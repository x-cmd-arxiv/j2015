The out-of-equilibrium description\nof strongly interacting relativistic fields is based on the theory of Kadanoff\nand Baym. For the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamical\nquasiparticle model (DQPM) for QCD in equilibrium. The widths and masses of the\nquasiparticles are controlled by transport coefficients in comparison to\nlattice QCD results. The resulting off-shell transport approach - denoted by\nParton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) - also includes covariant dynamical\nhadronization and keeps track of the hadronic interactions in the final phase.\nWe show that PHSD captures the bulk dynamics of heavy-ion collisions from SPS\nto LHC energies and provides a basis for the evaluation of the electromagnetic\nemissivity, using the same dynamical parton propagators as for the system\nevolution. Direct photon production in elementary processes and heavy-ion\nreactions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated and the status of the photon\nv2 puzzle - a large elliptic flow of the direct photons observed in A+A\ncollisions - is addressed. We discuss the roles of hadronic and partonic\nsources for the photon spectra and the flow coefficients v2 and v3 and also the\npossibility to subtract the QGP signal from observables. Furthermore, the\nproduction of dilepton pairs is addressed from SIS to LHC energies. The\nlow-mass dilepton yield is enhanced due to the in-medium modification of the\nrho-meson and at the lowest energy also due to a multiple regeneration of\nDelta-resonances. In addition, a signal of the partonic degrees-of-freedom is\nfound in the intermediate dilepton mass regime (1.2GeV<M<3GeV), which can shed\nlight on the nature of the very early degrees-of-freedom in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 16:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Though not\nwithout challenges, the dynamo theory can explain the large-scale coherent\nmagnetic fields which govern galaxies, but observational evidence for the\ntheory is so far very scarce. Putting together the available data of\nnon-interacting, non-cluster galaxies with known large-scale magnetic fields,\nwe find a tight correlation between the integrated polarized flux density,\nS(PI), and the rotation speed, v(rot), of galaxies. This leads to an almost\nlinear correlation between the large-scale magnetic field B and v(rot),\nassuming that the number of cosmic ray electrons is proportional to the star\nformation rate, and a super-linear correlation assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic fields and cosmic rays. This correlation cannot be attributed to an\nactive linear alpha-Omega dynamo, as no correlation holds with global shear or\nangular speed. It indicates instead a coupling between the large-scale magnetic\nfield and the dynamical mass of the galaxies, B ~ M^(0.25-0.4). Hence, faster\nrotating and/or more massive galaxies have stronger large-scale magnetic\nfields. The observed B-v(rot) correlation shows that the anisotropic turbulent\nmagnetic field dominates B in fast rotating galaxies as the turbulent magnetic\nfield, coupled with gas, is enhanced and ordered due to the strong gas\ncompression and/or local shear in these systems. This study supports an\nstationary condition for the large-scale magnetic field as long as the\ndynamical mass of galaxies is constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 20:52:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 20:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

While its static\ncounterpart can be solved in near-linear time, this decremental problem is much\nmore challenging even in the undirected unweighted case. In this case, the\nclassic $O(mn)$ total update time of Even and Shiloach [JACM 1981] has been the\nfastest known algorithm for three decades. At the cost of a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation factor, the running time was recently improved to\n$n^{2+o(1)}$ by Bernstein and Roditty [SODA 2011]. In this paper, we bring the\nrunning time down to near-linear: We give a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm with $m^{1+o(1)}$ expected total update time, thus obtaining\nnear-linear time. Moreover, we obtain $m^{1+o(1)} \\log W$ time for the weighted\ncase, where the edge weights are integers from $1$ to $W$.

The main aim is to provide the reader with a consistent\nintroduction to the mathematics used in the published papers. The text is a\ncombination both of well known results and new ones. We emphasize the notion of\na generalized metric and of corresponding orthogonal transformations, which\nlaid the groundwork of our research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 00:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The development process can be roughly divided into the following two\nstages: (1) development of a new mathematical formulation for the sequential\nchemical compositional reservoir simulation, (2) implementation of a sequential\nsolution approach for chemical compositional reservoir simulation based on the\nformulation described in this paper. This paper addresses the first stage of\nthe development process by presenting a new mathematical formulation of the\nchemical compositional reservoir flow equations for the sequential simulation.\nThe newly developed mathematical formulation is extended from the model\nformulation used in existing chemical compositional simulators. During the\nmodel development process, it was discovered that the currently used chemical\ncompositional model estimates the adsorption effect on the transport of a\ncomponent reasonably well but it violates the principle of mass conservation.\nThe energy conservation equation in the currently used chemical compositional\nmodel does not consider any change in the effective pore size caused by\nadsorption, which leads to inconsistency between the overall compositional\nbalance equations and the energy conservation equation by violating\nconservation of energy. With these partial differential equations as governing\nequations, several simulators have been developed. In this article, we propose\na formulation to model the change in pore volume due to adsorption that\nsatisfies the conservation laws for mass and energy, and allows applying a\nsequential solution approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 05:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

Next we apply conformal transformation on the metric to\ntransform the action back to the Einstein frame. We also show that an effective\ntheory constructed from these extended theories of gravity and SM sector looks\nexactly the same. Using the relic constraint observed by Planck 2015, we\nconstrain the scale of the effective field theory ($\\Lambda_{UV}$) as well as\nthe dark matter mass ($M$). We consider two cases- (1) light dark matter (LDM)\nand (2) heavy dark matter (HDM), and deduce upper bounds on thermally averaged\ncross section of dark matter annihilating to SM particles. Further we show that\nour model naturally incorporates self interactions of dark matter. Using these\nself interactions, we derive the constraints on the parameters of the (1) local\n$f(R)$ gravity and (2) non-minimally coupled gravity from dark matter self\ninteraction.

In this paper, we explore how the\ncompositions of terrestrial planets are affected by dynamical evolution of\ngiant planets. We estimate the initial compositions of building blocks of these\nrocky planets by using a simple condensation model, and numerically study the\ncompositions of planets formed in a few different formation models of the Solar\nSystem. We find that the abundances of refractory and moderately volatile\nelements are nearly independent of formation models, and that all the models\ncould reproduce the abundances of these elements of the Earth. The abundances\nof atmophile elements, on the other hand, depend on the scattering rate of icy\nplanetesimals into the inner disc as well as the mixing rate of the inner\nplanetesimal disc. For the classical formation model, neither of these\nmechanisms are efficient and the accretion of atmophile elements during the\nfinal assembly of terrestrial planets appears to be difficult. For the Grand\nTack model, both of these mechanisms are efficient, which leads to a relatively\nuniform accretion of atmophile elements in the inner disc. It is also possible\nto have a \"hybrid\" scenario where the mixing is not very efficient but the\nscattering is efficient. The abundances of atmophile elements in this case\nincreases with orbital radii. Such a scenario may occur in some of the\nextrasolar planetary systems which are not accompanied by giant planets or\nthose without strong perturbations from giants. We also confirm that the Grand\nTack scenario leads to the distribution of asteroid analogues where rocky\nplanetesimals tend to exist interior to icy ones, and show that their overall\ncompositions are consistent with S-type and C-type chondrites, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 08:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

It is shown that this approach leads\nto an overestimate, if the amount of residual accretion is enough to distort\nthe magnetosphere away from a force-free configuration, through magnetospheric\nmass loading or crushing, so that the lever arm of the braking torque migrates\ninside the light cylinder. We derive an alternative spin-down formula and\ncalculate the residual accretion rates where the formula is applicable. As a\ndemonstration, we apply the alternative spin-down formula to produce updated\nmagnetic moment estimates for the four objects above.

Because quiescent accretion rates are not measured directly (only\nupper limits are placed), it is impossible to be confident without more data\nwhether the thresholds for magnetospheric mass loading or crushing are reached\nor not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 10:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The semi-discrete version of the proposed method is\nbased on a technique of local propagation speeds and it is free of any Riemann\nsolver. The main advantages of our scheme are the high resolution of\ndiscontinuous solutions, its low numerical dissipation, and its simplicity for\nthe implementation. The proposed scheme does not use any splitting approach,\nwhich is applied in some cases to upwind schemes in order to simplify the\nresolution of Riemann problems. The semi-discrete form of the scheme is\nstrongly linked to the analytical properties of the nonlinear conservation law\nand to the geometry of the sphere. The curved geometry is treated here in an\nanalytical way so that the semi-discrete form of the proposed scheme is\nconsistent with a geometric compatibility property. Furthermore, the time\nevolution is carried out by using a total-variation-diminishing Runge-Kutta\nmethod. A rich family of (discontinuous) stationary solutions is available for\nthe problem under consideration when the flux is nonlinear and foliated (as\nidentified by the author in an earlier work). We present here a series of\nnumerical examples, obtained by considering non-trivial steady state solutions\nand this leads us to a good validation of the accuracy and efficiency of the\nproposed central-upwind finite volume method. Our numerical tests confirm the\nstability of the proposed scheme and clearly show its ability to capture\naccurately discontinuous steady state solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic\nconservation laws posed on the sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 10:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

We firstly\ndemonstrate non-perturbative gravitino mass generation via this mechanism in\nflat spacetime, and from this derive the condensate mode wavefunction\nrenormalisation. By then calculating the full canonically normalised one-loop\neffective potential for the condensate mode about a de Sitter background, we\ndemonstrate that, contrary to claims in the literature, this process may both\noccur and function in a phenomenologically viable manner. In particular, we\nfind that outside of certain unfortunate gauge choices, the stability of the\ncondensate is intimately tied via gravitational degrees of freedom to the sign\nof the tree-level cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that the energy\ndensity liberated may provide the necessary inflation of the early universe via\nan effective scalar degree of freedom, provided by the condensate, acting as\nthe inflaton. However, in so doing we find that simultaneously\nphenomenologically viable inflation and supersymmetry breaking via this\napproach are mutually incompatible in the simplest supergravity settings. As\nthis mechanism takes place in the gravitational sector, relying on the\nubiquitous gravitino torsion terms, we argue that it can also enjoy a certain\nuniversality in the context of supergravity and string theories, in that it\ndoes not rely on specific or arbitrary choices of potential and/or matter\ncontent. This then allows straightforward transplantation of these results into\nother settings. We present in detail our findings establishing contact between\nthis scenario and known phenomenology, and discuss future avenues for research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 12:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

Purpose: We show those\nresonances can be attributed to the cluster states with asymmetric\nconfigurations such as $\\alpha$+$^{16}{\\rm O}$. We explain why asymmetric\ncluster states are strongly excited by the isoscalar dipole transition. We also\nprovide a theoretical prediction of the isoscalar dipole transitions in\n$^{20}{\\rm Ne}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$. Method: The transition matrix is\nanalytically derived to clarify the excitation mechanism. The nuclear model\ncalculations by Brink-Bloch wave function and antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics are also performed to provide a theoretical prediction for $^{20}{\\rm\nNe}$ and $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$.

Unlike previous bulk\nparameterizations, the stochastic parameterization does not assume any\nparticular droplet size distribution, all parameters have physical meanings\nwhich are recoverable from data, and the resultant parameterization has the\nflexibility to utilize a variety of collision kernels. Our strategy is a new\ntwo-fold approach to modelling the kinetic collection equation. Partitioning\nthe droplet spectrum into cloud and rain aggregates, we represent droplet\ndensities as the sum of a mean and a random fluctuation. Moreover, we use a\nTaylor approximation for the collision kernel which allows the resulting\nparameterization to be independent of the collision kernel.\n  To address the two-moment closure for bulk microphysical equations, we\nrepresent the higher (third) order terms as points in an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck-like stochastic process.

This\n2D space is naturally partitioned into four domains, each associated with a\ncollision process: cloud and rain self-collection, auto-conversion, and\naccretion. The stochastic processes in the solution to the kinetic collection\nequation are defined as the sum of a mean and the product of a standard\ndeviation and a random fluctuation. An order of magnitude argument on the\ntemporal fluctuations of the evolving cloud properties eliminates the terms\ncontaining a standard deviation and a random fluctuation from the mean\nevolution equations.

Moreover, bearing the Clausius relation in mind,\nusing Friedman equations in Rastall theory and the Cai-Kim temperature, we\nobtain a relation for the apparent horizon entropy of a flat FLRW universe. In\naddition, we impose the entropy positivity condition on the obtained relation\nfor the horizon entropy, to find some constraints on the Rastall parameters.\nMoreover, we investigate the second and generalized second laws of\nthermodynamics. The results of considering a dominated prefect fluid with\nconstant state parameter are also addressed helping us familiarize with the\nRastall theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 06:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 07:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 07:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 21:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 09:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 07:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}
