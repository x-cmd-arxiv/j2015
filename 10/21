We here examine the two key experimental\nobservations of genetic diversity made in the 1960s, one between species and\nthe other within a population of a species, that directly contributed to the\ndevelopment of MET. The interpretations of these observations as well as the\nassumptions by MET are widely known to be inadequate. We review the recent\nprogress of an alternative framework, the maximum genetic diversity (MGD)\nhypothesis, that uses axioms and natural selection to explain the vast majority\nof genetic diversity as being at optimum equilibrium that is largely determined\nby organismal complexity. The MGD hypothesis fully absorbs the proven virtues\nof MET and considers its assumptions relevant only to a much more limited\nscope. This new synthesis has accounted for the much overlooked phenomenon of\nprogression towards higher complexity, and more importantly, been instrumental\nin directing productive research into both evolutionary and biomedical\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 16:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 04:35:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-04"}

Additionally, the objective function is not\ndirectly related to the goal of the task, e.g., discriminating true speakers\nand imposters.

Instead, we confirm\nthat the shape of the red clump magnitude distribution closely follows the\ndistance distribution expected for an X-shaped bulge at critical Galactic\nlatitudes.

This 'quantum weirdness' could be\napplied in the field of electron microscopy to generate images of\nbeam-sensitive specimens with substantially reduced damage to the specimen. A\nreduction of beam-induced damage to specimens is especially of great importance\nif it can enable imaging of biological specimens with atomic resolution.\nFollowing a recent suggestion that interaction-free measurements are possible\nwith electrons, we now analyze the difficulties of actually building an atomic\nresolution interaction-free electron microscope, or \"quantum electron\nmicroscope\". A quantum electron microscope would require a number of unique\ncomponents not found in conventional transmission electron microscopes. These\ncomponents include a coherent electron-beam splitter or two-state-coupler, and\na resonator structure to allow each electron to interrogate the specimen\nmultiple times, thus supporting high success probabilities for interaction-free\ndetection of the specimen. Different system designs are presented here, which\nare based on four different choices of two-state-couplers: a thin crystal, a\ngrating mirror, a standing light wave and an electro-dynamical pseudopotential.\nChallenges for the detailed electron optical design are identified as future\ndirections for development. While it is concluded that it should be possible to\nbuild an atomic resolution quantum electron microscope, we have also identified\na number of hurdles to the development of such a microscope and further\ntheoretical investigations that will be required to enable a complete\ninterpretation of the images produced by such a microscope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 16:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

While\nextremely successful at explaining the observed characteristics of flares, all\nsuch models so far have specified energy input ad hoc, rather than deriving it\nself-consistently. There is broad consensus that flares are powered by magnetic\nenergy released through reconnection. Recent work has generalized Petschek's\nbasic reconnection scenario, topological change followed by field line\nretraction and shock heating, to permit its inclusion into a one-dimensional\nflare loop model. Here we compare the gas dynamics driven by retraction and\nshocking to those from more conventional static loop models energized by ad hoc\nsource terms. We find significant differences during the first minute, when\nretraction leads to larger kinetic energies and produces higher densities at\nthe loop top, while ad hoc heating tends to rarify the loop top. The loop-top\ndensity concentration is related to the slow magnetosonic shock, characteristic\nof Petschek's model, but persists beyond the retraction phase occurring in the\noutflow jet. This offers an explanation for observed loop-top sources of X-ray\nand EUV emission, with advantages over that provided by ad hoc heating\nscenarios. The cooling phases of the two models are, however, notably similar\nto one another, suggesting observations at that stage will yield little\ninformation on the nature of energy input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 17:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Many bacteriocins undergo\npost-translational processing or modifications necessary for the biosynthesis\nof the final mature form.

To achieve these goals, we have developed a\nsoftware tool, Bacteriocin Operon and gene block Associator (BOA) that can\nidentify homologous bacteriocin associated gene clusters and predict novel\nones. We discover that several phyla have a strong preference for bactericon\ngenes, suggesting distinct functions for this group of molecules.

This is the so-called type I migration. Simulations\nattempting to reproduce the observed properties of exoplanets show that type I\nmigration needs to be significantly reduced over a wide region of the disk for\na long time. However, the mechanism capable of suppressing type I migration\nover a wide region has remained elusive. The recently found turbulence-driven\ndisk winds offer new possibilities. We investigate the effects of disk winds on\nthe disk profile and type I migration for a range of parameters that describe\nthe strength of disk winds. We also examine the in situ formation of close-in\nsuper-Earths in disks that evolve through disk winds. The disk profile, which\nis regulated by viscous diffusion and disk winds, was derived by solving the\ndiffusion equation. We carried out a number of simulations and plot here\nmigration maps that indicate the type I migration rate. We also performed\nN-body simulations of the formation of close-in super-Earths from a population\nof planetesimals and planetary embryos. We define a key parameter, Kw, which\ndetermines the ratio of strengths between the viscous diffusion and disk winds.\nFor a wide range of Kw, the type I migration rate is presented in migration\nmaps. These maps show that type I migration is suppressed over the whole\nclose-in region when the effects of disk winds are relatively strong (Kw <\n100). From the results of N-body simulations, we see that type I migration is\nsignificantly slowed down assuming Kw = 40. We also show that the results of\nN-body simulations match statistical orbital distributions of close-in\nsuper-Earths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 19:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Due to mathematical and computational challenges, these sampling\nprobabilities are typically computed under the unrealistic assumption of a\nconstant population size, and simulation studies have shown that resulting\nrecombination rate estimates can be severely biased in certain cases of\nhistorical population size changes. To alleviate this problem, we develop here\nnew methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size\nfunctions that are piecewise constant. Our main theoretical result, implemented\nin a new software package called LDpop, is a novel formula for the sampling\nprobability that can be evaluated by numerically exponentiating a large but\nsparse matrix. This formula can handle moderate sample sizes ($n \\leq 50$) and\ndemographic size histories with a large number of epochs ($\\mathcal{D} \\geq\n64$). In addition, LDpop implements an approximate formula for the sampling\nprobability that is reasonably accurate and scales to hundreds in sample size\n($n \\geq 256$). Finally, LDpop includes an importance sampler for the posterior\ndistribution of two-locus genealogies, based on a new result for the optimal\nproposal distribution in the variable-size setting. Using our methods, we study\nhow a sharp population bottleneck followed by rapid growth affects the\ncorrelation between partially linked sites. Then, through an extensive\nsimulation study, we show that accounting for population size changes under\nsuch a demographic model leads to substantial improvements in fine-scale\nrecombination rate estimation.

In this\nformation channel LMXBs are formed from wide binaries $(>1000$ AU) with a BH\ncomponent and a stellar companion. The wide binary is perturbed by fly-by's of\nfield stars and its orbit random-walks and changes over time. This diffusion\nprocess can drive the binary into a sufficiently eccentric orbit such that the\nbinary components tidally interact at peri-center and the binary evolves to\nbecome a short period binary, which eventually evolves into an LMXB. The\nformation rate of LMXBs through this channel mostly depends on the number of\nsuch BH wide binaries progenitors, which in turn depends on the velocity kicks\nimparted to BHs (or NSs) at birth. We consider several models for the formation\nand survival of such wide binaries, and calculate the LMXB formation rates for\neach model.

This formation scenario had several\nobservational signatures: (1) the number density of LMXBs generally follows the\nbackground stellar density and (2) the mass function of the BH stellar\ncompanion should be comparable to the mass function of the background stellar\npopulation, likely peaking at $0.4-0.6$ M$_{\\odot}$. The latter aspect, in\nparticular, is unique to this model compared with previously suggested LMXB\nformation models following common envelope binary stellar evolution. We note\nthat NS LMXBs can similarly form from wide binaries, but their formation rate\nthrough this channel is likely significantly smaller due to their much higher\nnatal kicks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 20:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

As hydrodynamical simulations strongly depend on\ndetails in the feedback implementations, no unique and robust predictions for\nbaryonic effects currently exist. In this paper we propose a baryonic\ncorrection model that modifies the density field of dark-matter-only $N$-body\nsimulations to mimic the effects of baryons from any underlying adopted\nfeedback recipe. The model assumes haloes to consist of 4 components: 1- hot\ngas in hydrostatical equilibrium, 2- ejected gas from feedback processes, 3-\ncentral galaxy stars, and 4- adiabatically relaxed dark matter, which all\nmodify the initial dark-matter-only density profiles. These altered profiles\nallow to define a displacement field for particles in $N$-body simulations and\nto modify the total density field accordingly. The main advantage of the\nbaryonic correction model is to connect the total matter density field to the\nobservable distribution of gas and stars in haloes, making it possible to\nparametrise baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. We show that the\nmost crucial quantities are the mass fraction of ejected gas and its\ncorresponding ejection radius. The former controls how strongly baryons\nsuppress the power spectrum, while the latter provides a measure of the scale\nwhere baryonic effects become important. A comparison with X-ray and\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster observations suggests that baryons suppress wave\nmodes above $k\\sim0.5$ h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 10-25 percent around\n$k\\sim 2$ h/Mpc.

Reducing these uncertainties is critical for\nstake-holders to make risk-informed decisions based on numerical simulations.\nFor example, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are\nincreasingly used in mission-critical systems involving turbulent flows.\nHowever, for many practical flows the RANS predictions have large model-form\nuncertainties originating from the uncertainty in the modeled Reynolds\nstresses. Recently, a physics-informed Bayesian framework has been proposed to\nquantify and reduce model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by utilizing\nsparse observation data. However, in the design stage of engineering systems,\nmeasurement data are usually not available. In the present work we extend the\noriginal framework to scenarios where there are no available data on the flow\nto be predicted.

The merits of the proposed method are\ndemonstrated on two flows that are challenging to standard RANS models. By not\nrequiring observation data on the flow to be predicted, the present\ncalibration-prediction method will gain wider acceptance in practical\nengineering application.

High-resolution HERMES/Mercator and Keck/HIRES\nspectra have been used to derive elemental abundances using 1-D LTE MARCS\nmodels. A metallicity of [Fe/H] $\\sim -2.4$ is found, along with s-process\noverabundances on the order of 2 dex (with the exception of [Y/Fe] $\\sim+0.5$),\nand most notably overabundances of r-process elements like Sm, Eu, Dy, and Er\nin the range 0.9 - 2.0 dex. With [Ba/Fe] $ > 1.9$ dex and [Eu/Fe] = 2.3 dex, HE\n0017+0055 is a CEMP-rs star. It appears to be a giant star below the tip of the\nred giant branch (RGB). The s-process pollution must therefore originate from\nmass transfer from a companion formerly on the AGB, now a carbon-oxygen white\ndwarf (WD). If the 384 d velocity variations are attributed to the WD\ncompanion, its orbit must be seen almost face-on, with $i \\sim 2.3^\\circ$,\nbecause the mass function is very small: $f(M_1,M_2) =\n(6.1\\pm1.1)\\times10^{-6}$ Msun. Alternatively, the WD orbital motion could be\nresponsible for the long-term velocity variations, with a period of several\ndecades. The 384 d variations should then be attributed either to a low-mass\ninner companion (perhaps a brown dwarf, depending on the orbital inclination),\nor to stellar pulsations. The latter possibility is made likely by the fact\nthat similar low-amplitude velocity variations, with periods close to 1 yr,\nhave been reported for other CEMP stars in a companion paper (Jorissen et al.,\n2015). A definite conclusion about the origin of the 384 d velocity variations\nshould however await the detection of synchronous low-amplitude photometric\nvariations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 20:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Yet\nincomplete or noisy data, the state variation and parameter dependence of the\nforward model, and correlations in the prior collectively provide useful\nstructure that can be exploited for dimension reduction in this setting--both\nin the parameter space of the inverse problem and in the state space of the\nforward model. To this end, we show how to jointly construct low-dimensional\nsubspaces of the parameter space and the state space in order to accelerate the\nBayesian solution of the inverse problem. As a byproduct of state dimension\nreduction, we also show how to identify low-dimensional subspaces of the data\nin problems with high-dimensional observations.

The central\nproblem is a quadratic optimization problem with an l0-norm penalty. Exactly\nenforcing the l0-norm penalty is computationally intractable for larger scale\nproblems, so dif- ferent sparsity-inducing penalty functions that approximate\nthe l0-norm have been introduced. In this paper, we show that viewing the\nproblem from a convex relaxation perspective offers new insights. In\nparticular, we show that a popular sparsity-inducing concave penalty function\nknown as the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), and the reverse Huber penalty\nderived in a recent work by Pilanci, Wainwright and Ghaoui, can both be derived\nas special cases of a lifted convex relaxation called the perspective\nrelaxation. The optimal perspective relaxation is a related minimax problem\nthat balances the overall convexity and tightness of approximation to the l0\nnorm. We show it can be solved by a semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, a\nprobabilistic interpretation of the semidefinite relaxation reveals connections\nwith the boolean quadric polytope in combinatorial optimization. Finally by\nreformulating the l0-norm pe- nalized problem as a two-level problem, with the\ninner level being a Max-Cut problem, our proposed semidefinite relaxation can\nbe realized by replacing the inner level problem with its semidefinite\nrelaxation studied by Goemans and Williamson. This interpretation suggests\nusing the Goemans-Williamson rounding procedure to find approximate solutions\nto the l0-norm penalized problem.

The estimated travel time of the disturbance ($\\sim 20$ hrs), together\nwith the massive magnetic field strengths measured within the ejecta ($>\n100$nT), made it one of the most extreme events observed during the space era.\nIn this study, we examine the properties of the shock wave. Because of an\ninstrument malfunction, plasma measurements during the interval surrounding the\nCME were limited, and our approach has been modified to capitalize on the\navailable measurements and suitable proxies, where possible. We were able to\ninfer the following properties. First, the shock normal was pointing\npredominantly in the radial direction (${\\bf n} = 0.97 {\\bf e}_r -0.09 {\\bf\ne}_t -0.23 {\\bf e}_n$). Second, the angle between ${\\bf n}$ and the upstream\nmagnetic field, $\\theta_{Bn}$, was estimated to be $\\approx 34^{\\circ}$, making\nthe shock \"quasi-parallel,\" and supporting the idea of an earlier\n\"preconditioning\" ICME. Third, the shock speed was estimated to be $\\approx\n3300$ km s$^{-1}$. Fourth, the sonic Mach number, $M_s$, for this shock was\n$\\sim 28$. We support these results with an idealized numerical simulation of\nthe ICME. Finally, we estimated the change in ram pressure upstream of the\nshock to be $\\sim 5$ times larger than the pressure from the energetic\nparticles, suggesting that this was not a standard \"steady-state\" cosmic-ray\nmodified shock (CRMS). Instead it might represent an early, transient phase in\nthe evolution of the CRMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 23:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Scholars have\nattempted to understand such extraordinary credibility, but usually used the\nnumber of edits as the unit of time, without consideration of real time.

The model\nsuccessfully generates the key properties of real Wikipedia articles such as\ndistinct types of articles for the editing patterns characterized by the\ninterrelationship between the numbers of edits and editors, and the article\nsize. In addition, the model indicates that infrequently referred articles tend\nto grow faster than frequently referred ones, and articles attracting a high\nmotivation to edit counterintuitively reduce the number of participants.

We also identify one new DA/DB\npair, four candidate DA/DC pairs, four candidate DA/DAH pairs, and one new\ncandidate triple degenerate system. Because wide DWDs are co-eval and evolve\nindependently, the difference in the pre-WD lifetimes should equal the\ndifference in the WD cooling ages. We use this to develop a Bayesian\nhierarchical framework and construct a likelihood function to determine the\nprobability that any particular IFMR fits a sample of wide DWDs. We then define\na parametric model for the IFMR and find the best parameters indicated by our\nsample of DWDs. We place robust constraints on the IFMR for initial masses of\n2--4 \\Msun. The WD masses produced by our model for stars within this mass\nrange differ from those predicted by semi-empirical fits to open cluster WDs.\nWithin this mass range, where there are few constraining open cluster WDs and\ndisagreements in the cluster ages, wide DWDs may provide more reliable\nconstraints on the IFMR. Expanding this method to the many wide DWDs expected\nto be discovered by Gaia may transform our understanding of the IFMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 01:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

We study the formation and fragmentation of this\nbubble with multi-wavelength dust and gas observations. Towards the bubble\nN131, we analyzed archival multi-wavelength observations including 3.6, 4.5,\n5.8, 8.0, 24, 70, 160, 250, 350, 500 $\\mu$m, 1.1 mm, and 21 cm.

Most of the\nprior literature focuses on the reduction of load in the backhaul and core\nnetworks due to caching, i.e., on the benefits caching offers for the wireline\ncommunication link between the origin server and the caches. In this paper, we\nare instead interested in the benefits caching can offer for the wireless\ncommunication link between the caches and the end users.\n  To quantify the gains of caching for this wireless link, we consider an\ninterference channel in which each transmitter is equipped with an isolated\ncache memory. Communication takes place in two phases, a content placement\nphase followed by a content delivery phase. The objective is to design both the\nplacement and the delivery phases to maximize the rate in the delivery phase in\nresponse to any possible user demands. Focusing on the three-user case, we show\nthat through careful joint design of these phases, we can reap three distinct\nbenefits from caching: a load balancing gain, an interference cancellation\ngain, and an interference alignment gain. In our proposed scheme, load\nbalancing is achieved through a specific file splitting and placement,\nproducing a particular pattern of content overlap at the caches. This overlap\nallows to implement interference cancellation. Further, it allows us to create\nseveral virtual transmitters, each transmitting a part of the requested\ncontent, which increases interference-alignment possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 03:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2017 16:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

We focused on a set of previously-published studies on KT\nwhich rely on a combination of network analysis and computer-assisted analysis\nof the contents of scientific literature and patents. The selected studies\nprovide a duo of complementary perspectives: the demand of knowledge (cervical\ncancer and Ebola hemorrhagic fever) and the supply of knowledge (liposomes and\nnanoparticles to treat cancer and the paradigmatic Doxil, the first nanodrug to\nbe approved).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 03:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 04:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 18:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

However,\nowing to the physical extension of the observing beam, observations may detect\nscattered photons, resulting in a change in the observed (or effective)\nextinction, depending on the spatial distribution of the dust and the\nresolution of the instrument. We investigate the influence of clumpy dust\ndistributions on effective extinction toward embedded sources and those in the\ndiffuse ISM. We use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to examine effective\nextinction for various geometries. By varying the number, optical depth and\nvolume-filling factor of clumps in models of spherical shells and the diffuse\nISM, we explore the evolution of extinction. Depending on the number of\nscattering events in the beam, the extinction curve steepens in homogeneous\nmedia and flattens in clumpy media. As a result, clumpy dust distributions can\nto reproduce extinction curves with arbitrary R_v, the effective ratio of\ntotal-to-selective extinction. The flattening `washes out' the 2175 \\AA bump\nand shifts the peak to shorter wavelengths. The mean R_v of a shell correlates\nwith the optical depth of an individual clump and the wavelength at which a\nclump becomes optically thick. Similar behaviour is seen for edge-on discs or\ntori. However, at grazing inclinations the combination of extinction and strong\nforward scattering results in chaotic behaviour. Caution is therefore advised\nwhen measuring extinction in, for example, AGN tori or toward SNIa or GRB\nafterglows. In face-on discs, the shape of the scattered continuum changes with\nclumpiness, however, unlike absorption features, individual features in the\nscattering cross-sections are preserved. Finally, we show that diffuse\ninterstellar extinction is not modified by scattering on scales of a few kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Although containing nonlinear dynamics and thereby exposed\nto the possibility of superluminal signaling in individual events, such models\nare widely accepted on the basis of fully reproducing the non-signaling\nstatistical predictions of quantum mechanics. Here we present a deterministic\nnonlinear model without any external noise, in which randomness - instead of\nbeing universally present - emerges in the measurement process, from\ndeterministic irregular dynamics of the detectors. The treatment is based on a\nminimally nonlinear von Neumann equation for a Stern-Gerlach or Bell-type\nmeasuring setup, containing coordinate and momentum operators in a self-adjoint\nskew-symmetric, split scalar product structure over the configuration space.\nThe microscopic states of the detectors act as a nonlocal set of hidden\nparameters, controlling individual outcomes. The model is shown to display\npumping of weights between setup-defined basis states, with a single winner\nrandomly selected and the rest collapsing to zero. Environmental decoherence\nhas no role in the scenario.

We analyse the\nentire data set from 16 yr of Ulysses ISD measurements in interplanetary space.\nThis paper concentrates on the overall mass distribution of ISD. An\naccompanying paper investigates time-variable phenomena in the Ulysses ISD\ndata, and in a third paper we present the results from dynamical modelling of\nthe ISD flow applied to Ulysses. We use the latest values for the interstellar\nhydrogen and helium densities, the interstellar helium flow speed of\nv_ISM,inf=23.2km/s, and the ratio of radiation pressure to gravity, beta,\ncalculated for astronomical silicates. We find a gas-to-dust-mass ratio in the\nlocal interstellar cloud of R_g/d=193^+85_-57, and a dust density of\n2.1+/-0.6x10^-24kg/m^3. For a higher inflow speed of 26km/s, the\ngas-to-dust-mass ratio is 20% higher, and, accordingly, the dust density is\nlower by the same amount. The gas-to-dust mass ratio derived from our new\nanalysis is compatible with the value most recently determined from\nastronomical observations. We confirm earlier results that the very local\ninterstellar medium contains 'big' (i.e. 1 um-sized) ISD grains. We find a dust\ndensity in the local interstellar medium that is a factor of three lower than\nvalues implied by earlier analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 09:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

Paying all\nattention to the structure of network causes some trouble applying these models\nto real-word applications.\n  Motivated by this, we present weighted independent cascade (WIC) model, a\nnovel cascade model which extends the applicability of independent cascade(IC)\nmodel by attaching attributes to the nodes. The IM problem in WIC model is to\nmaximize the value of nodes which are influenced. This problem is NP-hard.

The damped Lya systems (DLAs), seen in absorption towards distant\nquasars and gamma-ray bursts, are predicted to be the dominant reservoirs for\nthis gas. Detailed properties of DLAs have been studied extensively for decades\nwith great success. However, their size, fundamental in understanding their\nnature, has remained elusive, as quasar and gamma-ray-burst sightlines only\nprobe comparatively tiny areas of the foreground DLAs. Here, we introduce a new\napproach to measure the full extent of DLAs in the sightlines toward extended\nbackground sources. We present the discovery of a high-column-density (log\nN(HI) = 21.1 +/-0.4 cm^-2) DLA at z ~ 2.4 covering 90-100% of the luminous\nextent of a line-of-sight background galaxy. Estimates of the size of the\nbackground galaxy range from a minimum of a few kpc^2, to ~100 kpc^2, and\ndemonstrate that high-column density neutral gas can span continuous areas 10^8\n- 10^10 times larger than previously explored in quasar or gamma-ray burst\nsightlines. The DLA presented here is the first from a sample of DLAs in our\npilot survey that searches Lyman break and Lyman continuum galaxies at high\nredshift. The low luminosities, large sizes, and mass contents (>~10^6 - 10^9\nM_solar) implied by this DLA and the early data suggest that DLAs contain the\nnecessary fuel for galaxies, with many systems consistent with relatively\nmassive, low-luminosity primeval galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 11:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The hope has been that by setting the Ekman number to be as small as\ncomputationally feasible, an asymptotic regime would be reached in which the\ncorrect force balance is achieved. However, recent analyses of geodynamo models\nsuggest that the desired balance has still not yet been attained.

The inward motion of molecular\ngas in the massive star forming region G34.26+0.15 is investigated by using\nhigh-resolution profiles of seven transitions of ammonia at THz frequencies\nobserved with Herschel-HIFI. The shapes and intensities of these lines are\ninterpreted in terms of radiative transfer models of a spherical, collapsing\nmolecular envelope. An accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) method is used to\ncompute the models. The seven ammonia lines show mixed absorption and emission\nwith inverse P-Cygni-type profiles that suggest infall onto the central source.\nA trend toward absorption at increasingly higher velocities for higher\nexcitation transitions is clearly seen in the line profiles. The $J =\n3\\leftarrow2$ lines show only very weak emission, so these absorption profiles\ncan be used directly to analyze the inward motion of the gas. This is the first\ntime a multitransitional study of spectrally resolved rotational ammonia lines\nhas been used for this purpose. Broad emission is, in addition, mixed with the\nabsorption in the $1_0-0_0$ ortho-NH$_3$ line, possibly tracing a molecular\noutflow from the star forming region. The best-fitting ALI model reproduces the\ncontinuum fluxes and line profiles, but slightly underpredicts the emission and\nabsorption depth in the ground-state ortho line $1_0-0_0$. The derived\northo-to-para ratio is approximately 0.5 throughout the infalling cloud core\nsimilar to recent findings for translucent clouds in sight lines toward W31C\nand W49N.

The composing meander-shaped strands are assembled very tightly\ninto the cable, which results in a strong electromagnetic interaction between\nthem. This interaction profoundly influences the effective self-field critical\ncurrent ($I_c$) of the cable, which is much lower than the sum of the $I_c$s of\nthe composing strands. Also the AC losses are influenced by the material's\nproperties and by the geometrical configuration of the cable. Being able to\npredict the effective critical current and AC losses of such cables is very\nimportant for a proper design of applications: due to the complexity of the\ncable's geometry and of the material's properties, this prediction can only be\nperformed with advanced numerical tools.\n  In this contribution we use finite-element-based models to compute the\neffective $I_c$ and the AC losses of Roebel cables composed of 31 strands using\ntapes from two manufacturers. The AC losses are analyzed in the simultaneous\npresence of transport current and background perpendicular field proportional\nto the current, which mirrors the situation occurring in a winding.

Its nature is not\nyet clear, it could be either a very peculiar BL Lac or a CSO (Compact\nSymmetric Object) radio source, considered as the early stage of a radio\ngalaxy.

These atomic stress tensors can be used to describe\nliquids' structures and to investigate the connection between structural and\ndynamic properties. In particular, atomic stresses allow to address atomic\nscale correlations relevant to the Green-Kubo expression for viscosity.\nPreviously correlations between the atomic stresses of different atoms were\nstudied using the Cartesian representation of the stress tensors or the\nrepresentation based on spherical harmonics. In this paper we address\nstructural correlations in a model 3D binary liquid using the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the atomic stress tensors. Thus correlations relevant to the\nGreen-Kubo expression for viscosity are interpreted in a simple geometric way.\nOn decrease of temperature the changes in the relevant stress correlation\nfunction between different atoms are significantly more pronounced than the\nchanges in the pair density function. We demonstrate that this behaviour\noriginates from the orientational correlations between the eigenvectors of the\natomic stress tensors. We also found correlations between the eigenvalues of\nthe same atomic stress tensor. For the studied system, with purely repulsive\ninteractions between the particles, the eigenvalues of every atomic stress\ntensor are positive and they can be ordered: $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq\n\\lambda_3 \\geq 0$. We found that, for the particles of a given type, the\nprobability distributions of the ratios $(\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1)$ and\n$(\\lambda_3/\\lambda_2)$ are essentially identical to each other in the liquids\nstate. We also found that $\\lambda_2$ tends to be equal to the geometric\naverage of $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_3$.

For the considered models this reduces to assessing\nwhether the slope parameter in these nonlinear regression models is zero or\nnot. A technical problem is that the null distribution (when the slope is zero)\ndepends on non-identifiable parameters, so that standard asymptotic results on\nthe distribution of the likelihood-ratio test no longer apply. Asymptotic\nsolutions for this problem have been extensively discussed in the literature.\nThe resulting approximations however are not of simple form and require\nsimulation to calculate the asymptotic distribution. In addition their\nappropriateness might be doubtful for the case of a small sample size. Direct\nsimulation to approximate the null distribution is numerically unstable due to\nthe non identifiability of some parameters. In this article we derive a\nnumerical algorithm to approximate the exact distribution of the\nlikelihood-ratio test under multiple models for normally distributed data. The\nalgorithm uses methods from differential geometry and can be used to evaluate\nthe distribution under the null hypothesis, but also allows for power and\nsample size calculations.

The thesis consists of two parts. The first part\nintroduces stochastic thermodynamics, the second part aims at transferring the\nconcepts of stochastic thermodynamics to developed turbulence. / Central in\nstochastic thermodynamics are Markov processes. An elementary example is\nBrownian motion. In contrast to macroscopic thermodynamics, the work done and\nthe entropy produced for single trajectories of the Brownian particles are\nrandom quantities. Statistical properties of such fluctuating quantities are\ncentral in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Prominent results are\nso-called fluctuation theorems which express the balance between production and\nconsumption of entropy and generalise the second law. / Turbulent cascades of\neddies are assumed to be the predominant mechanism of turbulence generation and\nfix the statistical properties of developed turbulent flows. An intriguing\nphenomenon of developed turbulence, known as small-scale intermittency, are\nviolent small-scale fluctuations in flow velocity that exceed any Gaussian\nprediction. / In analogy to Brownian motion, it is demonstrated in the thesis\nhow the assumption of the Markov property leads to a Markov process for the\nturbulent cascade that is equivalent to the seminal K62 model. In addition to\nthe K62 model, it is demonstrated how many other models of turbulence can be\nwritten as a Markov process, including scaling laws, multiplicative cascades,\nmultifractal models and field-theoretic approaches. Based on the various Markov\nprocesses, the production of entropy along the cascade and the corresponding\nfluctuation theorems is discussed. In particular, experimental data indicates\nthat entropy consumption is linked to small-scale intermittency, and a\nconnection between entropy consumption and an inverse cascade is suggestive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 14:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

The frequency of DO events varied\nin time, supposedly because of changes in background climate conditions. Here,\nthe influence of external forcings on DO events is investigated with\nstatistical modelling. We assume two types of simple stochastic dynamical\nsystems models (double-well potential-type and oscillator-type), forced by the\nnorthern hemisphere summer insolation change and/or the global ice volume\nchange. The model parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood\nmethod with the NGRIP Ca$^{2+}$ record. The stochastic oscillator model with at\nleast the ice volume forcing reproduces well the sample autocorrelation\nfunction of the record and the frequency changes of warming transitions in the\nlast glacial period across MISs 2, 3, and 4. The model performance is improved\nwith the additional insolation forcing. The BIC scores also suggest that the\nice volume forcing is relatively more important than the insolation forcing,\nthough the strength of evidence depends on the model assumption. Finally, we\nsimulate the average number of warming transitions in the past four glacial\nperiods, assuming the model can be extended beyond the last glacial, and\ncompare the result with an Iberian margin sea-surface temperature (SST) record\n(Martrat et al., Science, vol. 317, p. 502, 2007).

The latter are allowed by the uncertainties in\nthe Higgs decay $h_{125}\\to WW^*$, $h_{125}\\to ZZ^*$ and $h_{125}\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$. The study of the parameter space for such additional\nscalars/pseudoscalars decay of the Higgs is performed in the gluon fusion\nchannel. The extra hidden Higgs bosons of the enlarged scalar sector, if they\nexist, will then decay into lighter fermion paris, i.e., $b\\bar{b}$,\n$\\tau\\bar{\\tau}$ and $\\mu\\bar{\\mu}$ via the mixing with the doublets. A\ndetailed simulation using PYTHIA of the $2b+2\\tau$, $\\geq 3\\tau$, $2b+2\\mu$ and\n$2\\tau+2\\mu$ final states is presented. From our analysis we conclude that,\ndepending on the selected benchmark points, such decay modes can be explored\nwith an integrated luminosity of 25 fb$^{-1}$ at the LHC at a center of mass\nenergy of 13 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 15:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

We present a sharp\ninterface approach which treats the interface as a shock-wave like\ndiscontinuity. Any mixing of fluid phases is avoided by using the flow solver\nin the bulk regions only, and a ghost-fluid approach close to the interface.\nThe coupling states for the numerical solution in the bulk regions are\ndetermined by the solution of local multi-phase Riemann problems across the\ninterface. The Riemann solution accounts for the relevant physics by enforcing\nappropriate jump conditions at the phase boundary. A wide variety of interface\neffects can be handled in a thermodynamically consistent way. This includes\nsurface tension or mass/energy transfer by phase transition. Moreover, the\nlocal normal speed of the interface, which is needed to calculate the time\nevolution of the interface, is given by the Riemann solution. The interface\ntracking itself is based on a level-set method.\n  The focus in this paper is the description of the multi-phase Riemann solver\nand its usage within the sharp interface approach. One-dimensional problems are\nselected to validate the approach. Finally, the three-dimensional simulation of\na wobbling droplet and a shock droplet interaction in two dimensions are shown.\nIn both problems phase transition and surface tension determine the global bulk\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 16:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

The heat results from focusing energy in\nthe radiofrequency spectrum through a needle. Amongst others, this can enable\nthe treatment of patients who are not eligible for an open surgery. However,\nthe possibility of recurrent liver cancer due to incomplete ablation of the\ntumor makes post-interventional monitoring via regular follow-up scans\nmandatory. These scans have to be carefully inspected for any conspicuousness.\nWithin this study, the RF ablation zones from twelve post-interventional CT\nacquisitions have been segmented semi-automatically to support the visual\ninspection. An interactive, graph-based contouring approach, which prefers\nspherically shaped regions, has been applied. For the quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of the algorithm's results, manual slice-by-slice\nsegmentations produced by clinical experts have been used as the gold standard\n(which have also been compared among each other). As evaluation metric for the\nstatistical validation, the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) has been\ncalculated. The results show that the proposed tool provides lesion\nsegmentation with sufficient accuracy much faster than manual segmentation. The\nvisual feedback and interactivity make the proposed tool well suitable for the\nclinical workflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 08:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}
