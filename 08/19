HAWC is an air\nshower array of 300 water Cherenkov detectors (WCD's), each with 4\nphotomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Because the observatory is sensitive to air\nshowers produced by cosmic rays and gamma rays, one of the main tasks in the\nanalysis of gamma-ray sources is gamma/hadron separation for the suppression of\nthe cosmic-ray background. Currently, HAWC uses a method called compactness for\nthe separation. This method divides the data into 10 bins that depend on the\nnumber of PMTs in each event, and each bin has its own value cut. In this work\nwe present a new method which depends continuously on the number of PMTs in the\nevent instead of binning, and therefore uses a single cut for gamma/hadron\nseparation. The method uses a Feedforward Multilayer Perceptron net (MLP) fed\nwith five characteristics of the air shower to create a single output value. We\nused simulated cosmic-ray and gamma-ray events to find the optimal cut and then\napplied the technique to data from the Crab Nebula. This new method is tuned on\nMC and predicts better gamma/hadron separation than the existing one.\nPreliminary tests on the Crab data are consistent with such an improvement, but\nin future work it needs to be compared with the full implementation of\ncompactness with selection criteria tuned for each of the data bins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 16:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Hydrodynamics requires that the\nenergy-momentum tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ and four-currents $j^{\\mu}$ do not deviate\nconsiderably from the equilibrium ideal-fluid form, but the ones constructed\nfrom transport do not necessarily possess this property. In this work we\ninvestigate the space-time picture of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium\nin Au+Au collisions using a coarse-grained transport approach. The collision\nenergy is varied in the range $E_{lab} = 5-160A$ GeV. The sensitivity of\n$T^{\\mu\\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium to collision centrality, and other\nparameters such as the switching criterion, the amount of statistics used to\nconstruct the initial state, and the smearing parameter $\\sigma$ is\ninvestigated. For low statistics deviations of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ from equilibrium\nare large and dominated by the effect of finite sampling. For large statistics\nthe pressure anisotropy plays the most significant role, while the off-diagonal\ncomponents of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ are small in a large volume during the whole\nevolution. For all considered energies and centralities the pressure anisotropy\nexhibits a similar feature: there is a narrow interval of time, when it rapidly\ndrops in a considerable volume. This allows us to introduce an \"isotropization\ntime,\" which is found to decrease with energy and slightly increase with\ncentrality.

In this paper, we provide a new method for\ncomparing GVCs across countries and over time. First, we use the World\nInput-Output Database (WIOD) to construct both the upstream and downstream\nglobal value networks, where the nodes are individual sectors in different\ncountries and the links are the value-added contribution relationships. Second,\nwe introduce a network-based measure of node similarity to compare the GVCs\nbetween any pair of countries for each sector and each year available in the\nWIOD. Our network-based similarity is a better measure for node comparison than\nthe existing ones because it takes into account all the direct and indirect\nrelationships between country-sector pairs, is applicable to both directed and\nweighted networks with self-loops, and takes into account externally defined\nnode attributes. As a result, our measure of similarity reveals the most\nintensive interactions among the GVCs across countries and over time. From 1995\nto 2011, the average similarity between sectors and countries have clear\nincreasing trends, which are temporarily interrupted by the recent economic\ncrisis. This measure of the similarity of GVCs provides quantitative answers to\nimportant questions about dependency, sustainability, risk, and competition in\nthe global production system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 17:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

At high density, n_B > ~ 5n_s, we use the percolated quark\nmatter equations of state which must be very stiff to pass the two-solar mass\nconstraints. The intermediate domain at 2 < n_B/n_s < 5 is described as neither\npurely hadronic nor percolated quark matter, and the equations of state are\ninferred by interpolating hadronic and percolated quark matter equations of\nstate.

The line core Doppler shift is a good measure of the line-of-sight\nvelocity at the formation height. The line width is both dependent on the width\nof the absorption profile (thermal and non-thermal width) and an opacity\nbroadening factor of 1.2-4 due to the optically thick line formation with a\nlarger broadening for double peak profiles. The 133.5 nm lines can be formed\nboth higher and lower than the core of the Mg II k line depending on the amount\nof plasma in the 14-50 kK temperature range. More plasma in this temperature\nrange gives a higher 133.5 nm formation height relative to the Mg II k line\ncore. The synthetic line profiles have been compared with IRIS observations.\nThe derived parameters from the simulated line profiles cover the parameter\nrange seen in observations but on average the synthetic profiles are too\nnarrow.

The existence of components\ndistributed over a network often conflicts with real-time requirements, leading\nto design strategies that depend on domain- and even application-specific\nknowledge. Distributed Virtual Environment (DVE) systems are DRT systems that\nconnect multiple users instantly with each other and with a shared virtual\nspace over a network. DVE systems deviate from traditional DRT systems in the\nimportance of the quality of the end user experience. We present an analysis of\nimportant, but challenging, issues in the design, testing and evaluation of DVE\nsystems through the lens of experiments with a concrete DVE, OpenSimulator. We\nframe our observations within six dimensions of well-known design concerns:\ncorrectness, fault tolerance/prevention, scalability, time sensitivity,\nconsistency, and overhead of distribution. Furthermore, we place our\nexperimental work in a broader historical context, showing that these\nchallenges are intrinsic to DVEs and suggesting lines of future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 21:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

The result of a test for a\ngroup of items is positive if any of the items in the group is defective and\nnegative otherwise. The goal is to judiciously group subsets of items such that\ndefective items can be reliably recovered using the minimum number of tests,\nwhile also having a low-complexity decoding procedure.\n  We describe SAFFRON (Sparse-grAph codes Framework For gROup testiNg), a\nnon-adaptive group testing paradigm that recovers at least a\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-fraction (for any arbitrarily small $\\epsilon > 0$) of $K$\ndefective items with high probability with $m=6C(\\epsilon)K\\log_2{n}$ tests,\nwhere $C(\\epsilon)$ is a precisely characterized constant that depends only on\n$\\epsilon$. For instance, it can provably recover at least $(1-10^{-6})K$\ndefective items with $m \\simeq 68 K \\log_2{n}$ tests. The computational\ncomplexity of the decoding algorithm of SAFFRON is $\\mathcal{O}(K\\log n)$,\nwhich is order-optimal. Further, we robustify SAFFRON such that it can reliably\nrecover the set of $K$ defective items even in the presence of erroneous or\nnoisy test results.

Methods: A local injury model is adopted, in which radiation-induced\ndamage (functional loss) G is the integral of the DVH with function R(D). RP\nrisk is H(G) where H() is the sigmoid cumulative distribution of functional\nreserve. RP incidence is a Bernoulli function of risk. A homogeneous patient\ncohort is assumed, allowing non-dose-related factors to be ignored. Clinically\nrealistic DVHs are combined with the injury model to simulate RP data. Results:\nCorrelation analysis is often used to identify predictor variables that are\ncorrelated with outcome, for inclusion in a predictive model. In the local\ninjury model, all DVH metrics VD contribute to damage. Correlation analysis\ntherefore has limited value. The subset of VD significantly correlated with\nincidence varies randomly from trial to trial due to random variations in the\nDVH set, and does not necessarily reveal anything useful about the patient\ncohort or the underlying biological dose-response relationship. Regression or\nmatrix analysis can extract R(D) from damage or risk data, provided smoothness\nregularization is employed. Extraction of R(D) from incidence data was not\nsuccessful, due to its higher level of statistical variability. Conclusions: To\nthe author's knowledge, smoothness regularization has not been applied to this\nproblem, so represents a novel approach. Dose-response functions can be\nsuccessfully extracted from measurements of integral (as opposed to regional)\nlung damage G, suggesting value in re-visiting available measurements of\nventilation, perfusion and radiographic damage. The techniques developed here\ncan potentially be used to extract the dose-response functions of different\ntissues from multiple types of quantitative volumetric imaging data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 03:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 16:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

Destabilization, including\ncatastrophic encounters and/or collisions involving the Earth, has been\nsuggested to be initiated through a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity\n(eM), with an estimated probability of ~1%. However, it has recently been shown\nthat the statistics of numerical Solar System integrations are sensitive to the\naccuracy and type of numerical algorithm. Here I report results from\ncomputationally demanding ensemble integrations (N=1,600 with slightly\ndifferent initial conditions) at unprecedented accuracy based on the full\nequations of motion of the eight planets and Pluto over 5Gyr, including\ncontributions from general relativity. The standard symplectic algorithm\nproduced spurious results for highly eccentric orbits and during close\nencounters, which were hence integrated with a suitable Bulirsch-Stoer\nalgorithm, specifically designed for these situations. The present study yields\nodds for a large increase in Mercury's eccentricity that are less than previous\nestimates. Strikingly, in two solutions Mercury continued on highly eccentric\norbits (after reaching eM values >0.93) for 80-100Myr before colliding with\nVenus or the Sun. Most importantly, none of the 1,600 solutions led to a close\nencounter involving the Earth or a destabilization of Earth's orbit in the\nfuture.

Conventional\nmethods often study these two steps separately, e.g., learning hash functions\nfrom a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile, the bit lengths of\noutput hashing codes are preset in most previous methods, neglecting the\nsignificance level of different bits and restricting their practical\nflexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning\nframework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw\nimages. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity\nlearning. Specifically, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet\nsamples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a\ndifferent label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between\nmatched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a\nregularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e.,\nimages of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional\nneural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where\ndiscriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized.\nFurthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can\nmanipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework\noutperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and\nalso achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification\nin surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes\nwell preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 06:26:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 06:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Here, we examine these issues and a\nstrategy for overcoming them by studying the gas phase and bulk electronic\nstructure of the organic molecule quinacridone (5Q), a promising material with\nmany interesting properties for organic devices. Experimentally, we perform\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARUPS) on thin films of the\ncrystalline $\\beta$-phase of 5Q.

For the bulk crystal, we take into account the correct screening in\nthe bulk, using the recently developed OT-SRSH approach, while retaining the\noptimally-tuned parameters for the range-separation and the short-range Fock\nexchange.

It has a wide variety of applications in disease\ndiagnosis, neuroimaging, etc. Most research on subgraph mining focuses on the\ngraph representation alone. However, in many real-world applications, the side\ninformation is available along with the graph data. For example, for\nneurological disorder identification, in addition to the brain networks derived\nfrom neuroimaging data, hundreds of clinical, immunologic, serologic and\ncognitive measures may also be documented for each subject. These measures\ncompose multiple side views encoding a tremendous amount of supplemental\ninformation for diagnostic purposes, yet are often ignored. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of discriminative subgraph selection using multiple side\nviews and propose a novel solution to find an optimal set of subgraph features\nfor graph classification by exploring a plurality of side views. We derive a\nfeature evaluation criterion, named gSide, to estimate the usefulness of\nsubgraph patterns based upon side views. Then we develop a branch-and-bound\nalgorithm, called gMSV, to efficiently search for optimal subgraph features by\nintegrating the subgraph mining process and the procedure of discriminative\nfeature selection. Empirical studies on graph classification tasks for\nneurological disorders using brain networks demonstrate that subgraph patterns\nselected by the multi-side-view guided subgraph selection approach can\neffectively boost graph classification performances and are relevant to disease\ndiagnosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 07:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Observations of variable X-ray\nabsorption in multiple Seyferts and over a wide range of timescales indicate\nthe presence of clumps/clouds of gas within the circumnuclear material.

It will be a means\nfor researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to\ncreate new versions of it. The SP system is a unique attempt to simplify and\nintegrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream\ncomputing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition, with information\ncompression as a unifying theme. Potential benefits and applications include\nhelping to solve problems associated with big data; facilitating the\ndevelopment of autonomous robots; unsupervised learning, natural language\nprocessing, several kinds of reasoning, fuzzy pattern recognition at multiple\nlevels of abstraction, computer vision, best-match and semantic forms of\ninformation retrieval, software engineering, medical diagnosis, simplification\nof computing systems, and the seamless integration of diverse kinds of\nknowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Additional motivations include\nthe potential of the SP system to help solve problems in defence, security, and\nthe detection and prevention of crime; potential in terms of economic, social,\nenvironmental, and academic criteria, and in terms of publicity; and the\npotential for international influence in research. The main elements of the\nproposed facility are described, including support for the development of\n\"SP-neural\", a neural version of the SP machine. The facility should be\npermanent in the sense that it should be available for the foreseeable future,\nand it should be designed to facilitate its use by researchers anywhere in the\nworld.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 09:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

The most important results are: 1) the average number of S0 galaxies in\nclusters is almost a factor of $\\sim 3 - 4$ larger today than at redshift $z\n\\sim 1$; 2) the fraction of S0's to Spirals increases on average by a factor\n$\\sim$ 2 every Gyr; 3) the average rate of transformation for Spirals (not\nconsidering the infall of new galaxies from the cosmic web) is: $\\sim$ 5 Sp\ninto S0's per Gyr and $\\sim$ 2 Sp into E's per Gyr; 4) there are evidences that\nthe interstellar gas of Spirals is stripped by an hot intergalactic medium; 5)\nthere are also indirect hints that major/minor merging events have played a\nrole in the transformation of Spiral galaxies. In particular, we show that: 1)\nthe ratio between the number of S0's and Spirals (NS0/NSp) in the WINGS\nclusters is correlated with their X-ray luminosity $L_X$ ; 2) that the\nbrightest and massive S0's are always close to the cluster center; 3) that the\nmean Sersic index of S0's is always larger than that of Spirals (and lower than\nE's) for galaxy stellar masses above $10^9.5$ Msun; 4) that the number of E's\nin clusters cannot be constant; 5) that the largest difference between the mean\nmass of S0's and E's with respect to Spirals is observed in clusters with low\nvelocity dispersion. Finally, by comparing the properties of the various\nmorphological types for galaxies in clusters and in the field, we find that the\nmost significant effect of the environment is the stripping of the outer galaxy\nregions, resulting in a systematic difference in effective radius and Sersic\nindex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 09:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

We construct a\nclass of entangled states resulting in a violation of the inequality, and thus\ntruly demonstrate non-locality in phase space.

This typically\ninvolves the construction of an empirical mode base that appropriately captures\nthe dominant flow structures. The most prominent candidates are the\nenergy-ranked proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and the frequency ranked\nFourier decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). However, these\nmethods fail when the relevant coherent structures occur at low energies or at\nmultiple frequencies, which is often the case. To overcome the deficit of these\n\"rigid\" approaches, we propose a new method termed Spectral Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to\nspatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional\ntemporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at\nmultiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from\nthe energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by\nchanging a single parameter. In this article, SPOD is motivated from\nphenomenological considerations of the POD autocorrelation matrix and justified\nfrom dynamical system theory. The new method is further applied to three sets\nof PIV measurements of flows from very different engineering problems. We\nconsider the flow of a swirl-stabilized combustor, the wake of an airfoil with\na Gurney flap, and the flow field of the sweeping jet behind a fluidic\noscillator. For these examples, the commonly used methods fail to assign the\nrelevant coherent structures to single modes.

We show that STM-based\nmagnetoconductance measurements can yield clear signatures of both these SOI\ninduced effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 13:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

In other words, the manifold's evolution depends on the solution to\nthe PDE, and vice versa the differential operator of the PDE depends on the\nmanifold's geometry. DPDE is used to study a diffusion equation with source on\na growing surface whose growth depends on the intensity of the diffused\nquantity. The surface may, for instance, represent the membrane of an egg\nchamber and the diffused quantity a protein activating a signaling pathway\nleading to growth. Our main objective is to show controllability of the surface\nshape using a fixed source with variable intensity for the diffusion. More\nspecifically, we look for a control driving a symmetric manifold shape to any\nother symmetric shape in a given time interval. For the diffusion we take\ndirectly the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the surface, while the surface growth\nis assumed to be equal to the value of the diffused quantity. We introduce a\ntheoretical framework, provide approximate controllability and show numerical\nresults.

The experimental results from a\nseries of SPECjvm2008 benchmarks are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 19:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

We see\nthat in this scenario, the inverse power-law potential\n$V(\\phi)=V_{0}(\\phi/\\phi_{0})^{-n}$ with $n=2$ leads to the power-law inflation\nwith the scale factor $a(t)\\propto t^{q}$ where $q>1$, while with $n<2$, it\ngives rise to the intermediate inflation with the scale factor\n$a(t)\\propto\\exp\\left(At^{f}\\right)$ where $A>0$ and $0<f<1$. We find that,\nalthough the inverse power-law potential with $n\\leq 2$ is completely ruled out\nby the Planck 2015 data, the result of this potential for $n>2$ can be\ncompatible with the 95\\% CL region of Planck 2015 TT, TE, EE+lowP data.

We investigate the\npossibility of a visco-elastic flow instability in curved geometry for such\nmaterials. To this end, we first present a general strategy extending a\nfirst-principles approach based on projections onto slow variables (so far\nrestricted to strictly homogeneous flow) in order to handle inhomogeneities. In\nparticular, we separate the advection of the microstructure by the flow, at the\norigin of a fluctuation advection term, from the intrinsic dynamics. On account\nof the complexity of the involved equations, we then opt for a drastic\nsimplification of the theory, in order to establish its potential to describe\ninstabilities. These very strong approximations lead to a constitutive equation\nof the White-Metzner class, whose parameters are fitted with experimental\nmeasurements of the macroscopic rheology of a glass-forming colloidal\ndispersion. The model properly accounts for the shear-thinning properties of\nthe dispersions, but, owing to the approximations, the description is not fully\nquantitative. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis of the flow in\nthe experimentally relevant cylindrical (Taylor-Couette) geometry and provide\nevidence that shear-thinning strongly stabilises the flow, which can explain\nwhy visco-elastic instabilities are not observed in dense colloidal\nsuspensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 11:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

The two-state three-neighborhood\none-dimensional ACAs that converge to fixed points from arbitrary seeds are\nused here for pattern classification. To design the classifier, we first\nidentify a set of ACAs that always converge to fixed points from any seeds with\nfollowing properties - (1) each ACA should have at least two but not huge\nnumber of fixed point attractors, and (2) the convergence time of these ACAs\nare not to be exponential. In order to address the first issue, we propose a\ngraph, coined as fixed point graph of an ACA that facilitates in counting the\nfixed points. We further perform an experimental study to estimate the\nconvergence time of ACAs, and find that there are some convergent ACAs which\ndemand exponential convergence time. Finally, we find that there are 71 (out of\n256) ACAs which can be effective candidates as pattern classifier.
