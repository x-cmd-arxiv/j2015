Most users, however, prefer password-only authentication. One reason\nwhy two-factor authentication is so unpopular is the extra steps that the user\nmust complete in order to log in. Currently deployed two-factor authentication\nmechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a\nverification code to the browser. Two-factor authentication schemes that\neliminate user-phone interaction exist, but require additional software to be\ndeployed.\n  In this paper we propose Sound-Proof, a usable and deployable two-factor\nauthentication mechanism. Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the\nuser and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the\nproximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity\nof the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their\nmicrophones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so\nthat the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication.\nSound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major\nbrowsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We\nprovide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to\ndetermine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if\nthe phone is in a pocket or purse.

Two most relevant bi-tensors in this\ncontext are Synge's World function $\\Omega(p,p_0)$ and the van Vleck\ndeterminant (VVD) $\\Delta(p,p_0)$, as they encode the metric properties of\nspacetime and (de)focussing behaviour of geodesics. They also characterize the\nleading short distance behavior of two point functions of the d'Alembartian\n$_{p_0} \\square_p$. We begin by discussing the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry\nof equi-geodesic surfaces $\\Sigma_{G,p_0}$ defined by $\\Omega(p,p_0)=constant$\nin a geodesically convex neighbourhood of an event $p_0$, and highlight some\nelementary identities relating the VVD with geometry of these surfaces. As an\naside, we also comment on the contribution of $\\Sigma_{G,p_0}$ to the surface\nterm in the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action and show that it can be written as a\nvolume integral of $\\square \\ln \\Delta$. We then study the small scale\nstructure of spacetime in presence of a Lorentz invariant short distance\ncut-off $\\ell_0$ using $\\Omega$ and $\\Delta$, based on some recently developed\nideas.

In this paper, we present a new method\naimed at extracting sites encoding structural and func- tional properties from\na set of protein primary sequences, namely a Multiple Sequence Alignment. The\nmethod, called Critical Variable Selection, is based on the idea that subsets\nof relevant sites cor- respond to subsequences that occur with a particularly\nbroad frequency distribution in the dataset. By applying this algorithm to in\nsilico sequences, to the Response Regulator Receiver and to the Voltage Sensor\nDomain of Ion Channels, we show that this procedure recovers not only\ninformation encoded in single site statistics and pairwise correlations but it\nalso captures dependencies going beyond pairwise correlations. The method\nproposed here is complementary to Statistical Coupling Analysis, in that the\nmost relevant sites predicted by the two methods markedly differ. We find\nrobust and consistent results for datasets as small as few hundred sequences,\nthat reveal a hidden hierarchy of sites that is consistent with present\nknowledge on biologically relevant sites and evo- lutionary dynamics. This\nsuggests that Critical Variable Selection is able to identify in a Multiple\nSequence Alignment a core of sites encoding functional and structural\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 17:07:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 21:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

These theoretical predictions can be tested with observational\ndata of contemporary impacts that is becoming available from spacecraft\ncurrently in orbit about Mars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 20:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

It is important to reliably distinguish different modes of\nmotion to improve our knowledge of the membrane architecture and to understand\nthe nature of interactions between membrane proteins and their environments.\nHere, we present an analysis technique for single molecule tracking (SMT)\ntrajectories that can determine the preferred model of motion that best matches\nobserved trajectories. Information theory criteria, such as the Bayesian\ninformation criterion (BIC), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and\nmodified AIC (AICc), are used to select the preferred model. The considered\ngroup of models includes free Brownian motion, and confined motion in 2nd or\n4th order potentials. We determine the best information criteria for\nclassifying trajectories. We tested its limits through simulations matching\nlarge sets of experimental conditions and built a decision tree. This decision\ntree first uses the BIC to distinguish between free Brownian motion and\nconfined motion. In a second step, it classifies the confining potential\nfurther using the AIC. We apply the method to experimental Clostridium\nPerfingens epsilon-toxin (CPepsilonT) receptor trajectories to show that these\nreceptors are confined by a spring-like potential. An adaptation of this\ntechnique was applied on a sliding window in the temporal dimension along the\ntrajectory. We applied this adaptation to experimental CPepsilonT trajectories\nthat lose confinement due to disaggregation of confining domains. This new\ntechnique adds another dimension to the discussion of SMT data. The mode of\nmotion of a receptor holds more biologically relevant information than the\ndiffusion coefficient or domain size and may be a better tool to classify and\ncompare different SMT experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 21:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

There are two main challenges for the conventional\nkernel approximation methods. First, before performing kernel approximation, a\ngood kernel has to be chosen. Picking a good kernel is a very challenging\nproblem in itself. Second, high-dimensional maps are often required in order to\nachieve good performance. This leads to high computational cost in both\ngenerating the nonlinear maps, and in the subsequent learning and prediction\nprocess. In this work, we propose to optimize the nonlinear maps directly with\nrespect to the classification objective in a data-dependent fashion. The\nproposed approach achieves kernel approximation and kernel learning in a joint\nframework. This leads to much more compact maps without hurting the\nperformance. As a by-product, the same framework can also be used to achieve\nmore compact kernel maps to approximate a known kernel. We also introduce\nCirculant Nonlinear Maps, which uses a circulant-structured projection matrix\nto speed up the nonlinear maps for high-dimensional data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 21:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

Indeed, it is\nforecasted that at least a 100x network capacity increase will be required to\nmeet the traffic demands in 2020. As a result, vendors and operators are now\nlooking at using every tool at hand to improve network capacity. In this epic\ncampaign, three paradigms are noteworthy, i.e., network densification, the use\nof higher frequency bands and spectral efficiency enhancement techniques. This\npaper aims at bringing further common understanding and analysing the potential\ngains and limitations of these three paradigms, together with the impact of\nidle mode capabilities at the small cells as well as the user equipment density\nand distribution in outdoor scenarios. Special attention is paid to network\ndensification and its implications when transitioning to ultra-dense small cell\ndeployments. Simulation results show that network densification with an average\ninter site distance of 35 m can increase the cell- edge UE throughput by up to\n48x, while the use of the 10GHz band with a 500MHz bandwidth can increase the\nnetwork capacity up to 5x. The use of beamforming with up to 4 antennas per\nsmall cell base station lacks behind with cell-edge throughput gains of up to\n1.49x. Our study also shows how network densifications reduces multi-user\ndiversity, and thus proportional fair alike schedulers start losing their\nadvantages with respect to round robin ones. The energy efficiency of these\nultra-dense small cell deployments is also analysed, indicating the need for\nenergy harvesting approaches to make these deployments energy- efficient.\nFinally, the top ten challenges to be addressed to bring ultra-dense small cell\ndeployments to reality are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 23:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

The\nsystematic errors including the each mask and stereotactic target localizer\nwere analyzed and the errors were calculated as the mean and standard deviation\n(SD) from the LR, SI, AP, and yaw setup corrections. In addition, the frequency\nof three-dimensional (3D) vector length were also analyzed. The values of the\nmean setup corrections for the R-mask in all directions were small; < 0.7 mm\nand < 0.1 degree, whereas the magnitudes of the SDs were relatively large\ncompared to the mean values. In contrast to the R-mask, the means and SDs of\nthe A-mask were smaller than those for the R-mask with the exception of the SD\nin the AP direction. The mean and SD in the yaw rotational direction in the\nR-mask and A-mask system were comparable. The 3D vector shifts of a larger\nmagnitude occurred more frequently for the R-mask than the A-mask. The setup\nuncertainties for each mask with the stereotactic localizing system had an\nasymmetric offset towards the positive AP direction. The A-mask-creation\nmethod, which is capable of covering the top of the patient head is superior to\nthat for R-mask, and thereby the use of the A-mask is encouraged for SF-SRS to\nreduce the setup uncertainties. Moreover, the careful mask making is required\nto prevent the possible setup uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 01:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

Second, AS-level adversaries can\nexploit natural churn in Internet routing to lie on the BGP paths for more\nusers over time.

Mouthguard displacements were within video measurement\nerror (<1mm), while the skin patch and skull cap displaced up to 4mm and 13mm\nfrom the ear-canal reference, respectively.

As a promising technique to\nincrease the efficiency of the spectrum utilization, cognitive radio (CR)\ntechnique has the great potential to meet such a requirement by allowing\nun-licensed users to coexist in licensed bands. In conventional CR systems, the\nspectrum sensing is performed at the beginning of each time slot before the\ndata transmission. This unfortunately results in two major problems: 1)\ntransmission time reduction due to sensing, and 2) sensing accuracy impairment\ndue to data transmission. To tackle these problems, in this paper we present a\nnew design paradigm for future CR by exploring the full-duplex (FD) techniques\nto achieve the simultaneous spectrum sensing and data transmission. With FD\nradios equipped at the secondary users (SUs), SUs can simultaneously sense and\naccess the vacant spectrum, and thus, significantly improve sensing\nperformances and meanwhile increase data transmission efficiency. The aim of\nthis article is to transform the promising conceptual framework into the\npractical wireless network design by addressing a diverse set of challenges\nsuch as protocol design and theoretical analysis.

Our results show\nthat the BSP-fitted ages in ~33.3% of ETG sample are around 0.5-1.0 Gyr larger\nthan the SSP-fitted ages; ~44.2\\% are only 0.1-0.5 Gyr larger; the rest ~22.5%\nare approximately equal. By comparisons, we find the difference of the star\nformation rate between the SSP and BSP models is large at the late evolution\nstage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 07:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Experimental\nobservations show that bacteria increase their run duration when encountering\nan increasing gradient of chemotactic molecules. This led to a first class of\nmodels which heuristically include tumbling frequencies depending on the\npath-wise gradient of chemotactic signal.\n  More recently, the biochemical pathways regulating the flagellar motors were\nuncovered. This knowledge gave rise to a second class of kinetic-transport\nequations, that takes into account an intra-cellular molecular content and\nwhich relates the tumbling frequency to this information. It turns out that the\ntumbling frequency depends on the chemotactic signal, and not on its gradient.\n  For these two classes of models, macroscopic equations of Keller-Segel type,\nhave been derived using diffusion or hyperbolic rescaling. We complete this\nprogram by showing how the first class of equations can be derived from the\nsecond class with molecular content after appropriate rescaling. The main\ndifficulty is to explain why the path-wise gradient of chemotactic signal can\narise in this asymptotic process.\n  Randomness of receptor methylation events can be included, and our approach\ncan be used to compute the tumbling frequency in presence of such a noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 07:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

We analyse the MIDI data and the full SED, using the MCMax radiative\ntransfer code, to find a good structure model of AC Her's circumbinary disk. We\ninclude a grain size distribution and midplane settling of dust\nself-consistently. The spatial distribution of crystalline forsterite in the\ndisk is investigated with the mid-IR features, the 69~$\\mu$m band and the\n11.3~$\\mu$m signatures in the interferometric data. All the data are well\nfitted. The inclination and position angle of the disk are well determined at\ni=50+-8 and PA=305+-10. We firmly establish that the inner disk radius is about\nan order of magnitude larger than the dust sublimation radius. Significant\ngrain growth has occurred, with mm-sized grains being settled to the midplane\nof the disk. A large dust mass is needed to fit the sub-mm fluxes. By assuming\n{\\alpha}=0.01, a good fit is obtained with a small grain size power law index\nof 3.25, combined with a small gas/dust ratio <10. The resulting gas mass is\ncompatible with recent estimates employing direct gas diagnostics. The spatial\ndistribution of the forsterite is different from the amorphous dust, as more\nwarm forsterite is needed in the surface layers of the inner disk. The disk in\nAC Her is very evolved, with its small gas/dust ratio and large inner hole.\nMid-IR interferometry offers unique constraints, complementary to mid-IR\nfeatures, for studying the mineralogy in disks. A better uv coverage is needed\nto constrain in detail the distribution of the crystalline forsterite in AC\nHer, but we find strong similarities with the protoplanetary disk HD100546.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 08:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 07:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In GSM, in addition to conveying information bits\nthrough $n_{rf}$ conventional modulation symbols (for example, QAM), the\nindices of the $n_{rf}$ active transmit antennas also convey information bits.\nIn this paper, we investigate {\\em GSM for large-scale multiuser MIMO\ncommunications on the uplink}. Our contributions in this paper include: ($i$)\nan average bit error probability (ABEP) analysis for maximum-likelihood\ndetection in multiuser GSM-MIMO on the uplink, where we derive an upper bound\non the ABEP, and ($ii$) low-complexity algorithms for GSM-MIMO signal detection\nand channel estimation at the base station receiver based on message passing.\nThe analytical upper bounds on the ABEP are found to be tight at moderate to\nhigh signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The proposed receiver algorithms are found\nto scale very well in complexity while achieving near-optimal performance in\nlarge dimensions. Simulation results show that, for the same spectral\nefficiency, multiuser GSM-MIMO can outperform multiuser SM-MIMO as well as\nconventional multiuser MIMO, by about 2 to 9 dB at a bit error rate of\n$10^{-3}$. Such SNR gains in GSM-MIMO compared to SM-MIMO and conventional MIMO\ncan be attributed to the fact that, because of a larger number of spatial index\nbits, GSM-MIMO can use a lower-order QAM alphabet which is more power\nefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 09:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

When the relative velocity is sufficiently\nsmall, the periodic pattern reduces to a periodic array of topological solitons\nas kinks of relative phase. According to our variational and numerical\nanalyses, the soliton solution is well characterized by the soliton width and\ndensity depression. We demonstrate the dependence of the depression and width\non the Rabi frequency and the coupling constant of inter-component\ndensity-density interactions. The periodic pattern of the relative phase\ntransforms continuously from a soliton array to a sinusoidal pattern as the\nperiod becomes smaller than the soliton width.

We discuss this link using the tree size of\na multiqubit state, a complexity measure that has two noticeable (and, so far,\nunique) features: it is in principle computable, and non-trivial lower bounds\ncan be obtained, hence identifying truly complex states. In this paper, we\nfirst review the definition of tree size, together with known results on the\nmost complex three and four qubits states. Moving to the multiqubit case, we\nrevisit a mathematical theorem for proving a lower bound on tree size that\nscales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. Next, states with\nsuperpolynomial tree size, the Immanant states, the Deutsch-Jozsa states, the\nShor's states and the subgroup states, are described. We show that the\nuniversal resource state for measurement based quantum computation, the\n2D-cluster state, has superpolynomial tree size. Moreover, we show how the\ncomplexity of subgroup states and the 2D cluster state can be verified\nefficiently. The question of how tree size is related to the speed up achieved\nin quantum computation is also addressed. We show that superpolynomial tree\nsize of the resource state is essential for measurement based quantum\ncomputation. The necessary role of large tree size in the circuit model of\nquantum computation is still a conjecture; and we prove a weaker version of the\nconjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 10:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 06:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons\nstarting at similar times for all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at\ndifferent time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and spatial\nproperties of neuronal networks. Here, we explore the extreme cases of axon\nformation especially concerning short-distance connectivity during early\ndevelopment, either starting at the same time for all neurons (parallel, i.e.\nmaximally-overlapped time windows) or occurring for each neuron separately one\nneuron after another (serial, i.e. no overlaps in time windows).

Second, connection probability\ndecreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than\nfor serial growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for\nparallel growth.

Moreover, in the cases of the dihedral groups of order twice odd\nprimes, which are special cases of the Frobenius groups, we determine the same\nbound for the Cayley graphs of the groups with respect to not only normal but\nalso all Cayley subsets. As is the case of abelian groups which we have treated\nin the previous papers, such a bound is equal to the trivial one in the above\nsense or, as exceptional cases, exceeds one from it.

Our goal is to determine the molecular composition of the circumstellar\ndisk around AB Aurigae (hereafter, AB Aur). AB Aur is a prototypical Herbig Ae\nstar and the understanding of its disk chemistry is of paramount importance to\nunderstand the chemical evolution of the gas in warm disks. Methods. We used\nthe IRAM 30-m telescope to perform a sensitive search for molecular lines in AB\nAur as part of the IRAM Large program ASAI (A Chemical Survey of Sun-like\nStar-forming Regions). These data were complemented with interferometric\nobservations of the HCO+ 1-0 and C17O 1-0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer (PdBI). Single-dish and interferometric data were used to\nconstrain chemical models. Results. Throughout the survey, several lines of CO\nand its isotopologues, HCO+, H2CO, HCN, CN and CS, were detected. In addition,\nwe detected the SO 54-33 and 56-45 lines, confirming the previous tentative\ndetection.

AB Aur is the only protoplanetary disk detected in SO thus\nfar. Conclusions. We modeled the line profiles using a chemical model and a\nradiative transfer 3D code. Our model assumes a flared disk in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The best agreement with observations was obtained for a disk with\na mass of 0.01 Msun , Rin=110 AU, Rout=550 AU, a surface density radial index\nof 1.5 and an inclination of 27 deg.

This agreement is reasonable\ntaking into account the simplicity of our model that neglects any structure\nwithin the disk.

With the aim of understanding the spread of infection in the affected\ncountries, it is crucial to modelize the virus and simulate it. In this paper,\nwe begin by studying a simple mathematical model that describes the 2014 Ebola\noutbreak in Liberia. Then, we use numerical simulations and available data\nprovided by the World Health Organization to validate the obtained mathematical\nmodel. Moreover, we develop a new mathematical model including vaccination of\nindividuals. We discuss different cases of vaccination in order to predict the\neffect of vaccination on the infected individuals over time. Finally, we apply\noptimal control to study the impact of vaccination on the spread of the Ebola\nvirus. The optimal control problem is solved numerically by using a direct\nmulti-shooting method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 01:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}
