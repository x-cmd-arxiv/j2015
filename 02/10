For control and read-out the atom must be coupled\nto electronic contacts. Hence the spin dynamics of the system is governed by a\nquantum master equation. Our analysis shows that in general it cannot be\nreduced to a classical master equation in the basis of the unperturbed\ncrystal-field Hamiltonian. Rather, depending on parameters and control fields,\n\"environment induced superselection\" principles choose the appropriate set of\nbasis states, which in turn determines the specific relaxation channels and\nlifetimes. Our simulations suggest that in ideal situations the lifetimes\nshould be even longer than observed in the experiment. We, therefore,\ninvestigate the influence of various perturbations.

We provide a theoretical framework for\nanalyzing the robustness of classifiers to adversarial perturbations, and show\nfundamental upper bounds on the robustness of classifiers. Specifically, we\nestablish a general upper bound on the robustness of classifiers to adversarial\nperturbations, and then illustrate the obtained upper bound on the families of\nlinear and quadratic classifiers. In both cases, our upper bound depends on a\ndistinguishability measure that captures the notion of difficulty of the\nclassification task. Our results for both classes imply that in tasks involving\nsmall distinguishability, no classifier in the considered set will be robust to\nadversarial perturbations, even if a good accuracy is achieved. Our theoretical\nframework moreover suggests that the phenomenon of adversarial instability is\ndue to the low flexibility of classifiers, compared to the difficulty of the\nclassification task (captured by the distinguishability). Moreover, we show the\nexistence of a clear distinction between the robustness of a classifier to\nrandom noise and its robustness to adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the\nformer is shown to be larger than the latter by a factor that is proportional\nto \\sqrt{d} (with d being the signal dimension) for linear classifiers. This\nresult gives a theoretical explanation for the discrepancy between the two\nrobustness properties in high dimensional problems, which was empirically\nobserved in the context of neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, our\nresults provide the first theoretical work that addresses the phenomenon of\nadversarial instability recently observed for deep networks.

We show that the lag-energy spectra of the two QPOs are\nsystematically different: while the lower kHz QPO shows soft lags, the upper\nkHz QPO shows either a flat lag-energy spectrum or hard variations lagging\nsofter variations. This suggests two different QPO-generation mechanisms. We\nalso performed the first spectral deconvolution of the covariance spectra of\nboth kHz QPOs. The QPO spectra are consistent with Comptonized blackbody\nemission, similar to the one found in the time-averaged spectrum, but with a\nhigher seed-photon temperature, suggesting that a more compact inner region of\nthe Comptonization layer (boundary/spreading layer, corona) is responsible for\nthe QPO emission.

We are motivated by the need for formal modeling\nin the field. Thus, we introduce and analyze, in this theoretical study, a new\nmodel for the FI mining task. Indeed, we encode the itemsets as words over an\nordered alphabet, and state this problem by a formal series over the counting\nsemiring $(\\mathbb{N},+,\\times,0,1)$, whose range constitutes the itemsets and\nthe coefficients are their supports. This formalism offers many advantages in\nboth fundamental and practical aspects: the introduction of a clear and unified\ntheoretical framework through which we can express the main FI-approaches, the\npossibility of their generalization to mine other more complex objects, and\ntheir incrementalisation or parallelisation; in practice, we explain how this\nproblem can be seen as that of word recognition by an automaton, allowing an\nefficient implementation in $O(|Q|)$ space and $O(|\\mathcal{F}_L||Q|])$ time,\nwhere $Q$ is the set of states of the automaton used for representing the data,\nand $\\mathcal{F}_L$ the set of prefixial longest FI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 20:28:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 19:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 21:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 23:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Using a high-level six-dimensional\npotential surface, time-independent scattering calculations, within a full\nangular-momentum-coupling formulation, were performed for the deexcitation of\nvibrationally excited CO. Agreement with experimentally-determined results\nconfirms the accuracy of the potential and scattering computations,\nrepresenting the largest of such calculations performed to date. This\ninvestigation advances computational quantum dynamics studies representing\ninitial steps toward obtaining CO-H$_2$ rovibrational quenching data needed for\nastrophysical modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 20:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

By means of multidimensional fits, we\nderive the current preferred values of the high-energy neutrino flavor ratios,\nthe normalization and spectral index of the astrophysical fluxes, and the\nexpected atmospheric background events, including a prompt component. A crucial\nassumption resides on the choice of the energy interval used for the analyses,\nwhich significantly biases the results. When restricting ourselves to the ~30\nTeV - 3 PeV energy range, which contains all the observed IceCube events, we\nfind that the inclusion of the spectral information improves the fit to the\ncanonical flavor composition at Earth, (1:1:1), with respect to a single-energy\nbin analysis. Increasing both the minimum and the maximum deposited energies\nhas dramatic effects on the reconstructed flavor ratios as well as on the\nspectral index. Imposing a higher threshold of 60 TeV yields a slightly harder\nspectrum by allowing a larger muon neutrino component, since above this energy\nmost atmospheric tracklike events are effectively removed. Extending the\nhigh-energy cutoff to fully cover the Glashow resonance region leads to a\nsofter spectrum and a preference for tau neutrino dominance, as none of the\nexpected electron antineutrino induced showers have been observed so far. The\nlack of showers at energies above 2 PeV may point to a broken power-law\nneutrino spectrum.

Mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)\nactivity state, with a VHE flux of about half that of the Crab Nebula, yet the\nlight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highest\nvariability being in the X-rays. We determined the power spectral densities\n(PSD) at most wavelengths and found that all PSDs can be described by\npower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noise\nbehavior. We observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and\nmeasured a positive correlation between VHE and X-ray fluxes with zero time\nlag. Such characteristics have been reported many times during flaring\nactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaring\nstate. We also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/UV and\nX-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.\n  The harder-when-brighter behavior in the X-ray spectra and the measured\npositive X-ray/VHE correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaign\nsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaring\nstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. In\nparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsible\nfor the emission of Mrk421 during non-flaring activity. Such a temporally\nextended X-ray/VHE correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, and\nhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. The\nhighest variability is observed in the X-ray band, which, within the one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton scenario, indicates that the electron energy\ndistribution is most variable at the highest energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 20:54:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 20:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-07"}

This implies an exchange of\nangular momentum between linear perturbations and the background disc. In\nparticular, when the disturbance is a low-frequency trailing wave and the disc\ntemperature decreases outwards, this interaction is unstable and leads to the\ngrowth of the wave. We demonstrate this phenomenon through numerical\nhydrodynamic simulations of locally isothermal discs in 2D using the FARGO code\nand in 3D with the ZEUS-MP and PLUTO codes.

The\nmetal species S and Ar are overabundant, with 1.2-2.7 and 1.3-3.8 solar\nabundances, respectively, which strongly indicate the presence of a substantial\nejecta component in the X-ray-emitting plasma of this SNR. Kes 41 is found to\nbe associated with a giant molecular cloud (MC) at a systemic local standard of\nrest velocity of -50 km s$^{-1}$ and confined in a cavity delineated by a\nnorthern molecular shell, a western concave MC that features a discernible\nshell, and an HI cloud seen toward the southeast of the SNR. The birth of the\nSNR in a preexisting molecular cavity implies a mass of $\\gtrsim$18 M$_{\\odot}$\nfor the progenitor if it was not in a binary system. Thermal conduction and\ncloudlet evaporation seem to be feasible mechanisms to interpret the X-ray\nthermal composite morphology, and the scenario of gas reheating by the shock\nreflected from the cavity wall is quantitatively consistent with the\nobservations. An updated list of thermal composite SNRs is also presented in\nthis paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 21:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

To attempt to understand\nthis relation, we hypothesize that the relation and its evolution is regulated\nby the increase in the stellar and gas mass surface density in galaxies with\nredshift, which is itself governed by the angular momentum of the accreted gas,\nthe amount of available gas, and by self-regulation of star formation. With our\nmodel, we can reproduce the specific SFR-M_star relations at z~1-2 by assuming\ngas fractions and gas mass surface densities similar to those observed for\nz=1-2 galaxies. We further argue that it is the increasing angular momentum\nwith cosmic time that causes a decrease in the surface density of accreted gas.\nThe gas mass surface densities in galaxies are controlled by the centrifugal\nsupport (i.e., angular momentum), and the sSFR is predicted to increase as,\nsSFR(z)=(1+z)^3/t_H0, as observed (where t_H0 is the Hubble time and no free\nparameters are necessary). At z>~2, we argue that star formation is\nself-regulated by high pressures generated by the intense star formation\nitself. The star formation intensity must be high enough to either balance the\nhydrostatic pressure (a rather extreme assumption) or to generate high\nturbulent pressure in the molecular medium which maintains galaxies near the\nline of instability (i.e. Toomre Q~1).

The Gumbel distribution has certain drawbacks because it is a\nnon-heavy-tailed distribution and is characterized by constant skewness and\nkurtosis. The generalized extreme value distribution is frequently used in this\ncontext because it encompasses the three possible limiting distributions for a\nnormalized maximum of infinite samples of independent and identically\ndistributed observations. However, the generalized extreme value distribution\nmight not be a suitable model when each observed maximum does not come from a\nlarge number of observations. Hence, other forms of generalizations of the\nGumbel distribution might be preferable. Our goal is to collect in the present\nliterature the distributions that contain the Gumbel distribution embedded in\nthem and to identify those that have flexible skewness and kurtosis, are\nheavy-tailed and could be competitive with the generalized extreme value\ndistribution. The generalizations of the Gumbel distribution are described and\ncompared using an application to a wind speed data set and Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We show that some distributions suffer from overparameterization\nand coincide with other generalized Gumbel distributions with a smaller number\nof parameters, i.e., are non-identifiable.

While\nthere has been significant research on this problem, current state-of-the-art\napproaches for this task require annotation of facial landmarks, e.g. TSM [25],\nor annotation of face poses [28, 22]. They also require training dozens of\nmodels to fully capture faces in all orientations, e.g. 22 models in HeadHunter\nmethod [22]. In this paper we propose Deep Dense Face Detector (DDFD), a method\nthat does not require pose/landmark annotation and is able to detect faces in a\nwide range of orientations using a single model based on deep convolutional\nneural networks. The proposed method has minimal complexity; unlike other\nrecent deep learning object detection methods [9], it does not require\nadditional components such as segmentation, bounding-box regression, or SVM\nclassifiers. Furthermore, we analyzed scores of the proposed face detector for\nfaces in different orientations and found that 1) the proposed method is able\nto detect faces from different angles and can handle occlusion to some extent,\n2) there seems to be a correlation between dis- tribution of positive examples\nin the training set and scores of the proposed face detector. The latter\nsuggests that the proposed methods performance can be further improved by using\nbetter sampling strategies and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques.\nEvaluations on popular face detection benchmark datasets show that our\nsingle-model face detector algorithm has similar or better performance compared\nto the previous methods, which are more complex and require annotations of\neither different poses or facial landmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 03:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 10:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

Differentiating the extent to which patterns in a given\nsystem are determined statistically, and where it requires explicit ecological\nprocesses, has been difficult. We tackled this challenge by directly comparing\nmodels from a constraint-based theory, the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology\n(METE) and models from a process-based theory, the size-structured neutral\ntheory (SSNT). Models from both theories were capable of characterizing the\ndistribution of individuals among species and the distribution of body size\namong individuals across 76 forest communities. However, the SSNT models\nconsistently yielded higher overall likelihood, as well as more realistic\ncharacterizations of the relationship between species abundance and average\nbody size of conspecific individuals. This suggests that the details of the\nbiological processes contain additional information for understanding community\nstructure that are not fully captured by the METE constraints in these systems.\nOur approach provides a first step towards differentiating between process- and\nconstraint-based models of ecological systems and a general methodology for\ncomparing ecological models that make predictions for multiple patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 03:22:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 17:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 17:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 19:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

In this study, we consider spherical blast\nwaves propagating into a constant density core surrounded by an isothermal halo\nwith a decreasing density profile in order to explore how the deceleration rate\nof the shock speed affects the radio emission from accelerated electrons. The\nsurface brightness profile and the volume-integrated radio spectrum of the\nmodel shocks are calculated by assuming a ribbon-like shock surface on a\nspherical shell and the associated downstream region of relativistic electrons.\nIf the postshock magnetic field strength is about 7 microgauss, at the shock\nage of ~50 Myr, the volume-integrated radio spectrum steepens gradually with\nthe spectral index from alpha_{inj} to alpha_{inj}+0.5 over 0.1-10 GHz, where\nalpha_{inj} is the injection index at the shock positionexpected from the\ndiffusive shock acceleration theory.

(2014), if the relic shock\nis young enough so that the break frequency falls in around 1 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 05:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However,\nas deep features eventually transition from general to specific along the\nnetwork, the feature transferability drops significantly in higher layers with\nincreasing domain discrepancy. Hence, it is important to formally reduce the\ndataset bias and enhance the transferability in task-specific layers. In this\npaper, we propose a new Deep Adaptation Network (DAN) architecture, which\ngeneralizes deep convolutional neural network to the domain adaptation\nscenario. In DAN, hidden representations of all task-specific layers are\nembedded in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the mean embeddings of\ndifferent domain distributions can be explicitly matched. The domain\ndiscrepancy is further reduced using an optimal multi-kernel selection method\nfor mean embedding matching.

Since its introduction, the CCD has been the principle method of\nmeasuring flux to calculate the apparent magnitude of an object. Each CCD image\ntaken must go through a process of cleaning and calibration prior to its use.\nAs the number of research telescopes increases the overall computing resources\nrequired for image processing also increases. Existing processing techniques\nare primarily sequential in nature, requiring increasingly powerful servers,\nfaster disks and faster networks to process data. Existing High Performance\nComputing solutions involving high capacity data centres are complex in design\nand expensive to maintain, while providing resources primarily to high profile\nscience projects. This research describes three distributed pipeline\narchitectures, a virtualised cloud based IRAF, the Astronomical Compute Node\n(ACN), a private cloud based pipeline, and NIMBUS, a globally distributed\nsystem. The ACN pipeline processed data at a rate of 4 Terabytes per day\ndemonstrating data compression and upload to a central cloud storage service at\na rate faster than data generation. The primary contribution of this research\nis NIMBUS, which is rapidly scalable, resilient to failure and capable of\nprocessing CCD image data at a rate of hundreds of Terabytes per day. This\npipeline is implemented using a decentralised web queue to control the\ncompression of data, uploading of data to distributed web servers, and creating\nweb messages to identify the location of the data. Using distributed web queue\nmessages, images are downloaded by computing resources distributed around the\nglobe. Rigorous experimental evidence is presented verifying the horizontal\nscalability of the system which has demonstrated a processing rate of 192\nTerabytes per day with clear indications that higher processing rates are\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 09:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

This is made possible by the recent progress in precision metrology\nwith ultrastable lasers on energy levels in neutral molecular hydrogen (H$_2$,\nHD and D$_2$) and the molecular hydrogen ions (H$_2^+$, HD$^+$ and D$_2^+$).\nComparisons between experiment and quantum electrodynamics calculations for\nthese molecular systems can be interpreted in terms of probing large extra\ndimensions, under which conditions gravity will become much stronger. Molecules\nare a probe of space-time geometry at typical distances where chemical bonds\nare effective, i.e. at length scales of an \\AA. Constraints on compactification\nradii for extra dimensions are derived within the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali\nframework, while constraints for curvature or brane separation are derived\nwithin the Randall-Sundrum framework. Based on the molecular spectroscopy of\nD$_2$ molecules and HD$^+$ ions, the compactification size for seven extra\ndimensions (in connection to M-theory defined in 11 dimensions) of equal size\nis shown to be limited to $R_7 < 0.6 \\mu$m. While limits on compactification\nsizes of extra dimensions based on other branches of physics are compared, the\nprospect of further tightening constraints from the molecular method is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 10:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The disc\nluminosity, L=L_Edd\\propto ln mdot, at large-mdot cases. The Eddington ratio of\nthe disc is ~3 for mdot~100, which is significantly lower than that of a\nconventional slim disc without outflows.

For each receiver, the transmitter\nhas a unique infinite stream of packets, and its goal is to deliver them at the\nhighest throughput possible. While such multiple-unicast models are unsolved in\ngeneral, several network coding based schemes were suggested. In such schemes,\nthe transmitter can either send an uncoded packet, or a coded packet which is a\nfunction of a few packets. The packets sent can be received by the designated\nreceiver (with some probability) or heard and stored by other receivers. Two\nfunctional modes are considered; the first presumes that the storage time is\nunlimited, while in the second it is limited by a given Time to Expire (TTE)\nparameter. We model the transmission process as an infinite-horizon Markov\nDecision Process (MDP). Since the large state space renders exact solutions\ncomputationally impractical, we introduce policy restricted and induced MDPs\nwith significantly reduced state space, and prove that with proper reward\nfunction they have equal optimal value function (hence equal optimal\nthroughput).

We study the\nadiabatic response of the initially spherical dark halo to the introduction of\nthe baryonic component and find that the halo flattens in its inner regions\nwith final minor-major axis ratios $q$ = 0.75 - 0.95. The extent of the\nflattening depends on the velocity structure of the halo particles with\nradially biased models exhibiting a stronger response.

In order\nto further test the dynamical nature of these resonances we study the $\\bar\nB^0_s \\to \\phi D^* \\bar D^*$ and $\\bar B^0_s \\to \\phi D_s^* \\bar D_s^*$ decays\nclose to the $D^* \\bar D^*$ and $D_s^* \\bar D_s^*$ thresholds and make\npredictions for the ratio of the mass distributions in these decays and the\n$\\bar B^0_s \\to \\phi R$ decay widths. The measurement of these decays rates can\nhelp unravel the nature of these resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 15:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 07:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 09:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Reasoning about reactive systems using\nrefinement involves defining an abstract, high-level specification system and a\nconcrete, low-level implementation system. One then shows that every behavior\nallowed by the implementation is also allowed by the specification. Due to the\ndifference in abstraction levels, it is often the case that the implementation\nrequires many steps to match one step of the specification, hence, it is quite\nuseful for refinement to directly account for stuttering. Some optimized\nimplementations, however, can actually take multiple specification steps at\nonce. For example, a memory controller can buffer the commands to the memory\nand at a later time simultaneously update multiple memory locations, thereby\nskipping several observable states of the abstract specification, which only\nupdates one memory location at a time. We introduce skipping simulation\nrefinement and provide a sound and complete characterization consisting of\n\"local\" proof rules that are amenable to mechanization and automated\nverification. We present case studies that highlight the applicability of\nskipping refinement: a JVM-inspired stack machine, a simple memory controller\nand a scalar to vector compiler transformation.

As the\nfield is slowly tilted away from the normal, we find that the transformation\npathway between the two phases depends strongly on crystal orientation, field\nstrength, and degree of confinement of the monolayer. In some cases, the\npathway occurs by smooth magnetostrictive shear, while in others it involves\nthe sudden formation of martensitic plates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 15:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

So, possible perturbation of Earth\norbit is likely to be proportional to (0.017)$^2$ ~ 0.03% from 1 a.e. or ~ 43\n200 km which could be compared with gap between Earth and Apophis during\nclosest Apophis approach to Earth in April 2029.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 17:07:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2022 15:26:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 13:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}
