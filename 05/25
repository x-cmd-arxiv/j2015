The setting is of a\nnoisy, synchronous, Boolean, multi-access channel where $K$ active users (out\nof a total of $N$ users) seek to access. A solution to the partition problem\nplaces each of the $N$ users in one of $K$ groups (or blocks) such that no two\nactive nodes are in the same block. We consider a simple, but non-trivial and\nillustrative case of $K=2$ active users and study the number of steps $T$ used\nto solve the partition problem.

We present an X-ray study of the supernova remnant SNR J0533-7202 in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and determine its physical characteristics\nbased on its X-ray emission. Methods. We observed SNR J0533-7202 with\nXMM-Newton (flare-filtered exposure times of 18 ks EPIC-pn and 31 ks\nEPIC-MOS1/MOS2). We produced X-ray images of the SNR, performed an X-ray\nspectral analysis, and compared the results to multi-wavelength studies.\nResults. The distribution of X-ray emission is highly non-uniform, with the\nsouth-west region brighter than the north-east. The X-ray emission is\ncorrelated with the radio emission from the remnant. We determine that this\nmorphology is likely due to the SNR expanding into a non-uniform ambient medium\nand not an absorption effect. We estimate the size to be 53.9 (\\pm 3.4) x 43.6\n(\\pm 3.4) pc, with the major axis rotated ~64 degrees east of north. We find no\nspectral signatures of ejecta and infer that the X-ray plasma is dominated by\nswept-up interstellar medium. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedov\nself-similar solution, we estimate an age of ~17-27 kyr, with an initial\nexplosion energy of (0.09-0.83) x 10^51 erg. We detected an X-ray source\nlocated near the centre of the remnant, namely XMMU J053348.2-720233.

We detected bright thermal X-ray emission from SNR J0533-7202\nand determined that the remnant is in the Sedov phase of its evolution. The\nlack of ejecta emission prohibits us from typing the remnant with the X-ray\ndata.

We conjecture that this state has\nexponential correlation decay and that it demonstrates that the\nBrandao-Horodecki bound is tight (at least up to constant factors), and we\nprovide some numerical evidence for this as well as a sketch of how a proof of\ncorrelation decay might proceed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2015 19:40:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 16:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

The degree of lensing can be inferred by\ndetermining the transformation required to restore axisymmetry. This technique\nis in contrast to traditional weak lensing methods, which require averaging an\nensemble of background galaxy ellipticity measurements, to obtain a single\nshear measurement.

This elasticity can be employed to shape the\ndaily aggregated electricity demand profile of a system comprised of a large\nnumber of residential PEVs' users sharing one electricity retailer or an\naggregator. In this paper, we propose a joint demand shaping and altering\nalgorithm for managing vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled PEVs' electricity\nassignments (charging and discharging) in order to diminish the overall\nelectricity procurement costs for a retailer bidding to two-settlement\nelectricity markets, i.e., a day-ahead (DA) and a real-time (RT) market. This\napproach is decentralized, scalable, fast converging and does not violate\nusers' privacy. Our simulations' results demonstrate significant overall cost\nsavings (up to 28\\%) for a retailer bidding to an operational electricity\nmarket by using our proposed algorithm.

Thus even weak random\nchemical potential leads to diffusive motion of nodal fermions and the\nsignificantly critical behaviors of physical implications, since the strength\nflows eventually to large values at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 03:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

The counting results are critical for many components\nin assembly (e.g. variants detection and read error correction). For large\ngenomes, the k-mer counting task can easily consume a huge amount of memory,\nmaking it impossible for large-scale parallel assembly on commodity servers.\n  In this paper, we develop MSPKmerCounter, a disk-based approach, to\nefficiently perform k-mer counting for large genomes using a small amount of\nmemory. Our approach is based on a novel technique called Minimum Substring\nPartitioning (MSP). MSP breaks short reads into multiple disjoint partitions\nsuch that each partition can be loaded into memory and processed individually.\nBy leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers derived from the same short read,\nMSP can achieve astonishing compression ratio so that the I/O cost can be\nsignificantly reduced. For the task of k-mer counting, MSPKmerCounter offers a\nvery fast and memory-efficient solution. Experiment results on large real-life\nshort reads data sets demonstrate that MSPKmerCounter can achieve better\noverall performance than state-of-the-art k-mer counting approaches.\n  MSPKmerCounter is available at http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~yangli/MSPKmerCounter\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 07:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

Further, two different operations with\nrespect to the phase noise sources are considered, namely, the case of\nidentical phase noise sources and the case of independent phase noise sources\nover the antennas. In all scenarios the optimal detector is derived for a very\ngeneral parametrization of the phase noise distribution. Further, a high\nsignal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) analysis is performed to show that\nsymbol-error-rate (SER) floors appear in all cases. The SER floor in the case\nof identical phase noise sources (for both constant and fading channels) is\nindependent of the number of antenna elements. In contrast, the SER floor in\nthe case of independent phase noise sources is reduced when increasing the\nnumber of antenna elements (for both constant and fading channels). Finally,\nthe system model is extended to multiple data channel uses and it is shown that\nthe conclusions are valid for these setups, as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 07:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 09:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Thus, we use differential privacy to preserve the privacy of learners,\nand study the influence of guaranteeing differential privacy on the utility of\nthe distributed online learning algorithm.

Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art\nin MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR) is essential. Method: We conducted\nan extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a\nrigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary\nMDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process\nconsists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After\ndiscovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified,\nstrictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of\nour SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified\nprimary MDS studies. E.g. regarding security modelling artefact, we found that\ndeveloping domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches.\nThe current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding\npotential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the\nidentified primary MDS studies into 5 principal MDS studies, and other emerging\nor less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are\ngiven. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple\nsecurity concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains\nsupporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the\napplication of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the\nfirst in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy\nwith database searching.

The\nproposed static anti-windup analysis and robust performance synthesis\ncorrespond to several optimization goals, ranging from minimization of the\nnonlinear input/output gain to maximization of the stability region or\nmaximization of the domain of attraction. We also introduce a novel paradigm\naccounting for uncertainties in the energy of the disturbance inputs. Due to\nthe special structure of linear static anti-windup design, wherein the design\nvariables are decoupled from the Lyapunov certificates, we introduce a\nsignificant extension, called scenario with certificates (SwC), of the\nso-called scenario approach for uncertain optimization problems. This extension\nis of independent interest for similar robust synthesis problems involving\nparameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. We demonstrate that the scenario with\ncertificates robust design formulation is appealing because it provides a way\nto implicitly design the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and to remove\nrestrictive assumptions about convexity with respect to the uncertain\nparameters.

The issue of \"inconsistency\" in\nthis context has gained much attention in recent years. The literature provides\nus with a number of different \"inconsistency\" indices suggested for measuring\nthe inconsistency of the pairwise comparison matrix (PCM). The latter is\nunderstood as a deviation of the PCM from the \"consistent case\" - a notion that\nis formally well-defined in this theory. However the usage of the indices is\njustified only by some heuristics. It is still unclear what they really\n\"measure\". What is even more important and still not known is the relationship\nbetween their values and the \"consistency\" of the decision maker's judgments on\none hand, and the prioritization results upon the other. We provide examples\nshowing that it is necessary to distinguish between these three following\ntasks: the \"measuring\" of the \"PCM inconsistency\" and the PCM-based \"measuring\"\nof the consistency of decision maker's judgments and, finally, the \"measuring\"\nof the usefulness of the PCM as a source of information for estimation of the\npriority vector (PV). Next we focus on the third task, which seems to be the\nmost important one in Multi-Criteria Decision Making. With the help of Monte\nCarlo experiments, we study the performance of various inconsistency indices as\nindicators of the final PV estimation quality. The presented results allow a\ndeeper understanding of the information contained in these indices and help in\nchoosing a proper one in a given situation. They also enable us to develop a\nnew inconsistency characteristic and, based on it, to propose the PCM\nacceptance approach that is supported by the classical statistical methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 09:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 09:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 15:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

Chemical concentration measurements start with the binding of\nligand molecules to receptor proteins, which is an inherently noisy process,\nespecially at low concentrations. The signaling networks that transmit the\ninformation on the ligand concentration from the receptors into the cell have\nto filter this noise extrinsic to the cell as much as possible. These networks,\nhowever, are also stochastic in nature, which means that they will also add\nnoise to the transmitted signal. In this review, we will first discuss how the\ndiffusive transport and binding of ligand to the receptor sets the receptor\ncorrelation time, and then how downstream signaling pathways integrate the\nnoise in the receptor state; we will discuss how the number of receptors, the\nreceptor correlation time, and the effective integration time together set a\nfundamental limit on the precision of sensing. We then discuss how cells can\nremove the receptor noise while simultaneously suppressing the intrinsic noise\nin the signaling network. We describe why this mechanism of time integration\nrequires three classes of resources---receptors and their integration time,\nreadout molecules, energy---and how each resource class sets a fundamental\nsensing limit. We also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum-likelihood\nestimation, the role of receptor cooperativity, and how cellular copy protocols\ndiffer from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the computational\nliterature, explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the\nLandauer limit on the optimal trade-off between accuracy and energetic cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 09:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

In these models, the dynamics is generally represented by a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain whose states denote the copy-numbers of the\nconstituent species. The state-space on which this process resides is a subset\nof non-negative integer lattice and for many examples of interest, this\nstate-space is countably infinite. This causes numerous problems in analyzing\nthe Markov chain and understanding its long-term behavior. These problems are\nfurther confounded by the presence of conservation relations among species\nwhich constrain the dynamics in complicated ways. In this paper we provide a\nlinear-algebraic procedure to disentangle these conservation relations and\nrepresent the state-space in a special decomposed form, based on the\ncopy-number ranges of various species and dependencies among them. This\ndecomposed form is advantageous for analyzing the stochastic model and for a\nlarge class of networks we demonstrate how this form can be used for finding\nall the closed communication classes for the Markov chain within the infinite\nstate-space. Such communication classes are irreducible state-spaces for the\ndynamics and they support all the extremal stationary distributions for the\nMarkov chain. Hence our results provide important insights into the long-term\nbehavior and stability properties of stochastic models of reaction networks.

The\npartial gathering problem is a new generalization of the total gathering\nproblem. The partial gathering problem requires, for a given integer $g$, that\neach agent should move to a node and terminate so that at least $g$ agents\nshould meet at the same node. The requirement for the partial gathering problem\nis weaker than that for the (well-investigated) total gathering problem, and\nthus, we have interests in clarifying the difference on the move complexity\nbetween them. We propose three algorithms to solve the partial gathering\nproblem. The first algorithm is deterministic but requires unique ID of each\nagent. This algorithm achieves the partial gathering in $O(gn)$ total moves,\nwhere $n$ is the number of nodes. The second algorithm is randomized and\nrequires no unique ID of each agent (i.e., anonymous). This algorithm achieves\nthe partial gathering in expected $O(gn)$ total moves. The third algorithm is\ndeterministic and requires no unique ID of each agent. For this case, we show\nthat there exist initial configurations in which no algorithm can solve the\nproblem and agents can achieve the partial gathering in $O(kn)$ total moves for\nsolvable initial configurations, where $k$ is the number of agents.

Due to the entangled impact of various factors on EE\nsuch as interference level, backhaul capacity, BS density, power consumption\nparameters, BS sleeping, content popularity and cache capacity, another\nimportant question is what are the key factors that contribute more to the EE\ngain from caching. In this paper, we attempt to explore the potential of EE of\nthe cache-enabled wireless access networks and identify the key factors.

Generally,\nthe prey species would die out when their birth rate is too low, the habitat\nsize is too small, the predator grows too fast, or the predation pressure is\ntoo high. To save the endangered prey species, some human interference is\nuseful, such as creating a protection zone where the prey could cross the\nboundary freely but the predator is prohibited from entering. This paper\nstudies the existence of positive steady states to a predator-prey model with\nreaction-diffusion terms, Beddington-DeAngelis type functional response and\nnon-flux boundary conditions. It is shown that there is a threshold value\n$\\theta_0$ which characterizes the refuge ability of prey such that the\npositivity of prey population can be ensured if either the prey's birth rate\nsatisfies $\\theta\\geq\\theta_0$ (no matter how large the predator's growth rate\nis) or the predator's growth rate satisfies $\\mu\\le 0$, while a protection zone\n$\\Omega_0$ is necessary for such positive solutions if $\\theta<\\theta_0$ with\n$\\mu>0$ properly large. The more interesting finding is that there is another\nthreshold value $\\theta^*=\\theta^*(\\mu,\\Omega_0)<\\theta_0$, such that the\npositive solutions do exist for all $\\theta\\in(\\theta^*,\\theta_0)$. Letting\n$\\mu\\rightarrow\\infty$, we get the third threshold value\n$\\theta_1=\\theta_1(\\Omega_0)$ such that if $\\theta>\\theta_1(\\Omega_0)$, prey\nspecies could survive no matter how large the predator's growth rate is.

However, little\nwork has gone into using SDN to improve the performance and manageability of\nexisting networks without requiring a major overhaul of the existing network\ninfrastructure.\n  In this paper, we show how we can dramatically improve, or supercharge, the\nperformance of existing IP routers by combining them with SDN-enabled equipment\nin a novel way. More particularly, our supercharged solution substantially\nreduces the convergence time of an IP router upon link or node failure without\ninducing any reconfiguration of the IP router itself. Our key insight is to use\nthe SDN controller to precompute backup forwarding entries and immediately\nactivate them upon failure, enabling almost immediate data-plane recovery,\nwhile letting the router converge at its typical slow pace. By boosting\nexisting equipment's performance, we not only increase their lifetime but also\nprovide new incentives for network operators to kickstart SDN deployment.\n  We implemented a fully functional \"supercharger\" and use it to boost the\nconvergence performance of a Cisco Nexus 7k router.

From observations we know that this field is uncorrelated (or\nperhaps even weakly anticorrelated) with the global sunspot cycle. Our aim is\nto explore the origin, and particularly the cycle dependence of such a\nphenomenon using three-dimensional dynamo simulations. We adopt a simple model\nof a turbulent dynamo in a shearing box driven by helically forced turbulence.\nDepending on the dynamo parameters, large-scale (global) and small-scale\n(local) dynamos can be excited independently in this model. Based on\nsimulations in different parameter regimes, we find that, when only the\nlarge-scale dynamo is operating in the system, the small-scale magnetic field\ngenerated through shredding and tangling of the large-scale magnetic field is\npositively correlated with the global magnetic cycle. However, when both\ndynamos are operating, the small-scale field is produced from both the\nsmall-scale dynamo and the tangling of the large-scale field. In this\nsituation, when the large-scale field is weaker than the equipartition value of\nthe turbulence, the small-scale field is almost uncorrelated with the\nlarge-scale magnetic cycle. On the other hand, when the large-scale field is\nstronger than the equipartition value, we observe an anticorrelation between\nthe small-scale field and the large-scale magnetic cycle. This anticorrelation\ncan be interpreted as a suppression of the small-scale dynamo. Based on our\nstudies we conclude that the observed small-scale magnetic field in the Sun is\ngenerated by the combined mechanisms of small-scale dynamo and tangling of the\nlarge-scale field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 14:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 14:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-11"}

We develop the finite-sample theory of weighted-average\npower (WAP) tests with normal errors and a known long-run variance. We\nintroduce two weights which are invariant to orthogonal transformations of the\ninstruments; e.g., changing the order in which the instruments appear. While\ntests using the MM1 weight can be severely biased, optimal tests based on the\nMM2 weight are naturally two-sided when errors are homoskedastic.\n  We propose two boundary conditions that yield two-sided tests whether errors\nare homoskedastic or not. The locally unbiased (LU) condition is related to the\npower around the null hypothesis and is a weaker requirement than unbiasedness.\nThe strongly unbiased (SU) condition is more restrictive than LU, but the\nassociated WAP tests are easier to implement. Several tests are SU in finite\nsamples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the\nAnderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I. Andrews'\n(2015) PI-CLC tests) and two-sided tests which are optimal when the sample size\nis large and instruments are strong.\n  We refer to the WAP-SU tests based on our weights as MM1-SU and MM2-SU tests.\nDropping the restrictive assumptions of normality and known variance, the\ntheory is shown to remain valid at the cost of asymptotic approximations. The\nMM2-SU test is optimal under the strong IV asymptotics, and outperforms other\nexisting tests under the weak IV asymptotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 14:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

Existing methods for this problem make too restrictive assumptions\nand thus cannot model practical scenarios. The goal of this paper is to\nconsider the team formation problem in a realistic setting and present a novel\nformulation based on densest subgraphs. Our formulation allows modeling of many\nnatural requirements such as (i) inclusion of a designated team leader and/or a\ngroup of given experts, (ii) restriction of the size or more generally cost of\nthe team (iii) enforcing locality of the team, e.g., in a geographical sense or\nsocial sense, etc.\n  The proposed formulation leads to a generalized version of the classical\ndensest subgraph problem with cardinality constraints (DSP), which is an NP\nhard problem and has many applications in social network analysis. In this\npaper, we present a new method for (approximately) solving the generalized DSP\n(GDSP). Our method, FORTE, is based on solving an equivalent continuous\nrelaxation of GDSP.

Given that highly accurate values of the\ncorrection to the spin g-factor are currently available, accurate values of the\ncorrection to the orbital g-factor may also be determined.

Our recent\nresearch on 2D granular column collapses by using 2D granular materials (i.e.,\naluminum rods) has revealed results that differ markedly from those reported in\nthe literature. We assume a 2D column with an initial height of h0 and initial\nwidth of d0, a defined as their ratio (a =h0/d0), a final height of h , and\nmaximum run-out distance of d . The experimental data suggest that for the low\na regime (a <0.65) the ratio of the final height to initial height is 1.\nHowever, for the high a regime (a >0.65), the ratio of a to (d-d0)/d0, h0/h ,\nor d/d0 is expressed by power-law relations. In particular, the following\npower-function ratios (h0/h=1.42a^2/3 and d/d0=4.30a^0.72) are proposed for\nevery a >0.65. In contrast, the ratio (d-d0)/d0=3.25a^0.96 only holds for 0.65<\na< 1.5, whereas the ratio (d-d0)/d0=3.80a^0.73 holds for a>1.5.

The modern positivistic model of science for policy, known as\nevidence based policy, is based on dramatic simplifications and compressions of\navailable perceptions of the state of affairs and possible explanations\n(hypocognition). This model can result in flawed prescriptions. The flaws\nbecome more evident when dealing with complex issues characterized by\nconcomitant uncertainties in the normative, descriptive and ethical domains. In\nthis situation evidence-based policy may concur to the fragility of the social\nsystem. Science plays an important role in reducing the feeling of\nvulnerability of humans by projecting a promise of protection against\nuncertainties. In many applications quantitative science is used to remove\nuncertainty by transforming it into probability, so that mathematical modelling\ncan play the ritual role of haruspices. This epistemic governance arrangement\nis today in crisis. The primacy of science to adjudicate political issues must\npass through an assessment of the level of maturity and effectiveness of the\nvarious disciplines deployed. The solution implies abandoning dreams of\nprediction, control and optimization obtained by relying on a limited set of\nsimplified narratives to define the problem and moving instead to an open\nexploration of a broader set of plausible and relevant stories. Evidence based\npolicy has to be replaced by robust policy, where robustness is tested with\nrespect to feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control);\nviability (compatibility with processes under human control, in relation to\nboth the economic and technical dimensions), and desirability domain\n(compatibility with a plurality of normative considerations relevant to a\nplurality of actors).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 07:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}
