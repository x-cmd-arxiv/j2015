They were obtained in a unique environment for\nstudying QCD matter at temperatures and densities that exceed the limits\nwherein hadrons can exist as individual entities and raises to prominence the\nquark-gluon degrees of freedom. These findings are supported by major\nexperimental observations via measuring of the bulk properties of particle\nproduction, particle ratios and chemical freeze-out conditions, and elliptic\nflow; followed by hard probe measurements. The results reveal that a dense,\nstrongly-interacting medium is created in central Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV\nat RHIC. This revelation of a new state of nuclear matter has also been\nobserved in measurements at the LHC. Further, the IP-Glasma model coupled with\nviscous hydrodynamic models, which assumes the formation of a QGP, reproduces\nwell the experimental flow results from Au+Au at 200 GeV. This implies that the\nfluctuations in the initial geometry state are important and the created medium\nbehaves as a nearly perfect liquid of nuclear matter because it has an\nextraordinarily low ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. However, these\ndiscoveries are far from being fully understood. Furthermore, recent\nexperimental results from RHIC and LHC in small p+A, d+Au and He+A collision\nsystems provide brand new insight into the role of initial and final state\neffects. These have proven to be interesting and more surprising than\noriginally anticipated; and could conceivably shed new light in our\nunderstanding of collective behavior in heavy-ion physics. Accordingly, the\nfocus of the experiments at both facilities RHIC and the LHC is on detailed\nexploration of the properties of this new state of nuclear matter, the QGP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 16:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 16:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

In the algorithm for optimal scheduling,\neach load is modeled with a dynamic power profile that may be different for on\nand off switching. Optimal scheduling is achieved by the evaluation of a\nuser-specified criterion function with possible power constraints. The\nscheduling algorithm exploits the use of a moving finite time horizon and the\nresulting finite number of scheduling combinations to achieve real-time\ncomputation of the optimal timing and switching of loads. The moving time\nhorizon in the proposed optimal scheduling algorithm provides an opportunity to\nuse short term (time moving) predictions of solar power based on advection of\nclouds detected in sky images. Advection, persistence, and perfect forecast\nscenarios are used as input to the load scheduling algorithm to elucidate the\neffect of forecast errors on mis-scheduling. The advection forecast creates\nless events where the load demand is greater than the available solar energy,\nas compared to persistence. Increasing the decision horizon leads to increasing\nerror and decreased efficiency of the system, measured as the amount of power\nconsumed by the aggregate loads normalized by total solar power.

Processes with\nthe risk of deformation after time or post processing may find this technique\nbeneficial. We propose to use objects from algebraic geometry as test shapes. A\ncubic surface is given as the zero set of a 3rd degree polynomial with 3\nvariables. A class of cubics in real 3D space contains exactly 27 real lines.\nWe provide a library for the computer algebra system Singular which, from 6\ngiven points in the plane, constructs a cubic and the lines on it. A surface\nshape derived from a cubic offers simplicity to the dimensional comparison\nprocess, in that the straight lines and many other features can be analytically\ndetermined and easily measured using non-digital equipment. For example, the\nsurface contains so-called Eckardt points, in each of which three of the lines\nintersect, and also other intersection points of pairs of lines. Distances\nbetween these intersection points can easily be measured, since the points are\nconnected by straight lines. At all intersection points of lines, angles can be\nverified. Hence, many features distributed over the build volume are known\nanalytically, and can be used for the validation process. Due to the thin shape\ngeometry the material required to produce an algebraic surface is minimal.

We introduce a special\nway to define operators at any given scale in terms of appropriate\ncoarse-grained collective variables, without requiring the use of the\nelementary fields. The Wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting the\ncut-off to a functional of these collective variables. We impose three criteria\nto determine the coarse-graining. The first criterion is that the effective\nWard identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. should\npreserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric and\nsources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. The\nsecond criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in the\nactual background metric should be state-independent, implying that the\ncollective variables should not explicitly appear in them. The final criterion\nis that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the RG flow can be transformed\nto a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic equations with a\nfinite number of parameters, such as incompressible non-relativistic\nNavier-Stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the scale and of the time\ncoordinate. Using previous work, we explicitly show that in the hydrodynamic\nlimit each such highly efficient RG flow reproduces a unique classical gravity\ntheory with precise UV data that satisfy our IR criterion. We obtain the\nexplicit coarse-graining which reproduces Einstein's equations. In a simple\nexample, we are also able to compute the beta function.

In case of the kinetic gravity braiding model and the Galileon model,\nthe growth rate $f\\sigma_8$ is enhanced compared with the $\\Lambda$CDM case,\nfor the same value of $\\Omega_{m,0}$, because of the enhancement of effective\ngravitational constant. For future observational data of the cosmic growth rate\n(Euclid), compatible value of $\\Omega_{m,0}$ are different by models,\nfurthermore $\\Omega_{m,0}$ can be stringently constrained. Thus, we find the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model is distinguishable from modified gravity by combining the\ngrowth rate data of the Euclid with other observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 19:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

Our results are valid for all values of the gauge coupling in $1+1$\ndimensions, and valid in the strong-coupling region for any number of\ndimensions. When the quark chemical potential $\\mu$ is nonzero, the spatial\ntransfer matrix $T_s$ is non-Hermitian. The appearance of complex eigenvalues\nin $T_s$ is a manifestation of the sign problem in finite-density QCD. The\ninvariance of finite-density QCD under the combined action of charge\nconjugation $\\mathcal{C}$ and complex conjugation $\\mathcal{K}$ implies that\nthe eigenvalues of $T_s$ are either real or part of a complex pair. Calculation\nof the spectrum confirms the existence of complex pairs in much of the\ntemperature-chemical potential plane. Many features of the spectrum for static\nquarks are determined by a particle-hole symmetry. For $\\mu$ small compared to\nthe quark mass $M$, we typically find real eigenvalues for the lowest lying\nstates. At somewhat larger values of $\\mu,$ pairs of eigenvalues may form\ncomplex-conjugate pairs, leading to damped oscillatory behavior in Polyakov\nloop correlation functions. However, near $\\mu=M$, the low-lying spectrum\nbecomes real again. This is a direct consequence of the approximate\nparticle-hole symmetry at $\\mu=M$ for heavy quarks. This behavior of the\neigenvalues should be observable in lattice simulations and can be used as a\ntest of lattice algorithms.

Results: The mean GDR\nfrequency and width are mostly reproduced with the FAM-QRPA, when compared to\nexperimental data, although some deficiency is observed with isotopes heavier\nthan erbium. A role of the TRK enhancement factor in actual GDR strength is\nclearly shown: its increment leads to a shift of the GDR strength to\nhigher-energy region, without a significant change in the transition\namplitudes. Conclusions: The newly developed FAM-QRPA scheme shows a remarkable\nefficiency, which enables to perform systematic analysis of GDR for heavy\nrare-earth nuclei. Theoretical deficiency of photoabsorption cross section\ncould not be improved by only adjusting the TRK enhancement factor, suggesting\nthe necessity of beyond the self-consistent QRPA approach, and/or a more\nsystematic optimization of the EDF parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 21:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

We studied\ndifferent MHD solutions characterized by different values of (a) the disk\naspect ratio ($\\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We use two\nkinds of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence\n(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. Such heating could be from e.g.\ndissipation of energy due to MHD turbulence in the disk or from illumination.\nWe use each of these MHD solutions to predict the physical parameters of an\noutflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\\xi$), column density and\ntimescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions within\nthe outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. The cold MHD\nsolutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency.

Thus, it is of great importance to estimate\nheterogeneous dependencies and discover subpopulation with certain commonality\nacross the whole population. In this work, we introduce a novel regularized\nestimation scheme for learning nonparametric mixture of Gaussian graphical\nmodels, which extends the methodology and applicability of Gaussian graphical\nmodels and mixture models. We propose a unified penalized likelihood approach\nto effectively estimate nonparametric functional parameters and heterogeneous\ngraphical parameters.

This question is well understood in two classes of routing games.

The second framework is splitable\natomic games: there are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a\npopulation of individuals (let them be cars in road traffic or packets in the\ncommunication networks). In this paper, we study two other frameworks of\nrouting games in which each of several players has an integer number of\nconnections (which are population of packets) to route and where there is a\nconstraint that a connection cannot be split. Through a particular game with a\nsimple three link topology, we identify various novel and surprising properties\nof games within these frameworks. We show in particular that equilibria are non\nunique even in the potential game setting of Rosenthal with strictly convex\nlink costs.

INTRODUCTION A central question in routing games has been to\nestablish conditions for the uniqueness of the equilibria, either in terms of\nthe network topology or in terms of the costs. A survey on these issues is\ngiven in [1]. The question of uniqueness of equilibria has been studied in two\ndifferent frameworks. The first, which we call F1, is the non-atomic routing\nintroduced by Wardrop on 1952 in the context of road traffic in which each\nplayer (car) is infinitesimally small; a single car has a negligible impact on\nthe congestion. Each car wishes to minimize its expected delay. Under arbitrary\ntopology, such games are known to have a convex potential and thus have a\nunique equilibrium [2]. The second framework, denoted by F2, is splitable\natomic games. There are finitely many players, each controlling the route of a\npopulation of individuals. This type of games have already been studied in the\ncontext of road traffic by Haurie and Marcotte [3] but have become central in\nthe telecom community to model routing decisions of Internet Service Providers\nthat can decide how to split the traffic of their subscribers among various\nroutes so as to minimize network congestion [4].

Here we report on a novel dispersive hydrodynamics testbed: the\neffectively frictionless dynamics of interfacial waves between two high\ncontrast, miscible, low Reynolds' number Stokes fluids. This scenario is\nrealized by injecting from below a lighter, viscous fluid into a column filled\nwith high viscosity fluid. The injected fluid forms a deformable pipe whose\ndiameter is proportional to the injection rate, enabling precise control over\nthe generation of symmetric interfacial waves. Buoyancy drives nonlinear\ninterfacial self-steepening while normal stresses give rise to dispersion of\ninterfacial waves. Extremely slow mass diffusion and mass conservation imply\nthat the interfacial waves are effectively dissipationless. This enables high\nfidelity observations of large amplitude dispersive shock waves in this\nspatially extended system, found to agree quantitatively with a nonlinear wave\naveraging theory. Furthermore, several highly coherent phenomena are\ninvestigated including dispersive shock wave backflow, the refraction or\nabsorption of solitons by dispersive shock waves, and the multi-phase merging\nof two dispersive shock waves. The complex, coherent, nonlinear mixing of\ndispersive shock waves and solitons observed here are universal features of\ndissipationless, dispersive hydrodynamic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 08:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 01:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 18:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The latest deep ConvNets proposed for this task consist of a\nsiamese network that is trained by penalising misclassification of pairs of\nlocal image patches. Current results from machine learning show that replacing\nthis siamese by a triplet network can improve the classification accuracy in\nseveral problems, but this has yet to be demonstrated for local image\ndescriptor learning. Moreover, current siamese and triplet networks have been\ntrained with stochastic gradient descent that computes the gradient from\nindividual pairs or triplets of local image patches, which can make them prone\nto overfitting. In this paper, we first propose the use of triplet networks for\nthe problem of local image descriptor learning. Furthermore, we also propose\nthe use of a global loss that minimises the overall classification error in the\ntraining set, which can improve the generalisation capability of the model.\nUsing the UBC benchmark dataset for comparing local image descriptors, we show\nthat the triplet network produces a more accurate embedding than the siamese\nnetwork in terms of the UBC dataset errors.

The proposed new measure of\ninsolvency risk is constructed by disentangling assets, debt and equity at the\nmicro-prudential firm level. This new risk index is the Firm Insolvency Risk\nIndex (FIRI) which is symmetrical, proportional and scale invariant. We\ndemonstrate that the balance sheet can be shown to evolve with a fractal\npattern. As such we construct a fractal index that can measure the risk of\nassets.

Here, we report the discovery of 59\nmassive structures of galaxies with masses greater than a few x 10^13 Msun at\nredshifts between z=0.6 and 4.5 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey\nfields. The massive structures are identified by running top-hat filters on the\ntwo dimensional spatial distribution of magnitude-limited samples of galaxies\nusing a combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We analyze the\nMillennium simulation data in a similar way to the analysis of the\nobservational data in order to test the LCDM cosmology.

Our result suggests that massive structures have emerged early, but\nthe reason for the discrepancy with the simulation is unclear. It could be due\nto the limitation of the simulation such as the lack of key, unrecognized\ningredients (strong non-Gaussianity or other baryonic physics), or simply a\ndifficulty in the halo mass estimation from observation, or a fundamental\nproblem of the LCDM cosmology. On the other hand, the over-abundance of massive\nstructures at high redshifts does not favor heavy neutrino mass of ~ 0.3 eV or\nlarger, as heavy neutrinos make the discrepancy between the observation and the\nsimulation more pronounced by a factor of 3 or more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 13:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Our analysis shows that the fractal dimensions which\ndescribe the tracer dispersion in the body decrease consistently with the\ndeterioration of the patient therapeutic outcome condition. In 20 out-of 24\ncases the fractal analysis results match those of the medical records, while 7\ncases are considered as special cases because the patients have non-tumour\nrelated medical conditions or side effects which affect the results. The\ndecrease in the fractal dimensions with the deterioration of the patient\nconditions (in terms of disease progression) are attributed to the hierarchical\nlocalisation of the tracer which accumulates in the affected lesions and does\nnot spread homogeneously throughout the body. Fractality emerges as a result of\nthe migration patterns which the malignant cells follow for propagating within\nthe body (circulatory system, lymphatic system). Analysis of the multifractal\nspectrum complements and supports the results of the fractal analysis. In the\nkinetic Monte Carlo modelling of the metastatic process a small number of\nmalignant cells diffuse throughout a fractal medium representing the blood\ncirculatory network. Along their way the malignant cells engender random\nmetastases (colonies) with a small probability and, as a result, fractal\nspatial distributions of the metastases are formed similar to the ones observed\nin the PET/CT images. In conclusion, we propose that fractal and multifractal\nanalysis has potential application in the quantification of the evaluation of\nPET/CT images to monitor the disease evolution as well as the response to\ndifferent medical treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 11:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

If the interference channels between the SUs and the PU are\nstatistically heterogeneous due to the different physical locations of the\ndifferent SUs, the SUs will experience different delay performances. This is\nbecause SUs located closer to the PU transmit with lower power levels. Two\ndynamic scheduling-and-power-allocation policies that can provide the required\naverage delay guarantees to all SUs irrespective of their locations are\nproposed. The first policy solves the problem when the interference constraint\nis an instantaneous one, while the second is for problems with long-term\naverage interference constraints.
