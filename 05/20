The prospects of exploiting these properties in sensing, catalysis,\nenergy storage, protective coatings and electrochromism have witnessed a\nparadigm shift towards the exploration of these sophisticated 2D materials. The\nexemplary performance of graphene (1) which is among the first of these\nelemental 2D materials have initiated a runaway effect in the pursuit of\nstudying alternative 2D materials. Even though graphene has tunable exotic\nelectronic properties (2), the spin-orbit (SO) coupling is weak (3) limiting\nits applications as spin filters, topological insulators etc. Topological\ninsulators by their very nature force the electrons to travel on the surface at\nvery high speeds thereby finding useful applications in electronic and photonic\ndevices. Exploration of group IV elements using first principles calculations\nhave revealed that the SO coupling increases as the atomic weight of the basis\natoms in the honeycomb lattice (4). Tin is one of the heaviest elements in this\nseries having strong spin-orbit coupling making it a promising applicant for\nroom temperature topological insulator. Thus there is an urgent need to\ndiscover novel 2D materials in the post graphene age to overcome its\ndeficiencies.

Rather than relying on the precise structure of\nthe codes, this method requires only that the codes are highly symmetric. In\nparticular, the technique applies to any sequence of linear codes where the\nblocklengths are strictly increasing, the code rates converge to a number\nbetween 0 and 1, and the permutation group of each code is doubly transitive.\nThis also provides a rare example in information theory where symmetry alone\nimplies near-optimal performance.\n  An important consequence of this result is that a sequence of Reed-Muller\ncodes with increasing blocklength achieves capacity if its code rate converges\nto a number between 0 and 1. This possibility has been suggested previously in\nthe literature but it has only been proven for cases where the limiting code\nrate is 0 or 1. Moreover, these results extend naturally to affine-invariant\ncodes and, thus, to all extended primitive narrow-sense BCH codes. The primary\ntools used in the proof are the sharp threshold property for monotone boolean\nfunctions and the area theorem for extrinsic information transfer functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 19:29:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 17:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

However, it\nalso means that they lack the features of (i) functional repair, and (ii)\npartial information-exchange ($\\beta<\\alpha$) in the original regenerating\ncodes (RCs), which could further reduce the repair bandwidth. Motivated by the\nsignificant bandwidth reduction of RCs over ECs, existing works by Ahmad et al\nand by Hollmann studied the concept of \"locally repairable regenerating codes\n(LRRCs)\" that successfully combine functional repair and partial information\nexchange of regenerating codes with the much-desired local repairability\nfeature of LRC. The resulting LRRCs demonstrate significant bandwidth\nreduction.\n  One important issue that needs to be addressed by any local repair schemes\n(including both LRCs and LRRCs) is that sometimes designated helper nodes may\nbe temporarily unavailable, the result of multiple failures, degraded reads, or\nother network dynamics. Under the setting of LRRCs with temporary node\nunavailability, this work studies the impact of different helper selection\nmethods. It proves that with node unavailability, all existing methods of\nhelper selection, including those used in RCs and LRCs, can be insufficient in\nterms of achieving the optimal repair-bandwidth. For some scenarios, it is\nnecessary to combine LRRCs with a new helper selection method, termed dynamic\nhelper selection, to achieve optimal repair bandwidth.

Isolated ETEC express a plethora of colonization factors\n(fimbriae/pili), of which CFA/I and CFA/II that are assembled via the alternate\nchaperone pathway (ACP), are amongst the most common. Fimbriae are filamentous\nstructures, whose shafts are primarily composed of helically arranged single\npilin-protein subunits, with a unique biomechanical capability allowing them to\nunwind and rewind. A sustained ETEC infection, under adverse conditions of\ndynamic shear forces, is primarily attributed to this biomechanical feature of\nETEC fimbriae. Recent understandings about the role of fimbriae as virulence\nfactors are pointing to an evolutionary adaptation of their structural and\nbiomechanical features. In this work, we investigated the biophysical\nproperties of CS2 fimbriae from the CFA/II group. Homology modelling its major\nstructural subunit CotA reveals structural clues and these are related to the\nniche in which they are expressed. Using optical tweezers force spectroscopy we\nfound that CS2 fimbriae unwind at a constant force of 10 pN and have a corner\nvelocity of 1300 nm/s, i.e., the velocity at which the force required for\nunwinding rises exponentially with increased speed. The biophysical properties\nof CS2 fimbriae assessed in this work classify them into a low-force unwinding\ngroup of fimbriae together with the CFA/I and CS20 fimbriae expressed by ETEC\nstrains. The three fimbriae are expressed by ETEC, colonize in similar gut\nenvironments, and exhibit similar biophysical features, but differ in their\nbiogenesis. Our observation suggests that the environment has a strong impact\non the biophysical characteristics of fimbriae expressed by ETEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 19:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

However, since dynamical locality\nis strictly weaker than local causality, this leaves open the question of\nwhether an ontological model for quantum mechanics can be both separable and\ndynamically local. We answer this question in the affirmative, using an\nontological model based on previous work by Deutsch and Hayden. Although the\noriginal formulation of the model avoids Bell's theorem by denying that\nmeasurements result in single, definite outcomes, we show that the model can\nalternatively be cast in the framework of ontological models, where Bell's\ntheorem does apply. We find that the resulting model violates local causality,\nbut satisfies both separability and dynamical locality, making it a candidate\nfor the `most local' ontological model of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 20:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

In order to\nunderstand the experimental data, we explore symmetry arguments that lead to\nthe hypothesis of minimal flavor violation. In particular, under the assumption\nof negligible neutrino mass effects in charged lepton processes, the presence\nof lepton universality violation without lepton flavor violation naturally\narises. This can account for a deficit of $B^+\\to K^+\\mu\\mu$ over $B^+\\to\nK^+ee$ decays with new physics coupled predominantly to muons and a new physics\nscale of a few TeV. A prediction of this scenario is the modification of\nprocesses involving the third generation. In particular, accounting for the\nabove ratio implies a large enhancement, by a factor $\\sim10^3$ with respect to\nthe standard model, of all the $b\\to s\\tau\\tau$ decay rates. Although these are\nstill below current experimental limits, they should be easily at reach in\nfuture experiments at $B$-factories. Another important consequence is the\nprediction of sizable effects in charge-current $B$ tauonic decays which could\nalso explain the enhancements that have been observed in the $B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\bar \\nu$ and $B^-\\to\\tau^-\\bar \\nu$ decays.

In fact, nuclear norm minimization for\nmatrix recovery is a tractable convex relaxation approach, but the extension of\nthe nuclear norm to tensors is in general NP-hard to compute. In this article,\nwe introduce convex relaxations of the tensor nuclear norm which are computable\nin polynomial time via semidefinite programming.

We map the 21cm HI line, 4 OH\nlines, 19 H_alpha recombination lines and the continuum from 1 to 2 GHz of a\nsignificant fraction of the Milky Way (l=15-67deg, |b|<1deg) at ~20\"\nresolution. In this paper, we focus on the HI emission from the W43\nstar-formation complex. Classically, the HI 21cm line is treated as optically\nthin with column densities calculated under this assumption. This might give\nreasonable results for regions of low-mass star-formation, however, it is not\nsufficient to describe GMCs. We analyzed strong continuum sources to measure\nthe optical depth, and thus correct the HI 21cm emission for optical depth\neffects and weak diffuse continuum emission. Hence, we are able to measure the\nHI mass of W43 more accurately and our analysis reveals a lower limit of\nM=6.6x10^6 M_sun, which is a factor of 2.4 larger than the mass estimated with\nthe assumption of optically thin emission. The HI column densities are as high\nas N(HI)~150 M_sun/pc^2 ~ 1.9x10^22 cm^-2, which is an order of magnitude\nhigher than for low mass star formation regions. This result challenges\ntheoretical models that predict a threshold for the HI column density of ~10\nM_sun/pc^2, at which the formation of molecular hydrogen should set in. By\nassuming an elliptical layered structure for W43, we estimate the particle\ndensity profiles. While at the cloud edge atomic and molecular hydrogen are\nwell mixed, the center of the cloud is strongly dominated by molecular\nhydrogen.

Although the latter\nresults have been used to argue in favor of a chiral $d+id$ superconducting\nstate, such an order parameter is incompatible with broken tetragonal symmetry.\nHere, we employ a phenomenological model to investigate the properties of a\nchiral superconducting state that develops inside the hidden-order phase.

Recently, interest has increased in the scaling\nproperties of the magnetic domain wall (MDW) motion in disordered media when an\nexternal driving field is present. We consider a (1+1)-dimensional model, based\non evolution rules, able to describe the MDW avalanches. The global interface\nwidth of this model shows Family-Vicsek scaling with roughness exponent\n$\\zeta\\simeq 1.585$ and growth exponent $\\beta\\simeq 0.975$. In contrast, this\nmodel shows scaling anomalies in the interface local properties characteristic\nof other systems with depinning transition of the MDW, e.g. quenched\nEdwards-Wilkinson (QEW) equation and random-field Ising model (RFIM) with\ndriving. We show that, at the depinning transition, the saturated average\nvelocity $v_\\mathrm{sat}\\sim f^\\theta$ vanished very slowly (with $\\theta\\simeq\n0.037$) when the reduced force $f=p/p_\\mathrm{c}-1\\to 0^{+}$. The simulation\nresults show that this model verifies all accepted scaling relations which\nrelate the global exponents and the correlation length (or time) exponents,\nvalid in systems with depinning transition. Using the interface tilting method,\nwe show that the model, close to the depinning transition, exhibits a\nnonlinearity similar to the one included in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nequation. The nonlinear coefficient $\\lambda\\sim f^{-\\phi}$ with $\\phi\\simeq\n-1.118$, which implies that $\\lambda\\to 0$ as the depinning transition is\napproached, a similar qualitatively behaviour to the driven RFIM.

Fusion\nof multi-source information for establishing the attributes has been widely\nrecognized. Multi-feature visual recognition has recently received much\nattention in multimedia applications. This paper studies visual understanding\nvia a newly proposed l_2-norm based multi-feature shared learning framework,\nwhich can simultaneously learn a global label matrix and multiple\nsub-classifiers with the labeled multi-feature data. Additionally, a group\ngraph manifold regularizer composed of the Laplacian and Hessian graph is\nproposed for better preserving the manifold structure of each feature, such\nthat the label prediction power is much improved through the semi-supervised\nlearning with global label consistency. For convenience, we call the proposed\napproach Global-Label-Consistent Classifier (GLCC). The merits of the proposed\nmethod include: 1) the manifold structure information of each feature is\nexploited in learning, resulting in a more faithful classification owing to the\nglobal label consistency; 2) a group graph manifold regularizer based on the\nLaplacian and Hessian regularization is constructed; 3) an efficient\nalternative optimization method is introduced as a fast solver owing to the\nconvex sub-problems. Experiments on several benchmark visual datasets for\nmultimedia understanding, such as the 17-category Oxford Flower dataset, the\nchallenging 101-category Caltech dataset, the YouTube & Consumer Videos dataset\nand the large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset, demonstrate that the proposed approach\ncompares favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

For example, digit 1 occurs\napproximately 30.1% in the first place in random numbers, while digit 9 occurs\nonly approximately 4.6%. In this article it is shown that a process where a\nlarge enough set of identical quantities constantly alternates between\nminuscule random consolidations (summing two randomly chosen values into a\nsingular value) and tiny random fragmentations (division of one randomly chosen\nvalue into two new values) converges digit-wise to the Benford proportions\nafter sufficiently many such cycles. The statistical tendency of the system\nafter numerous cycles is to have approximately 2/3 multiplicative expressions\nwhich are conducive to Benford behavior as they tend to the Lognormal\nDistribution, and 1/3 additive expressions which are detrimental to Benford\nbehavior as they tend to the Normal Distribution, hence the process represents\nin essence a tug of war between addition and multiplication. Since the process\nencounters the so-called Achilles' heel of the Central Limit Theorem, namely\nadditions of skewed distributions with high order of magnitude, additions are\nnot very effective, and the war is decisively won by multiplication, leading to\nBenford behavior. Randomness in selecting the particular quantity to be\nfragmented, as well as randomness in selecting the two particular quantities to\nbe consolidated, is essential for convergence. Not surprisingly then,\nfragmentation itself could be performed either randomly say via a realization\nfrom the continuous Uniform on (0, 1), or deterministically via any fixed split\nratio such as say 25% - 75%, and Benford's Law emerges in either case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 03:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 14:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 2019 21:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-04"}

This is necessary to avoid loops, inhibiting opportunities to\nimplement an adaptive and intelligent forwarding plane. Consequently, content\ndistribution efficiency is reduced due to a lack of inherent multi-path\ntransmission. In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a\nsupporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance\ncontent dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design,\nimplement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called\nStochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. SAF imitates a self-adjusting\nwater pipe system, intelligently guiding and distributing Interests through\nnetwork crossings circumventing link failures and bottlenecks. Just as real\npipe systems, SAF employs overpressure valves enabling congested nodes to lower\npressure autonomously. Through an implicit feedback mechanism it is ensured\nthat the fraction of the traffic forwarded via congested nodes decreases. By\nconducting simulations we show that our approach outperforms existing\nforwarding strategies in terms of the Interest satisfaction ratio in the\nmajority of the evaluated scenarios. This is achieved by extensive utilization\nof NDN's multipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the\nrouting plane. SAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that\nare likely to be dropped anyway. This enables SAF to identify new paths to the\ncontent origin or to cached replicas, circumventing link failures and resource\nshortages without relying on routing updates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 06:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 11:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 09:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 09:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

A velocity map of the line shows a gradient across the source that\nindicates large-scale rotation of star-forming gas. Together, the velocity map\nand line profile suggest the presence of a massive rotating disc with a\ndynamical mass M_dyn > 5x10^10 M_sun. Using the assumption of a rotating disc\norigin, we employ an empirical relation between galaxy disc circular velocity\nand bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) to estimate that sigma > 310 km/s,\nsubject to a correction for the unknown disc inclination.

The most popular method to obtain such data is\nprincipal component analysis, which extracts modes of large conformational\nfluctuations around an average structure. We recently applied relaxation mode\nanalysis for protein systems, which approximately estimates the slow relaxation\nmodes and times from a simulation and enables investigations of the dynamic\nproperties underlying the structural fluctuations of proteins. In this study,\nwe apply this relaxation mode analysis to extract reaction coordinates for a\nsystem in which there are large conformational changes such as those commonly\nobserved in protein folding/unfolding. We performed a 750-ns simulation of\nchignolin protein near its folding transition temperature, and observed many\ntransitions between the most stable, misfolded, intermediate, and unfolded\nstates. We then applied principal component analysis and relaxation mode\nanalysis to the system. In the relaxation mode analysis, we could automatically\nextract good reaction coordinates. The free-energy surfaces provide a clearer\nunderstanding of the transitions not only between local minimum-energy states\nbut also between the folded and unfolded states, even though the simulation\ninvolved large conformational changes.

Concepts\nsuch as solar thermo-photovoltaics (STPV) and thermo-photonics4 aim to harness\nthis dissipated heat, yet exceeding the SQ limit has not been achieved, mainly\ndue to the very high operating temperatures needed. Recently, we demonstrated\nthat in high-temperature endothermic-photoluminescence (PL), the photon rate is\nconserved with temperature increase, while each photon is blue shifted. We also\ndemonstrated how endothermic-PL generates orders of magnitude more\nenergetic-photons than thermal emission at similar temperatures. These new\nfindings show that endothermic-PL is an ideal optical heat-pump. Here, we\npropose and thermodynamically analyse a novel device based on Thermally\nEnhanced Photo Luminescence (TEPL). In such a device, solar radiation is\nharvested by a low-bandgap PL material. In addition to the PL excitation, the\notherwise lost heat raises the temperature and allows the TEPL emission to be\ncoupled to a higher bandgap solar cell. The excessive thermal energy is then\nconverted to electrical work at high voltage and enhanced efficiency. Our\nresults show that such a TEPL based device can reach theoretical maximal\nefficiencies of 70%, as high as in STPV, while the significantly lowered\noperating temperatures are below 1000C.

In this paper, we aim to derive new\nconstraints on the structure of the transition disk MWC 758, to detect\nnon-axisymmetric features and understand their origin. We obtained infrared\npolarized intensity observations of the protoplanetary disk MWC 758 with\nSPHERE/VLT at 1.04 microns to resolve scattered light at a smaller inner\nworking angle (0.093\") and a higher angular resolution (0.027\") than previously\nachieved. We observe polarized scattered light within 0.53\" (148 au) down to\nthe inner working angle (26 au) and detect distinct non-axisymmetric features\nbut no fully depleted cavity. The two small-scale spiral features that were\npreviously detected with HiCIAO are resolved more clearly, and new features are\nidentified, including two that are located at previously inaccessible radii\nclose to the star. We present a model based on the spiral density wave theory\nwith two planetary companions in circular orbits. The best model requires a\nhigh disk aspect ratio (H/r~0.20 at the planet locations) to account for the\nlarge pitch angles which implies a very warm disk. Our observations reveal the\ncomplex morphology of the disk MWC758. To understand the origin of the detected\nfeatures, the combination of high-resolution observations in the submillimeter\nwith ALMA and detailed modeling is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 11:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

A multicomponent\npower density spectrum with two break frequencies was found during both\nactivity stages. The rms-flux relation is obvious only in the quiescent data.\nHowever, while the collection of all outburst data do not show this\nvariability, every individual outburst does show it in the majority of cases\nkeeping the rms value approximately in the same interval. Furthermore, the same\nanalysis was performed for light curve subsamples taken from the beginning,\nmiddle and the end of the supercycle both for quiescence and regular outbursts.\nEvery light curve subsample shows the same multicomponent power density\nspectrum. The stability of the break frequencies over the supercycle can be\nconfirmed for all frequencies except for the high break frequency during\noutburst, which shows variability, but with rather low confidence. Finally, the\nlow break frequency can be associated with the geometrically thin disc or its\ninner edge, while the high break frequency can originate from the inner\ngeometrically thick hot disc.

The high energy tail in the electron energy distribution function\nwhich develops at higher temperatures or lower Kappa parameters, increases the\nemission currents well over the predictions of the classical expression.

The solutions show two extreme cases: close-in\ngiant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and\nEarth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of\nclose-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally\ndriven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized, but, if the orbit\nis elliptical, with a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The\nrotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose\nfrequencies are 1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2 ... times the mean-motion. The number of\nattractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital\neccentricity. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3\nof the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with\na relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped,\nbut not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one. In that case, the relaxation is\nestimated to lie in the interval 4.6 -- 27 x 10^{-9} s^{-1} (equivalent to a\nquality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5<Q<50). The stars have\nrelaxation similar to the hot Jupiters and their rotation is also driven to the\nonly stationary solution existing in these cases. However, solar-type stars may\nlose angular momentum due to stellar wind, braking the rotation and displacing\nthe attractor towards larger periods. Old active host stars with big close-in\ncompanions generally have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of\nthe companions. The paper also includes the study of the energy dissipation and\nthe evolution of the orbital eccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 13:46:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 15:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

The\nmore recent investigation of adhesives by probe-tack methods also revealed the\nimportance of cavitation and stringing mechanisms during debonding, underlining\nthe influence of large deformations and of the related non-linear response of\nthe material, which also intervenes during peeling. Although a global modelling\nof the complex coupling of all these ingredients remains a formidable issue, we\nreport here some key experiments and modelling arguments that should constitute\nan important step forward. We first measure a non-trivial dependence of the\nadherence energy on the loading geometry, namely through the influence of the\npeeling angle, which is found to be separable from the peeling velocity\ndependence. This is the first time to our knowledge that such adherence energy\ndependence on the peeling angle is systematically investigated and\nunambiguously demonstrated. Secondly, we reveal an independent strong influence\nof the large strain rheology of the adhesives on the adherence energy. We\ncomplete both measurements with a microscopic investigation of the debonding\nregion. We discuss existing modellings in light of these measurements and of\nrecent soft material mechanics arguments, to show that the adherence energy\nduring peeling of PSA should not be associated to the propagation of an\ninterfacial stress singularity. The relevant deformation mechanisms are\nactually located over the whole adhesive thickness, and the adherence energy\nduring peeling of PSA should rather be associated to the energy loss by viscous\nfriction and by rate-dependent elastic hysteresis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 14:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

The count rate, stacked over many craters, peaks over the crater\ncentre, has a minimum near the crater rim, and at larger distances, it\nincreases to a mean value that is up to 1% lower than the mean count rate\nobserved over the crater. A simple model is presented, based upon an analytical\ntopographical profile for the stacked craters fitted to data from the Lunar\nOrbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA). The effect of topography coupled with neutron\nbeaming from the surface largely reproduces the observed count rate profiles.\nHowever, a model that better fits the observations can be found by including\nthe additional freedom to increase the neutron emissivity of the crater area by\n~0.35% relative to the unperturbed surface. It is unclear what might give rise\nto this effect, but it may relate to additional surface roughness in the\nvicinities of craters.

Both in signaling networks and\ngene regulation there are two main mechanisms by which the concentration can be\nencoded internally: amplitude modulation (AM), where the absolute concentration\nof an internal signaling molecule encodes the stimulus, and frequency\nmodulation (FM), where the period between successive bursts represents the\nstimulus. Although both mechanisms have been observed in biological systems,\nthe question of when it is beneficial for cells to use either AM or FM is\nlargely unanswered. Here, we first consider a simple model for a single\nreceptor (or ion channel), which can either signal continuously whenever a\nligand is bound, or produce a burst in signaling molecule upon receptor\nbinding. We find that bursty signaling is more accurate than continuous\nsignaling only for sufficiently fast dynamics. This suggests that modulation\nbased on bursts may be more common in signaling networks than in gene\nregulation. We then extend our model to multiple receptors, where continuous\nand bursty signaling are equivalent to AM and FM respectively, finding that AM\nis always more accurate. This implies that the reason some cells use FM is\nrelated to factors other than accuracy, such as the ability to coordinate\nexpression of multiple genes or to implement threshold crossing mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 15:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

We simulate merger events between two identical dwarfs changing\nthe initial inclination of their disks with respect to the orbit and the amount\nof orbital angular momentum. On radial orbits the amount of prolate rotation in\nthe merger remnants correlates strongly with the inclination of the disks and\nis well understood as due to the conservation of the angular momentum component\nof the disks along the merger axis. For non-radial orbits prolate rotation may\nstill be produced if the orbital angular momentum is initially not much larger\nthan the intrinsic angular momentum of the disks. The orbital structure of the\nremnants with significant rotation is dominated by box orbits in the center and\nlong-axis tubes in the outer parts. The frequency analysis of stellar orbits in\nthe plane perpendicular to the major axis reveals the presence of two families\nroughly corresponding to inner and outer long-axis tubes.

However, most papers consider submodular set\nfunctions. Recently, several advances have been made for the more general case\nof submodular functions on the integer lattice. In this paper, we present a\ndeterministic $\\frac{1}{3}$-approximation for maximizing a submodular function\non a bounded integer lattice $\\{0, \\ldots, C\\}^n$ using a Double Greedy\nframework. Moreover, we show that the analysis is tight and that other ideas\nused for approximating set functions cannot easily be extended. In contrast to\nset functions, submodularity on the integer lattice does not imply the\nso-called diminishing returns property. Assuming this property, it was shown\nthat many results for set functions can also be obtained for the integer\nlattice. In this paper, we consider a further generalization. Instead of the\ninteger lattice, we consider a distributive lattice as the function domain and\nassume the diminishing returns (DR) property. On the one hand, we show that\nsome approximation algorithms match the set functions setting. In particular,\nwe can obtain a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for unconstrained maximization, a\n$(1-\\frac{1}{e})$-approximation for monotone functions under a cardinality\nconstraint and a $\\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for a poset matroid constraint.

This elusive notion has been\nnot only bothering philosophers since Plato and Aristotle. It goes throughout\nhuman history embracing all analytical and creative (anthropocentric)\ndisciplines. Time has been a central theme in physical and life sciences,\nphilosophy, psychology, music, art and many more. This theme is known with a\nvast body of knowledge across different theories and categories. What has been\nexplored concerns its nature (rational, irrational, arational),\nappearances/qualia, degrees, dimensions and scales of conceptualization\n(internal, external, fractal, discrete, continuous, mechanical, quantum, local,\nglobal, etc.). Of particular interest have been parameters of time such as\nduration ranges, resolutions, modes (present, now, past, future), varieties of\ntenses (e.g. present perfect, present progressive, etc.) and some intuitive,\nbut also fancy phenomenological characteristics such as arrow, stream, texture,\nwidth, depth, density, even scent. Perhaps the most distinct characteristic of\nthis fundamental concept is the absolute time constituting the flow of\nconsciousness according to Husserl, the reflection of pure (human) nature\nwithout having the distinction between exo and endo.

It\nhas been suggested that this architecture can confer advantages to the system\nas a whole, such as `qualitative stability', but this observation does not in\nitself explain how a loopless structure might arise. We show here that the\nnumber of feedback loops in a network, as well as the eigenvalues of associated\nmatrices, are determined by a structural property called trophic coherence, a\nmeasure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct levels. Our theory correctly\nclassifies a variety of networks -- including those derived from genes,\nmetabolites, species, neurons, words, computers and trading nations -- into two\ndistinct regimes of high and low feedback, and provides a null model to gauge\nthe significance of related magnitudes. Since trophic coherence suppresses\nfeedback, whereas an absence of feedback alone does not lead to coherence, our\nwork suggests that the reasons for `looplessness' in nature should be sought in\ncoherence-inducing mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 15:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 11:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 10:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-12"}

In this model,\nheterogeneous agents, behaving according to the Von Neumann and Morgenstern\nutility theory, may mutually interact. A Tobin-like tax (TT) on successful\ninvestments and a flat tax are compared to assess the effects on the agents'\nwealth distribution. We carry out extensive numerical simulations in two\nalternative scenarios: i) a reference scenario, where the agents keep their\nutility function fixed, and ii) a focal scenario, where the agents are adaptive\nand self-organize in communities, emulating their neighbours by updating their\nown utility function. Specifically, the interactions among the agents are\nmodelled through a directed scale-free network to account for the presence of\ncommunity leaders, and the herding-like effect is tested against the reference\nscenario. We observe that our model is capable of replicating the benefits and\ndrawbacks of the two taxation systems and that the interactions among the\nagents strongly affect the wealth distribution across the communities.\nRemarkably, the communities benefit from the presence of leaders with\nsuccessful trading strategies, and are more likely to increase their average\nwealth. Moreover, this emulation mechanism mitigates the decrease in trading\nvolumes, which is a typical drawback of TTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 13:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 16:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}
