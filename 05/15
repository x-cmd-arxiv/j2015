In the general case of\nelliptical distributions, we provide a sufficient condition for unboundedness\nof the FIM. Accurate approximations of the FIM for $K$-distributed noise are\nalso derived when it is bounded. Additionally, the maximum likelihood estimator\nof the signal DoA and an approximated version are derived, assuming known\ncovariance matrix: the latter is then estimated from secondary data using a\nconventional regularization technique. When the FIM is unbounded, an analysis\nof the estimators reveals a rate of convergence much faster than the usual\n$T^{-1}$. Simulations illustrate the different behaviors of the estimators,\ndepending on the FIM being bounded or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 16:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

We consider a two-band model,\nsince most of these correlated systems have electrons from at least two\ndifferent atomic orbitals coexisting at their Fermi surface. The Coulomb\nrepulsion is taken into account through a local repulsive interaction. Pairing\nis considered among quasi- particles in neighbouring sites and we allow for\ndifferent symmetries of the order parameter. In order to deal with the strong\nlocal correlations, we use the well known slave boson approach that has proved\nvery successful for this problem.

While sensitivity analyses in\nmatched observational studies have been well addressed when there is a single\noutcome variable, accounting for multiple comparisons through the existing\nmethods yields overly conservative results when there are multiple outcome\nvariables of interest. This stems from the fact that unmeasured confounding\ncannot affect the probability of assignment to treatment differently depending\non the outcome being analyzed. Existing methods allow this to occur by\ncombining the results of individual sensitivity analyses to assess whether at\nleast one hypothesis is significant, which in turn results in an overly\npessimistic assessment of a study's sensitivity to unobserved biases. By\nsolving a quadratically constrained linear program, we are able to perform a\nsensitivity analysis while enforcing that unmeasured confounding must have the\nsame impact on the treatment assignment probabilities across outcomes for each\nindividual in the study.

It is of\nparticular interest, to locate the basins of escape towards the different\nescape channels and connect them with the corresponding escape periods of the\norbits. We split our examination into three different cases depending on the\nfunction of the perturbation term which determines the number of escape\nchannels on the physical space. In every case, we computed extensive samples of\norbits in both the physical and the phase space by integrating numerically the\nequations of motion as well as the variational equations. In an attempt to\ndetermine the regular or chaotic nature of trapped motion, we applied the SALI\nmethod as a chaos detector. It was found, that in all studied cases regions of\ntrapped orbits coexist with several basins of escape. It was also observed,\nthat for energy levels very close to the escape value the escape times of\norbits are large, while for values of energy much higher than the escape energy\nthe vast majority of orbits escape very quickly or even immediately to\ninfinity. The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial\nconditions in the boundaries of the escape basins and also in the vicinity of\nthe fractal structure. Most of the current outcomes have been compared with\nprevious related work. We hope that our results will be useful for a further\nunderstanding of the escape mechanism of orbits in open Hamiltonian systems\nwith two degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 19:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

In this paper we obtain a broad generalization of the\nMorse-Hedlund theorem via group actions.

First, we study how individual spending behavior is qualitatively\nand quantitatively affected by various factors such as customer's age, gender,\nand size of a home city. We show that, similar to other socioeconomic urban\nquantities, individual spending activity exhibits a statistically significant\nsuperlinear scaling with city size. With respect to the general trends, we\nquantify the distinctive signature of each city in terms of residents' spending\nbehavior, independently from the effects of scale and demographic\nheterogeneity.

Furthermore, it\nappears to be related with the ability of cities to attract foreign visitors,\nwhich is a particularly remarkable finding given that the classification was\nbased exclusively on the behavioral patterns of city residents.

Topological (Chern) insulators are known to have a quantized Hall\nconductance. A natural question is how the Hall viscosity behaves for these\nmaterials. So far, most of studies on the Hall viscosity of Chern insulators\nhave focused on the continuum limit. The presence of lattice breaks the\ncontinuous translational symmetry to a discrete group and this causes two\ncomplications: it introduces a new length scale associated with the lattice\nconstant, and makes the momentum periodic.

However, not all ejections of components are associated\nwith gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi. Clear gamma-ray detections are\nobtained only when components are moving in a direction closer to our line of\nsight.This suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission depends not only on\nthe interaction of moving components with the mm-VLBI core, but also on their\norientation with respect to the observer. Timing of the gamma-ray detections\nand ejection of superluminal components locate the gamma-ray production to\nwithin almost 0.13 pc from the mm-VLBI core, which was previously estimated to\nlie about 0.24 pc from the central black hole. This corresponds to about twice\nthe estimated extension of the broad line region, limiting the external photon\nfield and therefore suggesting synchrotron self Compton as the most probable\nmechanism for the production of the gamma-ray emission.

It provides automatic\nconstructions of closed-form quadratic bounds or utilization bounds for a wide\nrange of applications in real-time systems under fixed-priority scheduling. The\nkey of the framework is a $k$-point schedulability test or a $k$-point response\ntime analysis that is based on the utilizations and the execution times of\n$k-1$ higher-priority tasks. The natural condition of k2Q is a quadratic form\nfor testing the schedulability or analyzing the response time. The response\ntime analysis and the schedulability analysis provided by the framework can be\nviewed as a \"blackbox\" interface that can result in sufficient\nutilization-based analysis. Since the framework is independent from the task\nand platform models, it can be applied to a wide range of applications.\n  We show the generality of k2Q by applying it to several different task\nmodels. k2Q produces better uniprocessor and/or multiprocessor schedulability\ntests not only for the traditional sporadic task model, but also more\nexpressive task models such as the generalized multi-frame task model and the\nacyclic task model. Another interesting contribution is that in the past,\nexponential-time schedulability tests were typically not recommended and most\nof time ignored due to high complexity.

As a\nsurviving strategy, Misrepair mechanism plays also an important role in\nindividual adaptation, species survival, and species differentiation. Firstly,\nMisrepair of an injury is one of the manners of individual adaptation; and\nMisrepair mechanism gives an organism a great potential in adapting to\nchangeable and destructive environment. Secondly, Misrepair mechanism is\nimportant in maintaining and enlarging the diversity of genome DNAs of a\nspecies; and a large diversity of genome DNAs is essential for the adaptation\nand the differentiation of a species in different environments.

The development time\nof an organism depends on its structural complexity. The maintenance time is\nrelated to two factors: the degree of damage-exposure and the potential of\nfunctionality for structure-maintenance.

Since both of development time and maintenance\ntime are determined by structural complexity, the potential of longevity of an\norganism is hidden in structural complexity. III.

Although a vacuum formulation is sufficient in many astrophysical\ncontexts, there are applications such as the role of the self-force in\nenforcing cosmic-censorship in the context of the overcharging problem, which\nnecessitate an extension into the non-vacuum regime. The defining feature of\nthe self-force problem in non-vacuum spacetimes is the coupling between\ngravitational and non-gravitational field perturbations. The formulation of the\nself-force problem for non-vacuum spacetimes was recently provided in\nsimultaneous papers by Zimmerman and Poisson [1] and Linz, Friedmann, Wiseman\n[2]. Here we distinguish ourselves by working with the effective action rather\nthan the field equations. The formalism utilizes the multi-index notation\ndeveloped by Zimmerman and Poisson [1] to accommodate the coupling between the\ndifferent fields. Using dimensional regularization, we arrive at a finite\nexpression for the local self-force expressed in terms of multi-index\nquantities evaluated in the background spacetime. We then apply the formalism\nto compute the coupled gravitational self-force in two explicit cases. First,\nwe calculate the self-force on a massive particle possessing scalar charge and\nmoving in an scalarvac spacetime. We then derive an expression for the\nself-force on an electrically charged, massive particle moving in an electrovac\nspacetime.

The LRISp\nspectropolarimeter is capable of achieving these SNRs on faint targets with the\n10m aperture of the Keck telescope, provided several instrumental artifacts can\nbe suppressed. We describe here several methods to overcome instrumental error\nsources that are required to achieve these high SNRs on LRISp. We explore high\nSNR techniques such as defocusing and slit-stepping during integration with\nhigh spectral and spatial oversampling. We find that the instrument flexure and\ninterference fringes introduced by the achromatic retarders create artificial\nsignals at 0.5\\% levels in the red channel which mimic real stellar signals and\nlimit the sensitivity and calibration stability of LRISp. Careful spectral\nextraction and data filtering algorithms can remove these error sources. For\nfaint targets and long exposures, cosmic ray hits are frequent and present a\nmajor limitation to the upgraded deep depletion red-channel CCD. These must be\ncorrected to the same high SNR levels, requiring careful spectral extraction\nusing iterative filtering algorithms. We demonstrate here characterization of\nthese sources of instrumental polarization artifacts and present several\nmethods used to successfully overcome these limitations. We have measured the\nlinear to circular cross-talk and find it to be roughly 5\\%, consistent with\nthe known instrument limitations. We show spectropolarimetric signals on brown\ndwarfs are clearly detectable at 0.2\\% amplitudes with sensitivities better\nthan 0.05\\% at full spectral sampling in atomic and molecular bands. Future\nLRISp users can perform high sensitivity observations with high quality\ncalibration when following the described algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 23:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Both versions of the problem have tight approximation factors on worst\ncase instances. Therefore to improve on these ratios, one must go beyond the\nworst case.\n  In this work, we take this approach and provide strong positive results both\nfor the asymmetric and symmetric $k$-center problems under a natural input\nstability (promise) condition called $\\alpha$-perturbation resilience [Bilu and\nLinia 2012], which states that the optimal solution does not change under any\nalpha-factor perturbation to the input distances. We provide algorithms that\ngive strong guarantees simultaneously for stable and non-stable instances: our\nalgorithms always inherit the worst-case guarantees of clustering approximation\nalgorithms, and output the optimal solution if the input is $2$-perturbation\nresilient. Furthermore, we prove our result is tight by showing symmetric\n$k$-center under $(2-\\epsilon)$-perturbation resilience is hard unless $NP=RP$.\n  The impact of our results are multifaceted. This is the first tight result\nfor any problem under perturbation resilience. Furthermore, our results\nillustrate a surprising relationship between symmetric and asymmetric\n$k$-center instances under perturbation resilience. Unlike approximation ratio,\nfor which symmetric $k$-center is easily solved to a factor of 2 but asymmetric\n$k$-center cannot be approximated to any constant factor, both symmetric and\nasymmetric $k$-center can be solved optimally under resilience to\n2-perturbations.

In recent times, effective formal synthesis\nmethods have been proposed based on the use of inductive learning. We refer to\nthis class of methods that learn programs from examples as formal inductive\nsynthesis. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for formal\ninductive synthesis. We discuss how formal inductive synthesis differs from\ntraditional machine learning. We then describe oracle-guided inductive\nsynthesis (OGIS), a framework that captures a family of synthesizers that\noperate by iteratively querying an oracle. An instance of OGIS that has had\nmuch practical impact is counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS). We\npresent a theoretical characterization of CEGIS for learning any program that\ncomputes a recursive language. In particular, we analyze the relative power of\nCEGIS variants where the types of counterexamples generated by the oracle\nvaries. We also consider the impact of bounded versus unbounded memory\navailable to the learning algorithm. In the special case where the universe of\ncandidate programs is finite, we relate the speed of convergence to the notion\nof teaching dimension studied in machine learning theory. Altogether, the\nresults of the paper take a first step towards a theoretical foundation for the\nemerging field of formal inductive synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 03:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 14:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 01:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 07:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

In particular, we examine the impact of time-dependent\nmass accretion of repeating burst and quiescent phases that are expected to\noccur with a self-gravitating circumstellar disk. We show that the stellar\nevolution with such episodic accretion differs qualitatively from that expected\nwith a constant accretion rate, even if the mean accretion rate is the same.\nUnlike the case of constant mass accretion, whereby the star expands roughly\nfollowing $R_* \\simeq 2.6 \\times 10^3 R_\\odot (M_*/100~M_\\odot)^{1/2}$, the\nprotostar can substantially contract during the quiescent phases between\naccretion bursts. The stellar effective temperature and ionizing photon\nemissivity increase accordingly as the star contracts, which can cause strong\nionizing feedback and halt the mass accretion onto the star. With a fixed\nduration of the quiescent phase $\\Delta t_{\\rm q}$, such contraction occurs in\nearly evolutionary phases, i.e. for $M_* \\lesssim 10^3~M_\\odot$ with $\\Delta\nt_{\\rm q} \\simeq 10^3$ yr.

We show\nthat such behavior is well understood by comparing the interval time and the\nthermal relaxation time for a bloated surface layer. We conclude that the UV\nradiative feedback becomes effective if the quiescent phase associated by the\nburst accretion is longer than $\\sim 10^3$ yr, which is possible in an\naccretion disk forming in the direct collapse model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 03:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

We address this issue for two operators' spectrum sharing in\nthe same geographical area.\n  We model and analyze interactions between the competitive operators\ncoexisting in the same frequency band as a strategic noncooperative game, where\nthe operators simultaneously share the spectrum dynamically as per their\nrelative requirement. If resources are allocated in a conventional way (static\northogonal allocation), spectrum utilization becomes inefficient when there is\nload asymmetry between the operators and low inter-operator interference.\n  Theoretically, operators can share resources in a cooperative manner, but\npragmatically they are reluctant to reveal their network information to\ncompetitors. By using game theory, we design a distributed implementation, in\nwhich self-interested operators play strategies and contend for the spectrum\nresources in a noncooperative manner.

However, these defects appear to play distinct roles in\ndriving the quantum and thermal \"melting.\" Our study will help comprehending\nmelting in a variety of experimental traps - from quantum dots to complex\nplasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 12:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

These fundamental strategies are important benchmarks for\nlarge-scale applications. Our comparison includes annualized portfolio returns,\nmaximal drawdowns, transaction costs, portfolio concentration, and asset\ndiversity in the portfolio.

We derived\nSpT and Av for all the targets, and then we determined their physical\nparameters. All the objects but one have M*<0.6 Msun, and 8 have mass below or\nclose to the hydrogen-burning limit. Using the intensity of various emission\nlines present in their spectra, we determined the Lacc and Macc for all the\nobjects. When compared with previous works targeting the same sample, we find\nthat, in general, these objects are not as strongly accreting as previously\nreported, and we suggest that the reason is our more accurate estimate of the\nphotospheric parameters. We also compare our findings with recent works in\nother slightly older star-forming regions to investigate possible differences\nin the accretion properties, but we find that the accretion properties for our\ntargets have the same dependence on the stellar and substellar parameters as in\nthe other regions. This leads us to conclude that we do not find evidence for a\ndifferent dependence of Macc with M* when comparing low-mass stars and BDs.\nMoreover, we find a similar small (1 dex) scatter in the Macc-M* relation as in\nsome of our recent works in other star-forming regions, and no significant\ndifferences in Macc due to different ages or properties of the regions. The\nlatter result suffers, however, from low statistics and sample selection biases\nin the current studies. The small scatter in the Macc-M* correlation confirms\nthat Macc in the literature based on uncertain photospheric parameters and\nsingle accretion indicators, such as the Ha width, can lead to a scatter that\nis unphysically large. Our studies show that only broadband spectroscopic\nsurveys coupled with a detailed analysis of the photospheric and accretion\nproperties allows us to properly study the evolution of disk accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 12:26:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Contribution of\nshocks due to the radio jet is observed at locations co-spatial with the radio\nhotspots at 0.5\" northeast and 0.6\" southwest of the nucleus, as evidenced by\nthe emission-line ratio and gas kinematics. The stellar kinematics shows\nrotation with an amplitude at 250pc from the nucleus of 200 km/s after\ncorrected for the inferred inclination of 18.3deg. The stellar velocity\ndispersion obtained from the integrated K-band spectrum is sigma*=133+/-8 km/s,\nwhich implying on a mass for the supermassive black hole of M=5.2E7 Msun, using\nthe M-sigma* relation. The gas kinematics present three components: (1) gas in\nthe plane of the galaxy in counter-rotation relative to the stars; (2) an\noutflow perpendicular to the radio jet that seems to be due to an equatorial\nAGN outflow; (3) turbulence of the gas observed in association with the radio\nhot spots, supporting an interaction of the radio jet with the gas of the disk.\nWe estimated the mass of ionized and warm molecular gas of ~1.3E6 Msun and ~470\nMsun, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 13:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

However, detailed\ninvestigation shows that they are not constant, and their variations are not\nrandom but have very strong diagnostic potential for our understanding of\nstellar structure and evolution. In this regard, frequencies of the minimum\nlarge separation are very useful tools. From these frequencies, in addition to\nthe large separation and frequency of maximum amplitude, Y\\i ld\\i z et al.\nrecently have developed new methods to find almost all the fundamental stellar\nproperties. In the present study, we aim to find metallicity and helium\nabundances from the frequencies, and generalize the relations given by Y\\i ld\\i\nz et al. for a wider stellar mass range and arbitrary metallicity ($Z$) and\nhelium abundance ($Y$). We show that the effect of metallicity is {\nsignificant} for most of the fundamental parameters. For stellar mass, for\nexample, the expression must be multiplied by $(Z/Z_{\\sun})^{0.12}$. For\narbitrary helium abundance, $ M \\propto (Y/Y_{\\sun})^{0.25} $. Methods for\ndetermination of $Z$ and $Y$ from pure asteroseismic quantities are based on\namplitudes (differences between maximum and minimum values of \\Dnu) in the\noscillatory component in the spacing of oscillation frequencies. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that the difference between the first maximum and the second\nminimum is very sensitive to $Z$. It also depends on $\\nu_{\\rm min1}/\\nu_{\\rm\nmax}$ and small separation between the frequencies. Such a dependence leads us\nto develop a method to find $Z$ (and $Y$) from oscillation frequencies. The\nmaximum difference between the estimated and model $Z$ values is about 14 per\ncent.

One of the appealing features of DPC is that: it is safe in the sense\nthat the detected inactive features are guaranteed to have zero coefficients in\nthe solution vectors across all tasks. Thus, by removing the inactive features\nfrom the training phase, we may have substantial savings in the computational\ncost and memory usage without sacrificing accuracy. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first screening rule that is applicable to sparse models\nwith multiple data matrices. A key challenge in deriving DPC is to solve a\nnonconvex problem.

Moreover, DPC has\nvery low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. We\nhave evaluated the proposed DPC rule on both synthetic and real data sets.

We derive the plasma\nelectron temperatures using the line-to-continuum ratios and use them as\nproxies for the nebular [O/H] abundances, because in thermal equilibrium the\nabundance of the coolants (O, N, and other heavy elements) in the ionized gas\nsets the electron temperature, with high abundances producing low temperatures.\nCombining these data with our previous work produces a sample of 90 HII regions\nwith high quality electron temperature determinations. We derive kinematic\ndistances in a self-consistent way for the entire sample. The radial gradient\nin [O/H] is -0.082 +/- 0.014 dex/kpc for Az = 90-130 degree, about a factor of\ntwo higher than the average value between Az = 0-60 degree. Monte Carlo\nsimulations show that the azimuthal structure we reported for Az = 0-60 degree\nis not significant because kinematic distance uncertainties can be as high as\n50% in this region. Nonetheless, the flatter radial gradients between Az = 0-60\ndegree compared with Az = 90-130 degree, are significant within the\nuncertainty. We suggest that this may be due to radial mixing from the Galactic\nBar whose major axis is aligned toward Az ~30 degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 15:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

As a\nconsequence, properness of quaternion random variables should be defined with\nrespect to the most general isometries in $4D$, i.e. rotations from $SO(4)$.\nBased on this idea, we propose a new definition of properness, namely the\n$(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)$-properness, for quaternion random variables using invariance\nproperty under the action of the rotation group $SO(4)$. This new definition\ngeneralizes previously introduced properness concepts for quaternion random\nvariables. A second order study is conducted and symmetry properties of the\ncovariance matrix of $(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)$-proper quaternion random variables are\npresented. Comparisons with previous definitions are given and simulations\nillustrate in a geometric manner the newly introduced concept.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 00:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 15:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

One expects\nthat a tandem cell design with these cells connected in series will improve the\nefficiency further. Using a self-consistent numerical modeling of optical and\ntransport characteristics, however, we find that a traditional series connected\ntandem design suffers from low Jsc due to band-gap mismatch and current\nmatching constraints. It requires careful thickness optimization of Perovskite\nto achieve any noticeable efficiency gain. Specifically, a traditional tandem\ncell with state-of-the-art HIT (24%) and Perovskite (20%) sub-cells provides\nonly a modest tandem efficiency of ~25%. Instead, we demonstrate that a\nbifacial HIT/Perovskite tandem design decouples the optoelectronic constraints\nand provides an innovative path for extraordinary efficiencies. In the bifacial\nconfiguration, the same state-of the-art sub-cells achieve a normalized output\nof 33%, exceeding the bifacial HIT performance at practical albedo reflections.\nUnlike the traditional design, this bifacial design is relatively insensitive\nto Perovskite thickness variations, which may translate to simpler manufacture\nand higher yield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 00:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

Treating a stock market as a self-organized system governed by a fast\npurchase process and slow variations of demand and supply the model suggests\nthat the short term price distribution has the form a logistic (Laplace)\ndistribution. The long term return can be described by Laplace-Gaussian mixture\ndistributions. The long term mean price evolution is governed by a Walrus\nequation, which can be transformed into a replicator equation. This allows\nquantifying the evolutionary price competition between stocks. The theory\nsuggests that stock prices scaled by the price over all stocks can be used to\ninvestigate long-term trends in a Fisher-Pry plot. The price competition that\nfollows from the model is illustrated by examining the empirical long-term\nprice trends of two stocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 09:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}
