An Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN) with conjugate-gradient learning algorithm has been used\nto model the sand fraction. The available sand fraction data from the high\nresolution well logs has far more information content than the low resolution\nseismic attributes. Therefore, regularization schemes based on Fourier\nTransform (FT), Wavelet Decomposition (WD) and Empirical Mode Decomposition\n(EMD) have been proposed to shape the high resolution sand fraction data for\neffective machine learning. The input data sets have been segregated into\ntraining, testing and validation sets. The test results are primarily used to\ncheck different network structures and activation function performances. Once\nthe network passes the testing phase with an acceptable performance in terms of\nthe selected evaluators, the validation phase follows. In the validation stage,\nthe prediction model is tested against unseen data. The network yielding\nsatisfactory performance in the validation stage is used to predict\nlithological properties from seismic attributes throughout a given volume.\nFinally, a post-processing scheme using 3-D spatial filtering is implemented\nfor smoothing the sand fraction in the volume.

Recent experimental studies on a hole-doped version of BEDT\ncompounds reveal an enhancement of superconductivity and a rapid crossover\nbetween two different conducting phases above the superconducting dome. One of\nthese phases is a Fermi liquid, the other not. Using plaquette cellular\ndynamical mean field theory with state of the art continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations, we study this problem with the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel on the anisotropic triangular lattice. Phase diagrams as a function of\ntemperature $T$ and interaction strength $U/t$ are obtained for anisotropy\nparameters $t'=0.4t$, $t'=0.8t$ and various fillings. As for cuprates, we find,\nat finite doping, a first-order transition between two normal-state phases. For\n$T$ above the critical point of the first-order transition, there is a Widom\nline where crossovers occur. The results are in broad agreement with\nexperiment. This suggests that for compounds with intermediate to high\nfrustration, very light-doping should reveal the first-order transition and\nassociated crossovers. These crossovers could leave traces in the\nsuperconducting phase. We also predict that destroying the superconducting\nphase by a magnetic field should reveal the first-order transition.

To address these biases, ensemble forecasts are\npost-processed using statistical recalibration frameworks.

A common choice is the Normal distribution with mean and variance\nspecified by linear functions of the ensemble mean and variance. The parameters\nof the recalibration framework are estimated from historical archives of\nforecasts and verifying observations. Often there are relatively few forecasts\nand observations available for parameter estimation, and so the fitted\nparameters are also subject to uncertainty.

We cover 100 Myr of the evolution of modeled clusters and\nshow that the expulsion of residual gas from initially mass-segregated clusters\nleads to a significantly shallower slope of the stellar MF in the low- ($m\\leq\n0.50 M_\\odot$) and intermediate-mass ($\\simeq 0.50-0.85 M_\\odot$) regime.\nTherefore, the imprint of residual gas expulsion and primordial mass\nsegregation might be visible in the present-day MF.

The model easily produces\nsteady-state wind solutions for a range of mass-loading factors, energy-loading\nfactors, galaxy mass and galaxy radius. We find that, with radiative losses\nincluded, highly mass-loaded winds must be driven at high central temperatures,\nwhereas low mass-loaded winds can be driven at low temperatures just above the\npeak of the cooling curve, meaning radiative losses can drastically affect the\nwind solution even for low mass-loading factors. By including radiative losses,\nwe are able to show that subsonic flows can be ignored as a possible mechanism\nfor expelling mass and energy from a galaxy compared to the more efficient\ntransonic solutions.

It renders\nT-duality on a torus manifest by adding $D$ winding coordinates in addition to\nthe $D$ space time coordinates. An essential consistency constraint of the\ntheory, the strong constraint, only allows for field configurations which\ndepend on half of the coordinates of the arising doubled space. I derive\nDFT${}_\\mathrm{WZW}$, a generalization of the current formalism. It captures\nthe low energy dynamics of a closed bosonic string propagating on a compact\ngroup manifold. Its classical action and the corresponding gauge\ntransformations arise from Closed String Field Theory up to cubic order in the\nmassless fields. These results are rewritten in terms of a generalized metric\nand extended to all orders in the fields. There is an explicit distinction\nbetween background and fluctuations. For the gauge algebra to close, the latter\nhave to fulfill a modified strong constraint, while for the former the weaker\nclosure constraint is sufficient. Besides the generalized diffeomorphism\ninvariance known from the original formulation, DFT${}_\\mathrm{WZW}$ is\ninvariant under standard diffeomorphisms of the doubled space. They are broken\nby imposing the totally optional extended strong constraint. In doing so, the\noriginal formulation is restored. A flux formulation for the new theory is\nderived and its connection to generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications is\ndiscussed. Further, a possible tree-level uplift of a genuinely non-geometric\nbackground (not T-dual to any geometric configuration) is presented. Finally, a\nlong standing problem, the missing of a prescription to construct the twist in\ngeneralized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, is solved. Altogether, a more\ngeneral picture of DFT and the structures it is based on emerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 20:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

The Stan Math Library is a C++,\nreverse-mode automatic differentiation library designed to be usable, extensive\nand extensible, efficient, scalable, stable, portable, and redistributable in\norder to facilitate the construction and utilization of such algorithms.\n  Usability is achieved through a simple direct interface and a cleanly\nabstracted functional interface. The extensive built-in library includes\nfunctions for matrix operations, linear algebra, differential equation solving,\nand most common probability functions. Extensibility derives from a\nstraightforward object-oriented framework for expressions, allowing users to\neasily create custom functions. Efficiency is achieved through a combination of\ncustom memory management, subexpression caching, traits-based metaprogramming,\nand expression templates. Partial derivatives for compound functions are\nevaluated lazily for improved scalability. Stability is achieved by taking care\nwith arithmetic precision in algebraic expressions and providing stable,\ncompound functions where possible.

One of these options is deciding\nwhether or not the dependence between observations depends on direction, or, in\nother words, whether or not the spatial covariance function is isotropic.\nIsotropy implies that spatial dependence is a function of only the distance and\nnot the direction of the spatial separation between sampling locations. A\nresearcher may use graphical techniques, such as directional sample\nsemivariograms, to determine whether an assumption of isotropy holds.

In order to escape these issues, a hypothesis test of\nthe assumption of isotropy may be more desirable.

We determine steady-state motor\ndensity profiles for fixed-length overlaps using exact and approximate\nsolutions of the continuum differential equations and compare to kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations. Overlap motor density profiles and motor trajectories\nresemble experimental measurements. The phase diagram of the model is similar\nto the single-filament case for low switching rate, while for high switching\nrate we find a new low density-high density-low density-high density phase. The\noverlap center region, far from the overlap ends, has a constant motor density\nas one would naively expect. However, rather than following a simple binding\nequilibrium, the center motor density depends on total overlap length, motor\nspeed, and motor switching rate. The size of the crowded boundary layer near\nthe overlap ends is also dependent on the overlap length and switching rate in\naddition to the motor speed and bulk concentration. The antiparallel\nmicrotubule overlap geometry may offer a previously unrecognized mechanism for\nbiological regulation of protein concentration and consequent activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 03:05:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 23:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 23:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Whenever this condition is\nviolated, new physical effects become important such as radial energy advection\nand mass loss from the disc. These effects are important, for instance, for\nlarge mass accretion rates when the disc approaches its local Eddington limit.\nIn this work, we study the upper limits for standard accretion disc\napproximation and find the corrections to the standard model that should be\nconsidered in any model aiming on reproducing the transition to super-Eddington\naccretion regime. First, we find that for thin accretion disc, taking into\naccount relativistic corrections allows to increase the local Eddington limit\nby about a factor of two due to stronger gravity in General Relativity (GR).\nHowever, violation of the local Eddington limit also means large disc\nthickness. To consider consequently the disc thickness effects, one should make\nassumptions upon the two-dimensional rotation law of the disc. For rotation\nfrequency constant on cylinders $r\\sin\\theta=const$, vertical gravity becomes\nstronger with height on spheres of constant radius. On the other hand, effects\nof radial flux advection increase the flux density in the inner parts of the\ndisc and lower the Eddington limit. In general, the effects connected to disc\nthickness tend to increase the local Eddington limit even more. The efficiency\nof accretion is however decreased by advection effects by about a factor of\nseveral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Beyond 106 there is\nso far no statistical evidence available because the number of survivors is too\nsmall even in the largest nations. However assuming that Gompertz's law\ncontinues to hold beyond 106, we conclude that the mortality rate becomes equal\nto 1 at age 120 (meaning that there are 1,000 deaths in a population of one\nthousand). In other words, the upper bound of human life is near 120. The\nexistence of this fixed-point has interesting implications. It allows us to\npredict the form of the relationship between death rates at age 35 and the\ndoubling time of Gompertz's law. In order to test this prediction, we first\ncarry out a transversal analysis for a sample of countries comprising both\nindustrialized and developing nations.

The usual attempts to resolve this conflict\nfor instance by appealing to decoherence or eigenstate thermalization are\nriddled with problems. This paper considers theoretical physics of thermalized\nsystems as it is done in practise and shows that all approaches to thermalized\nsystems presuppose in some form limits to linear superposition and\ndeterministic time evolution. These considerations include, among others, the\nclassical limit, extensivity, the concepts of entropy and equilibrium, and\nsymmetry breaking in phase transitions and quantum measurement. As a\nconclusion, the paper argues that the irreversibility and stochasticity of\nstatistical mechanics should be taken as a true property of nature. It follows\nthat a gas of a macroscopic number $N$ of atoms in thermal equilibrium is best\nrepresented by a collection of $N$ wave packets of a size of the order of the\nthermal de Broglie wave length, which behave quantum mechanically below this\nscale but classically sufficiently far beyond this scale.

If the RFD is included, this state could become phase\nseparated and consist of short range PDW stripes, in which two PDW components\ncoexist but differ in magnitudes, resulting in charge density waves (CDW) and a\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking order, in the form of loop current, as\nsecondary composite orders. We call this phase-separated pair nematic (PSPN)\nstate, which could be responsible for the pseudogap. Using a phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we found that in this\nstate, RFD induces short range static CDW with phase-separated patterns in the\ndirectional components and the static CDW is destroyed by thermal phase\nfluctuations at a crossover temperature $T_{CO}<T^{*}$, above which the CDW\nbecomes dynamically fluctuating.

Their verification requires the measurement of the\ntotal work (or entropy production) performed on a system. Nevertheless in many\ncases only a partial measurement of the work is possible. Here we consider FRs\nin dual-trap optical tweezers where two different forces (one per trap) are\nmeasured. With this setup we perform pulling experiments on single molecules by\nmoving one trap relative to the other. We demonstrate that work should be\nmeasured using the force exerted by the trap that is moved. The force that is\nmeasured in the trap at rest fails to provide the full dissipation in the\nsystem leading to a (incorrect) work definition that does not satisfy the FR.\nThe implications to single-molecule experiments and free energy measurements\nare discussed. In the case of symmetric setups a new work definition, based on\ndifferential force measurements, is introduced. This definition is best suited\nto measure free energies as it shows faster convergence of estimators. We\ndiscuss measurements using the (incorrect) work definition as an example of\npartial work measurement. We show how to infer the full work distribution from\nthe partial one via the FR. The inference process does also yield quantitative\ninformation, e.g. the hydrodynamic drag on the dumbbell. Results are also\nobtained for asymmetric dual-trap setups.

More precisely, the considered cost function results from a\nlinear combination of two parts: a cost with memory and a memoryless cost. In\nthis paper, the first component is identified to be the transformer ageing\nwhile the second one corresponds to distribution Joule losses. First, we\nformulate the problem as a non-trivial discrete-time optimal control problem\nwith finite time horizon. It is non-trivial because of the presence of\nsaturation constraints and a non-quadratic cost. It turns out that the system\nstate, which is the transformer hot-spot (HS) temperature here, can be\nexpressed as a function of the sequence of control variables; the cost function\nis then seen to be convex in the control for typical values for the model\nparameters. The problem of interest thus becomes a standard optimization\nproblem. While the corresponding problem can be solved by using available\nnumerical routines, three distributed charging policies are provided. The\nmotivation is threefold: to decrease the computational complexity; to model the\nimportant scenario where the charging profile is chosen by the EV itself; to\ncircumvent the allocation problem which arises with the proposed formulation.\nRemarkably, the performance loss induced by decentralization is verified to be\nsmall through simulations. Numerical results show the importance of the choice\nof the charging policies. For instance, the gain in terms of transformer\nlifetime can be very significant when implementing advanced charging policies\ninstead of plug-and-charge policies. The impact of the accuracy of the non-EV\ndemand forecasting is equally assessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 12:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

Although the list decodability of random\nrank-metric codes and limits to list decodability have been completely\ndetermined, little work on efficient list decoding rank-metric codes has been\ndone. The only known efficient list decoding of rank-metric codes $\\mC$ gives\ndecoding radius up to the Singleton bound $1-R-\\Ge$ with positive rate $R$ when\n$\\rho(\\mC)$ is extremely small, i.e., $\\Theta(\\Ge^2)$ , where $\\rho(\\mC)$\ndenotes the ratio of the number of rows over the number of columns of $\\mC$\n\\cite[STOC2013]{Guru2013}.

In this case, device-to-device (D2D) communications in\nmmWave bands should be fully exploited due to no interference with the\nmacrocell networks and higher achievable transmission rates. In addition, due\nto less interference by directional transmission, multiple links including D2D\nlinks can be scheduled for concurrent transmissions (spatial reuse). With the\npopularity of content-based mobile applications, popular content downloading in\nthe small cells needs to be optimized to improve network performance and\nenhance user experience. In this paper, we develop an efficient scheduling\nscheme for popular content downloading in mmWave small cells, termed PCDS\n(popular content downloading scheduling), where both D2D communications in\nclose proximity and concurrent transmissions are exploited to improve\ntransmission efficiency. In PCDS, a transmission path selection algorithm is\ndesigned to establish multi-hop transmission paths for users, aiming at better\nutilization of D2D communications and concurrent transmissions. After\ntransmission path selection, a concurrent transmission scheduling algorithm is\ndesigned to maximize the spatial reuse gain. Through extensive simulations\nunder various traffic patterns, we demonstrate PCDS achieves near-optimal\nperformance in terms of delay and throughput, and also superior performance\ncompared with other existing protocols, especially under heavy load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 12:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

In this work, an aggregator is seen as an entity (a coalition) which\nis able to manage jointly the energy demand of a large group of consumers or\nusers. More precisely, the demand consists in charging an electrical vehicle\n(EV) battery. The way the EVs user charge their batteries matters since it\nstrongly impacts the network, especially the distribution network costs (e.g.,\nin terms of Joule losses or transformer ageing). Since the charging policy is\nchosen by the users or the aggregators, the charging problem is naturally\ndistributed. It turns out that one of the tools suited to tackle this\nheterogenous scenario has been introduced only recently namely, through the\nnotion of composite games. This paper exploits for the first time in the\nliterature of smart grids the notion of composite game and equilibrium. By\nassuming a rectangular charging profile for an EV, a composite equilibrium\nanalysis is conducted, followed by a detailed analysis of a case study which\nassumes three possible charging periods or time-slots. Both the provided\nanalytical and numerical results allow one to better understand the\nrelationship between the size (which is a measure) of the coalition and the\nnetwork sum-cost.

We describe a public parallel numerical algorithm\nconsisting in representing the phase-space sheet with a conforming,\nself-adaptive simplicial tessellation of which the vertices follow the\nLagrangian equations of motion. The algorithm is implemented both in six- and\nfour-dimensional phase-space. Refinement of the tessellation mesh is performed\nusing the bisection method and a local representation of the phase-space sheet\nat second order relying on additional tracers created when needed at runtime.\nIn order to preserve in the best way the Hamiltonian nature of the system,\nrefinement is anisotropic and constrained by measurements of local Poincar\\'e\ninvariants. Resolution of Poisson equation is performed using the fast Fourier\nmethod on a regular rectangular grid, similarly to particle in cells codes. To\ncompute the density projected onto this grid, the intersection of the\ntessellation and the grid is calculated using the method of Franklin and\nKankanhalli (1993) generalised to linear order. As preliminary tests of the\ncode, we study in four dimensional phase-space the evolution of an initially\nsmall patch in a chaotic potential and the cosmological collapse of a\nfluctuation composed of two sinusoidal waves. We also perform a \"warm\" dark\nmatter simulation in six-dimensional phase-space that we use to check the\nparallel scaling of the code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 21:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

However, natural materials with isotropic\nnegative thermal expansion are rare and usually unsatisfied in performance.\nHere, we propose a novel method to achieve negative thermal expansion via a\nmetamaterial approach. The metamaterial is constructed with unit cells that\ncombine bi-material strips and anti-chiral structures. Both experimental and\nsimulation results display isotropic negative thermal expansion properties. The\ncoefficient of negative thermal expansion of the metamaterials is demonstrated\nto be dependent on the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of\ntwo component materials in the bi-material strips, as well as on the circular\nnode radius and the ligament length in the anti-chiral structures. The measured\nvalue of the linear negative thermal expansion coefficient reaches -68.1X10-6\n1/K in an operating temperature range from 303.15 K to 773.15 K, which is among\nthe largest achieved in experiments to date.

However, the anisotropy of Els\\\"asser variables\n($\\textbf{Z}^\\pm$) in 2D wave-vector space has yet to be investigated. Here we\nfirst verify the transformation based on the projection-slice theorem between\nthe power spectral density PSD$_{2D}(k_\\parallel,k_\\perp )$ and the spatial\ncorrelation function CF$_{2D} (r_\\parallel,r_\\perp )$. Based on the application\nof the transformation to the magnetic field and the particle measurements from\nthe WIND spacecraft, we investigate the spectral anisotropy of Els\\\"asser\nvariables ($\\textbf{Z}^\\pm$), and the distribution of residual energy E$_{R}$,\nAlfv\\'en ratio R$_{A}$ and Els\\\"asser ratio R$_{E}$ in the\n$(k_\\parallel,k_\\perp)$ space.
