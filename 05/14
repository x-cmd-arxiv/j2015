However, attempts at using time-of-flight for indoor\nlocalization have failed to deliver acceptable accuracy due to fundamental\nlimitations in measuring time on Wi-Fi and other RF consumer technologies.\nWhile the research community has developed alternatives for RF-based indoor\nlocalization that do not require time-of-flight, those approaches have their\nown limitations that hamper their use in practice. In particular, many existing\napproaches need receivers with large antenna arrays while commercial Wi-Fi\nnodes have two or three antennas.

We present a comparison of theoretical models for the field-aligned\ndensity along prominence fine structures. We consider Lorentzian, Gaussian, and\nparabolic profiles.

Bayesian parameter inference and model comparison techniques\nare developed and applied. Parameter inference requires the computation of the\nposterior distribution for the density gradient parameter conditional on the\nobservable period ratio. Model comparison involves the computation of the\nmarginal likelihood as a function of the period ratio to obtain the\nplausibility of each density model and the computation of Bayes Factors to\nquantify the relative evidence for each model, given a period ratio\nobservation. A Lorentzian density profile, with plasma density concentrated\naround the centre of the tube seems to offer the most plausible inversion\nresult.

Furthermore, Halpha equivalent\nwidth measurements and Hipparcos photometry show no significant variations with\nthis period. Another investigation of this star established that there was no\nvariability in the spectral line shapes with the radial velocity period. An\norbital solution results in a period of P = 628.96 +/- 0.90 d, eccentricity, e\n= 0.10 +/- 0.05, and a radial velocity amplitude, K = 142.1 +/- 7.2 m/s.\nEvolutionary tracks yield a stellar mass of 1.13 +/- 0.11 M_sun, which\ncorresponds to a minimum companion mass of 6.47 +/- 0.53 M_Jup with an orbital\nsemi-major axis of a = 1.46 +/- 0.27 AU.

In addition the GLAD drifters were launched\nclose together, producing few independent realizations and hence weaker\nstatistical significance.

DRAM device density\nand maximum device count are constrained by technology, package, and signal in-\ntegrity issues that limit total memory capacity. Synchronous DRAM protocols\nrequire data to be returned within a fixed latency, and thus memory extension\nmethods over commodity DDRx interfaces fail to support scalable topologies.\nCurrent extension approaches either use slow PCIe interfaces, or require\nexpensive changes to the memory interface, which limits commercial\nadoptability. Here we propose twin-load, a lightweight asynchronous memory\naccess mechanism over the synchronous DDRx interface. Twin-load uses two\nspecial loads to accomplish one access request to extended memory, the first\nserves as a prefetch command to the DRAM system, and the second asynchronously\ngets the required data. Twin-load requires no hardware changes on the processor\nside and only slight soft- ware modifications. We emulate this system on a\nprototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Twin-load has\ncomparable performance to NUMA extended memory and outperforms a page-swapping\nPCIe-based system by several orders of magnitude. Twin-load thus enables\ninstant capacity increases on commodity platforms, but more importantly, our\narchitecture opens opportunities for the design of novel, efficient, scalable,\ncost-effective memory subsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 17:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Instead, the microscopic relaxation\ntimes diverge so rapidly that, upon further cooling, equilibration eventually\nbecomes impossible and glass formation occurs. Classic supercooled liquids\nexhibit specific identifiers including microscopic relaxation times diverging\non a Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) trajectory, a Havriliak-Negami (HN) form for\nthe dielectric function, and a general Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) form for\ntime-domain relaxation. Recently, the pyrochlore Dy2Ti2O7 has become of\ninterest because its frustrated magnetic interactions may, in theory, lead to\nhighly exotic magnetic fluids. However, its true magnetic state at low\ntemperatures has proven very difficult to identify unambiguously. Here we\nintroduce high-precision, boundary-free magnetization transport techniques\nbased upon toroidal geometries and gain a fundamentally new understanding of\nthe time- and frequency-dependent magnetization dynamics of Dy2Ti2O7.

A common approach is to model neural responses as a\nweighted combination of external features, or vice versa. The structure of the\nmodel weights can provide insight into neural representations. Often, neural\ninput-output relationships are sparse, with only a few inputs contributing to\nthe output. In part to account for such sparsity, structured regularizers are\nincorporated into model fitting optimization. However, by imposing priors,\nstructured regularizers can make it difficult to interpret learned model\nparameters. Here, we investigate a simple, minimally structured model\nestimation method for accurate, unbiased estimation of sparse models based on\nBootstrapped Adaptive Threshold Selection followed by ordinary least-squares\nrefitting (BoATS). Through extensive numerical investigations, we show that\nthis method often performs favorably compared to L1 and L2 regularizers. In\nparticular, for a variety of model distributions and noise levels, BoATS more\naccurately recovers the parameters of sparse models, leading to more\nparsimonious explanations of outputs.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 20:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

In particular, we begin by\nexplaining how to model effective interactions in one dimension, which we then\napply to the main forward scattering channel -- the interbranch collisions --\ncommon to these systems. We renormalise the corresponding interbranch\nphenomenological constants in favour of scattering phase shifts. Interestingly,\nour renormalisation procedure shows (i) how Luttinger's model arises in a\ncompletely natural way -- and not as a convenient approximation -- from\nTomonaga's model, and (ii) the reasons behind the interbranch coupling constant\nremaining unrenormalised in Luttinger's model.

We show that, contrary to general belief and common sense, the\nintrabranch interactions appearing in Luttinger liquid theory do not correspond\nto an intrabranch scattering channel, nor an energy shift due to intrabranch\ninteractions, in the microscopic theory.

We test our theory on a sample of 35 nearby spiral galaxies, for\nwhich we derive a measurement of $\\nu_\\textrm{M}$ and $\\nu_\\textrm{R}$. 32/35\ngalaxies show the signature of ongoing inside-out growth ($\\nu_\\textrm{R} >\n0$). The typical derived e-folding timescales for mass and radial growth in our\nsample are ~ 10 Gyr and ~ 30 Gyr, respectively, with some systematic\nuncertainties. More massive discs have a larger scatter in $\\nu_\\textrm{M}$ and\n$\\nu_\\textrm{R}$, biased towards a slower growth, both in mass and size. We\nfind a linear relation between the two growth rates, indicating that our galaxy\ndiscs grow in size at ~ 0.35 times the rate at which they grow in mass; this\nratio is largely unaffected by systematics. Our results are in very good\nagreement with theoretical expectations if known scaling relations of disc\ngalaxies are not evolving with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 20:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

The lifetime\nof a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the\norbital distance of the planet from the host star. For a type-I planet, which\nis formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal\nemission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.\nTherefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in\nthis orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the\ncritical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared\natmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L\nbands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star\ncontrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$. Our\nmodel predicts that, in the type-II orbital region, molten planets would be\npresent over the main sequence of the G-type host star if the initial bulk\ncontent of water exceeds approximately 1 wt%. In visible atmospheric windows,\nthe contrasts of the thermal emission drop below $10^{-10}$ in less than $10^5$\nyears, whereas those of the reflected light remain $10^{-10}$ for both types of\nplanets. Since the contrast level is comparable to those of reflected light\nfrom Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, the visible reflected light\nfrom molten planets also provides a promising target for direct imaging with\nfuture ground- and space-based telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 21:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

The cost for an Internet user depends on whether the\ncontent providers have an agreement with the Internet Service Provider in which\nthe Internet user is connected to.

It is well known that\ntechniques like independent component analysis can separate the brain activity\nat rest to provide such RSNs, but the specific pattern of interaction between\nRSNs is not yet fully understood. To this aim, we propose here a novel method\nto compute the information flow (IF) between different RSNs from resting state\nmagnetic resonance imaging. After haemodynamic response function blind\ndeconvolution of all voxel signals, and under the hypothesis that RSNs define\nregions of interest, our method first uses principal component analysis to\nreduce dimensionality in each RSN to next compute IF (estimated here in terms\nof Transfer Entropy) between the different RSNs by systematically increasing k\n(the number of principal components used in the calculation). When k = 1, this\nmethod is equivalent to computing IF using the average of all voxel activities\nin each RSN. For k greater than one our method calculates the k-multivariate IF\nbetween the different RSNs. We find that the average IF among RSNs is\ndimension-dependent, increasing from k =1 (i.e., the average voxels activity)\nup to a maximum occurring at k =5 to finally decay to zero for k greater than\n10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to 5) is sufficient\nto describe the IF pattern between RSNs. Our method - addressing differences in\nIF between RSNs for any generic data - can be used for group comparison in\nhealth or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the interRSNs IF in a\ndataset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to find that the most significant\ndifferences between AD and controls occurred for k =2, in addition to AD\nshowing increased IF w.r.t. controls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 21:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

The effect can be controlled by either temperature\nor by using a magnetic field to control the state of the remote ferromagnetic\nelements and may act as a basic building block for a new generation of quantum\ninterference devices based on the spin of a Cooper pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 22:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Recently, some methods have been proposed to detect moving objects\nin a video via low-rank approximation and sparse outliers where the background\nis modeled with the computed low-rank component of the video and the foreground\nobjects are detected as the sparse outliers in the low-rank approximation. All\nof these existing methods work in a batch manner, preventing them from being\napplied in real time and long duration tasks. In this paper, we present an\nonline sequential framework, namely contiguous outliers representation via\nonline low-rank approximation (COROLA), to detect moving objects and learn the\nbackground model at the same time. We also show that our model can detect\nmoving objects with a moving camera.

During the observation, NuSTAR detected six bursts of short\nduration, with $T_{90}<1$ s. An elevated level of emission tail is detected\nafter the brightest burst, persisting for $\\sim$1 ks. The emission showed a\npower-law decay with a temporal index of 0.5 before returning to the persistent\nemission level. The long observation also provided detailed phase-resolved\nspectra of the persistent X-ray emission of the source. By comparing the\npersistent spectrum with that previously reported, we find that the source\nhard-band emission has been stable over approximately 10 years. The persistent\nhard X-ray emission is well fitted by a coronal outflow model, where $e^{+/-}$\npairs in the magnetosphere upscatter thermal X-rays.

Yet, making the direction of nuclear recoil visible with large\ntarget masses is a challenge. To achieve this, we are exploring a new method of\ndetecting directions of short nuclear recoil tracks in high-pressure Xe gas,\ndown to a few micron long, by utilizing columnar recombination. Columnar\nrecombination changes the scintillation and ionization yields depending on the\nangle between a track and the electric field direction.

We performed a detailed simulation\nof ionization electrons transport created by nuclear recoils in a Xe + TMA gas\nmixture, and evaluated the size of the columnar recombination signal. The\nresults show that the directionality signal can be obtained for a track longer\nthan a few micrometers in some ideal cases.

We start\nwith an asymptotic Anti-de-Sitter(AdS) black hole against a complex scalar\nperturbation at the initial time, and solve the dynamics of the gravitational\nsystems in the bulk. When the black hole temperature T is smaller than a\ncritical value Tc, the scalar perturbation grows exponentially till saturation,\nthe final state of spacetime approaches to a hairy black hole. In the bulk\ntheory, we find the clue of the influence of nonlinear corrections in the gauge\nfield on the process of the scalar field condensation. We show that the bulk\ndynamics in the non-equilibrium process is completely consistent with the\nobservations on the boundary order parameter.

Both the evolution of apparent\nand event horizons show that the original AdS black hole configuration requires\nmore time to finish the transformation to become a hairy black hole if there is\nnonlinear correction to the electromagnetic field.

In practice, the prognosis outcome data can be contaminated, and most of\nthe existing methods are not robust to data contamination.

In\nparticular, great efforts have recently been devoted to making semiconductors\nferromagnetic and metallic ferromagnets superconducting. Here we report the\nunprecedented observation of a heavily donor-doped ferromagnetic semiconductor,\nSmN, becoming superconducting with ferromagnetism remaining intact. The\nextremely large exchange splitting of the conduction and valence bands in this\nmaterial necessitates that the superconducting order hosted by SmN is of an\nunconventional triplet type, most likely exhibiting p-wave symmetry. Short\nrange spin fluctuations, which are thought to be the cause of pairing\ninteractions in currently known triplet superconductors, are quenched in SmN,\nsuggesting its superconductivity to be the result of phonon- or\nCoulomb-mediated pairing mechanisms. This scenario is further supported by the\ninferred heavy mass of superconducting charge carriers. The unique near-zero\nmagnetisation associated with the ferromagnetic state in SmN further aids its\ncoexistence with superconductivity. Presenting this novel material system where\nsemiconducting, ferromagnetic and superconducting properties are combined\nprovides a versatile new laboratory for studying quantum phases of matter.\nMoreover it is a major step towards identifying materials that merge\nsuperconductivity and spintronics, urgently needed to enable the design of\nelectronic devices with superior functionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 04:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 22:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

As expected based on previous observations, we detect HI\nin green valley objects with lower amounts of HI than blue galaxies, while\nstacking only produces a 3-$\\sigma$ upper limit for red galaxies with M$_{\\rm\nHI}$ $<$ (5 $\\pm$ 1.5) $\\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and M$_{\\rm HI}/\\rm{L}_r$\n$<$ 0.02 $\\pm$ 0.006 $\\rm M_{\\odot} / \\rm L_{\\odot} $. We find that the HI\ncontent is more dependent on NUV-r color, and less on ionization properties, in\nthe sense that regardless of the presence of an optical AGN (based on optical\nionization line diagnostics), green-valley galaxies always show HI, whereas red\ngalaxies only produce an upper limit. This suggests that feedback from optical\nAGN is not the (main) reason for depleting large-scale gas reservoirs.\n  Low-level radio continuum emission in our galaxies can stem either from star\nformation, or from AGN. We use the WISE color-color plot to separate these\nphenomena by dividing the sample into IR late-type and IR early-type galaxies.\nWe find that the radio emission in IR late-type galaxies stems from enhanced\nstar formation, and this group is detected in HI. However, IR early-type\ngalaxies lack any sign of HI gas and star formation activity, suggesting that\nradio AGN are likely to be the source of radio emission in this population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 04:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We model the present-day population of 'classical' low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs) with neutron star accretors, which have hydrogen-rich donor\nstars. Their population is compared with that of hydrogen-deficient LMXBs,\nknown as ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs). We model the observable LMXB\npopulation and compare it to observations. Methods. We combine the binary\npopulation synthesis code SeBa with detailed LMXB evolutionary tracks to model\nthe size and properties of the present-day LMXB population in the Galactic\nBulge. Whether sources are persistent or transient, and what their\ninstantaneous X-ray luminosities are, is predicted using the thermal-viscous\ndisk instability model. Results. We find a population of ~2.1 x 10^3 LMXBs with\nneutron star accretors. Of these about 15 - 40 are expected to be persistent\n(depending on model assumptions), with luminosities higher than 10^35 erg s^-1.\nAbout 7 - 20 transient sources are expected to be in outburst at any given\ntime.

Conclusions. Even though the observed population\nof hydrogen-rich LMXBs in the Bulge is larger than the observed population of\n(hydrogen-deficient) UCXBs, the latter have a higher formation rate. While\nUCXBs may dominate the total LMXB population at the present, the majority would\nbe very faint, or may have become detached and produced millisecond radio\npulsars. In that case UCXBs would contribute significantly more to the\nformation of millisecond radio pulsars than hydrogen-rich LMXBs.

INTEGRAL played a\ncrucial role in the discovery, study and understanding of heavily obscured\nsystems and of fast X-ray transients. Most super-giant systems can now be\nclassified in three categories: classical/obscured, eccentric and fast\ntransient. The classical systems feature low eccentricity and variability\nfactor of about 1000, mostly driven by hydrodynamic phenomena occurring on\nscales larger than the accretion radius. Among them, systems with short orbital\nperiods and close to Roche-Lobe overflow or with slow winds, appear highly\nobscured. In eccentric systems, the variability amplitude can reach even higher\nfactors, because of the contrast of the wind density along the orbit. Four\nsuper-giant systems, featuring fast outbursts, very short orbital periods and\nanomalously low accretion rates, are not yet understood. Simulations of the\naccretion processes on relatively large scales have pro- gressed and reproduce\nparts of the observations. The combined effects of wind clumps, magnetic\nfields, neutron star rotation and eccentricity ought to be included in future\nmodelling work.

An analysis of pair correlations among these\nobservables well confirms the results reported by the previous papers. More\ninterestingly, a tight correlation among $L_{\\rm iso}$, $E_{\\rm p,z}$, and\n$\\Gamma_0$ is found from a multiple regression analysis, which takes the form\nof $L_{\\rm iso} \\propto E_{\\rm p,z}^{1.34\\pm 0.14} \\Gamma_0^{1.32\\pm 0.19}$ or\n$E_{\\rm p,z} \\propto L_{\\rm iso}^{0.55\\pm 0.06}\\Gamma_0^{-0.50\\pm 0.17}$.

An increasing\ndensity of three-body resonances makes the region between the Cybele and Hilda\npopulations dynamically unstable, so that the Cybele zone could be considered\nthe last outpost of an extended main belt. The presence of binary asteroids\nwith large primaries and small secondaries suggested that asteroid families\nshould be found in this region, but only relatively recently the first\ndynamical groups were identified in this area. Among these, the Sylvia group\nhas been proposed to be one of the oldest families in the extended main belt.\n  In this work we identify families in the Cybele region in the context of the\nlocal dynamics and non-gravitational forces such as the Yarkovsky and\nstochastic YORP effects. We confirm the detection of the new Helga group at\n$\\simeq$3.65~AU, that could extend the outer boundary of the Cybele region up\nto the 5J:-3A mean-motion resonance. We obtain age estimates for the four\nfamilies, Sylvia, Huberta, Ulla and Helga, currently detectable in the Cybele\nregion, using Monte Carlo methods that include the effects of stochastic YORP\nand variability of the Solar luminosity. The Sylvia family should be $T = 1220\n\\pm 40$ Myr old, with a possible older secondary solution.

Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.
