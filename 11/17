In order to investigate the scattering of\nphonons in multilayer structures we developed a beam matching technique, which\nis based on the concept of individual phonons and their scattering at\ninterfaces. One of the major goals is to efficiently determine the complex band\nstructure of the bulk materials. The complex band structure is determined using\nselected k-points on a triangulated grid in the complex plane of wave vectors\nperpendicular to the interface. Matching the phonon modes at an interface is\ntranslated to a singular value problem. Its null-vectors provide the coupling\ncoefficients of the phonon modes across the interface. Besides giving explicit\naccess to the modes as they scatter at the interface, the technique provides\nthe transfer matrices, that provide the transmission coefficient of any\nmultilayer structure. The transmission coefficient, in turn, yields the\nphononic thermal conductance for coherent transport. The knowledge of the\nmatched phonons forms the basis of investigating incoherent transport under the\ninfluence of phonon-phonon or impurity scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 16:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

For example, quantum\nconfinement in carbon nanotubes and armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) leads\nto the opening of substantial electronic band gaps that are directly linked to\ntheir structural boundary conditions. Even more intriguing are nanostructures\nwith zigzag edges, which are expected to host spin-polarized electronic edge\nstates and can thus serve as key elements for graphene-based spintronics. The\nmost prominent example is zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) for which the\nedge states are predicted to couple ferromagnetically along the edge and\nantiferromagnetically between them. So far, a direct observation of the\nspin-polarized edge states for specifically designed and controlled zigzag edge\ntopologies has not been achieved. This is mainly due to the limited precision\nof current top-down approaches, which results in poorly defined edge\nstructures. Bottom-up fabrication approaches, on the other hand, were so far\nonly successfully applied to the growth of AGNRs and related structures. Here,\nwe describe the successful bottom-up synthesis of ZGNRs, which are fabricated\nby the surface-assisted colligation and cyclodehydrogenation of specifically\ndesigned precursor monomers including carbon groups that yield atomically\nprecise zigzag edges. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy we prove the\nexistence of edge-localized states with large energy splittings.

However\nthe choice of the softmax function seems somehow arbitrary as there are many\nother possible normalizing functions. It is thus unclear why the log-softmax\nloss would perform better than other loss alternatives. In particular Vincent\net al.

In this paper, we\ncarry out a rigorous evaluation of these methods by making the following\ncontributions: 1) we proposes a new evaluation metric for face alignment on a\nset of images, i.e., area under error distribution curve within a threshold,\nAUC$_\\alpha$, given the fact that the traditional evaluation measure (mean\nerror) is very sensitive to big alignment error. 2) we extend the 300W database\nwith more practical face detections to make fair comparison possible. 3) we\ncarry out face alignment sensitivity analysis w.r.t. face detection, on both\nsynthetic and real data, using both off-the-shelf and re-retrained models. 4)\nwe study factors that are particularly important to achieve good performance\nand provide suggestions for practical applications. Most of the conclusions\ndrawn from our comparative analysis cannot be inferred from the original\npublications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 17:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

It is an extension of B\\\"uchi\nautomaton by using a set of records as its alphabet or transition labels.\nRecords are used to express the synchrony between the externally visible\nactions of coordinated components modeled by BARs. The main composition\noperator on the set of BARs is called as join which is the semantics of its\ncounterpart in Reo. In this paper, we define the notion of labeled transition\nsystems of records as a generalization of the notion of BAR, abstracting away\nfrom acceptance or rejection of strings. Then, we consider four equivalence\nrelations (semantics) over the set of labeled transition systems of records and\ninvestigate their congruency with respect to the join composition operator. In\nfact, we prove that the finite-traces-based, infinite-traces-based, and\nnondeterministic finite automata (NFA)-based equivalence relations all are\ncongruence relations over the set of all labeled transition systems of records\nwith respect to the join operation. However, the equivalence relation using\nB\\\"uchi acceptance condition is not so. In addition, using these results, we\nintroduce the language-theoretic definitions of the join operation considering\nboth finite and infinite strings notions. Also, we show that there is no\nlanguage-based and structure-independent definition of the join operation on\nB\\\"uchi automata of records.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 18:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

The considered SCN is\ncomposed of a mixture of small cells that are configured in either in-band or\nout-of-band backhaul modes with a certain probability. The performance of the\nuser in the considered hierarchical network is limited by several sources of\ninterference such as the backhaul interference, small cell base station\n(SBS)-to-SBS interference and the SI. Moreover, due to the channel hardening\neffect in massive MIMO, the backhaul links experience long term channel effects\nonly, whereas the access links experience both the long term and short term\nchannel effects. Consequently, the developed framework is flexible to\ncharacterize different sources of interference while capturing the\nheterogeneity of the access and backhaul channels.

Its theme is\nthe remarkable interplay, accelerating in the last few decades, between\ntopology and the theory of orderable groups, with applications in both\ndirections.\n  It begins with an introduction to orderable groups and their algebraic\nproperties. Many of the algebraic results are proved by topological methods,\nvia consideration of the space of orderings. After a discussion H\\\"older's\ntheorem and some dynamical aspects of orderable groups, we provide explicit\norderings of important groups in topology: free groups and most surface groups.\n  Next we consider orderability of the fundamental groups of three-dimensional\nmanifolds. All knot groups, and more generally groups of 3-manifolds with\npositive first Betti number are left-orderable, in fact locally indicable and\nsometimes even bi-orderable. However when the first homology is finite the\nsituation is more subtle, and we find connections with foliations, branched\ncoverings, surgery, and conjecturally Heegaard-Floer homology.\n  Braid groups are considered in some detail, including Dehornoy's ordering of\nthe braid groups and its later generalizations due to Thurston. This is\nfollowed by a discussion of recent applications of Dehornoy's ordering to knot\ntheory. A short chapter outlines a proof that the group of PL homeomorphisms of\nthe $n$-dimensional cube (fixed on the boundary) is left-orderable; a property\nconjectured to be true for the group of homeomorphisms in dimension two.\n  We present a new proof that local indicability of a group is equivalent to\nthe existence of a \"Conradian\" left-ordering. A final chapter considers the\nspace $LO(G)$ of left-orderings of a group $G$. We give a new proof of Sikora's\ntheorem that $LO(\\mathbb{Z}^n), n >1$ is a Cantor set, as well as a proof of\nLinnell's theorem that for any group $G$, $LO(G)$ is either finite or\nuncountable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 19:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

But language also provides a\nstrong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the\nunderlying models truly understanding the visual content. This can hinder\nprogress in pushing state of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal\nAI. In this paper, we address binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on\nabstract scenes. We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts\ninquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple\nthat concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If\nthe concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is \"yes\", and\notherwise \"no\". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on\nthe high-level semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level\nrecognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the\nmodality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and\nthe role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs\nof scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is \"yes\" for\none scene, and \"no\" for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language\npriors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset.\nMoreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art\nVQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 19:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 20:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 20:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 20:58:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 19:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

A geometric locus is a curve or\nsurface formed by points, all of which possess some uniform property. A\ngeometric locus of an algebraic equation is the set of points whose coordinates\nare solutions of the equation. Any given curve or surface must pass through\neach point on a specified locus. This paper argues that it is impossible to fit\nrandom data points to algebraic equations of partially configured geometric\nloci that reference arbitrary Cartesian coordinate systems. It also argues that\nthe fundamental curve of a linear decision boundary is actually a principal\neigenaxis. It is shown that learning principal eigenaxes of linear decision\nboundaries involves finding a point of statistical equilibrium for which\neigenenergies of principal eigenaxis components are symmetrically balanced with\neach other. It is demonstrated that learning linear decision boundaries\ninvolves strong duality relationships between a statistical eigenlocus of\nprincipal eigenaxis components and its algebraic forms, in primal and dual,\ncorrelated Hilbert spaces.

A large number $N$ of light species\nin the theory, which occur in many string constructions, can amplify these\nproblems. One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation. Here we show that there is no such problem when we\ncorrectly renormalize models with many light species, taking the {\\it physical}\nPlanck scale to be $M^2_{pl} \\gtrsim N {\\cal M}_{UV}^2$, where ${\\cal M}_{UV}$\nis the cutoff for the QFT coupled to semiclassical quantum gravity. The number\nof light species then cancels out of the gravitational entropy of de Sitter or\nnear-de Sitter backgrounds at leading order. Working in detail with $N$ scalar\nfields in de Sitter space, renormalized to one loop order, we show that the\ngravitational entropy automatically obeys the covariant entropy bound.\nFurthermore, while the axion decay constant is a strong coupling scale for the\naxion dynamics, we show that it is {\\it not} in general the cutoff of 4d\nsemiclassical gravity. After renormalizing the two point function of the\ninflaton, we note that it is also controlled by scales much below the cutoff.\nWe revisit $N$-flation and KKLT-type compactifications in this light, and show\nthat they are perfectly consistent with the covariant entropy bound.

We\nconsider the particular case of Sgr B2, one of the brightest and most massive\nXRN in our Galaxy. We parametrise the gas distribution inside the cloud using a\nsimple clumping model, with the slope of the clump mass function (alpha), the\nminimum clump mass (m_{min}), the fraction of the cloud's mass contained in\nclumps (f_{DGMF}), and the mass-size relation of individual clumps as free\nparameters, and investigate how these affect the reflected X-ray spectrum. In\nthe case of very dense clumps, similar to those presently observed in Sgr B2,\nthese occupy a small volume of the cloud and present a small projected area to\nthe incoming X-ray radiation. We find that these contribute negligibly to the\nscattered X-rays. Clump populations with volume filling factors of > 10^{-3},\ndo leave observational signatures, that are sensitive to the clump model\nparameters, in the reflected spectrum and polarisation. Future high-resolution\nX-ray observations could therefore complement the traditional optical and radio\nobservations of these GMCs, and prove to be a powerful probe in the study of\ntheir internal structure. Finally, clumps in GMCs should be visible both as\nbright spots and regions of heavy absorption in high resolution X-ray\nobservations. We therefore further study the time-evolution of the X-ray\nmorphology, under illumination by a transient source, as a probe of the 3d\ndistribution and column density of individual clumps by future X-ray\nobservatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 20:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

However, these types of stars are part of\nmultiple systems more often than not. Close stellar companions affect the\nformation and orbital evolution of any planets, and the properties of the\ncompanions can help constrain the binary formation mechanism. Unfortunately,\nclose companions are difficult and expensive to detect with imaging techniques.\nIn this paper, we describe the direct spectral detection method wherein a\nhigh-resolution spectrum of the primary is cross-correlated against a template\nfor a companion star. Variants of this method have previously been used to\nsearch for stellar, brown dwarf, and even planetary companions. We show that\nthe direct spectral detection method can detect companions as late as M-type\norbiting A0 or earlier primary stars in a single epoch on small-aperture\ntelescopes. In addition to estimating the detection limits, we determine the\nsources of uncertainty in characterizing the companion temperature, and find\nthat large systematic biases can exist. After calibrating the systematic biases\nwith synthetic binary star observations, we apply the method to a sample of 34\nknown binary systems with an A- or B-type primary star. We detect nine total\ncompanions, including four of the five known companions with literature\ntemperatures between $4000$ K $ < T < 6000$ K, the temperature range for which\nour method is optimized. We additionally characterize the companion for the\nfirst time in two previously single-lined binary systems and one binary\nidentified with speckle interferometry. This method provides an inexpensive way\nto use small-aperture telescopes to detect binary companions with moderate\nmass-ratios, and is competitive with high-resolution imaging techniques inside\n$\\sim 100-200$ mas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Most of this energy is thermalized and immediately removed\nfrom the ISM by radiative cooling. The rest is available for driving ISM\ndynamics. In this work we estimate the amount of feedback energy retained as\nkinetic energy when the bubble walls have decelerated to the sound speed of the\nambient medium. We show that the feedback of the most massive star outweighs\nthe feedback from less massive stars. For a giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass of\n1e5 solar masses (as e.g. found in the Orion GMCs) and a star formation\nefficiency of 8% the initial mass function predicts a most massive star of\napproximately 60 solar masses. For this stellar evolution model we test the\ndependence of the retained kinetic energy of the cold GMC gas on the inclusion\nof stellar winds. In our model winds insert 2.34 times the energy of a SN and\ncreate stellar wind bubbles serving as pressure reservoirs. We find that during\nthe pressure driven phases of the bubble evolution radiative losses peak near\nthe contact discontinuity (CD), and thus, the retained energy depends\ncritically on the scales of the mixing processes across the CD.

Previous studies using simulated\nphotometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's\norbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's\nlongitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and\naxial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the\nkernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is\nEast-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find\nthat perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually\nsufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis. Surprisingly, we predict\nthat East-West albedo contrast is more useful for constraining obliquity than\nNorth-South contrast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 01:11:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 00:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 23:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

Thanks to the high AGN obscuration, the host\ngalaxy is easily observable, and has UV/optical colors usually consistent with\nthose of a normal galaxy.

In this paper we present a new non-parametric calibration\nmethod called \\textit{ensemble of near isotonic regression} (ENIR). The method\ncan be considered as an extension of BBQ, a recently proposed calibration\nmethod, as well as the commonly used calibration method based on isotonic\nregression. ENIR is designed to address the key limitation of isotonic\nregression which is the monotonicity assumption of the predictions. Similar to\nBBQ, the method post-processes the output of a binary classifier to obtain\ncalibrated probabilities. Thus it can be combined with many existing\nclassification models. We demonstrate the performance of ENIR on synthetic and\nreal datasets for the commonly used binary classification models. Experimental\nresults show that the method outperforms several common binary classifier\ncalibration methods. In particular on the real data, ENIR commonly performs\nstatistically significantly better than the other methods, and never worse. It\nis able to improve the calibration power of classifiers, while retaining their\ndiscrimination power. The method is also computationally tractable for large\nscale datasets, as it is $O(N \\log N)$ time, where $N$ is the number of\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 21:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

We\nconsider a new network formation game that incorporates an adversarial attack,\nas well as immunization against attack. An agent's benefit is the expected size\nof her connected component post-attack, and agents may also choose to immunize\nthemselves from attack at some additional cost. Our framework is a stylized\nmodel of settings where reachability rather than centrality is the primary\nconcern and vertices vulnerable to attacks may reduce risk via costly measures.\n  In the reachability benefit model without attack or immunization, the set of\nequilibria is the empty graph and any tree.

We show that, under a mild\nassumption on the adversary, every equilibrium network with $n$ agents contains\nat most $2n-4$ edges for $n\\geq 4$. So despite permitting topologies denser\nthan trees, the amount of overbuilding is limited.

Results from numerical simulations of star formation qualitatively\nresemble an observed mass function, a scale-free power law with a sharp decline\nat low masses. However, most analytic IMF theories critically depend on the\nempirically chosen input spectrum of mass fluctuations which evolve into dense\ncores and, subsequently, stars, and on the scaling relation between the\namplitude and mass of a fluctuation. Here we propose a new approach exploiting\nthe techniques from the field of network science. We represent a system of\ndense cores accreting gas from the surrounding diffuse interstellar medium\n(ISM) as a spatial network growing by preferential attachment and assume that\nthe ISM density has a self-similar fractal distribution following the\nKolmogorov turbulence theory. We effectively combine gravoturbulent and\ncompetitive accretion approaches and predict the accretion rate to be\nproportional to the dense core mass: $dM/dt \\propto M$. Then we describe the\ndense core growth and demonstrate that the power-law core mass function emerges\nindependently of the initial distribution of density fluctuations by mass. Our\nmodel yields a power law solely defined by the fractal dimensionalities of the\nISM and accreting gas.

Instead, the analyst typically needs to\nuse the data to search for interesting analyses to perform and hypotheses to\ntest. This is an adaptive process, where the choice of analysis to be performed\nnext depends on the results of the previous analyses on the same data.\nUltimately, which results are reported can be heavily influenced by the data.\nIt is widely recognized that this process, even if well-intentioned, can lead\nto biases and false discoveries, contributing to the crisis of reproducibility\nin science. But while %the adaptive nature of exploration any data-exploration\nrenders standard statistical theory invalid, experience suggests that different\ntypes of exploratory analysis can lead to disparate levels of bias, and the\ndegree of bias also depends on the particulars of the data set. In this paper,\nwe propose a general information usage framework to quantify and provably bound\nthe bias and other error metrics of an arbitrary exploratory analysis. We prove\nthat our mutual information based bound is tight in natural settings, and then\nuse it to give rigorous insights into when commonly used procedures do or do\nnot lead to substantially biased estimation. Through the lens of information\nusage, we analyze the bias of specific exploration procedures such as\nfiltering, rank selection and clustering.

We\nadditionally show that these parameters become identifiable when the initial\nconditions for each of the gating variables are known. The time constants for\neach gating variable are shown to be identifiable, and a novel method for\nestimating them is presented. Finally, the exponents of the gating variables\nare shown to be identifiable in the two-gate case, and we conjecture these to\nbe identifiable in the general case. These results are broadly applicable to\nmodels using HH-like formalisms, and show in general which parameters and\ncombinations of parameters are possible to estimate from voltage clamp data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 23:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

One fundamental\ndistributed decision-making process is coalition formation for sharing certain\nreplaceable resources collaboratively, for example, sharing hotel rooms among\ntravelers, sharing taxi-rides among passengers, and sharing regular passes\namong users. Motivated by the applications of sharing economy, this paper\nstudies a coalition formation game subject to the capacity of $K$ participants\nper coalition. The participants in each coalition are supposed to split the\nassociated cost according to a given cost-sharing mechanism. A stable coalition\nstructure is established when no group of participants can opt out to form\nanother coalition that leads to lower individual payments. We quantify the\ninefficiency of distributed decision-making processes under a cost-sharing\nmechanism by the strong price of anarchy (SPoA), comparing a worst-case stable\ncoalition structure and a social optimum. In particular, we derive SPoA for\ncommon fair cost-sharing mechanisms (e.g., equal-split, proportional-split,\negalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions of bargaining games, and usage based\ncost-sharing). We show that the SPoA for equal-split, proportional-split, and\nusage based cost-sharing (under certain conditions) is $\\Theta(\\log K)$,\nwhereas the one for egalitarian and Nash bargaining solutions is $O(\\sqrt{K}\n\\log K)$. Therefore, distributed decision-making processes under common fair\ncost-sharing mechanisms induce only moderate inefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 04:44:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 23:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 14:56:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 09:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

To address this problem, we\nstudied a sample of seven ULSs with extensive Chandra and XMM-Newton coverage.\nWe find an anticorrelation between fitted temperatures and radii of the thermal\nemitter, and no correlation between bolometric luminosity and radius or\ntemperature. We compare the physical parameters of ULSs with those of classical\nsupersoft sources, thought to be surface-nuclear-burning white dwarfs, and of\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), thought to be super-Eddington stellar-mass\nblack holes. We argue that ULSs are the sub-class of ULXs seen through the\ndensest wind, perhaps an extension of the soft-ultraluminous regime. We suggest\nthat in ULSs, the massive disk outflow becomes effectively optically thick and\nforms a large photosphere, shrouding the inner regions from our view. Our model\npredicts that when the photosphere expands to >10,000 km and the temperature\ndecreases below approximately 50 eV, ULSs become brighter in the far-UV but\nundetectable in X-rays.

It follows that the\nlate radiation has to be entangled with the early radiation and, as a\nconsequence, the entanglement among the Hawking pair partners has to decrease\ncontinuously from maximal to vanishing during the BH's life span. Starting from\nthe basic premise that both the horizon radius and the center of mass of a\nfinite-mass BH are fluctuating quantum mechanically, we show how this process\nis realized. First, it is shown that the horizon fluctuations induce a small\namount of variance in the total linear momentum of each created pair. This is\nin contrast to the case of an infinitely massive BH, for which the total\nmomentum of the produced pair vanishes exactly on account of momentum\nconservation. This variance leads to a random recoil of the BH during each\nemission and, as a result, the center of mass of the BH undergoes a quantum\nrandom walk. Consequently, the uncertainty in its momentum grows as the square\nroot of the number of emissions. We then show that this uncertainty controls\nthe amount of deviation from maximal entanglement of the produced pairs and\nthat this deviation is determined by the ratio of the cumulative number of\nemitted particles to the initial BH entropy. Thus, the interplay between the\nhorizon and center-of-mass fluctuations provides a mechanism for teleporting\nentanglement from the pair partners to the BH and the emitted radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 07:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

This phenomenon has profound implications for the\ninterpretation of the multifrequency spectra of radiation from supernova\nremnants. Neutrals that undergo charge exchange with hot ions downstream of the\nshock may result in fast neutrals moving towards the upstream gas, where they\ncan suffer additional charge exchange or ionisation reactions, thereby\ndepositing energy and momentum upstream. Here we discuss the implications of\nthis neutral return flux, which was already predicted in our previous work on\nneutral mediated supernova shocks, and show how the spectra of accelerated\nparticles turn out to be appreciably steeper than $p^{-4}$, thereby affecting\nthe gamma ray spectra from supernova remnants in general and from Tycho\nspecifically.

In recent years numerous studies have evaluated pairs of tumor\nspecimens to examine the similarity of the somatic characteristics of the\ntumors and to test for clonal relatedness. As the landscape of mutation testing\nhas evolved, a number of statistical methods for determining clonality have\ndeveloped, notably for comparing losses of heterozygosity at candidate markers,\nand for comparing copy number profiles. Increasingly tumors are being evaluated\nfor point mutations in panels of candidate genes using gene sequencing\ntechnologies. Comparison of the mutational profiles of pairs of tumors presents\nunusual methodological challenges: mutations at some loci are much more common\nthan others; knowledge of the marginal mutation probabilities is scanty for\nmost loci at which mutations might occur; the sample space of potential\nmutational profiles is vast. We examine this problem and propose a test for\nclonal relatedness of a pair of tumors from a single patient. Using\nsimulations, its properties are shown to be promising.

The graphene electromagnetic response was studied i.e. the\nformulae for the induced current and conductivity were found and analyzed\nneglecting loss.

Traditionally, many of the selection-based processes used to\ndescribe cultural and genetic evolution (such as imitation and birth-death\nmodels) have been studied on a case-by-case basis. Over time, these models have\ngrown in sophistication to include population structure, differing phenotypes,\nand various forms of interaction asymmetry, among other features. Furthermore,\nmany processes inspired by natural selection, such as evolutionary algorithms\nin computer science, possess characteristics that should fall within the realm\nof a \"selection process,\" but so far there is no overarching theory\nencompassing these evolutionary processes. The framework of $\\textit{stochastic\nselection processes}$ we present here provides such a theory and consists of\nthree main components: a $\\textit{population state space}$, an\n$\\textit{aggregate payoff function}$, and an $\\textit{update rule}$. A\npopulation state space is a generalization of the notion of population\nstructure, and it can include non-spatial information such as strategy-mutation\nrates and phenotypes. An aggregate payoff function allows one to generically\ntalk about the fitness of traits without explicitly specifying a method of\npayoff accounting or even the nature of the interactions that determine\npayoff/fitness. An update rule is a fitness-based function that updates a\npopulation based on its current state, and it includes as special cases the\nclassical update mechanisms (Moran, Wright-Fisher, etc.) as well as more\ncomplicated mechanisms involving chromosomal crossover, mutation, and even\ncomplex cultural syntheses of strategies of neighboring individuals. Our\nframework covers models with variable population size as well as with\narbitrary, measurable trait spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 13:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Two distinct\nmechanisms account for dependence in traits of recruiters and recruitees in an\nRDS study: homophily, the tendency for individuals to share social ties with\nothers exhibiting similar characteristics, and preferential recruitment, in\nwhich recruiters do not recruit uniformly at random from their available\nalters.

Only for individual galaxies a causal connection\nbetween spatially resolved H$\\alpha$ kinematics and Ly$\\alpha$ photometry can\nbe conjectured.

Furthermore, we compute non-parametric global kinematical statistics --\nintrinsic velocity dispersion $\\sigma_0$, shearing velocity $v_\\mathrm{shear}$,\nand the $v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0$ ratio -- from our kinematic maps. In\ngeneral LARS galaxies are characterised by high intrinsic velocity dispersions\n(54\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ median) and low shearing velocities (65\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$\nmedian). $v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0$ values range from 0.5 to 3.2 with an\naverage of 1.5. Noteworthy, five galaxies of the sample are dispersion\ndominated systems with $v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0 <1$ and are thus\nkinematically similar to turbulent star forming galaxies seen at high redshift.\nWhen linking our kinematical statistics to the global LARS Ly$\\alpha$\nproperties, we find that dispersion dominated systems show higher Ly$\\alpha$\nequivalent widths and higher Ly$\\alpha$ escape fractions than systems with\n$v_\\mathrm{shear}/\\sigma_0 > 1$. Our result indicates that turbulence in\nactively star-forming systems is causally connected to interstellar medium\nconditions that favour an escape of Ly$\\alpha$ radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 13:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Because\nof the sheer amount of objects, spectral data cannot be obtained for all of\nthem. Therefore it is important to devise techniques for reliably estimating\nphysical properties of objects from photometric information alone. These\nestimates are needed to automatically identify interesting objects worth a\nfollow-up investigation as well as to produce the required data for a\nstatistical analysis of the space covered by a survey. We argue that machine\nlearning techniques are suitable to compute these estimates accurately and\nefficiently. This study promotes a feature selection algorithm, which selects\nthe most informative magnitudes and colours for a given task of estimating\nphysical quantities from photometric data alone. Using k nearest neighbours\nregression, a well-known non-parametric machine learning method, we show that\nusing the found features significantly increases the accuracy of the\nestimations compared to using standard features and standard methods. We\nillustrate the usefulness of the approach by estimating specific star formation\nrates (sSFRs) and redshifts (photo-z's) using only the broad-band photometry\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

We\ndiscuss several cases depending on the form of the Kahler metric for visible\nsector matter fields and the mechanism responsible for achieving a de Sitter\nvacuum. The leading decay channels which determine dark radiation predictions\nare to hidden sector axions, visible sector Higgses and SUSY scalars depending\non their mass. We show that in most of the parameter space of split SUSY-like\nmodels squarks and sleptons are heavier than the lightest modulus. Hence dark\nradiation predictions previously obtained for MSSM-like cases hold more\ngenerally also for split SUSY-like cases since the decay channel to SUSY\nscalars is kinematically forbidden. However the inclusion of string loop\ncorrections to the Kahler potential gives rise to a parameter space region\nwhere the decay channel to SUSY scalars opens up, leading to a significant\nreduction of dark radiation production. In this case, the simplest model with a\nshift-symmetric Higgs sector can suppress the excess of dark radiation $\\Delta\nN_{eff}$ to values as small as 0.14, in perfect agreement with current\nexperimental bounds. Depending on the exact mass of the SUSY scalars all values\nin the range 0.14 $\\lesssim \\Delta N_{eff} \\lesssim$ 1.6 are allowed.\nInterestingly dark radiation overproduction can be avoided also in the absence\nof a Giudice-Masiero coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 15:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

However, in addition to\nthe self-interference problem, cross-mode interference (i.e., between uplink\nand downlink) imposes a major obstacle for the deployment of FD communication\nin cellular networks. More specifically, the downlink to uplink interference\nrepresents the performance bottleneck for FD operation due to the uplink\nlimited transmission power and venerable operation when compared to the\ndownlink counterpart. While the positive impact of FD communication to the\ndownlink performance has been proved in the literature, its effect on the\nuplink transmission has been neglected. This paper focuses on the effect of\ndownlink interference on the uplink transmission in FD cellular networks in\norder to see whether FD communication is beneficial for the uplink transmission\nor not, and if yes for which type of network. To quantify the expected\nperformance gains, we derive a closed form expression of the maximum achievable\nuplink capacity in FD cellular networks. In contrast to the downlink capacity\nwhich always improves with FD communication, our results show that the uplink\nperformance may improve or degrade depending on the associated network\nparameters. Particularly, we show that the intensity of base stations (BSs) has\na more prominent effect on the uplink performance than their transmission\npower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 12:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

The analysis is done on the paradigmatic weak\nitinerant ferromagnet bcc Fe, whose magnetism, seen as a correlation phenomenon\ngiven by the coexistence of localized moments and itinerant electrons, and the\nnon-Fermi liquid behaviour at ambient and extreme conditions both remain\nunclear. The results offer a real space imaging of local pure spin flip and\nentangled spin flip-orbital flip excitations (even at energies where spin flip\ntransitions are hidden in quasiparticle peaks) and of chiral, vortex-like\nwavefronts of excited electrons, depending on the orbital character of the\nbands and the direction of the local magnetic moment. Such effects, mediated by\nthe hole polarization, make resonant photoemission a promising tool to perform\na full tomography of the local magnetic properties of a system with a high\nsensitivity to localization/correlation, even in itinerant or macroscopically\nnon magnetic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 06:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}
