The squeezed-limit bispectrum\nmeasures how the small-scale power spectrum is modulated by a long-wavelength\noverdensity, which is due to gravitational evolution and possibly inflationary\nphysics. We divide a survey into small subvolumes, compute the local power\nspectrum and the mean overdensity in each subvolume, and measure the\ncorrelation between them. The correlation measures the integral of the\nbispectrum, which is dominated by squeezed configurations if the scale of the\nlocal power spectrum is much smaller than the subvolume size. We use the\nseparate universe approach to model how the small-scale power spectrum is\naffected by a long-wavelength overdensity gravitationally. This models the\nnonlinearity of the bispectrum better than the perturbation theory approach.\nNot only the new observable is easy to interpret, but it sidesteps the\ncomplexity of the full bispectrum estimation as both power spectrum and mean\noverdensity are easier to estimate than the full bispectrum. We report on the\nfirst measurement of the position-dependent correlation function from the\nSDSS-III BOSS DR10 CMASS sample. We detect the bispectrum of the CMASS sample,\nand constrain their nonlinear bias combining with anisotropic clustering and\nweak lensing. We finally study the response of the small-scale power spectrum\nto 1-3 long-wavelength overdensities. We compare the separate universe approach\nto separate universe simulations to unprecedented accuracy. We test the\nstandard perturbation theory (SPT) hypothesis that the nonlinear n-point\nfunction is fully predicted by the linear power spectrum at the same time. We\nfind discrepancies on small scales, which suggest that SPT fails even if it is\ncalculated to all orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 16:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

To explore this idea, relative nova rates in three Virgo\nelliptical galaxies, M87, M49 and M84, which have significantly different GC\nspecific frequencies ($S_{N}$) of 14, 3.6, and 1.6, respectively, were measured\nover the course of 4 epochs spanning a period of 14 months. To simplify the\nanalysis, observations of the nearly equidistant galaxies were made on the same\nnights, with the same integration times, and through the same filter\n(H$\\alpha$), so that the relative numbers of novae discovered would reflect the\nrelative nova rates. At the conclusion of our survey we found a total of 27\nnovae associated with M87, 37 with M49, and 19 with M84. After correcting for\nsurvey completeness, we found annual nova rates of $154^{+23}_{-19}$,\n$189^{+26}_{-22}$, and $95^{+15}_{-14}$, for M87, M49, and M84, respectively,\ncorresponding to $K$-band luminosity-specific nova rates of $3.8\\pm1.0$,\n$3.4\\pm0.6$, and $3.0\\pm0.6$ novae per year per $10^{10}~L_{K,\\odot}$. The\noverall results of our study suggest that a galaxy's nova rate simply scales\nwith its luminosity, and is insensitive to its GC specific frequency. Two\nnovae, one in M87 and one in M84, were found to be spatially coincident with\nknown GCs.

We show that in the presence of different punishing cooperators\nthe highest level of public cooperation is always attainable through a\nselection mechanism.

In this method, we\nconsider a gas blob or ring falling onto a black hole from the marginally\nstable orbit, keeping its initial orbital angular momentum. We calculate the\ngas motion and photon trajectories in the Kerr space-time and, assuming that\nthe gas blob or ring emits monochromatic radiation, carefully examine how it is\nobserved by a distant observer. The light curve of the orbiting gas blob is\ncomposed of many peaks because of periodic enhancement of the flux due to the\ngravitational lensing and beaming effects. Further, the intensity of each peak\nfirst gradually increases with time due to the focusing effect around the\nphoton circular orbit and then rapidly decreases due to the gravitational\nredshift, as the gas blob approaches the event horizon. The light curve of the\ngas ring is equivalent to a superposition of those of the blobs with various\ninitial orbital phases, and so it is continuous and with no peaks. The flux\nfirst gradually increases and then rapidly decays, as in the blob model. The\nflux variation timescale depends on the black hole spin and is independent from\nthe inclination angle, while time averaged frequency shift have dependences of\nboth effects. We can thus, in principle, determine spin and inclination angle\nfrom observations. The observational implications and future issues are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 20:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

Two important properties of local estimates, namely, the\nconsistency and confidence, are emphasized. On one hand, the consistency, which\nmeans that the approximated error covariance is lower bounded by the true\nunknown one, has to be guaranteed so that the estimate is not over-confident.\nOn the other hand, since the confidence indicates the accuracy of the estimate,\nthe estimate should be as confident as possible. We first analyze two different\ninformation fusion strategies used in the case of information sources with,\nrespectively, uncorrelated errors and unknown but correlated errors. Then a\ndistributed hybrid information fusion algorithm is proposed, where each agent\nuses the information obtained not only by itself, but also from its neighbors\nthrough communication. The proposed algorithm not only guarantees the\nconsistency of the estimates, but also utilizes the available information\nsources in a more efficient manner and hence improves the confidence. Besides,\nthe proposed algorithm is fully distributed and guarantees convergence with the\nsufficient condition formulated. The comparisons with existing algorithms are\nshown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 20:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

One of the most\nimportant is the comparison of the 70GHz and 100GHz channels. Based on\ndifferent instrument technologies, with feeds located differently in the focal\nplane, analysed independently by different teams using different software, and\nnear the minimum of diffuse foreground emission, these channels are in effect\ntwo different experiments. The 143GHz channel has the lowest noise level on\nPlanck, and is near the minimum of unresolved foreground emission. In this\npaper, we analyse the level of consistency achieved in the 2013 Planck data. We\nconcentrate on comparisons between the 70/100/143GHz channel maps and power\nspectra, particularly over the angular scales of the first and second acoustic\npeaks, on maps masked for diffuse Galactic emission and for strong unresolved\nsources. Difference maps covering angular scales from 8deg-15arcmin are\nconsistent with noise, and show no evidence of cosmic microwave background\nstructure. Including small but important corrections for unresolved-source\nresiduals, we demonstrate agreement between 70 and 100GHz power spectra\naveraged over 70<l<390 at the 0.8% level, and agreement between 143 and 100GHz\npower spectra of 0.4% over the same l range. These values are within and\nconsistent with the overall uncertainties in calibration given in the Planck\n2013 results. We also present results based on the 2013 likelihood analysis\nshowing consistency at the 0.35% between the 100/143/217GHz power spectra.

In recent years, some studies point to the effect of\nparticle size and dimensionality of these compounds in their magnetic features.\nParticularly, LaCaMnO material research is well explored concerning the bulk\nmaterial. To overcome the lack of the information we successfully produced\nadvanced nanostructures of La$_{0.6}$Ca$_{0.4}$MnO$_{3}$ manganites, namely\nnanotubes and nanoparticles by using a sol-gel modified method, to determine\nthe size particle effect on the magnetism. The manganites crystal structure,\nmagnetic and magnetocaloric properties were studied in a broad temperature\nrange. Transmission electron microscopy revealed nanoparticles with sizes from\n45 up to 223 nm, depending on the calcination temperature. It was found that\nthe magnetic and magnetocaloric properties can be optimized by tuning the\nparticle size; for instance, the magnetic transition broadening by decreasing\nthe particle size. We report the relative cooling power (RCP) of these samples;\nit was found that the best RCP was observed for the 223 nm particle (508 J/Kg).\nFinally, this work contributes to the research on the magnetic properties and\nmagnetocaloric potentials in nanostructured systems with distinct morphologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 23:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

In the field\nof quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum networking, various\nproposals discuss the possibility of hybrid architectures where specific tasks\nare delegated to the most suitable subsystem. For example, in quantum networks,\nit may be advantageous to transfer information from a subsystem that has good\nmemory properties to another subsystem that is more efficient at transporting\ninformation between nodes in the network. For trapped-ions, a hybrid system\nformed of different species introduces extra degrees of freedom that can be\nexploited to expand and refine the control of the system. Ions of different\nelements have previously been used in QIP experiments for sympathetic cooling,\ncreation of entanglement through dissipation, and quantum non-demolition (QND)\nmeasurement of one species with another. Here, we demonstrate an entangling\nquantum gate between ions of different elements which can serve as an important\nbuilding block of QIP, quantum networking, precision spectroscopy, metrology,\nand quantum simulation. A geometric phase gate between a $^9$Be$^+$ ion and a\n$^{25}$Mg$^+$ ion is realized through an effective spin-spin interaction\ngenerated by state-dependent forces induced with laser beams. Combined with\nsingle-qubit gates and same-species entangling gates, this mixed-element\nentangling gate provides a complete set of gates over such a hybrid system for\nuniversal QIP. Using a sequence of such gates, we demonstrate a Controlled-NOT\n(CNOT) gate and a SWAP gate.

In the proposed scheme, referred to as the analog fountain compressive\nsensing (AFCS), each measurement is generated from a linear combination of L\nrandomly selected binary signal elements with real weight coefficients. The\nweight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called\nmeasurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution\nfunction. We propose a simple verification based reconstruction algorithm for\nthe AFCS in the noiseless case. The proposed verification based decoder is\nanalyzed through SUM-OR tree analytical approach and an optimization problem is\nformulated to find the optimum measurement degree to minimize the number of\nmeasurements required for the reconstruction of binary sparse signals.

Data of some classes is abundant making\nthem an over-represented majority, and data of other classes is scarce, making\nthem an under-represented minority. This imbalance makes it challenging for a\nclassifier to appropriately learn the discriminating boundaries of the majority\nand minority classes. In this work, we propose a cost sensitive deep neural\nnetwork which can automatically learn robust feature representations for both\nthe majority and minority classes.

Manifestations of that can be found in everyday live, where\nthe viscoelasticity in a tire needs to be balanced so it is still flexible and\ncan dissipate shock-energy, yet hard enough for energy-saving operation.\nSimilarly, the cartilage in joints needs to absorb shocks while operating at\nlow- level friction with high elasticity. Two such examples with a biological\napplicability are stiff membranes, which allow for the sliding of joints and\ntherefore maintain their function over the lifetime of the corresponding\nindividual (decades) and the softening of cell membranes, for example for\nantimicrobial effects by dissolution in the case of bacteria (seconds). While\nthe first should allow for low- friction operation at high elasticity, in the\nsecond scenario energy dissipated into the membrane eventually leads to\nmembrane destruction. Here we address the intrinsic difference between these\ntwo types of membranes, differing in stiffness and displaying different\nrelaxation behavior on the nanosecond time scale. The harder membranes show\nadditional elastic modes, capillary waves, that indicate the high degree of\nelasticity necessary for instance in cartilage or red blood cells. The energy\nof these modes is in the order of 1 micro-eV. As model systems we chose a hard\nphospholipidmembrane of SoyPC lipids and a D2O/C10E4/decane microemulsion\nsystem representing soft surfactant membranes. Our results help to explain\nproperties observed for many membranes in nature, where hard membranes\nlubricate joints or stay intact as red blood particles in tiniest capillaries,\nboth with extremely long lifetimes. Contrarily, softened membranes can be\ndestroyed easily under little shear stress within seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 06:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

The parent drop bounces several times,\nfloats and then disappears within the liquid pool without producing daughter\ndroplets. This is called complete coalescence. Another outcome is the\ngeneration of secondary droplets from the primary drop itself. This is called\npartial coalescence. Repetitions of such phenomenon as a successive\nself-similar event is also known as coalescence cascade. In a nutshell,\ncomplete coalescence is governed strongly by swallowing mechanism whereas\npartial coalescence is attributed to slippage mechanism and solutal Marangoni\nflow. Here we use high speed camera and witness that water drop coalesces\ncompletely after impacting on pool of liquid whereas drop of non-ionic\nsurfactant (TWEEN 20) coalesces partially. We also observe that number of\ndaughter droplet generation is a strong function of surfactant concentration.\nHere we utilise the images to elaborately explain both the phenomenon in a\nsequential event based approach using the basic understanding of physics. We\nobserve the transient evolution of drop morphology during each stage and find\nshape wise resemblances with many common objects. Our study reveals some\ninteresting insight on the intermediate mechanisms and enlightens distinctive\nfeatures of both the phenomena. Here we propose for the first time that\nadditional instability due to slippage of rising water layer from the\nsurfactant drop and upward thrust due to Laplace pressure helps in formation of\nsecondary droplet.

Despite the fact that the majority of\nrelated research focuses on semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS2), the\ncharacteristics of WTe2 are provoking strong interest in semimetallic TMDs with\nextremely large magnetoresistance, pressure-driven superconductivity, and the\npredicted Weyl semimetal (WSM) state.

By using a potential argument\nfirst discovered by Goles and Olivos (1980), it is known that this process\nalways converges in $O(|E|)$ rounds to a two-periodic state in which every node\neither keeps its opinion or changes it in every round.\n  It has been shown by Frischknecht, Keller, and Wattenhofer (2013) that the\n$O(|E|)$ bound on the convergence time of the deterministic binary majority\nprocess is indeed tight even for dense graphs. However, in many graphs such as\nthe complete graph, from any initial opinion assignment, the process converges\nin just a constant number of rounds.\n  By carefully exploiting the structure of the potential function by Goles and\nOlivos (1980), we derive a new upper bound on the convergence time of the\ndeterministic binary majority process that accounts for such exceptional cases.\nWe show that it is possible to identify certain modules of a graph $G$ in order\nto obtain a new graph $G^\\Delta$ with the property that the worst-case\nconvergence time of $G^\\Delta$ is an upper bound on that of $G$.

Recently, it has been pointed out that several basic features of\navalanche dynamics are induced at the microscopic level by relaxation\nprocesses, which are neglected by most models. During my thesis, I studied two\nwell-known models of avalanche dynamics, modified minimally by the inclusion of\nsome forms of relaxation.\n  The first system is that of a viscoelastic interface driven in a disordered\nmedium. In mean-field, we prove that the interface has a periodic behaviour\n(with a new, emerging time scale), with avalanche events that span the whole\nsystem. We compute semi-analytically the friction force acting on this surface,\nand find that it is compatible with classical friction experiments. In finite\ndimensions (2D), the mean-field system-sized events become local, and numerical\nsimulations give qualitative and quantitative results in good agreement with\nseveral important features of real earthquakes.\n  The second system including a minimal form of relaxation consists in a toy\nmodel of avalanches: the Directed Percolation process. In our study of a\nnon-Markovian variant of Directed Percolation, we observed that the\nuniversality class was modified but not completely. In particular, in the\nnon-Markov case an exponent changes of value while several scaling relations\nstill hold. This picture of an extended universality class obtained by the\naddition of a non-Markovian perturbation to the dynamics provides promising\nprospects for our first system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 19:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

The connection is established\nby attributing a heat density Ts to the null surfaces where T is the\nappropriate Davies-Unruh temperature and s is the entropy density. The field\nequations can be obtained from a thermodynamic variational principle which\nextremizes the total heat density of all null surfaces. The explicit form of s\ndetermines the nature of the theory. We explore the consequences of this\nparadigm for an arbitrary null surface and highlight the thermodynamic\nsignificance of various geometrical quantities. In particular, we show that:\n(a) A conserved current, associated with the time development vector in a\nnatural fashion, has direct thermodynamic interpretation in all\nLanczos-Lovelock models of gravity. (b) One can generalize the notion of\ngravitational momentum, introduced in arXiv 1506.03814 to all Lanczos-Lovelock\nmodels of gravity such that the conservation of the total momentum leads to the\nrelevant field equations. (c) The thermodynamic variational principle which\nleads to the field equations of gravity can also be expressed in terms of the\ngravitational momentum in all Lanczos-Lovelock models. (d) Three different\nprojections of gravitational momentum related to an arbitrary null surface in\nthe spacetime lead to three different equations, all of which have\nthermodynamic interpretation. The first one reduces to a Navier-Stokes equation\nfor the transverse drift velocity. The second can be written as a thermodynamic\nidentity TdS = dE + P dV. The third describes the time evolution of the null\nsurface in terms of suitably defined surface and bulk degrees of freedom. The\nimplications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 20:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 00:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

COCO is two orders\nof magnitude larger than Pascal and has four times the number of categories; so\nin all likelihood researchers will be faced with a number of new challenges. At\nthis point, without any finished round of the competition, it is difficult for\nresearchers to put their techniques in context, or in other words, to know how\ngood their results are. In order to give a little context, this note evaluates\na hypothetical object detector consisting in an oracle picking the best object\nproposal from a state-of-the-art technique. This oracle achieves a AP=0.292 in\nsegmented objects and AP=0.317 in bounding boxes, showing that indeed the\ndatabase is challenging, given that this value is the best one can expect if\nworking on object proposals without refinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 08:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

Typically, the coverage optimization for the common\nchannels is solved by spatial multiplexing, i.e. keeping the access networks\nfar apart. However, with increasing densities of wireless network deployments\n(including the Internet-of-Things) and paucity of spectrum, and new\ndevelopments like whitespace devices and self-organizing, cognitive networks,\nthere is a need to manage interference and optimize coverage by efficient\nalgorithms that correctly set the transmit powers to ensure that transmissions\nonly use the power necessary.\n  In this work we study methods for computing and optimizing\ninterference-limited coverage maps of a set of transmitters. We progress\nsuccessively through increasingly realistic network scenarios. We begin with a\ndisk model with a fixed set of transmitters and present an optimal algorithm\nfor computing the coverage map. We then enhance the model to include updates to\nthe network, in the form of addition or deletion of one transmitter. In this\ndynamic setting, we present an optimal algorithm to maintain updates to the\ncoverage map. We then move to a more realistic interference model - the SINR\nmodel. For the SINR model we first show geometric bases for coverage maps. We\nthen present a method to approximate the measure of the coverage area. Finally,\nwe present an algorithm that uses this measure to optimize the coverage area\nwith minimum total transmit power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 13:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}
