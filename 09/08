Traveling waves have indeed recently been\nshown to exist in predator-prey systems, but the direction of the wave, an\nessential item of information in the context of the control of biological\ninvasions, is generally unknown. Preliminary numerical explorations have hinted\nthat control by generalist predators might be possible for prey populations\ndisplaying logistic growth. We aimed to formalize the conditions in which\nspatial biological control can be achieved by generalists, through an\nanalytical approach based on reaction-diffusion equations. The population of\nthe focal prey - the invader - is assumed to grow according to a logistic\nfunction. The predator has a type II functional response and is present\neverywhere in the domain, at its carrying capacity, on alternative hosts.\nControl, defined as the invader becoming extinct in the domain, may result from\nspatially independent demographic dynamics or from a spatial extinction wave.\nUsing comparison principles, we obtain sufficient conditions for control and\nfor invasion, based on scalar bistable partial differential equations (PDEs).\nThe searching efficiency and functional response plateau of the predator are\nidentified as the main parameters defining the parameter space for prey\nextinction and invasion. Numerical explorations are carried out in the region\nof those control parameters space between the super-and subso-lutions, in which\nno conclusion about controllability can be drawn on the basis of analytical\nsolutions. The ability of generalist predators to control prey populations with\nlogistic growth lies in the bis-table dynamics of the coupled system, rather\nthan in the bistability of prey-only dynamics as observed for specialist\npredators attacking prey populations displaying Allee effects. The\nconsideration of space in predator-prey systems involving generalist predators\nwith a parabolic functional response is crucial. Analysis of the ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) system identifies parameter regions with\nmonostable (extinction) and bistable (extinction or invasion) dynamics. By\ncontrast, analysis of the associated PDE system distinguishes different and\nadditional regions of invasion and extinction. Depending on the relative\npositions of these different zones, four patterns of spatial dynamics can be\nidentified : traveling waves of extinction and invasion, pulse waves of\nextinction and heterogeneous stationary positive solutions of the Turing type.\nAs a consequence, prey control is predicted to be possible when space is\nconsidered in additional situations other than those identified without\nconsidering space. The reverse situation is also possible. None of these\nconsiderations apply to spatial predator-prey systems with specialist natural\nenemies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 16:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 09:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

In the regime where the\nsemiclassical mean-field theory predicts bistability, the exact steady-state\ndensity matrix is known to be unique, being a statistical mixture of two\nstates: in particular, no static hysteresis cycle of the excited population\noccurs as a function of the driving intensity. Here, we predict that in the\nquantum regime a dynamic hysteresis with a rich phenomenology does appear when\nsweeping the driving amplitude in a finite time. The hysteresis area as a\nfunction of the sweep time reveals a double power-law decay, with a behavior\nqualitatively different from the mean-field predictions. The dynamic hysteresis\npower-law in the slow sweep limit defines a characteristic time, which depends\ndramatically on the size of the nonlinearity and on the frequency detuning\nbetween the driving and the resonator. In the strong nonlinearity regime, the\ncharacteristic time oscillates as a function of the intrinsic system parameters\ndue to multiphotonic resonances. We show that the dynamic hysteresis for the\nconsidered class of driven-dissipative systems is due to a non-adiabatic\nresponse region with connections to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for quenched\nphase transitions.

We\nfirst look at it in the context of one dimensional (1-d) dynamics, where 1LPT\nis exact at the perturbative level and one can exactly resum the SPT series\ninto the 1LPT power spectrum. Shell crossings lead to non-perturbative effects,\nand the PT ignorance can be quantified in terms of their ratio, which is also\nthe transfer function squared in the absence of stochasticity. At the order of\nPT we work, this parametrization is equivalent to the results of effective\nfield theory (EFT), and can thus be expanded in terms of the same parameters.\nWe find that its radius of convergence is larger than the SPT loop expansion.\nThe same EFT parametrization applies to all SPT loop terms and, if\nstochasticity can be ignored, to all N-point correlators. In 3-d, the LPT\nstructure is considerably more complicated, and we find that LPT models with\nparametrization motivated by the EFT exhibit running with $k$ and that SPT is\ngenerally a better choice. Since these transfer function expansions contain\nfree parameters that change with cosmological model their usefulness for\nbroadband power is unclear. For this reason we test the predictions of these\nmodels on baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and other primordial\noscillations, including string monodromy models, for which we ran a series of\nsimulations with and without oscillations.

Besides the well\nknown hyperon puzzle of the physics of compact stars, a similar puzzle exists\nalso when considering delta resonances. We show that these particles appear at\ndensities close to twice saturation density and must be therefore included in\nthe calculations of the hadronic equation of state. Such an early appearance is\nstrictly related to the value of the L parameter of the symmetry energy that\nhas been found, in recent phenomenological studies, to lie in the range\n$40<L<62$ MeV. We discuss also the threshold for the formation of deltas and\nhyperons for hot and lepton rich hadronic matter. Similarly to the case of\nhyperons, also delta resonances cause a softening of the equation of state\nwhich makes it difficult to obtain massive hadronic stars. Quark stars, on the\nother hand, can reach masses up to $2.75 M_{\\odot}$ as predicted by\nperturbative QCD calculations. We then discuss the observational constraints on\nthe masses and the radii of compact stars. The tension between the precise\nmeasurements of high masses and the indications of the existence of very\ncompact stellar objects (with radii of the order of $10$ km) is relieved when\nassuming that very massive compact stars are quark stars and very compact stars\nare hadronic stars.

That is, for each time\nslot links among nodes can change arbitrarily provided that the network is\nalways connected. Tolerating dynamic topologies is crucial in face of mobility\nand unreliable communication whereas, even if identifiers are available, it\nmight be convenient to ignore them in massive networks with changing topology.\nCounting is a fundamental task in distributed computing since knowing the size\nof the system often facilitates the design of solutions for more complex\nproblems. Currently, the best upper bound proved on the running time to compute\nthe exact network size is double-exponential. However, only linear complexity\nlower bounds are known, leaving open the question of whether efficient Counting\nprotocols for Anonymous Dynamic Networks exist or not. In this paper we make a\nsignificant step towards answering this question by presenting a distributed\nCounting protocol for Anonymous Dynamic Networks which has exponential time\ncomplexity. Our algorithm ensures that eventually every node knows the exact\nsize of the system and stops executing the algorithm. Previous Counting\nprotocols have either double-exponential time complexity, or they are\nexponential but do not terminate, or terminate but do not provide running-time\nguarantees, or guarantee only an exponential upper bound on the network size.\nOther protocols are heuristic and do not guarantee the correct count.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 18:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

Traffic\ngenerated by these sensors congest traditional intra-car networks, such as CAN\nbuses. Furthermore, the large amount of wires needed to connect sensors makes\nit harder to design cars in a modular way. To alleviate these limitations, we\npropose, simulate, and implement a hybrid wired/wireless architecture, in which\neach node is connected to either a wired interface or a wireless interface or\nboth. Specifically, we propose a new protocol, called Hybrid-Backpressure\nCollection Protocol (Hybrid-BCP), to efficiently collect data from sensors in\nintra-car networks. Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus\ntechnology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor\nnetworks. Hybrid-BCP achieves high throughput and shows resilience to dynamic\nnetwork conditions, including adversarial interferences. Our testbed\nimplementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load\nbalancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS\nattacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3\nsimulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the\nperformance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based collection protocol. Notably, the\nsimulations show that Hybrid-BCP can achieve the same performance as the\ntree-based protocol while reducing the radio transmission power by a factor of\n10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 19:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

In the model, populations of stellar clusters form in the high-pressure\ndiscs of high-redshift ($z>2$) galaxies (a rapid-disruption phase due to tidal\nperturbations from the dense interstellar medium), after which the galaxy\nmergers associated with hierarchical galaxy formation redistribute the\nsurviving, massive clusters into the galaxy haloes, where they remain until the\npresent day (a slow-disruption phase due to tidal evaporation). The high galaxy\nmerger rates of $z>2$ galaxies allow these clusters to be `liberated' into the\ngalaxy haloes before they are disrupted within the high-density discs. This\nphysically-motivated toy model is the first to include the rapid-disruption\nphase, which is shown to be essential for simultaneously reproducing the wide\nvariety of properties of observed GC systems, such as their universal\ncharacteristic mass-scale, the dependence of the specific frequency on\nmetallicity and galaxy mass, the GC system mass-halo mass relation, the\nconstant number of GCs per unit supermassive black hole mass, and the colour\nbimodality of GC systems. The model predicts that most of these observables\nwere already in place at $z=1$-$2$, although under rare circumstances GCs may\nstill form in present-day galaxies. In addition, the model provides important\nconstraints on models for multiple stellar populations in GCs by putting limits\non initial GC masses and the amount of pristine gas accretion.

We present\nthe perturbation equations for both electric-led and magnetic-led rotational\nLove numbers for generic multipoles and explicitly solve them for various\ntabulated equations of state and for a tidal field with an electric (even\nparity) and magnetic (odd parity) component with $\\ell=2,3,4$. For a binary\nsystem close to the merger, various components of the tidal field become\nrelevant. In this case we find that an octupolar magnetic tidal field can\nsignificantly modify the mass quadrupole moment of a neutron star. Preliminary\nestimates, assuming a spin parameter $\\chi\\approx0.05$, show modifications\n$\\gtrsim10\\%$ relative to the static case, at an orbital distance of five\nstellar radii. Furthermore, the rotational Love numbers as functions of the\nmoment of inertia are much more sensitive to the equation of state than in the\nstatic case, where approximate universal relations at the percent level exist.\nFor a neutron-star binary approaching the merger, we estimate that the\napproximate universality of the induced mass quadrupole moment deteriorates\nfrom $1\\%$ in the static case to roughly $6\\%$ when $\\chi\\approx0.05$. Our\nresults suggest that spin-tidal couplings can introduce important corrections\nto the gravitational waveforms of spinning neutron-star binaries approaching\nthe merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 20:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 17:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 11:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-03"}

Based on this, the compound Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel is studied\nunder the spectral norm constraint and without the degradedness assumption.\nFirst, it is assumed that only the eavesdropper channel is unknown, but is\nknown to have a bounded spectral norm (maximum channel gain). The compound\nsecrecy capacity is established in a closed form and the optimal signaling is\nidentified: the compound capacity equals the worst-case channel capacity thus\nestablishing the saddle-point property; the optimal signaling is Gaussian and\non the eigenvectors of the legitimate channel and the worst-case eavesdropper\nis isotropic.

We\nstudy the expected prompt-GRB emission from magnetic reconnection and compare\nits temporal and spectral properties to observations.

In this paper, we\npropose an approach for unsupervised discovery of linguistic structure for the\ntarget spoken language given raw speech data. This linguistic structure\nincludes two-level (subword-like and word-like) acoustic patterns, the lexicon\nof word-like patterns in terms of subword-like patterns and the N-gram language\nmodel based on word-like patterns. All patterns, models, and parameters can be\nautomatically learned from the unlabelled speech corpus. This is achieved by an\ninitialization step followed by three cascaded stages for acoustic, linguistic,\nand lexical iterative optimization. The lexicon of word-like patterns defines\nallowed consecutive sequence of HMMs for subword-like patterns. In each\niteration, model training and decoding produces updated labels from which the\nlexicon and HMMs can be further updated. In this way, model parameters and\ndecoded labels are respectively optimized in each iteration, and the knowledge\nabout the linguistic structure is learned gradually layer after layer. The\nproposed approach was tested in preliminary experiments on a corpus of Mandarin\nbroadcast news, including a task of spoken term detection with performance\ncompared to a parallel test using models trained in a supervised way.

All these effects were rather\nexotic before 2000, when improvements in nanofabrication and materials control\nallowed for a new quality of hybrid structures. Guided by pioneering\ntheoretical studies, experimental progress evolved rapidly, and since 2010\ntriplet supercurrents are routinely produced and observed. We have entered a\nnew stage of studying new phases of matter previously out of our reach, and of\nmerging the hitherto disparate fields of superconductivity and spintronics to a\nnew research direction: super-spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 01:36:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 22:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

It has been found that CME apparent mass\nmeasured from the brightness enhancement in coronagraph images shows an\nincreasing trend during its evolution in the corona. However, the physics\nbehind it is not clear. Does the apparent mass gain come from the mass outflow\nfrom the dimming regions in the low corona, or from the pileup of the solar\nwind plasma around the CME when it propagates outwards from the Sun? We\nanalyzed the mass evolution of six CME events. Their mass can increase by a\nfactor of 1.6 to 3.2 from 4 to 15 Rs in the field of view (FOV) of the\ncoronagraph on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Over\nthe distance about 7 to 15 Rs, where the coronagraph occulting effect can be\nnegligible, the mass can increase by a factor of 1.3 to 1.7. We adopted the\n`snow-plough' model to calculate the mass contribution of the piled-up solar\nwind in the height range from about 7 to 15 Rs. For 2/3 of the events, the\nsolar wind pileup is not sufficient to explain the measured mass increase. In\nthe height range from about 7 to 15 Rs, the ratio of the modeled to the\nmeasured mass increase is roughly larger than 0.55. Although the ratios are\nbelieved to be overestimated, the result gives evidence that the solar wind\npileup probably makes a non-negligible contribution to the mass increase. It is\nnot clear yet whether the solar wind pileup is a major contributor to the final\nmass derived from coronagraph observations. However, our study suggests that\nthe solar wind pileup plays increasingly important role in the mass increase as\na CME moves further away from the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 03:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

We propose RainCheck Filter (RCF), a lightweight\nprimitive that guarantees bounded waiting time for clients despite server\nflooding without keeping per-client state on the server. RCF achieves strong\nwaiting time guarantees by prioritizing clients based on how long the clients\nhave waited-as if the server maintained a queue in which the clients lined up\nwaiting for service. To avoid keeping state for every incoming client request,\nthe server sends to the client a raincheck, a timestamped cryptographic token\nthat not only informs the client to retry later but also serves as a proof of\nthe client's priority level within the virtual queue. We prove that every\nclient complying with RCF can access the server in bounded time, even under a\nflash crowd incident or a DDoS attack. Our large-scale simulations confirm that\nRCF provides a small and predictable maximum waiting time while existing\nschemes cannot. To demonstrate its deployability, we implement RCF as a Python\nmodule such that web developers can protect a critical server resource by\nadding only three lines of code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 07:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The\nrelationship between the decay timescale of the disk fraction and the mass\ndissipation timescale of an individual disk, however, remains unclear. Here we\ninvestigate the effect of the disk mass function (DMF) on the evolution of the\ndisk fraction. We show that the time variation in the disk fraction depends on\nthe spread of the DMF and the detection threshold of the disk. In general, the\ndisk fraction decreases more slowly than the disk mass if a typical initial DMF\nand a detection threshold are assumed. We find that, if the disk mass decreases\nexponentially, {the mass dissipation timescale of the disk} can be as short as\n$1\\,{\\rm Myr}$ even when the disk fraction decreases with the time constant of\n${\\sim}2.5\\,{\\rm Myr}$.

The\nthermal field reveals evidence of reversing summertime asymmetries superimposed\nonto the belt/zone structure. The temperature structure that is almost\nsymmetric about the equator by 2014, with seasonal lag times that increase with\ndepth and are qualitatively consistent with radiative climate models. Localised\nheating of the tropospheric hazes (100-250 mbar) create a distinct perturbation\nto the temperature profile that shifts in magnitude and location, declining in\nthe autumn hemisphere and growing in the spring. Changes in the para-H$_2$\n($f_p$) distribution are subtle, with a 0.02-0.03 rise over the spring\nhemisphere (200-500 mbar) perturbed by (i) low-$f_p$ air advected by both the\nspringtime storm of 2010 and equatorial upwelling; and (ii) subsidence of\nhigh-$f_p$ air at northern high latitudes, responsible for a developing\nnorth-south asymmetry in $f_p$.

The optical quality characterization of a real\nmirror can be obtained via profile metrology, and the Point Spread Function of\nthe mirror can be derived via one of the standard computation methods. However,\nin practical cases it can be difficult to access the optical surfaces of\ndensely stacked mirror shells, after they have been assembled, using the\nwidespread metrological tools. For this reason, the assessment of the imaging\nresolution of a system of mirrors is better obtained via a direct,\nfull-illumination test in X-rays. If the focus cannot be reached, an\nintra-focus test can be performed, and the image can be compared with the\nsimulation results based on the metrology, if available. However, until today\nno quantitative information was extracted from a full-illumination, intra-focal\nexposure. In this work we show that, if the detector is located at an optimal\ndistance from the mirror, the intensity variations of the intra-focal,\nfull-illumination image in single reflection can be used to reconstruct the\nprofile of the mirror surface, without the need of a wavefront sensor. The\nPoint Spread Function can be subsequently computed from the reconstructed\nmirror shape. We show the application of this method to an intra-focal (8 m\ndistance from mirror) test performed at PANTER on an optical module prototype\nmade of hot-slumped glass foils with a 20 m focal length, from which we could\nderive an expected imaging quality near 16 arcsec HEW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 09:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

This non-Arrhenius behaviour is understood in terms of a model, which\nwas originally proposed for viscous flow of disordered solids and is popularly\nknown in the literature as the `shoving' model.

We define the Cauchy factor of an anisotropic material as a\ndimensionless measure of a closeness to a pure Cauchy material and a similar\nisotropic factor is as a measure for a closeness of an anisotropic material to\nits isotropic prototype. For cubic crystals, these factors are explicitly\ndisplayed and cubic crystal average of an arbitrary elastic material is\nderived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 10:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

These networks are characterized by a degree distribution of\nthe form P(k) ~ k^(-gamma) for large k. Clustering is introduced in the\nnetworks by inserting triangles, i.e., triads of connected nodes. The\ntransition from a ferromagnetic (FM) to a paramagnetic (PM) phase has been\nstudied as a function of the exponent gamma and the triangle density. For gamma\n> 3 our results are in line with earlier simulations, and a phase transition\nappears at a temperature T_c(gamma) in the thermodynamic limit (system size N\nto infinity). For gamma <= 3, a FM-PM crossover appears at a size-dependent\ntemperature T_co, so that the system remains in a FM state at any finite\ntemperature in the limit N to infinity. Thus, for gamma = 3, T_co scales as ln\nN, whereas for gamma < 3, we find T_co ~ J N^z, where the exponent z decreases\nfor increasing gamma. Adding motifs (triangles in our case) to the networks\ncauses an increase in the transition (or crossover) temperature for exponent\ngamma > 3 (or <= 3). For gamma > 3, this increase is due to changes in the mean\nvalues < k > and < k^2 >, i.e., the transition is controlled by the degree\ndistribution (nearest neighbor connectivities). For gamma <= 3, however, we\nfind that clustered and unclustered networks with the same size and\ndistribution P(k) have different crossover temperature, i.e., clustering favors\nFM correlations, thus increasing the temperature T_co.

Purpose: We present a computationally\nefficient, fully self-consistent framework to compute the QRPA transition\nstrength function of an arbitrary multipole operator in axially-deformed\nsuperfluid nuclei. Methods: The method is based on the finite amplitude method\n(FAM) QRPA, allowing fast iterative solution of QRPA equations. A numerical\nimplementation of the FAM-QRPA solver module has been carried out for deformed\nnuclei. Results: The practical feasibility of the deformed FAM module has been\ndemonstrated. In particular, we calculate the quadrupole and octupole strength\nin a heavy deformed nucleus $^{240}$Pu, without any truncations in the\nquasiparticle space. To demonstrate the capability to calculate individual QRPA\nmodes, we also compute low-lying negative-parity collective states in\n$^{154}$Sm. Conclusions: The new FAM implementation enables calculations of the\nQRPA strength function throughout the nuclear landscape. This will facilitate\nglobal surveys of multipole modes and beta decays, and will open new avenues\nfor constraining the nuclear energy density functional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 13:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Backtracking\nalgorithms explore a tree whose vertices are partial solutions to a CSP in an\nattempt to find a complete solution. Assume there is a classical backtracking\nalgorithm which finds a solution to a CSP on n variables, or outputs that none\nexists, and whose corresponding tree contains T vertices, each vertex\ncorresponding to a test of a partial solution. Then we show that there is a\nbounded-error quantum algorithm which completes the same task using O(sqrt(T)\nn^(3/2) log n) tests. In particular, this quantum algorithm can be used to\nspeed up the DPLL algorithm, which is the basis of many of the most efficient\nSAT solvers used in practice. The quantum algorithm is based on the use of a\nquantum walk algorithm of Belovs to search in the backtracking tree.

The method consists of pre-processing the TDOAs with the purpose\nof reducing the measurement noise. The complete set of TDOAs (i.e., TDOAs\ncomputed at all microphone pairs) is known to form a redundant set, which lies\non a linear subspace in the TDOA space. Noise, however, prevents TDOAs from\nlying exactly on this subspace. We therefore show that TDOA denoising can be\nseen as a projection operation that suppresses the component of the noise that\nis orthogonal to that linear subspace. We then generalize the projection\noperator also to the cases where the set of TDOAs is incomplete.

Since prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound\nnucleus, in sharp contrast with eukaryotes, the DNA may consequently be\nexpected to occupy the whole available volume when constrained to fit in the\ncell. Still, it has been known for more than half a century that the DNA is\nlocalized in a well defined region of the cell, called the nucleoid, which\noccupies only 15% to 25% of the total volume. Although this problem has focused\nthe attention of many scientists for the past decades, there is still no\ncertainty concerning the mechanism that enables such a dramatic compaction. The\ngoal of this Topical Review is to take stock of our knowledge on this question\nby listing all possible compaction mechanisms with the proclaimed desire to\nclarify the physical principles they are based upon and discuss them in the\nlight of experimental results and the results of simulations based on\ncoarse-grained models. In particular, the fundamental differences between\npsi-condensation and segregative phase separation and between the condensation\nby small and long polycations are highlighted. This review suggests that the\nimportance of certain mechanisms, like supercoiling and the architectural\nproperties of DNA-bridging and DNA-bending nucleoid proteins, may have been\noverestimated, whereas other mechanisms, like segregative phase separation and\nthe self-association of nucleoid proteins, as well as the possible role of the\nsynergy of two or more mechanisms, may conversely deserve more attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 14:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

To this\nend, given a specified structural pattern (locations of zeros/non-zeros) of the\nplant matrices, we introduce the concept of essential information patterns,\ni.e., communication patterns between outputs and inputs that satisfy the\nfollowing conditions: (i) ensure arbitrary spectrum assignment of the\nclosed-loop system, using static output feedback constrained to the information\npattern, for almost all possible plant instances with the specified structural\npattern; and (ii) any communication failure precludes the resulting information\npattern from attaining the pole placement objective in (i).\n  Subsequently, we study the problem of determining essential information\npatterns. First, we provide several necessary and sufficient conditions to\nverify whether a specified information pattern is essential or not. Further, we\nshow that such conditions can be verified by resorting to algorithms with\npolynomial complexity (in the dimensions of the state, input and output).\nAlthough such verification can be performed efficiently, it is shown that the\nproblem of determining essential information patterns is in general NP-hard.\nThe main results of the paper are illustrated through examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 14:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

For a focusing telescope like SIMBOL-X, the exposure of the\nsoft X-ray detector to the proton flux can increase significantly the\ninstrumental background, with a consequent loss of sensitivity.

We introduce an iterative solution scheme\nwhich couples hydrodynamic boundary integral methods and elastic shape\nequations to find the stationary axisymmetric shape and the velocity of an\nelastic capsule moving in a viscous fluid at low Reynolds numbers. We use this\napproach to systematically study dynamical shape transitions of capsules with\nHookean stretching and bending energies and spherical rest shape sedimenting\nunder the influence of gravity or centrifugal forces. We find three types of\npossible axisymmetric stationary shapes for sedimenting capsules with fixed\nvolume: a pseudospherical state, a pear-shaped state, and buckled shapes.\nCapsule shapes are controlled by two dimensionless parameters, the\nF\\\"oppl-von-K\\'arm\\'an number characterizing the elastic properties and a Bond\nnumber characterizing the driving force. For increasing gravitational force the\nspherical shape transforms into a pear shape. For very large bending rigidity\n(very small F\\\"oppl-von-K\\'arm\\'an number) this transition is discontinuous\nwith shape hysteresis. The corresponding transition line terminates, however,\nin a critical point, such that the discontinuous transition is not present at\ntypical F\\\"oppl-von-K\\'arm\\'an numbers of synthetic capsules. In an additional\nbifurcation, buckled shapes occur upon increasing the gravitational force. This\ntype of instability should be observable for generic synthetic capsules. All\nshape bifurcations can be resolved in the force-velocity relation of\nsedimenting capsules, where up to three capsule shapes with different\nvelocities can occur for the same driving force. All three types of possible\naxisymmetric stationary shapes are stable with respect to rotation during\nsedimentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 14:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

Since many strong outliers in semicoherent searches of LIGO data are\ncaused by transient disturbances that last only a few hours, we extend the\nnoise model to cover such limited-duration disturbances, and demonstrate\nincreased robustness in realistic simulated data. Besides long-duration CWs,\nneutron stars could also emit transient signals which, for a limited time, also\nfollow the CW signal model (tCWs). As a pragmatic alternative to specialized\ntransient searches, we demonstrate how to make standard semicoherent CW\nsearches more sensitive to transient signals. Considering tCWs in a single\nsegment of a semicoherent search, Bayesian model selection yields a new\ndetection statistic that does not add significant computational cost. On\nsimulated data, we find that it increases sensitivity towards tCWs, even of\nvarying durations, while not sacrificing sensitivity to classical CW signals,\nand still being robust to transient or persistent single-detector instrumental\nartifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 14:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 10:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

Following the\nmicroplane model framework, the constitutive laws are formulated in terms of\nstress and strain vectors acting on planes of several orientations within the\nmaterial meso-structure. The model exploits the spectral decomposition of the\northotropic stiffness tensor to define orthogonal strain modes at the\nmicroplane level. These are associated to the various constituents at the\nmesoscale and to the material response to different types of deformation.\nStrain-dependent constitutive equations are used to relate the microplane\neigenstresses and eigenstrains while a variational principle is applied to\nrelate the microplane stresses at the mesoscale to the continuum tensor at the\nmacroscale. Thanks to these features, the resulting spectral stiffness\nmicroplane formulation can easily capture various physical inelastic phenomena\ntypical of fiber and textile composites such as: matrix microcracking,\nmicro-delamination, crack bridging, pullout, and debonding. The application of\nthe model to a twill 2$\\times$2 shows that it can realistically predict its\nuniaxial as well as multi-axial behavior.

The lack of any sign of extraterrestrial intelligence,\neven though on a cosmic timescale extraterrestrial civilizations would have\nenough time to cross the galaxy, is known as Fermi's Paradox. One possible\nexplanation for Fermi's Paradox is the Zoo Hypothesis which states that one or\nmore extraterrestrial civilizations know of our existence and can reach us, but\nhave chosen not to disturb us or even make their existence known to us. I\npropose here a proactive test of the Zoo Hypothesis. Specifically, I propose to\nsend a message using television and radio channels to any extraterrestrial\ncivilization(s) that might be listening and inviting them to respond. Even\nthough I accept this is unlikely to be successful in the sense of resulting in\na response from extraterrestrial intelligences, the possibility that\nextraterrestrial civilizations are monitoring us cannot be dismissed and my\nproposal is consistent with current scientific knowledge. Besides, issuing an\ninvitation is technically feasible, cheap and safe, and few would deny the\nprofound importance of establishing contact with one or more extraterrestrial\nintelligences. A website has been set up (http://active-seti.info) to encourage\ndiscussion of this proposal and for drafting the invitation message.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 10:06:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2017 17:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

A certain type or shape of the sidewall in the\nremaining resist profile may be desired in an application, e.g., an undercut\nfor lift-off and a vertical sidewall for etching, or required for a device.\nAlso, as the feature size is decreased well below a micron, a small variation\nof the sidewall slope can lead to a significant (relative) CD error in certain\nlayers of resist. Therefore, it is important to understand effects of spatial\ndose distribution on sidewall shape and be able to achieve the desired shape.\nIn this study, via simulation, the relationship among the total dose, spatial\ndistribution of dose, developing time and sidewall shape, and performance of\nthe method developed to optimize the dose distribution for a target sidewall\nshape have been analyzed.

Initially, the\nmedium is saturated with air and then invaded by a fluid that has a hardening\neffect taking place from the interface towards the interior by contact with the\nair. To take into account that interfacial hardening, we use an IP model where\ncapillary pressures of the growth sites are increased with time. In our model,\nif a site stays for a certain time at interface, it becomes a hard site and\ncannot be invaded anymore. That represents the glue interface becoming hard due\nto exposition with the air. Buoyancy forces are included in this system through\nthe Bond number which represents the competition between the hydrostatic and\ncapillary forces. We then compare our results with results from literature of\nnon-hardening fluids in each regime of Bond number. We see that the invasion\npatterns change strongly with hardening while the non-hardening behavior\nremains basically not affected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 09:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

The light scattering studies of such dust layer by\nlaboratory experiment and numerical simulation are two important tools to\ninvestigate their physical properties. In the present work, the light scattered\nfrom a layer of dust particles, containing 0.3{\\mu}m Al2O3 at wavelength 632.8\nnm is analysed. This work has been performed by using a light scattering\ninstrument 'ellipsometer', at the Department of Physics, Assam Universiy,\nSilchar, India. Through this experiment, we generated in laboratory the\nphotometric and polarimetric phase curves of light scattered from such a layer.\nIn order to numerically simulate this data, we used Hapke's model combined with\nMie's single particle scattering properties. The perpendicular and parallel\ncomponents of single particle albedo and the phase function were derived from\nMie theory. By using the Hapke's model combined with Mie theory, the physical\nproperties of the dust grain such as grain size, optical constant (n,k) and\nwavelength can be studied through this scheme. In literature, till today no\ntheoretical model to represent polarisation caused due to scattering from rough\nsurface is available, which can successfully explain the scattering process. So\nthe main objective of this work is to develop a model which can theoretically\nestimate polarisation as caused due to scattering from rough surface and also\nto validate our model with the laboratory data generated in the present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 09:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}

The stochastic exposure distributions in\nthe resist is generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. In addition a resist\ndevelopment simulation needs to be carried out. Although there are several ways\nto simulate or estimate LER but none of them can reveal as much the inner\nrelationship between LER and different parameters as theocratical analysing\nmethods can do. In this paper, a new approach to analytically derive the LER\nbased on the statistical exposure, is described.
