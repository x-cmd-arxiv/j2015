KL cycling was invoked to\nexplain: the large eccentricities of planetary orbits; the family of close--in\nhot Jupiters; and the retrograde planetary orbits in eccentric binary systems.\nHowever, several kinds of perturbations can quench the KL instability, by\ninducing fast periapse precessions which stabilize circular orbits of all\ninclinations: these could be a Jupiter--mass planet, a massive remnant disc or\ngeneral relativistic precession. Indeed, mutual gravitational perturbations in\nmultiplanet S--type systems can be strong enough to lend a certain dynamical\nrigidity to their orbital planes.

Not requiring special physical or\ninitial conditions, binary resonant driving is generic and could have\nprofoundly altered the architecture of many S--type multiplanet systems.

The number of\naccidents is increasing at a frightening pace, necessitating the development of\na low cost automatic headlight control system to ensure safety. In most\naccident cases, fatal collisions take place due to glare generated by excessive\nheadlight intensity (high beam) of the oncoming vehicle. In this paper, a user\nfriendly controller for headlight intensity control for driving on highway at\nnight has been proposed. Aim is to design simple and affordable system that can\nalleviate effect of blind spot due to high glare on the vehicle windscreen.\nController is based on Fuzzy inference system (FIS) and used incoming light\nintensity as criteria. Also, relative distance and speed is derived using\nincoming intensity of the oncoming vehicles. The system is designed considering\nhuman tolerance levels of light intensity as the boundary values. The system\ncontrols headlight beam voltage such that; a) intensity is maintained in human\nvisual comfort zone and b) blind spot is avoided. The super user feature\nincorporated in the intensity controller offers personalized preferences to the\ndriver.

This paper presents a generalized attack regime that uses jamming\nof secure and insecure measurements to greatly expand the scope of common\n'hidden' and 'detectable' data injection attacks in literature. For 'hidden'\nattacks, it is shown that with jamming, the optimal attack is given by the\nminimum feasible cut in a specific weighted graph. More importantly, for\n'detectable' data attacks, this paper shows that the entire range of relative\ncosts for adversarial jamming and data injection can be divided into three\nseparate regions, with distinct graph-cut based constructions for the optimal\nattack. Approximate algorithms for attack design are developed and their\nperformances are demonstrated by simulations on IEEE test cases. Further, it is\nproved that prevention of such attacks require security of all grid\nmeasurements. This work comprehensively quantifies the dual adversarial\nbenefits of jamming: (a) reduced attack cost and (b) increased resilience to\nsecure measurements, that strengthen the potency of data attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 16:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Our predictions are based on estimating 3D\ncorrections to a simple, yet powerful plane magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model\nwhere the equations to be solved are reduced to a system of Hamilton equations\nin one dimension (or a collection of) which become autonomous after the pulse\nhas overcome the electrons. Experimental tests seem to be at hand. If confirmed\nby the latter, the effect would provide a new extraction and acceleration\nmechanism for electrons, alternative to traditional radio-frequency-based or\nLaser-Wake-Field ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 18:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 18:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 12:10:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 09:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 21:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

WSPEC is an instrument proposed to target these science goals. It is a\nchannelizing spectrometer realized in rectangular waveguide, fabricated using\nconventional high-precision metal machining. Each spectrometer is coupled to\nfree space with a machined feed horn, and the devices are tiled into a 2D array\nto fill the focal plane of the telescope. The detectors will be aluminum\nLumped-Element Kinetic Inductance Detectors (LEKIDs). To target the CO lines\nand SZ effect, we will have bands at 135-175 GHz and 190-250 GHz, each\nNyquist-sampled at R~200 resolution. Here we discuss the instrument concept and\ndesign, and successful initial testing of a WR10 (i.e. 90 GHz) prototype\nspectrometer. We recently tested a WR5 (180 GHz) prototype to verify that the\nconcept works at higher frequencies, and also designed a resonant backshort\nstructure that may further increase the optical efficiency. We are making\nprogress towards integrating a spectrometer with a LEKID array and deploying a\nprototype device to a telescope for first light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 18:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence is likely driven by SN\nexplosions, but it has never been demonstrated that SN explosions can establish\nand maintain a turbulent cascade inside MCs consistent with the observations.\nIn this work, we carry out a simulation of SN-driven turbulence in a volume of\n(250 pc)$^3$, specifically designed to test if SN driving alone can be\nresponsible for the observed turbulence inside MCs. We find that SN driving\nestablishes a velocity scaling consistent with the usual scaling laws of\nsupersonic turbulence, suggesting that previous idealized simulations of MC\nturbulence, driven with a random, large-scale volume force, were correctly\nadopted as appropriate models for MC turbulence, despite the artificial\ndriving. We also find that the same scaling laws extend to the interior of MCs,\nand that the velocity-size relation of the MCs selected from our simulation is\nconsistent with that of MCs from the Outer-Galaxy Survey, the largest MC sample\navailable. The mass-size relation and the mass and size probability\ndistributions also compare successfully with those of the Outer Galaxy Survey.\nFinally, we show that MC turbulence is super-Alfv\\'{e}nic with respect to both\nthe mean and rms magnetic-field strength. We conclude that MC structure and\ndynamics are the natural result of SN-driven turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 18:16:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 14:48:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The 1.3 mm continuum, C18O, and SO emission all show central\ncompact components with sizes of ~40-180 AU within more extended components.\nThe C18O component shows signs of infalling and rotational motion. By fitting\nsimple kinematic models to the C18O data, the protostellar mass is estimated to\nbe 0.05 Msun. The specific angular momentum, on a 100 AU scale, is ~4.3E-5\nkm/s*pc.

We further show that Szabo's\ngeometric spectral sequence comes from a Khovanov-Floer theory, and is thus\nfunctorial as well. In addition, we illustrate how our framework can be used to\ngive another proof that Lee's spectral sequence is functorial and that\nRasmussen's invariant is a knot invariant. Finally, we use this machinery to\ndefine some potentially new knot invariants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 19:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 13:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

The large number of well rates for each control step make the\noptimization problem more difficult and at a high risk of achieving a\nsuboptimal solution. Moreover, the optimal number of adjustments is not known a\npriori. Adjusting well controls too frequently will increase unnecessary well\nmanagement and operation cost, and an excessively low number of control\nadjustments may not be enough to obtain a good yield. We investigate three\nderivative-free optimization algorithms, chosen for their robust and parallel\nnature, to determine optimal well control strategies. The algorithms chosen\ninclude generalized pattern search (GPS), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and\ncovariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). These three\nalgorithms encompass the breadth of available black-box optimization\nstrategies: deterministic local search, stochastic global search and stochastic\nlocal search. In addition, we hybridize the three derivative-free algorithms\nwith a multiscale regularization approach. Starting with a reasonably small\nnumber of control steps, the control intervals are subsequently refined during\nthe optimization. Results for experiments studied indicate that CMA-ES performs\nbest among the three algorithms in solving both small and large scale problems.\nWhen hybridized with a multiscale regularization approach, the ability to find\nthe optimal solution is further enhanced, with the performance of GPS improving\nthe most.

In this setting, in addition to the\ntraditional energy causality constraints at the transmitters, we have the\ndecoding causality constraints at the receivers, where energy spent by the\nreceiver for decoding cannot exceed its harvested energy. We first consider the\npoint-to-point single-user problem where the goal is to maximize the total\nthroughput by a given deadline subject to both energy and decoding causality\nconstraints. We show that decoding costs at the receiver can be represented as\ngeneralized data arrivals at the transmitter, and thereby moving all system\nconstraints to the transmitter side.

While silica is an excellent glass-former with small $R_c<10^{-2}$\nK/s, pure metals and most alloys are poor glass-formers with large\n$R_c>10^{10}$ K/s. Only in the past thirty years have bulk metallic glasses\n(BMGs) been identified with $R_c$ approaching that for silica. Recent\nsimulations have shown that hard-sphere models are able to identify the atomic\nsize ratio and number fraction regime where BMGs exist with critical cooling\nrates more than 13 orders of magnitude smaller than those for pure metals.\nHowever, there are many other features of interatomic potentials beyond\nhard-core interactions.

We perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine how\nvariations in the softness and non-additivity of the repulsive core and form of\nthe interatomic pair potential at intermediate distances affect the GFA of\nbinary alloys. These variations in the interatomic pair potential allow us to\nintroduce geometric frustration and change the crystal phases that compete with\nglass formation.

Several models for producing\nscale-free networks have been obtained by now and most of them are based on the\npreferential attachment approach. We will offer the model with another\nscale-free property explanation. The main idea is to approximate the network's\nadjacency matrix by multiplication of the matrices $V$ and $V^T$, where $V$ is\nthe matrix of vertices' latent features. This approach is called matrix\nfactorization and is successfully used in the link prediction problem. To\ncreate a generative model of scale-free networks we will sample latent features\n$V$ from some probabilistic distribution and try to generate a network's\nadjacency matrix.

The symmetries and streak/vortex\nstructures are reported and their possible connections to critical layer\ndynamics examined. While some of the solutions clearly display fluctuations\nthat are localized around the critical layer (the surface on which the\nstreamwise velocity matches the wave speed of the solution), for others this\nconnection is not as clear. Dynamical trajectories along unstable directions of\nthe solutions are computed. Over certain ranges of Reynolds number, two\nsolution families are shown to lie on the basin boundary between laminar and\nturbulent flow. Direct comparison of nonlinear travelling wave solutions to\nturbulent flow in the same channel is presented. The state-space dynamics of\nthe turbulent flow are organized around one of the newly-identified travelling\nwave families, and in particular the lower branch solutions of this family are\nclosely approached during transient excursions away from the dominant\nbehaviour.

This means that for every photon-driven body force,\nthere should be a sublimation-driven analogue that affects icy bodies. Thermal\nphotons emitted from the surfaces of asymmetrically shaped bodies in the Solar\nSystem generate net torques that change the spin rates of these bodies over\ntime. The long-term averaging of this torque is called the YORP effect. Here we\npropose a sublimation-driven analogue to the YORP effect (SYORP), in which\nsublimating gas molecules emitted from the surfaces of icy bodies also generate\nnet torques on the bodies. However, sublimating molecules carry momentum away\nfrom the body at a rate ~10^4-10^5 greater than thermal photons, resulting in\nmuch greater body torques. While previous studies of sublimative torques\nfocused on emissions from highly localized sources on the surfaces of Jupiter\nFamily Comet nuclei, SYORP applies to non-localized emissions across the entire\nbody, which likely dominates sublimation-drive torques on small icy chunks and\nDynamically Young Comets, and can therefore be applied without high-resolution\nspacecraft observations of their surfaces. Instead, we repurpose the equations\nof the YORP effect to account for sublimation-driven torques. We show how an\nSYORP-driven mechanism best matches observations of the Sun-oriented lineaments\n(striae) of comet tails, whose formation mechanism has remained enigmatic for\ndecades. The SYORP effect explains why striae are observed between\nnear-perihelion and ~1 AU from the Sun for comets with perihelia less than 0.6\nAU, and solves longstanding problems with moving enough material into the\ncometary tail to form visible striae. We show that SYORP can form striae that\nmatch those of Comet West, and produce a power-law size frequency distribution\nof their parent chunks with an index of -1.4 (-1.1- 2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 22:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

To do this, we need an accurate metrological apparatus,\ncovering a very broad range of spatial frequencies, and an affordable method to\ncompute the PSF from the metrology dataset. [...] However, the separation\nbetween these spectral ranges is difficult do define exactly, and it is also\nunclear how to affordably combine the PSFs, computed with different methods in\ndifferent spectral ranges, into a PSF expectation at a given X-ray energy. For\nthis reason, we have proposed a method entirely based on the Huygens-Fresnel\nprinciple to compute the diffracted field of real Wolter-I optics, including\nmeasured defects over a wide range of spatial frequencies. Owing to the shallow\nangles at play, the computation can be simplified limiting the computation to\nthe longitudinal profiles, neglecting completely the effect of roundness\nerrors. Other authors had already proposed similar approaches in the past, but\nonly in far-field approximation, therefore they could not be applied to the\ncase of Wolter-I optics, in which two reflections occur in sequence within a\nshort range. The method we suggest is versatile, as it can be applied to\nmultiple reflection systems, at any X-ray energy, and regardless of the nominal\nshape of the mirrors in the optical system. The method has been implemented in\nthe WISE code, successfully used to explain the measured PSFs of\nmultilayer-coated optics for astronomic use, and of a K-B optical system in use\nat the FERMI free electron laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 00:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

The diffusive\ncapacity is an integral characteristic of the flow motivated by the engineering\nnotion of the productivity index (PI), Dake 1983, Raghavan 1993, Christopher et\nal. 2014. The PI characterizes the well capacity with respect to drainage area\nof the well and in general is time dependent. We study its time dynamics for\ntwo types of fluids: slightly compressible and strongly compressible fluid\n(ideal gas). In case of the slightly compressible fluid the PI stabilizes in\ntime to the specific value, determined by the so-called pseudo steady state\nsolution, Aulisa et al. 2009, 2011, 2012. Here we generalize our results from\nAulisa et al. 2012 on long term dynamics of the PI in case of arbitrary order\nof the nonlinearity of the flow.\n  In this paper we study the mathematical model of the PI for compressible gas\nflow for the first time. In contrast to slightly compressible fluid this\nfunctional mathematically speaking is not time-invariant. At the same time it\nstays \"almost\" constant for a long period of time, but then it rapidly blows up\nas time approaches the certain critical value. This value depends on the\ninitial data (initial reserves) of the reservoir. The \"greater\" are the initial\nreserves, the larger is this critical value.

The focus of this paper is to analyze the\ncomparative efficiency of this statistic, versus a simple alternative statistic\nobtained by cross-correlating the \\textit{squared} measurements, in situations\nthat deviate from such standard assumptions. We find that differences in\ndetector sensitivities have a large impact on the comparative efficiency of the\ncross-correlation detection statistic, which is dominated by the alternative\nstatistic when these differences reach one order of magnitude.

When the gauge group is simple, the weak\nmixing angle is also predictable. We address a question whether there exists a\nmodel of gauge-Higgs unification in 6-dimensional space-time, which\nsuccessfully predicts the mass ratios of the Higgs boson and weak gauge bosons.\nFirst, by use of a useful formula we give a general argument on the condition\nto get a realistic prediction of the weak mixing angle $sin^{2}theta_{W} =\n1/4$, and find that triplet and sextet representations of the minimal SU(3)\ngauge group lead to the realistic prediction. Concerning the Higgs mass, we\nnotice that in the models with one Higgs doublet, the predicted Higgs mass is\nalways the same: $M_H = 2 M_W$. However, by extending our discussion to the\nmodels with two Higgs doublets, the situation changes: we obtain an interesting\nprediction $M_{H} leq 2M_{W}$ at the leading order of the perturbation. Thus it\nis possible to recover the observed Higgs mass, 125 GeV, for a suitable choice\nof the parameter. The situation is in clear contrast to the case of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model, where $M_{H} leq M_{Z}$ at the classical level\nand the predicted Higgs mass cannot recover the observed value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 06:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 22:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 01:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 13:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Recently, Dunstan, Foster\nand Darnell [Ecol. Model. 222 (2011) 955-963] proposed using finite mixture of\nregression (FMR) models for multi-species distribution modeling, where species\nare clustered based on their environmental response to form a small number of\n\"archetypal responses.\" As an illustrative example, they applied their mixture\nmodel approach to a presence-absence data set of 200 marine organisms,\ncollected along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Little attention, however,\nwas given to the problem of model selection - since the archetypes (mixture\ncomponents) may depend on different but likely overlapping sets of covariates,\na method is needed for performing variable selection on all components\nsimultaneously. In this article, we consider using penalized likelihood\nfunctions for variable selection in FMR models. We propose two penalties which\nexploit the grouped structure of the covariates, that is, each covariate is\nrepresented by a group of coefficients, one for each component. This leads to\nan attractive form of shrinkage that allows a covariate to be removed from all\ncomponents simultaneously. Both penalties are shown to possess specific forms\nof variable selection consistency, with simulations indicating they outperform\nother methods which do not take into account the grouped structure. When\napplied to the Great Barrier Reef data set, penalized FMR models offer more\ninsight into the important variables driving species co-occurrence in the\nmarine community (compared to previous results where no model selection was\nconducted), while offering a computationally stable method of modeling complex\nspecies-environment relationships (through regularization).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 07:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

We exploit the variation of tau(dep) to constrain the\nCO-to-H2 mass conversion factor alpha(CO) at low metallicity, and assuming a\npower-law variation find alpha(CO) \\propto (Z/Zsun)^1.9, similar to results\nbased on dust continuum measurements compared with gas mass. By including HI\nmeasurements, we show that the fraction of total gas mass relative to the\nbaryonic mass is higher in galaxies that are metal poor, of low mass, and of\nhigh sSFR. Finally, comparisons of the data with star-formation models of the\nmolecular gas phases suggest that, at metallicities Z/Zsun<=0.2, there are some\ndiscrepancies with model predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 09:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

Recently, Uhm & Zhang found that the decay slopes of three\nGRB X-ray flares are steeper than what the standard model predicts. This\nrequires bulk acceleration of the emission region, which is consistent with a\nPoynting-flux-dominated outflow. In this paper, we systematically analyze a\nsample of 85 bright X-ray flares detected in 63 Swift GRBs, and investigate the\nrelationship between the temporal decay index $\\alpha$ and spectral index\n$\\beta$ during the steep decay phase of these flares. The $\\alpha$ value\ndepends on the choice of the zero time point $t_0$. We adopt two methods.\n\"Method I\" takes $t_0^I$ as the first rising data point of each flare, and is\nthe most conservative approach. We find that at 99.9% condifence level 56/85\nflares have decay slopes steeper than the simplest curvature effect prediction,\nand therefore, are in the acceleration regime. \"Method II\" extrapolates the\nrising light curve of each flare backwards until the flux density is three\norders of magnitude lower than the peak flux density, and defines the\ncorresponding time as the time zero point (t_0^II). We find that 74/85 flares\nfall into the acceleration regime at 99.9% condifence level. This suggests that\nbulk acceleration is common, may be even ubiquitous among X-ray flares,\npointing towards a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition for these events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 10:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 22:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

As these approaches correspond to different dynamical\nsystems, it can in principle be envisaged that these differences are reflect by\ncertain statistics of the turbulent flow field. The instantaneous realizations\nof the flow in the various simulations are obviously different, but, as\nexpected, the usual one-point, one-time statistics do not show any appreciable\ndifference. However, the PDF for the fluctuations of the streamwise component\nof wall friction reveals that the simulation with constant flow rate presents\nlower probabilities for extreme events of large positive friction. The low\nprobability value of such events explains their negligible contribution to the\ncommonly computed statistics; however, the very existence of a difference in\nthe PDF demonstrates that the forcing term is not entirely uninfluential. Other\nstatistics for wall-based quantities (the two components of friction and\npressure) are examined; in particular spatio-temporal autocorrelations show\nsmall differences at large temporal separations, where unfortunately the\nresidual statistical uncertainty is still of the same order of the observed\ndifference.

Social role analysis also serves practical purposes, such\nas reducing the structure of complex systems to rela- tionships among roles\nrather than alters, and enabling a comparison of social systems that emerge in\nsimilar contexts. This article presents a data-driven approach for the\ndiscovery of social roles in large scale social systems. Motivated by an\nanalysis of the present art, the method discovers roles by the conditional\ntriad censuses of user ego-networks, which is a promising tool because they\ncapture the degree to which basic social forces push upon a user to interact\nwith others. Clusters of censuses, inferred from samples of large scale network\ncarefully chosen to preserve local structural prop- erties, define the social\nroles. The promise of the method is demonstrated by discussing and discovering\nthe roles that emerge in both Facebook and Wikipedia. The article con- cludes\nwith a discussion of the challenges and future opportunities in the discovery\nof social roles in large social systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 12:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

However, the manipulation of the Kondo effect in\nnon-artificial materials has not been thoroughly studied; in particular, the\nartificial creation of the Kondo effect remains unexplored. Per this subject\nstudy, however, a new route for the optical creation of the Kondo effect in the\nnon-artificial material $p$-type semiconductor CeZn$_{3}$P$_{3}$ is presented.\nThe Kondo effect emerges under visible-light illumination of the material by a\ncontinuous-wave laser diode and is ultimately revealed by photoinduced\nelectrical resistivity, which clearly exhibits a logarithmic temperature\ndependency.

The most important are the source complexity (line\ndensity), limited spectral resolution and insufficient sideband (image)\nrejection (SRR). Dual Sideband (2SB) millimeter receivers separate upper and\nlower sideband rejecting the unwanted image by about 15 dB, but they are\ndifficult to build and, until now, only feasible up to about 500 GHz\n(equivalent to ALMA Band 8).

The new method\npromises to ease the manufacturing of 2SB receivers, dramatically increase\nsideband rejection and allow 2SB instruments at the high frequencies currently\ncovered only by Double Sideband (DSB) or bolometric detectors.

This assumes that the\nclassical motions for given initial data are unique. In fluid turbulence\nnon-uniqueness due to \"roughness\" of the advecting velocity field is known to\nlead to stochastic motion of classical particles. Vanishingly small random\nperturbations are magnified by Richardson diffusion in a \"nearly rough\"\nvelocity field so that motion remains stochastic as the noise disappears, or\nclassical spontaneous stochasticity, . Analogies between stochastic particle\nmotion in turbulence and quantum evolution suggest that there should be quantum\nspontaneous stochasticity (QSS).

This lack of precision is mainly due to the absence of energy\nterms related to the microstructural properties of the fabric and, in\nparticular, to the bending stiffness of the yarns. In this paper it is shown\nthat in the unbalanced fabrics the different bending stiffnesses of the warp\nand weft yarns produce macroscopic effects that are extremely visible as, for\nexample, the asymmetric S-shape during a Bias Extension Test (BET).\n  We propose to introduce a constrained micromorphic model and a discrete model\nthat are able to account for i) the angle variation between warp and weft tows,\nii) the unbalance in the bending stiffness of the yarns and iii) the relative\nslipping of the tows.\n  The constrained micromorphic model is framed in the spirit of the Principle\nof Virtual Powers for the equilibrium of continuum bodies. A suitable\nconstraint is introduced by means of Lagrange multipliers in the strain\nenergydens ity and the resulting constrained model tends a particular second\ngradientone. The main advantage of using such constrained micromorphic model is\nthat the kinematical and traction boundary conditions that can be imposed on\nthe boundary of the considered body take a natural and unique meaning.\n  The discrete model is set up by opportunely interconnecting Euler-Bernoulli\nbeams with different bending stiffnesses in the two directions by means of\nrotational and translational elastic springs. The main advantage of such\ndiscrete model is that the slipping of the tows is described in a rather\nrealistic way.

These models tend\nto be intensive from the computational point of view as they adopt an a priori\ndiscretization anchored to the major material heterogeneities (e.g. grains in\nparticulate materials and aggregate pieces in cementitious composites) and this\nhampers their use in the numerical simulations of large systems. In this work,\nthis problem is addressed by formulating a general multiple scale computational\nframework based on classical asymptotic analysis and that (1) is applicable to\nany discrete model with rotational degrees of freedom; and (2) gives rise to an\nequivalent Cosserat continuum. The developed theory is applied to the upscaling\nof the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), a recently formulated discrete\nmodel for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials, and the properties of the\nhomogenized model are analyzed thoroughly in both the elastic and inelastic\nregime. The analysis shows that the homogenized micropolar elastic properties\nare size-dependent, and they are functions of the RVE size and the size of the\nmaterial heterogeneity. Furthermore, the analysis of the homogenized inelastic\nbehavior highlights issues associated with the homogenization of fine-scale\nmodels featuring strain-softening and the related damage localization. Finally,\nnonlinear simulations of the RVE behavior subject to curvature components\ncausing bending and torsional effects demonstrates, contrarily to typical\nCosserat formulations, a significant coupling between the homogenized\nstress-strain and couple-curvature constitutive equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 14:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}
