A\ndispersion equation is derived describing the Alfven wave coupled with the flow\ndriven mode $\\omega= k v_0$ and solutions are discussed analytically and\nnumerically. The usual solutions for two oppositely propagating Alfv\\'en waves\nare substantially modified due to the flowing plasma. More profound is\nmodification of the solution propagating in the negative direction with respect\nto the magnetic field and the plasma flow. For a large enough flow speed\n(exceeding the Alfven speed in the static plasma), this negative solution may\nbecome non-propagating, with frequency equal to zero. In this case it\nrepresents a spatial variation of the electromagnetic field. For greater flow\nspeed it becomes a forward mode, and it may merge with the positive one. This\nmerging of the two modes represents the starting point for a flow-driven\ninstability, with two complex-conjugate solutions. The Alfven wave in\ninterpenetrating plasmas is thus modified and coupled with the flow-driven mode\nand this coupled mode is shown to be growing when the flow speed is large\nenough. The energy for the instability is macroscopic kinetic energy of the\nflowing plasma. The dynamics of plasma particles caused by such a coupled wave\nstill remains similar to the ordinary Alfven wave. This means that well-known\nstochastic heating by the Alfv\\'en wave may work, and this should additionally\nsupport the potential role of the Alfven wave in the coronal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 16:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

A minimum level of nuclear activity is thought to be necessary\n--- but not sufficient --- for planets to be habitable. Extending previous work\nthat focused on short-lived nuclei, this paper considers the delivery of\nlong-lived radioactive nuclei to circumstellar disks in star forming regions.\nAlthough the long-lived nuclear species are always present, their abundances\ncan be enhanced through multiple mechanisms. Most stars form in embedded\ncluster environments, so that disks can be enriched directly by intercepting\nejecta from supernovae within the birth clusters. In addition, molecular clouds\noften provide multiple episodes of star formation, so that nuclear abundances\ncan accumulate within the cloud; subsequent generations of stars can thus\nreceive elevated levels of radioactive nuclei through this distributed\nenrichment scenario. This paper calculates the distribution of additional\nenrichment for $^{40}$K, the most abundant of the long-lived radioactive\nnuclei. We find that distributed enrichment is more effective than direct\nenrichment. For the latter mechanism, ideal conditions lead to about 1 in 200\nsolar systems being directly enriched in $^{40}$K at the level inferred for the\nearly solar nebula (thereby doubling the abundance). For distributed enrichment\nfrom adjacent clusters, about 1 in 80 solar systems are enriched at the same\nlevel. Distributed enrichment over the entire molecular cloud is more\nuncertain, but can be even more effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 19:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

Exploiting the Specht module\nrepresentation of partitions of $N$, the Aldous' conjecture is generalized to\nall partitions (except ($N$)) in the Hasse diagram of integer $N$. Based on\nthis result, it is shown that the spectral gap of Laplacian of all induced\ngraphs corresponding to partitions (other than ($N$)) of $N$ are the same,\nwhile the spectral radius of the Laplacian is obtained from the feasible least\ndominant partition in the Hasse diagram of integer $N$. The semidefinite\nprogramming formulation of the problem is addressed analytically for $N \\leq\nd^2 + 1$ and a wide range of topologies where closed-form expressions for the\noptimal results are provided. For a quantum network with complete graph\ntopology, solution of the optimization problem based on group association\nschemes is provided for all values of $N$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 22:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 14:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-27"}

The Dependent Object Types (DOT) family of calculi has been\nproposed as a new foundation for Scala and similar languages. Unfortunately, it\nis not clear how DOT relates to any well-known type systems, and type soundness\nhas only been established for very restricted subsets. In fact, important Scala\nfeatures are known to break at least one key metatheoretic property such as\nenvironment narrowing or subtyping transitivity, which are usually required for\na type soundness proof.\n  First, and, perhaps surprisingly, we show how rich DOT calculi can still be\nproved sound. The key insight is that narrowing and subtyping transitivity only\nneed to hold for runtime objects, but not for code that is never executed.\nAlas, the dominant method of proving type soundness, Wright and Felleisen's\nsyntactic approach, is based on term rewriting, which does not a priori make a\ndistinction between runtime and type assignment time.\n  Second, we demonstrate how type soundness can be proved for advanced,\npolymorphic, type systems with respect to high-level, definitional\ninterpreters, implemented in Coq. We present the first mechanized soundness\nproof in this style for System F<: and several extensions, including mutable\nreferences.

A\ntheoretical analysis via numerical simulations involves solving Maxwell's\nEquations in discretized form and typically requires substantial computing\neffort. We start from a hybrid-parallel (MPI+OpenMP) production code that\nimplements the Time Harmonic Inverse Iteration Method (THIIM) with\nFinite-Difference Frequency Domain (FDFD) discretization. Although this\nalgorithm has the characteristics of a strongly bandwidth-bound stencil update\nscheme, it is significantly different from the popular stencil types that have\nbeen exhaustively studied in the high performance computing literature to date.\nWe apply a recently developed stencil optimization technique, multicore\nwavefront diamond tiling with multi-dimensional cache block sharing, and\ndescribe in detail the peculiarities that need to be considered due to the\nspecial stencil structure. Concurrency in updating the components of the\nelectric and magnetic fields provides an additional level of parallelism. The\ndependence of the cache size requirement of the optimized code on the blocking\nparameters is modeled accurately, and an auto-tuner searches for optimal\nconfigurations in the remaining parameter space. We were able to completely\ndecouple the execution from the memory bandwidth bottleneck, accelerating the\nimplementation by a factor of three to four compared to an optimal\nimplementation with pure spatial blocking on an 18-core Intel Haswell CPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 10:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

The strengths\nand weaknesses of the various designs for screening variables in numerical\nmodels are discussed. First, classes of factorial designs for experiments to\nestimate main effects and interactions through a linear statistical model are\ndescribed, specifically regular and nonregular fractional factorial designs,\nsupersaturated designs and systematic fractional replicate designs. Generic\nissues of aliasing, bias and cancellation of factorial effects are discussed.\nSecond, group screening experiments are considered including factorial group\nscreening and sequential bifurcation. Third, random sampling plans are\ndiscussed including Latin hypercube sampling and sampling plans to estimate\nelementary effects. Fourth, a variety of modelling methods commonly employed\nwith screening designs are briefly described. Finally, a novel study\ndemonstrates six screening methods on two frequently-used exemplars, and their\nperformances are compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 14:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

The most relevant structure of molecular gas is\nthe circumnuclear ring (CNR), a dense and clumpy ring surrounding the\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH), with a radius of ~2 pc. We propose that the CNR\nformed through the tidal disruption of a molecular cloud, and we investigate\nthis scenario by means of N-body smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations.\nWe ran a grid of simulations with different cloud mass (4X10^4, 1.3X10^5 solar\nmasses), different initial orbital velocity (v_in=0.2-0.5 v_esc, where v_esc is\nthe escape velocity from the SMBH), and different impact parameter (b=8, 26\npc). The disruption of the molecular cloud leads to the formation of very dense\nand clumpy gas rings, containing most of the initial cloud mass. If the initial\norbital velocity of the cloud is sufficiently low (v_in<0.4 v_esc, for b=26 pc)\nor the impact parameter is sufficiently small (b<10 pc, for v_in>0.5 v_esc), at\nleast two rings form around the SMBH: an inner ring (with radius ~0.4 pc) and\nan outer ring (with radius ~2-4 pc). The inner ring forms from low-angular\nmomentum material that engulfs the SMBH during the first periapsis passage,\nwhile the outer ring forms later, during the subsequent periapsis passages of\nthe disrupted cloud. The inner and outer rings are misaligned by ~24 degrees,\nbecause they form from different gas streamers, which are affected by the SMBH\ngravitational focusing in different ways. The outer ring matches several\nproperties (mass, rotation velocity, temperature, clumpiness) of the CNR in our\nGalactic centre. We speculate that the inner ring might account for the neutral\ngas observed in the central cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 15:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The MF technique utilizes\nthe latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors)\nand item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data.\nHowever, in the real world user preferences are not static but full of\ndynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time\nvarying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that\nnone of them is specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual\nuser preferences. Motivated by this, we develop a Temporal Matrix Factorization\napproach (TMF) for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent\nvector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: (i) we develop a\nmodified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent\nvector at each time step, and (ii) by the Lasso regression we learn a linear\nmodel for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our\nmethod on a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. In comparison with the\noriginal MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to\nachieve lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for both the synthetic and real\ndatasets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is\nmostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent\nvectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic dataset and\nthe Ciao dataset, there are quite a few users with that property and the\nperformance gains for these two datasets are roughly 20% and 5%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 15:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

They both allow for the expected increase in\nclaims and the fluctuations about this expected value. Importantly, the\nattribution fraction proposed in the second of these schemes is necessarily\ndifferent to that found in epidemiological studies. This ensures that the\nstatistically expected fraction of attributed claims is correctly equal to the\nexpected increase in claims. The analysis of lightning data highlights two\nparticular difficulties with data-driven, as opposed to modeled, attribution\nstudies. The first is the possibility of unknown \"confounding\" variables that\ncan influence the strike frequency.

A time-reversal procedure, involving the invertion of the\nsigns of every energy and interaction, should produce an excitation revival:\nthe Loschmidt echo (LE). If somewhat imperfect, only a fraction of the\nexcitation will refocus. We use such a procedure to show how non-inverted weak\ndisorder and interactions, when assisted by the natural reversible dynamics,\nfully degrade the LE. These perturbations enhance diffusion and evenly\ndistribute the excitation throughout the system. Such a dynamical paradigm,\ncalled ergodicity, breaks down when either the disorder or the interactions are\ntoo strong. These extreme regimes give rise to the well known Anderson\nlocalization and Mott insulating phases, where quantum diffusion becomes\nrestricted. Accordingly, regardless of the kinetic energy terms, the excitation\nremains mainly localized and out-of-equilibrium, and the system behaves\nnon-ergodically. The LE constitutes a fair dynamical witness for the whole\nphase diagram since it evidences a surprising topography in which ergodic and\nnon-ergodic phases interpenetrate each other. Furthermore, we provide an\nestimation for the critical lines separating the ergodic and non-ergodic phases\naround the Mott and Anderson transitions. The energy uncertainties introduced\nby disorder and interaction shift these thresholds towards stronger\nperturbations. Remarkably, the estimations of the critical lines are in good\nagreement with the phase diagram derived from the LE dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 22:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

Despite that, it is actually\npossible for an irrational power of an irrational number to be a rational\nnumber. For many generations, this circulated as a non-constructive proof by\ncontradiction in logic for discrete mathematics textbooks and college courses.\nSince the 80s, a constructive proof circulated orally, such as\n$\\sqrt{2}^{log_\\sqrt{2} 3}$ equals to 3. A written proof was published in 2008\nby Lord. The first contribution of this paper is to prove that there is an\nuncountable number of such pairs of irrational numbers such that the power of\none to the other is a rational number.

This fact is\nwith contradistinction to sparse system in which the number of balls is smaller\nthan the number of boxes (i.e. energy distribution in gas) in which the average\nvalue has the highest probability. Here we show that when we postulate the\nrequirement that all possible configurations of balls in the boxes have equal\nprobabilities, a realistic \"long tail\" distribution is obtained. This formalism\nwhen applied for sparse systems converges to distributions in which the average\nis preferred. We calculate some of the distributions resulted from this\npostulate and obtain most of the known distributions in nature, namely, Zipf\nlaw, Benford law, particles energy distributions, and more. Further\ngeneralization of this novel approach yields not only much better predictions\nfor election polls, market share distribution among competing companies and so\nforth, but also a compelling probabilistic explanation for Planck's famous\nempirical finding that the energy of a photon is hv.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 07:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}
