Recent\nwork in deep networks highlighted that it is easy to generate images that\nhumans would never classify as a particular object class, yet networks classify\nsuch images high confidence as that given class - deep network are easily\nfooled with images humans do not consider meaningful. The closed set nature of\ndeep networks forces them to choose from one of the known classes leading to\nsuch artifacts. Recognition in the real world is open set, i.e. the recognition\nsystem should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time. We present a\nmethodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition, by introducing a\nnew model layer, OpenMax, which estimates the probability of an input being\nfrom an unknown class. A key element of estimating the unknown probability is\nadapting Meta-Recognition concepts to the activation patterns in the\npenultimate layer of the network. OpenMax allows rejection of \"fooling\" and\nunrelated open set images presented to the system; OpenMax greatly reduces the\nnumber of obvious errors made by a deep network. We prove that the OpenMax\nconcept provides bounded open space risk, thereby formally providing an open\nset recognition solution. We evaluate the resulting open set deep networks\nusing pre-trained networks from the Caffe Model-zoo on ImageNet 2012 validation\ndata, and thousands of fooling and open set images. The proposed OpenMax model\nsignificantly outperforms open set recognition accuracy of basic deep networks\nas well as deep networks with thresholding of SoftMax probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 16:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

To this end we first\nsingle out the appropriate Free Differential Algebra containing both a gauge\n$3$-form $\\mathbf{B}^{[3]}$ and a gauge $2$-form $\\mathbf{B}^{[2]}$: then we\npresent the complete rheonomic parametrization of all the generalized\ncurvatures. This allows us to identify two-brane configurations with\nArnold-Beltrami fluxes in the transverse space with exact solutions of\nsupergravity and to analyze the Killing spinor equation in their background. We\nfind that there is no preserved supersymmetry if there are no additional\ntranslational Killing vectors. Guided by this principle we explicitly construct\nArnold-Beltrami flux two-branes that preserve $0$, $1/8$ and $1/4$ of the\noriginal supersymmetry. Two-branes without fluxes are instead BPS states and\npreserve $1/2$ supersymmetry. For each two-brane solution we carefully study\nits discrete symmetry that is always given by some appropriate crystallographic\ngroup $\\Gamma$. Such symmetry groups $\\Gamma$ are transmitted to the $D=3$\ngauge theories on the brane world--volume that occur in the gauge/gravity\ncorrespondence. Furthermore we illustrate the intriguing relation between gauge\nfluxes in two-brane solutions and hyperinstantons in $D=4$ topological\nsigma-models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 16:43:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 08:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Each word can be regarded as a gaussian mixture\ndistribution in the embedded space, and each gaussian component represents a\nword sense. Since the number of senses varies from word to word, we further\npropose the Dynamic GMSG (D-GMSG) model by adaptively increasing the sense\nnumber of words during training.

We show that the\nEQE of WSe2 devices grows with temperature, with room temperature EQE reaching\n5%, which is 250x more than the previous best performance of MoS2 and MoSe2\nquantum wells in ambient conditions. We attribute such a different temperature\ndependences to the inverted sign of spin-orbit splitting of conduction band\nstates in tungsten and molybdenum dichalcogenides, which makes the\nlowest-energy exciton in WSe2 dark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 17:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

The basic\nidea of this work is to make use of the flexibility and scalability of the\nsystem such that more benefits can be gained by efficient resource management.\nThis motivates us to propose a flexible BS power consumption model, which can\ncontrol system resources, such as antennas, frequency carriers and transmit\npower allocation in an energy efficient manner rather than the \"on/off\" binary\nsleep mode for BSs. To denote these power-saving modes, we employ the group\nsparsity of the transmit power vector instead of the {0, 1} variables. Based on\nthis power model, a semi-dynamic green resource management mechanism is\nproposed, which can jointly solve a series of resource management problems,\nincluding BS association, frequency carriers (FCs) assignment, and the transmit\npower allocation, by group sparse power control based on the large scale fading\nvalues. In particular, the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based\nalgorithm is applied to solve a stationary solution to the original non-convex\nproblem. Simulation results also verify the proposed BS power model and the\ngreen resource management mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 17:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

As the orbital motion\nundergoes periodic acceleration due to a finite orbital eccentricity, the spin\nrate oscillates around the equilibrium mean value too, giving rise to the\nforced, or eccentricity-driven, librations. Both the shape and amplitude of\nforced librations of synchronous viscoelastic planets and moons are defined by\na combination of two different types of perturbative torque, the tidal torque\nand the triaxial torque. Consequently, forced librations can be tidally\ndominated (e.g., Io and possibly Titan) or deformation-dominated (e.g., the\nMoon) depending on a set of orbital, rheological, and other physical\nparameters. With small eccentricities, for the former kind, the largest term in\nthe libration angle can be minus cosine of the mean anomaly, whereas for the\nlatter kind, it is minus sine of the mean anomaly. The shape and the amplitude\nof tidal forced librations determine the rate of orbital evolution of\nsynchronous planets and moons, i.e., the rate of dissipative damping of\nsemimajor axis and eccentricity. The known super-Earth exoplanets can exhibit\nboth kinds of libration, or a mixture thereof, depending on, for example, the\neffective Maxwell time of their rigid mantles. Our approach can be extended to\nestimate the amplitudes of other libration harmonics, as well as the forced\nlibration in non-synchronous spin-orbit resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 18:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

In 2004\nKhoury and Weltman proposed the so called chameleon field arguing that it could\nhelp avoiding experimental bounds on the WEP while having a non-trivial\ncosmological impact. In this paper we revisit the extent to which these\nexpectations continue to hold as we enter the regime of high precision tests.\nThe basis of the study is the development of a new method for computing the\nforce between two massive bodies induced by the chameleon field which takes\ninto account the influence on the field by both, the large and the test bodies.\nWe confirm that in the thin shell regime the force does depend non-trivially on\nthe test body\\' s composition, even when the chameleon coupling constants are\nuniversal. We also propose a simple criterion based on energy minimization,\nthat we use to determine which of the approximations used in computing the\nscalar field in a two body problem is better in each specific regime. As an\napplication of our analysis we then compare the resulting differential\nacceleration of two test bodies with the corresponding bounds obtained from\nE\\\"otv\\\"os type experiments. We consider two setups: 1) an Earth based\nexperiment where the test bodies are made of Be and Al; 2) the Lunar Laser\nRanging experiment. We find that for some choices of the free parameters of the\nchameleon model the predictions of the E\\\"otv\\\"os parameter are larger than\nsome of the previous estimates. As a consequence, we put new constrains on\nthese free parameters.

Two regimes are considered. First, a regime\nin which neoclassical ion poloidal flow damping is not strong enough to enhance\nthe magnitude of the polarization current (relative to that found in slab\ngeometry).

For this\nreason, semi-supervised learning remains a topic of practical importance. The\nrecently proposed Ladder Network is one such approach that has proven to be\nvery successful. In addition to the supervised objective, the Ladder Network\nalso adds an unsupervised objective corresponding to the reconstruction costs\nof a stack of denoising autoencoders. Although the empirical results are\nimpressive, the Ladder Network has many components intertwined, whose\ncontributions are not obvious in such a complex architecture. In order to help\nelucidate and disentangle the different ingredients in the Ladder Network\nrecipe, this paper presents an extensive experimental investigation of variants\nof the Ladder Network in which we replace or remove individual components to\ngain more insight into their relative importance. We find that all of the\ncomponents are necessary for achieving optimal performance, but they do not\ncontribute equally. For semi-supervised tasks, we conclude that the most\nimportant contribution is made by the lateral connection, followed by the\napplication of noise, and finally the choice of what we refer to as the\n`combinator function' in the decoder path. We also find that as the number of\nlabeled training examples increases, the lateral connections and reconstruction\ncriterion become less important, with most of the improvement in generalization\nbeing due to the injection of noise in each layer.

Examples of\nsuch loss functions include the classification error, the edit distance and the\nBLEU score. A common workaround for this problem is to instead optimize a\nemph{surrogate loss} function, such as for instance cross-entropy or hinge\nloss. In order for this remedy to be effective, it is important to ensure that\nminimization of the surrogate loss results in minimization of the task loss, a\ncondition that we call emph{consistency with the task loss}. In this work, we\npropose another method for deriving differentiable surrogate losses that\nprovably meet this requirement. We focus on the broad class of models that\ndefine a score for every input-output pair. Our idea is that this score can be\ninterpreted as an estimate of the task loss, and that the estimation error may\nbe used as a consistent surrogate loss. A distinct feature of such an approach\nis that it defines the desirable value of the score for every input-output\npair. We use this property to design specialized surrogate losses for\nEncoder-Decoder models often used for sequence prediction tasks. In our\nexperiment, we benchmark on the task of speech recognition.

When the\neigenvalues of the hidden to hidden weight matrix deviate from absolute value\n1, optimization becomes difficult due to the well studied issue of vanishing\nand exploding gradients, especially when trying to learn long-term\ndependencies. To circumvent this problem, we propose a new architecture that\nlearns a unitary weight matrix, with eigenvalues of absolute value exactly 1.\nThe challenge we address is that of parametrizing unitary matrices in a way\nthat does not require expensive computations (such as eigendecomposition) after\neach weight update.

To\nachieve our improvement, we introduce an algorithmic technique of broader\ninterest: dynamically-bucketed selective coordinate descent (DB-SCD). At each\nstep of the iterative optimization algorithm, the DB-SCD method dynamically\nbuckets the coordinates of the gradient into those of roughly equal magnitude,\nand it updates all the coordinates in one of the buckets. This\ndynamically-bucketed updating permits us to take steps along several\ncoordinates with similar-sized gradients, thereby permitting more appropriate\nstep sizes at each step of the algorithm. In particular, this technique allows\nus to use in a straightforward manner the recent analysis from the breakthrough\nresults of Allen-Zhu and Orecchia [2] to achieve our still-further improved\nbounds. More generally, this method addresses \"interference\" among coordinates,\nby which we mean the impact of the update of one coordinate on the gradients of\nother coordinates. Such interference is a core issue in parallelizing\noptimization routines that rely on smoothness properties. Since our DB-SCD\nmethod reduces interference via updating a selective subset of variables at\neach iteration, we expect it may also have more general applicability in\noptimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 01:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

However binary embedding typically requires long codes in\norder to preserve the discriminative power of the input space. Thus binary\ncoding methods traditionally suffer from high computation and storage costs in\nsuch a scenario. To address this problem, we propose Circulant Binary Embedding\n(CBE) which generates binary codes by projecting the data with a circulant\nmatrix. The circulant structure allows us to use Fast Fourier Transform\nalgorithms to speed up the computation. For obtaining $k$-bit binary codes from\n$d$-dimensional data, this improves the time complexity from $O(dk)$ to\n$O(d\\log{d})$, and the space complexity from $O(dk)$ to $O(d)$.\n  We study two settings, which differ in the way we choose the parameters of\nthe circulant matrix. In the first, the parameters are chosen randomly and in\nthe second, the parameters are learned using the data. For randomized CBE, we\ngive a theoretical analysis comparing it with binary embedding using an\nunstructured random projection matrix. The challenge here is to show that the\ndependencies in the entries of the circulant matrix do not lead to a loss in\nperformance. In the second setting, we design a novel time-frequency\nalternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections, which\nalternatively minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains. In both\nthe settings, we show by extensive experiments that the CBE approach gives much\nbetter performance than the state-of-the-art approaches if we fix a running\ntime, and provides much faster computation with negligible performance\ndegradation if we fix the number of bits in the embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 03:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2015 02:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

MmWave\ncommunication relies on highly directional transmissions and the initial access\nprocedure must thus provide a mechanism by which initial transmission\ndirections can be searched in a potentially large angular space. Design options\nare compared considering different scanning and signaling procedures to\nevaluate access delay and system overhead. The channel structure and multiple\naccess issues are also considered. The analysis demonstrates significant\nbenefits of low-resolution fully digital architectures in comparison to single\nstream analog beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 03:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 20:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}

While different from currently-popular architectures such as\nconvolutional ones, spin glasses are amenable to analysis, which provides\ninsights on the topology of the loss function and motivates algorithms to\nminimize it. Specifically, we show that a regularization term akin to a\nmagnetic field can be modulated with a single scalar parameter to transition\nthe loss function from a complex, non-convex landscape with exponentially many\nlocal minima, to a phase with a polynomial number of minima, all the way down\nto a trivial landscape with a unique minimum. AnnealSGD starts training in the\nrelaxed polynomial regime and gradually tightens the regularization parameter\nto steer the energy towards the original exponential regime.

The network complexity is controlled to\nknow their effects on the resiliency of quantized networks by retraining. The\ncomplexity of the FFDNN is controlled by varying the unit size in each hidden\nlayer and the number of layers, while that of the CNN is done by modifying the\nfeature map configuration.

Without FM, the electric\nfield almost cannot flip the electron spin; the spin-flip probability is only\nabout 20%. While under FM, the spin-flip probability can be improved to\napproximately 70%. In particular, we find that the modulation amplitude has a\nlower bound, which is related to the width of the fluctuated hyperfine field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 06:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 09:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

During energy harvesting, such networks suffer from the energy\nheterogeneity, dynamics and prediction hardness because the access to natural\nresources is often spatiotemporal different and timely changing among the\ndevices. Meanwhile, the charging efficiency is quite low especially when the\npower of the harvested energy is weak. It results in the energy waste to store\nthe harvested energy indirectly. These features bring challenging and\ninteresting issues on efficient allocation of the harvested energy. This paper\nstudies the \\emph{stochastic duty cycling} by considering these features with\nthe objective characterized by maximizing the common active time. We consider\ntwo cases: offline and online stochastic duty cycling. For the offline case, we\ndesign an optimal solution: offline duty cycling algorithm. For the online\ncase, we design an online duty cycling algorithm, which achieves the\napproximation ratio with at least $1-e^{-\\gamma^2}$, where $\\gamma$ is the\nprobability able to harvest energy. We also evaluate our algorithms with the\nexperiment on a real energy harvesting network.

The HIB has\nremarkable preferable features to release the fusion energy in inertial fusion:\nin particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~\n30-40%, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a\nrequirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be\n~50-70 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with the standard energy output of 1GW\nof electricity. The HIF reactor operation frequency would be ~10~15 Hz or so.\nSeveral- MJ HIBs illuminate a fusion fuel target, and the fuel target is\nimploded to about a thousand times of the solid density. Then the DT fuel is\nignited and burned. The HIB ion deposition range is defined by the HIB ions\nstopping length, which would be ~1 mm or so depending on the material.\nTherefore, a relatively large density-scale length appears in the fuel target\nmaterial.

The main purpose of this review\nis to focus on the key features of cosmography, emphasising both the strategy\nfor obtaining the observable cosmographic series and pointing out any drawbacks\nwhich might plague the standard cosmographic treatment. In doing so, we relate\ncosmography to the most relevant cosmological quantities and to several dark\nenergy models.

However, in the protoplanetary disk the temperature should have\ndecreased below water condensation level well before the disk was\nphotoevaporated. Thus, the global water depletion of the inner Solar System is\npuzling. We show that, even if the inner disk becomes cold, there cannot be\ndirect condensation of water. This is because the snowline moves towards the\nSun more slowly than the gas itself. The appearance of ice in a range of\nheliocentric distances swept by the snowline can only be due to the radial\ndrift of icy particles from the outer disk. However, if a sufficiently massive\nplanet is present, the radial drift of particles is interrupted, because the\ndisk acquires a superKeplerian rotation just outside of the planetary orbit.\nFrom this result, we propose that the precursor of Jupiter achieved about 20\nEarth masses when the snowline was still around 3 AU. This effectively\nfossilized the snowline at that location. Although cooling, the disk inside of\nthe Jovian orbit remained ice-depleted because the flow of icy particles from\nthe outer system was intercepted by the planet. This scenario predicts that\nplanetary systems without giant planets should be much more rich in water in\ntheir inner regions than our system. We also show that the inner edge of the\nplanetesimal disk at 0.7AU, required in terrestrial planet formation models to\nexplain the small mass of Mercury and the absence of planets inside of its\norbit, could be due to the silicate condensation line, fossilized at the end of\nthe phase of streaming instability that generated the planetesimal seeds. Thus,\nwhen the disk cooled, silicate particles started to drift inwards of 0.7AU\nwithout being sublimated, but they could not be accreted by any pre-existing\nplanetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 10:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The goal is to find an assignment to\nvariables that maximizes the number of satisfied predicates.\n  Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, we show that it is NP-hard to\napproximate Max $k$-CSP$_R$ to within factor $2^{O(k \\log k)}(\\log\nR)^{k/2}/R^{k - 1}$ for any $k, R$. To the best of our knowledge, this result\nimproves on all the known hardness of approximation results when $3 \\leq k =\no(\\log R/\\log \\log R)$. In this case, the previous best hardness result was\nNP-hardness of approximating within a factor $O(k/R^{k-2})$ by Chan. When $k =\n2$, our result matches the best known UGC-hardness result of Khot, Kindler,\nMossel and O'Donnell.\n  In addition, by extending an algorithm for Max 2-CSP$_R$ by Kindler, Kolla\nand Trevisan, we provide an $\\Omega(\\log R/R^{k - 1})$-approximation algorithm\nfor Max $k$-CSP$_R$. This algorithm implies that our inapproximability result\nis tight up to a factor of $2^{O(k \\log k)}(\\log R)^{k/2 - 1}$. In comparison,\nwhen $3 \\leq k$ is a constant, the previously known gap was $O(R)$, which is\nsignificantly larger than our gap of $O(\\text{polylog } R)$.\n  Finally, we show that we can replace the Unique Games Conjecture assumption\nwith Khot's $d$-to-1 Conjecture and still get asymptotically the same hardness\nof approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

The goal is to find a min-cost subgraph H of G\nthat connects r to each terminal t by k edge-disjoint r,t-paths. This problem\nincludes as special cases the well-known directed Steiner tree (DST) problem\n(the case k = 1) and the group Steiner tree (GST) problem. Despite having been\nstudied and mentioned many times in literature, e.g., by Feldman et al.\n[SODA'09, JCSS'12], by Cheriyan et al. [SODA'12, TALG'14] and by Laekhanukit\n[SODA'14], there was no known non-trivial approximation algorithm for k-DST for\nk >= 2 even in the special case that an input graph is directed acyclic and has\na constant number of layers. If an input graph is not acyclic, the complexity\nstatus of k-DST is not known even for a very strict special case that k= 2 and\n|T| = 2.\n  In this paper, we make a progress toward developing a non-trivial\napproximation algorithm for k-DST. We present an O(D k^{D-1} log\nn)-approximation algorithm for k-DST on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with D\nlayers, which can be extended to a special case of k-DST on \"general graphs\"\nwhen an instance has a D-shallow optimal solution, i.e., there exist k\nedge-disjoint r,t-paths, each of length at most D, for every terminal t. For\nthe case k= 1 (DST), our algorithm yields an approximation ratio of O(D log h),\nthus implying an O(log^3 h)-approximation algorithm for DST that runs in\nquasi-polynomial-time (due to the height-reduction of Zelikovsky\n[Algorithmica'97]). Consequently, as our algorithm works for general graphs, we\nobtain an O(D k^{D-1} log n)-approximation algorithm for a D-shallow instance\nof the k-edge-connected directed Steiner subgraph problem, where we wish to\nconnect every pair of terminals by k-edge-disjoint paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 12:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 16:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

Early superhumps in\nthe superoutburst light curve were absent, and a precursor was observed at the\nonset of the superoutburst for the first time in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The\npresent superoutburst can be interpreted as a result of the condition that the\ndisk radius barely reached the 3:1 resonance radius, but did not reach the 2:1\nresonance one. Ordinary superhumps immediately grew following the precursor.\nThe initial part of the outburst is indistinguishable from those of\nsuperoutbursts of ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae. This observation supports\nthe interpretation that the 2:1 resonance suppresses a growth of ordinary\nsuperhumps. The estimated superhump period and superhump period derivative are\n$P_{\\rm sh}$ = 0.0573185(11) d and $P_{\\rm dot} = +1.5(3.1) \\times 10^{-5}$,\nrespectively. These values indicate that the evolution of ordinary superhumps\nis the same as that in past superoutbursts with much larger extent. Although\nthe light curve during the plateau stage was typical for an SU UMa-type dwarf\nnova, this superoutburst showed a rebrightening, together with a regrowth of\nthe superhumps. The overall light curve of the rebrightening was the almost the\nsame as those observed in previous rebrightenings. This implies that the\nrebrightening type is inherent in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Most existing\nstudies approach this problem via training multiple viewpoint-specific models,\nand conduct head pose estimation for model selection.

To\nproduce well-founded answers, Knowledge Space Theory relies on a combinatorial\nviewpoint on the assessment of knowledge, and thus departs from common,\nnumerical evaluation. Its assessment procedures fundamentally differ from other\ncurrent ones (such as those of S.A.T. and A.C.T.). They are adaptative (taking\ninto account the possible correctness of previous answers from the student) and\nthey produce an outcome which is far more informative than a crude numerical\nmark. This chapter recapitulates the main concepts underlying Knowledge Space\nTheory and its special case, Learning Space Theory. We begin by describing the\ncombinatorial core of the theory, in the form of two basic axioms and the main\nensuing results (most of which we give without proofs). In practical\napplications, learning spaces are huge combinatorial structures which may be\ndifficult to manage. We outline methods providing efficient and comprehensive\nsummaries of such large structures. We then describe the probabilistic part of\nthe theory, especially the Markovian type processes which are instrumental in\nuncovering the knowledge states of individuals. In the guise of the ALEKS\nsystem, which includes a teaching component, these methods have been used by\nmillions of students in schools and colleges, and by home schooled students. We\nsummarize some of the results of these applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 15:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}
