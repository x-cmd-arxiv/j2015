Aim: We aim at deriving the physical properties of the jets\nin VLA16234-2417 using tracers of shocked gas. Methods: ALMA Cycle 0 Early\nScience observations of CO(2-1) in the extended configuration are presented in\ncomparison with previous SMA CO(3-2) and Herschel-PACS [OI}] 63 micron\nobservations. Gas morphology and kinematics were analysed to constrain the\nphysical structure and origin of the protostellar outflows. Results: We reveal\na collimated jet component associated with the [OI] 63 micron emission at about\n8'' (about 960 AU) from source B. This newly detected jet component is\ninversely oriented with respect to the large-scale outflow driven by source A,\nand it is aligned with compact and fast jet emission very close to source B\n(about 0.3'') rather than with the direction perpendicular to the A disk. We\nalso detect a cavity-like structure at low projected velocities, which\nsurrounds the [OI] 63 micron emission and is possibly associated with the\noutflow driven by source A. Finally, no compact outflow emission is associated\nwith source W. Conclusions: Our high-resolution ALMA observations seem to\nsuggest there is a fast and collimated jet component associated with source B.\nThis scenario would confirm that source B is younger than A, that it is in a\nvery early stage of evolution, and that it drives a faster, more collimated,\nand more compact jet with respect to the large-scale slower outflow driven by\nA. However, a different scenario of a precessing jet driven by A cannot be\nfirmly excluded from the present observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 16:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

This\ncombination yields feasible points with objective function values that are\nclose to the global optimum of several large OPF problems. Compared to an\nexisting penalization method, the combination of penalization and the moment\nrelaxations eliminates the need to specify one of the penalty parameters and\nsolves a broader class of problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 16:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This criterion was used to prove\nthat a network of identical CFS can be synchronized under sufficiently strong\nlinear diffusive coupling. A very important class of CFS consists of biological\noscillators, named after Brian Goodwin and describing self-regulated chains of\nenzymatic reactions, where the product of each reaction catalyzes the next\nreaction, while the last product inhibits the first reaction in the chain.\nGoodwin's oscillators are used, in particular, to model the dynamics of genetic\ncircadian pacemakers, hormonal cycles and some metabolic pathways. In this\npaper we point out that for Goodwin's oscillators, where the individual\nreactions have nonlinear (e.g. Mikhaelis-Menten) kinetics, the synchronization\ncriterion, obtained by Hamadeh et al., cannot be directly applied. This\ncriterion relies on the implicit assumption of the solution boundedness,\ndictated also by the chemical feasibility (the state variables stand for the\nconcentrations of chemicals). Furthermore, to test the synchronization\ncondition one needs to know an explicit bound for a solution, which generally\ncannot be guaranteed under linear coupling. At the same time, we show that\nthese restrictions can be avoided for a nonlinear synchronization protocol,\nwhere the control inputs are \"saturated\" by a special nonlinear function\n(belonging to a wide class), which guarantees nonnegativity of the solutions\nand allows to get explicit ultimate bounds for them. We prove that oscillators\nsynchronize under such a protocol, provided that the couplings are sufficiently\nstrong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 16:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 16:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-16"}

When C is abelian, the extreme pseudo-expectations coincide\nwith the homomorphisms of C into I(D) which extend the inclusion of D into\nI(D), and these are in bijective correspondence with the ideals of C which are\nmaximal with respect to having trivial intersection with D.\n  Natural classes of inclusions have a unique pseudo-expectation (e.g., when D\nis a regular MASA in C).

The fit residuals of the VLT\nspectrum by the model without IGM HI show the same systematic trend as the\nSubaru spectrum. We consider that the likely origin of the discrepancy between\nthe two teams is the difference of the wavelength ranges adopted in the\nfittings; our wavelength range is wider than that of the VLT team, and also we\navoided the shortest wavelength range of deep Ly alpha absorption (lambda_obs <\n8426 A), because this region is dominated by HI in the host galaxy and the\nsystematic uncertainty about host HI velocity distribution is large. We also\nstudy the sensitivity of these results to the adopted Ly alpha cross section\nformulae, ranging from the classical Lorentzian function to the most recent one\ntaking into account fully quantum mechanical scattering.

An even harder\nproblem is to find characterizations of families of cyclic codes in terms of\ntheir weight distributions. On the other hand, it is also well known that\ncyclic codes with few weights have a great practical importance in coding\ntheory and cryptography. In particular, cyclic codes having three nonzero\nweights have been studied by several authors, however, most of these efforts\nfocused on cyclic codes over a prime field. In this work we present a\ncharacterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of dimension 3\nover any finite field. The codes under this characterization are, indeed,\noptimal in the sense that their lengths reach the Griesmer lower bound for\nlinear codes. Consequently, these codes reach, simultaneously, the best\npossible coding capacity, and also the best possible capabilities of error\ndetection and correction for linear codes. But because they are cyclic in\nnature, they also possess a rich algebraic structure that can be utilized in a\nvariety of ways, particularly, in the design of very efficient coding and\ndecoding algorithms. What is also worth pointing out, is the simplicity of the\nnecessary and sufficient numerical conditions that characterize our class of\noptimal three-weight cyclic codes. As we already pointed out, it is a hard\nproblem to find this kind of characterizations. However, for this particular\ncase the fundamental tool that allowed us to find our characterization was the\ncharacterization for all two-weight irreducible cyclic codes that was\nintroduced by B. Schmidt and C. White (2002). Lastly, another feature about the\ncodes in this class, is that their duals seem to have always the same\nparameters as the best known linear codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 19:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

However, there exists a non-eruptive filament in\nthe plage region just next to an eruptive one in the AR, which gives us an\nopportunity to perform a comparison analysis of these two filaments. The\ncoronal magnetic field extrapolated using a CESE-MHD-NLFFF code (Jiang & Feng\n2013) reveals that two magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) exist in the same\nextrapolation box supporting these two filaments, respectively. Analysis of the\nmagnetic field shows that the eruptive MFR contains a bald-patch separatrix\nsurface (BPSS) co-spatial very well with a pre-eruptive EUV sigmoid, which is\nconsistent with the BPSS model for coronal sigmoids. The magnetic dips of the\nnon-eruptive MFRs match H{\\alpha} observation of the non-eruptive filament\nstrikingly well, which strongly supports the MFR-dip model for filaments.\nCompared with the non-eruptive MFR/filament (with a length of about 200 Mm),\nthe eruptive MFR/filament is much smaller (with a length of about 20 Mm), but\nit contains most of the magnetic free energy in the extrapolation box and holds\na much higher free energy density than the non-eruptive one. Both the MFRs are\nweakly twisted and cannot trigger kink instability. The AR eruptive MFR is\nunstable because its axis reaches above a critical height for torus\ninstability, at which the overlying closed arcades can no longer confine the\nMFR stably. On the contrary, the quiescent MFR is very firmly held by its\noverlying field, as its axis apex is far below the torus-instability threshold\nheight. Overall, this comparison investigation supports that MFR can exist\nprior to eruption and the ideal MHD instability can trigger MFR eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 20:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Our results regarding the elliptical double-shell\nstructure and the distance to this nebula are in concordance with previous\nstudies. Furthermore, we have used the software SHAPE to construct a 3D model\nof NGC~3242, allowing us to successfully reproduce our observational data. We\nconclude that the prominent knots emitting in the [N II] line are fast,\nlow-ionisation emission regions (FLIERs) related to high velocity jets and the\nso-called ansae-like features rather resemble bubbles. The disruptions immersed\nin the halo, whose emission was detected in the the [O III] high-excitation\nemission line, remarkably display high velocities and were formed likely in an\nearlier ejection event, in comparison to the innermost FLIERs and bubbles.\nFinally, according to our model, the kinematical ages of the structures in\nNGC~3242 range from 390 to 5400 yr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 20:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

We call the model ELM for \"Energy Landscape\nModel\". We postulate that the spectrum of the scattered neutrons consists of\nlines of natural width shifted from the center by fluctuations. ELM is based on\ntwo facts: Neutrons are wave packets; proteins have low-lying substates that\nform the free-energy landscape (FEL). Experiments suggest that the wave packets\nare a few hundred micrometers long. The interaction between the neutron and a\nproton in the protein takes place during the transit of the wave packet. The\nwave packet exerts the force $F(t) = dQ(t)/dt$ on the protein moiety, a part of\nthe protein surrounding the struck proton. $Q(t)$ is the wave vector (momentum)\ntransferred by the neutron wave packet to the proton during the transit. The\nensuing energy is stored in the energy landscape and returned to the neutron as\nthe wave packet exits. Kinetic energy thus is changed into potential energy and\nback. The interaction energy is proportional to $Q$, not to $Q^2$. To develop\nand check the ELM, we use published work on dehydrated proteins after reversing\nimproper normalizations. In such proteins only vibrations are active and the\neffects caused by the neutron momentum can be studied undisturbed by external\nfluctuations. ELM has predictive power.

Analytical results indicate the\nfollowing facts: (1) Under the random scheme where SCs are turned off with\ncertain probability, the expected ratio of sleeping SCs is inversely\nproportional to the traffic load of SC-layer and decreases linearly with the\ntraffic load of MBS-layer; (2) The repulsive scheme, which only turns off the\nSCs close to MBSs, is less sensitive to the traffic variations; (3) deploying\ndenser MBSs enables turning off more SCs, which may help to improve network\nenergy-efficiency.

In this paper, we investigate the power saving\nperformance of traffic shaping in an analytical way, based on the statistic\ninformation of energy arrival and traffic load.

We derive\nconditions under which arbitrary summary statistics yield consistent inference\nin the Bayesian sense, with these conditions linked to identification of the\ntrue parameters.

However, the extreme weakness of photon-photon\nscattering has hindered any attempt to observe such interactions at the level\nof single particles. Here we implement a strong optical nonlinearity using\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency and slow light, and directly measure\nthe resulting nonlinear phase shift for individual photons. This is done by\nilluminating the sample with a weak classical pulse with as few as 0.5 photons\nper pulse on average, and using post-selection to determine whether a given\npulse contained (approximately) 0 or 1 photons.

The qubits\nthat form a verification string are referred to as decoy qubits, and there\nexists a large set of different quantum states that can be used as decoy\nqubits. In the absence of noise, any choice of decoy qubits provides equivalent\nsecurity. In this paper, we examine such equivalence for noisy environment\n(e.g., in amplitude damping, phase damping, collective dephasing and collective\nrotation noise channels) by comparing the decoy-qubit assisted schemes of\nsecure quantum communication that use single qubit states as decoy qubits with\nthe schemes that use entangled states as decoy qubits. Our study reveals that\nthe single qubit assisted scheme perform better in some noisy environments,\nwhile some entangled qubits assisted schemes perform better in other noisy\nenvironments. Specifically, single qubits assisted schemes perform better in\namplitude damping and phase damping noisy channels, whereas a few\nBell-state-based decoy schemes are found to perform better in the presence of\nthe collective noise. Thus, if the kind of noise present in a communication\nchannel (i.e., the characteristics of the channel) is known or measured, then\nthe present study can provide the best choice of decoy qubits required for\nimplementation of schemes of secure quantum communication through that channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 10:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Non-thermal X-ray\nemission is ruled out at levels above 0.5% of the source luminosity.\nUnfortunately, the second XMM-Newton observation proved inconclusive in terms\nof confirming (discarding) the fast candidate spin, providing an upper limit on\nthe pulsed fraction of the source that is very close to the limiting\nsensitivity for detecting the modulation found previously. In the absence of an\nunambiguous period determination and an estimate of the magnetic field, the\nnature of the source remains open to interpretation. Its likely association\nwith the Carina cluster and its overall spectral properties (only shared by a\nhandful of other peculiar INSs) disfavour a standard evolutionary path, or one\nin which the source was previously recycled by accretion in a binary system.\nThe INS 2XMM J104608.7-594306 may be similar to Calvera (1RXS\nJ141256.0+792204), a neutron star for which the scenario of an evolved\n`anti-magnetar' has been discussed.

Anaerobic digestion is one such process that has\nbenefitted from the application of mathematical analysis not only for\ncharacterising the biological dynamics, but also to investigate emergent\nbehaviour not apparent by simulation alone. Nevertheless, the standard\nmodelling approach has been to describe biological systems using sets of\ndifferential equations whose kinetics are generally described by some\nempirically derived function of growth. The drawbacks of this are two-fold; the\ngrowth functions are derived from empirical studies that may not be\nrepresentative of the system to be modelled and whose parameters may not have a\nmechanistic meaning, and mathematical analysis is restricted by a conformity to\nan assumption of the dynamics.

This renormalization effect is missing in semiclassical\nstochastic fluctuator models and typically also in Born-Markov approaches,\nwhich try to avoid the calculation of the nonstationary, nonequilibrium state\nof the qubit plus sensor. Technically, we integrate out the current-carrying\nelectrodes to obtain kinetic equations for the joint, nonequilibrium\ndetector-qubit dynamics. We show that the sensor-current response, level\nrenormalization, cotunneling, and leading non-Markovian corrections always\nappear together and cannot be turned off individually in an experiment or\nignored theoretically. We analyze the backaction on the reduced qubit state -\ncapturing the full non-Markovian effects imposed by the sensor quantum dot on\nthe qubit - by applying a Liouville-space decomposition into quasistationary\nand rapidly decaying modes. Importantly, the sensor cannot be eliminated\ncompletely even in the simplest high-temperature, weak-measurement limit: The\nqubit state experiences an initial slip that persists over many qubit cycles\nand depends on the initial preparation of qubit plus sensor quantum dot.

In contrast, sensitive agents can decide either to live peacefully\nadjusting their way of life to the core one, or to oppose it with eventually\njoining violent activities. The interplay dynamics between peaceful and\nopponent sensitive agents is driven by pairwise interactions.

Thus, the second result proves that a significant improvement\nof any of these algorithms would lead to a surprising breakthrough in the\ndesign of approximation algorithms for Min Bisection.\n  To prove our results, we use a reduction methodology based on combining the\nclassic approach of starting with a sparse instance of 3-Sat, prepared using\nthe Sparsification Lemma, with the existence of almost linear-size\nProbabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs). Apart from our main results, we also\nobtain lower bounds excluding the existence of subexponential algorithms for\nthe Optimum Linear Arrangement problem, as well as improved, yet still not\ntight, lower bounds for Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 14:29:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 09:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-16"}

In many games humans on average do\nnot achieve maximal payoff and the behaviour of individual players remains\ninhomogeneous even after playing many rounds. For instance, in repeated\nprisoner dilemma games humans do not always optimize their mean reward and\nfrequently exhibit broad distributions of cooperativity. The reasons for these\nfailures of maximization are not known. Here we show that the dynamics\nresulting from the tendency to shift choice probabilities towards previously\nrewarding choices in closed loop interaction with the strategy of the opponent\ncan not only explain systematic deviations from 'rationality', but also\nreproduce the diversity of choice behaviours. As a representative example we\ninvestigate the dynamics of choice probabilities in prisoner dilemma games with\nopponents using strategies with different degrees of extortion and generosity.\nWe find that already a simple model for human learning can account for a\nsurprisingly wide range of human decision behaviours. It reproduces suppression\nof cooperation against extortionists and increasing cooperation when playing\nwith generous opponents, explains the broad distributions of individual choices\nin ensembles of players, and predicts the evolution of individual subjects'\ncooperation rates over the course of the games.

Furthermore, if\nthe perturbation maps (and their multiplications) satisfy $f\\in O(g)$ or $g\\in\nO(f)$, we prove the existence of and compute the stable states and the\nmetastable dynamics at all time scales where some states vanish. Conversely, if\nthe big-$O$ assumption does not hold, we build a perturbation with these maps\nand no stable state. Our algorithm also runs in cubic time despite the general\nassumptions and the additional work. Proving the correctness of the algorithm\nrelies on new or rephrased results in Markov chain theory, and on algebraic\nabstractions thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 15:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 13:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

But\nit then shows that the exact rate of depolarisation can be obtained by\nreplacing $\\partial \\hat n/\\partial\\eta$ by another derivative as suggested in\nthe Epilogue of [1], while giving a heuristic justification for the new\nderivative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 15:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-24"}

In this system, a scheduler controls the bit rate of\nthe m-quadrature amplitude modulation (m-QAM) in order to minimize the\nlong-term losses incurred by the queue overflow in the data link layer and the\ntransmission power consumption in the physical layer. The work is done in two\nsteps. Firstly, we observe the L-natural-convexity and submodularity of DP to\nprove that the optimal policy is always nondecreasing in queue occupancy/state\nand derive the sufficient condition for it to be nondecreasing in both queue\nand channel states. We also show that, due to the L-natural-convexity of DP,\nthe variation of the optimal policy in queue state is restricted by a bounded\nmarginal effect: The increment of the optimal policy between adjacent queue\nstates is no greater than one. Secondly, we use the monotonicity results to\npresent two low complexity algorithms: monotonic policy iteration (MPI) based\non L-natural-convexity and discrete simultaneous perturbation stochastic\napproximation (DSPSA).

The non-zero elements of J are drawn from a gaussian distribution with\nmean 'mu' and standard deviation . The signs of the elements J reflect the\nnature of density-dependent interactions, such as predatory-prey, mutualism or\ncompetition, and their magnitudes reflect the strength of the interaction. In\nthis study we try to uncover the broad features of the interspecies\ninteractions that determine the global robustness of this network, as indicated\nby the average number of active nodes (i.e. non-extinct species) in the\nnetwork, and the total population, reflecting the biomass yield. We find that\nthe network transitions from a completely extinct system to one where all nodes\nare active, as the mean interaction strength goes from negative to positive. We\nalso find that the total population, displays distinct non-monotonic scaling\nbehaviour with respect to the product 'mu'C, implying that survival is\ndependent not merely on the number of links, but rather on the combination of\nthe sparseness of the connectivity matrix and the net interaction strength.\nMoreover, the total population levels are optimal when the network has\nintermediate net positive connection strengths. At the local level we observe\nmarked qualitative changes in dynamical patterns, ranging from anti-phase\nclusters of period 2 cycles and chaotic bands, to fixed points, under the\nvariation of mean 'mu' of the interaction strengths. Lastly, we propose an\neffective low dimensional map to capture the behavior of the entire network,\nand this provides a broad understanding of the interplay of the local dynamical\npatterns and the global robustness trends in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 12:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}
