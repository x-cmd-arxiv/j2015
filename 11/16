I. Zelmanov asked the following question in Dniester Notebook:\n$\"$Suppose that $F_{2,m}$ is a $2$-generated associative ring with the identity\n$x^m=0$. Is it true, that the nilpotency degree of $F_{2,m}$ has exponential\ngrowth?$\"$ We show that the nilpotency degree of $l$-generated associative\nalgebra with the identity $x^d=0$ is smaller than $\\Psi(d,d,l)$, where\n$\\Phi(n,d,l)=l(nd)^{C\\log(nd)}$ and $C$ is a constant. We give the definitive\nanswer to E. I. Zelmanov by this result. It is the consequence of one fact,\nwhich is based on combinatorics of words. Let $l$, $n$ and $d\\ge n$ be positive\nintegers. Then all the words over alphabet of cardinality $l$ which length is\ngreater than $\\Psi(n,d,l)$ are either $n$-divided or contain $d$-th power of\nsubword, where a word $W$ is $n$-divided, if it can be represented in the\nfollowing form $W=W_0W_1\\dots W_n$ such that $W_n\\succ W_{n-1}\\succ\\cdots\\succ\nW_1$. The symbol $\\succ$ means lexicographical order here. A. I. Shirshov\nproved that the set of non $n$-divided words over alphabet of cardinality $l$\nhas bounded height $h$ over the set $Y$ consisting of all the words of degree\n$<n$.

This approach has already led to great advances\nat modelling which have led to modelling software which is widely known.

Since the\nunderlying finite volume scheme is still written in terms of cell averages of\nthe conserved quantities, our new approach performs the spatial WENO\nreconstruction twice: the first WENO reconstruction is carried out on the known\ncell averages of the conservative variables. The WENO polynomials are then used\nat the cell centers to compute point values of the conserved variables, which\nare converted into point values of the primitive variables. A second WENO\nreconstruction is performed on the point values of the primitive variables to\nobtain piecewise high order reconstruction polynomials of the primitive\nvariables.

We emphasize that the found behavior is directly implied by the\nstructure of the deterministic equation of motion and is not caused by\nexogenous stochastic excitation. In the scaling limit of infinitely many\nparticles, we show that the chimeric state persists. Our findings provide the\nstarting point for the search or elicitation of chimeric states in real world\nSPP systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 17:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 17:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-12"}

Although there is a closed-form solution for the KCCA\nobjective, it involves solving an $N\\times N$ eigenvalue system where $N$ is\nthe training set size, making its computational requirements in both memory and\ntime prohibitive for large-scale problems. Various approximation techniques\nhave been developed for KCCA. A commonly used approach is to first transform\nthe original inputs to an $M$-dimensional random feature space so that inner\nproducts in the feature space approximate kernel evaluations, and then apply\nlinear CCA to the transformed inputs.

Here we demonstrate that these two facts can\nwork together to allow cooperation to develop, by the strategic use of\ndeliberately ambiguous signals, covert signaling. Covert signaling is the\ntransmission of information that is accurately received by its intended\naudience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow\ncoordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or\nhostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the\nempirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling,\nsuch as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics.\nWe introduce a novel mathematical model to assess the conditions under which a\ncovert signaling strategy will be favored.

For transmission schedules dependent\nonly on the estimation error covariance at the remote estimator, this work\nestablishes structural results on the optimal scheduling which show that 1) for\nunstable systems, if the error covariance is large then a sensor will always be\nscheduled to transmit, and 2) there is a threshold-type behaviour in switching\nfrom one sensor transmitting to another. Specializing to the single sensor\ncase, these structural results demonstrate that a threshold policy (i.e.\ntransmit if the error covariance exceeds a certain threshold and don't transmit\notherwise) is optimal. We also consider the situation where sensors transmit\nmeasurements instead of state estimates, and establish structural results\nincluding the optimality of threshold policies for the single sensor, scalar\ncase. These results provide a theoretical justification for the use of such\nthreshold policies in variance based event triggered estimation. Numerical\nstudies confirm the qualitative behaviour predicted by our structural results.\nAn extension of the structural results to Markovian packet drops is also\noutlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 01:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 01:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 10:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 08:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

The origin of\nthe thermal component and the relation between ULSs and standard (broad-band\nspectrum) ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are still controversial. We\nre-examined the X-ray spectral and timing properties of the M101 ULS using\narchival Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. We show that the X-ray\ntime-variability and spectral properties are inconsistent with standard disk\nemission. The characteristic radius R_{bb} of the thermal emitter varies from\nepoch to epoch between ~10,000 km and ~100,000 km; the colour temperature\nkT_{bb} varies between ~50 eV and ~140 eV; and the two quantities scale\napproximately as R_{bb} ~ T_{bb}^{-2}. In addition to the smooth continuum, we\nalso find (at some epochs) spectral residuals well fitted with thermal plasma\nmodels and absorption edges: we interpret this as evidence that we are looking\nat a clumpy, multi-temperature outflow. We suggest that at sufficiently high\naccretion rates and inclination angles, the super-critical, radiatively driven\noutflow becomes effectively optically thick and completely thermalizes the\nharder X-ray photons from the inner part of the inflow, removing the hard\nspectral tail. We develop a simple, spherically symmetric outflow model and\nshow that it is consistent with the observed temperatures, radii and\nluminosities.

An effective\ndamping constant {\\alpha}eff is often determined experimentally from the\nspectral linewidth of the free induction decay of the magnetization after the\nsystem is excited to its non-equilibrium state. Such an {\\alpha}eff, however,\nreflects both intrinsic damping as well as inhomogeneous broadening. In this\npaper we compare measurements of the magnetization dynamics in ultrathin\nnon-epitaxial films having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using two\ndifferent techniques, time-resolved magneto optical Kerr effect (TRMOKE) and\nhybrid optical-electrical ferromagnetic resonance (OFMR). By using an external\nmagnetic field that is applied at very small angles to the film plane in the\nTRMOKE studies, we develop an explicit closed-form analytical expression for\nthe TRMOKE spectral linewidth and show how this can be used to reliably extract\nthe intrinsic Gilbert damping constant. The damping constant determined in this\nway is in excellent agreement with that determined from the OFMR method on the\nsame samples. Our studies indicate that the asymptotic high-field approach that\nis often used in the TRMOKE method to distinguish the intrinsic damping from\nthe effective damping may result in significant error, because such high\nexternal magnetic fields are required to make this approach valid that they are\nout of reach. The error becomes larger the lower is the intrinsic damping\nconstant, and thus may account for the anomalously high damping constants that\nare often reported in TRMOKE studies. In conventional ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) studies, inhomogeneous contributions can be readily distinguished from\nintrinsic damping contributions from the magnetic field dependence of the FMR\nlinewidth. Using the analogous approach, we show how reliable values of the\nintrinsic damping can be extracted from TRMOKE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 02:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nrepresentation approach by constructing mid-level words in videos and encoding\nthem on Riemannian manifold.

This\nproblem is complex because each vehicle trajectory is an infinite-dimensional\nobject and neighboring trajectories have complex interactions (e.g.,\ncar-following behavior). A parsimonious shooting heuristic algorithm is\nproposed to construct vehicle trajectories on a signalized highway segment that\ncomply with boundary conditions for vehicle arrivals, vehicle mechanical\nlimits, traffic lights and vehicle following safety. This algorithm breaks each\nvehicle trajectory into a few sections and each is analytically solvable. This\ndecomposes the original hard trajectory control problem to a simple\nconstructive heuristic. Then we slightly adapt this shooting heuristic\nalgorithm to efficiently solve a leading vehicle problem on an uninterrupted\nfreeway. To study theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms, the time\ngeography theory is generalized by considering finite accelerations. With this\ngeneralized theory, it is found that under mild conditions, these algorithms\ncan always obtain a feasible solution to the original complex trajectory\ncontrol problem. Further, we discover that the shooting heuristic solution is a\ngeneralization of the solution to the classic kinematic wave theory by\nincorporating finite accelerations. We identify the theoretical bounds to the\ndifference between the shooting heuristic solution and the kinematic wave\nsolution. Numerical experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical results\nand to draw additional insights into the potential of trajectory control in\nimproving traffic performance. Building upon this foundation, an optimization\nframework will be presented in a following paper as Part II of this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 03:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

It is found that one large-scale circulation (LSC) roll exists in each\nof the fluid layers, and that their circulation planes have two preferred\nazimuthal orientations separated by $\\sim\\pi$. A surprising finding of the\nstudy is that cessations/reversals of the LSC in FC77 of the two-layer system\noccur much more frequently than they do in single-layer turbulent RBC, and that\na cessation is most likely to result in a flow reversal of the LSC, which is in\nsharp contrast with the uniform distribution of the orientational angular\nchange of the LSC before and after cessations in single-layer turbulent RBC.\nThis implies that the dynamics governing cessations and reversals in the two\nsystems are very different. Two coupling modes, thermal coupling (flow\ndirections of the two LSCs are opposite to each other at the fluid-fluid\ninterface) and viscous coupling (flow directions of the two LSCs are the same\nat the fluid-fluid interface), are identified with the former one as the\npredominant mode. That most cessations (in the FC77 layer) end up as reversals\ncan be understood as a symmetry breaking imposed by the orientation of the LSC\nin the water layer, which remained unchanged most of the time. Furthermore, the\nfrequently occurring cessations and reversals are caused by the system\nswitching between its two metastable states, i.e. thermal and viscous coupling\nmodes. It is also observed that the strength of the LSC in water becomes weaker\nwhen the LSC in FC77 rotates faster azimuthally and that the flow strength in\nFC77 becomes stronger when the LSC in water rotates faster azimuthally, i.e.\nthe influence of the LSC in one fluid layer on the other is not symmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 08:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

The discrete decision to emit a symbol at every time step makes it\ndifficult to learn with conventional backpropagation. It is however possible to\ntrain the transducer by using a dynamic programming algorithm to generate\ntarget discrete decisions.

Interpreting the collisional motion as leaking in\nthe phase space we related our results to both chaotic scattering and the\ntheory of leaking Hamiltonian systems. We also determined the escape and\ncollisional basins and computed the corresponding escape/collisional times. We\nhope our contribution to be useful for a further understanding of the escape\nand collisional mechanism of orbits in the restricted three-body problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 09:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

To solve\nit accurately, it is necessary to apply numerical methods that are able to take\nthe individual geometry and conductivity distribution of the subject's head\ninto account. In this context, the finite element method (FEM) has shown high\nnumerical accuracy with the possibility to model complex geometries and\nconductive features, e.g., white matter conductivity anisotropy. In this\narticle, we introduce and analyze the application of a discontinuous Galerkin\n(DG) method, a finite element method that includes features of the finite\nvolume framework, to the EEG forward problem.

A wide range of $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy distributions is\nconsidered as noise source, with varying stability index $\\alpha$ and asymmetry\nparameter $\\beta$.

The larger escape periods have been measured for orbits with initial\nconditions in the vicinity of the fractal structure, while the lowest escape\nrates belong to orbits with initial conditions inside the basins of escape.

The goal of this work is to determine the potential effect of\nstellar cosmic rays on key atmospheric species of Earth-like planets orbiting\nin the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars and show corresponding changes in the\nplanetary spectra. We build upon the cosmic rays model scheme of Grenfell et\nal. (2012), who considered cosmic ray induced NOx production, by adding further\ncosmic ray induced production mechanisms (e.g. for HOx) and introducing primary\nprotons of a wider energy range (16 MeV - 0.5 TeV). Previous studies suggested\nthat planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaring\nconditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their ozone\nbiosignature is completely destroyed. Our current study shows, however, that\nadding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a decrease in atmospheric\nmethane abundance of up to 80\\%. Furthermore, the cosmic ray induced HOx\nmolecules react with NOx to produce HNO$_3$, which produces strong HNO$_3$\nsignals in the theoretical spectra and reduces NOx-induced catalytic\ndestruction of ozone so that more than 25\\% of the ozone column remains. Hence,\nan ozone signal remains visible in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with a\nweaker intensity) when incorporating the new cosmic ray induced NOx and HOx\nschemes, even for a constantly flaring M-star case. We also find that HNO$_3$\nlevels may be high enough to be potentially detectable. Since ozone\nconcentrations, which act as the key shield against harmful UV radiation, are\naffected by cosmic rays via NOx-induced catalytic destruction of ozone, the\nimpact of stellar cosmic rays on surface UV fluxes is also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 11:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

In\nthis work we employ a pump-probe type SMS technique to observe the ultrafast\nenergy relaxation in single light-harvesting complexes LH2 of purple bacteria.\nAfter excitation at 800 nm, the measured relaxation time distribution of\nmultiple complexes has a peak at 95 fs and is asymmetric, with a tail at slower\nrelaxation times. When tuning the excitation wavelength, the distribution\nchanges in both its shape and position. The observed behaviour agrees with what\nis to be expected from the LH2 excited states structure. As we show by a\nRedfield theory calculation of the relaxation times, the distribution shape\ncorresponds to the expected effect of Gaussian disorder of the pigment\ntransition energies. By repeatedly measuring few individual complexes for\nminutes, we find that complexes sample the relaxation time distribution on a\ntimescale of seconds. Furthermore, by comparing the distribution from three\nlong-lived complexes with the whole ensemble, we demonstrate that the ensemble\ncan be considered ergodic. Our findings thus agree with the commonly used\nnotion of an ensemble of identical LH2 complexes experiencing slow random\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 12:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

While\nparametric models have proven effective for this task, they cannot easily\nincorporate new training data. By contrast, nonparametric approaches, which\nbypass any learning phase and directly transfer the labels from the training\ndata to the query images, can readily exploit new labeled samples as they\nbecome available. Unfortunately, because of the computational cost of their\nlabel transfer procedures, state-of-the-art nonparametric methods typically\nfilter out most training images to only keep a few relevant ones to label the\nquery. As such, these methods throw away many images that still contain\nvaluable information and generally obtain an unbalanced set of labeled samples.\nIn this paper, we introduce a nonparametric approach to scene parsing that\nfollows a sample-and-filter strategy. More specifically, we propose to sample\nlabeled superpixels according to an image similarity score, which allows us to\nobtain a balanced set of samples. We then formulate label transfer as an\nefficient filtering procedure, which lets us exploit more labeled samples than\nexisting techniques. Our experiments evidence the benefits of our approach over\nstate-of-the-art nonparametric methods on two benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:07:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 01:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

The understanding of\nthe fluids behavior inside the pipelines is the most important consideration\nfor the engineers and scientists. From the previous studies, there are several\ntwo-phase flow patterns in horizontal pipe. One of them is stratified flow\npattern, which is characterized by the liquid flowing along the bottom of the\npipe and the gas moving above it cocurrently. Another flow patterns are slug\nand plug flow patterns. This kind of flow triggers the damage in pipelines,\nsuch as corrosion, abrasion, and blasting pipe. Therefore, slug and plug flow\npatterns are undesirable in pipelines, and the flow is maintained at the\nstratified flow condition for safety reason. In this paper, the\nanalytical-based study on the experiment of the stratified flow pattern in a 26\nmm i.d. horizontal pipe is presented. The experiment is performed to develop a\nhigh quality database of the stratified two-phase flow pattern. The\nexperimental data were obtained from the visualization data by using a high\nspeed-video camera and were processed by using digital image processing\ntechnique. Analytical method of two-fluid model was used to study the\ninterfacial behavior of the flow. The aim of this study is to validate the\nprevious correlations which are proposed by other researchers. The results show\nthat there are still many significant differences among each other. Hence,\nbetter correlation should be proposed in the future.

It has found numerous\napplications in Bayesian statistics as there are many scenarios where the\nlikelihood function is intractable but can be estimated unbiasedly using Monte\nCarlo samples. Using many samples will typically result in averages computed\nunder this chain with lower asymptotic variances than the corresponding\naverages that use fewer samples. For a fixed computing time, it has been shown\nin several recent contributions that an efficient implementation of the\npseudo-marginal method requires the variance of the log-likelihood ratio\nestimator appearing in the acceptance probability of the algorithm to be of\norder 1, which in turn usually requires scaling the number $N$ of Monte Carlo\nsamples linearly with the number $T$ of data points. We propose a modification\nof the pseudo-marginal algorithm, termed the correlated pseudo-marginal\nalgorithm, which is based on a novel log-likelihood ratio estimator computed\nusing the difference of two positively correlated log-likelihood estimators.

There are two existing general methods: tangent space PCA\nand geodesic PCA. However, unlike tangent space PCA, our torus-PCA honors the\ncyclic topology of the data space whereas, unlike geodesic PCA, our torus-PCA\nproduces a variety of non-winding, non-dense descriptors. This is achieved by\ndeforming tori into spheres and then using a variant of the recently developed\nprinciple nested spheres analysis. This PCA analysis involves a step of small\nsphere fitting and we provide an improved test to avoid overfitting. However,\ndeforming tori into spheres creates singularities. We introduce a data-adaptive\npre-clustering technique to keep the singularities away from the data. For the\nfrequently encountered case that the residual variance around the PCA main\ncomponent is small, we use a post-mode hunting technique for more fine-grained\nclustering. Thus in general, there are three successive interrelated key steps\nof torus-PCA in practice: pre-clustering, deformation, and post-mode hunting.\nWe illustrate our method with two recently studied RNA structure (tori) data\nsets: one is a small RNA data set which is established as the benchmark for PCA\nand we validate our method through this data. Another is a large RNA data set\n(containing the small RNA data set) for which we show that our method provides\ninterpretable principal components as well as giving further insight into its\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 15:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

Our analysis, using the real mobility traces, as well as\nsynthetic models, shows that the most substantial benefit is achieved at the\nfirst few hops and that after several hops the extra gain diminishes as a\nfunction of content availability and tolerated delay.

A smaller sample of 128 clumps has been observed in the SiO\n(5-4) transition with the APEX telescope to complement the SiO (2-1) line and\nprobe the excitation conditions of the emitting gas, which is the main focus of\nthe current study. We report a high detection rate of >75% of the SiO (2-1)\nline and a >90% detection rate from the dedicated follow-ups in the (5-4)\ntransition. The SiO (2-1) line with broad line profiles and high detection\nrates, is a powerful probe of star formation activity, while the ubiquitous\ndetection of SiO in all evolutionary stages suggests a continuous star\nformation process in massive clumps. We find a large fraction of infrared-quiet\nclumps to exhibit SiO emission, the majority of them only showing a\nlow-velocity component (FWHM~5-6 km/s) centred at the rest velocity of the\nclump.

Based on the line ratio of the (5-4) to\nthe (2-1) line, our study reveals a trend of changing excitation conditions\nthat lead to brighter emission in the (5-4) line towards more evolved sources.\nOur analysis delivers a more robust estimate of SiO column density and\nabundance than previous studies and questions the decrease of jet activity in\nmassive clumps as a function of age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Following this\nspirit, in this paper we present a novel and flexible zero--inflated Bayesian\nregression model. This model includes other familiar models such as the\nzero--inflated Poisson and zero--inflated geometric models, as special cases. A\nBayesian estimation method is developed as an alternative to traditionally used\nmaximum likelihood based methods to analyze such data. For a real data\ncollected from 2004 to 2005 in an Australian insurance company an example is\nprovided by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which is developed in WinBUGS\npackage. The results show that the new Bayesian method performs the previous\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 10:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-02"}
