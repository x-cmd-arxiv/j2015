Specifically, AIR is established based on the\nmodified proximal forward-backward splitting (PFBS) algorithm, and its\nconnection to the filtered data fidelity with sparsity regularization is\ndiscussed. As a result, AIR decouples data fidelity and image regularization\nwith a two-step iterative scheme, during which an AR-projection step updates\nthe filtered data fidelity term, while a denoising solver updates the sparsity\nregularization term. During the AR-projection step, the image is projected to\nthe data domain to form the data residual, and then reconstructed by certain AR\nto a residual image which is then weighted together with previous image iterate\nto form next image iterate. Intuitively since the eigenvalues of AR-projection\noperator are close to the unity, PFBS based AIR has a fast convergence. Such an\nadvantage is rigorously established through convergence analysis and numerical\ncomputation of convergence rate. The proposed AIR method is validated in the\nsetting of circular cone-beam CT with AR being FDK and total-variation sparsity\nregularization, and has improved image quality from both AR and IR.

Our approach uses the ratio of the mean free path to the\ncharacteristic system lengthscale, also known as the Knudsen number, as the\nexpansion parameter to study the effects of boundaries on the breakdown of the\nFourier descrition. We show that, in the bulk, the traditional heat conduction\nequation using Fourier's law as a constitutive relation is valid at least up to\nsecond order in the Knudsen number for steady problems and first order for\ntime-dependent problems.

A few objects\nhave amplitudes (10-90th percentile brightness) in [3.6] or [4.5]>0.2 mag; a\nmore typical amplitude is 0.1-0.15 mag. The largest color change is >0.2 mag.\nThere are 24 periodic objects, with 40% of them being flat SED class. This may\nmean that the periodic signal is primarily from the disk, not the photosphere,\nin those cases. We find 9 variables likely to be 'dippers', where texture in\nthe disk occults the central star, and 11 likely to be 'bursters', where\naccretion instabilities create brightness bursts. There are 39 objects that\nhave significant trends in [3.6]-[4.5] color over the campaign, about evenly\ndivided between redder-when-fainter (consistent with extinction variations) and\nbluer-when-fainter. About a third of the 17 Class 0 and/or jet-driving sources\nfrom the literature are variable over the YSOVAR campaign, and a larger\nfraction (~half) are variable between the YSOVAR campaign and the cryogenic-era\nSpitzer observations (6-7 years), perhaps because it takes time for the\nenvelope to respond to changes in the central source. The NGC 1333 brown dwarfs\ndo not stand out from the stellar light curves in any way except there is a\nmuch larger fraction of periodic objects (~60% of variable brown dwarfs are\nperiodic, compared to ~30% of the variables overall).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 17:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

While the need to shift to in~situ workflows has been\nacknowledged for some time, much of the current research is focused on static\nworkflows, where the analysis that would have been done as a post-process is\nperformed concurrently with the simulation at user-prescribed frequencies.\nRecently, research efforts are striving to enable adaptive workflows, in which\nthe frequency, composition, and execution of computational and data\nmanipulation steps dynamically depend on the state of the simulation. Adapting\nthe workflow to the state of simulation in such a data-driven fashion puts\nextremely strict efficiency requirements on the analysis capabilities that are\nused to identify the transitions in the workflow.

Previous attempts to sample the\ninfinitely degenerate ground states used energy minimization techniques,\nintroducing algorithmic dependence that is artificial in nature. Recently, an\nensemble theory of stealthy hyperuniform ground states was formulated to\npredict the structure and thermodynamics that was shown to be in excellent\nagreement with corresponding computer simulation results in the canonical\nensemble (in the zero-temperature limit). In this paper, we provide details and\njustifications of the simulation procedure, which involves performing molecular\ndynamics simulations at sufficiently low temperatures and minimizing the energy\nof the snapshots for both the high-density disordered regime, where the theory\napplies, as well as lower densities. We also use numerical simulations to\nextend our study to the lower-density regime. We report results for the pair\ncorrelation functions, structure factors, and Voronoi cell statistics. In the\nhigh-density regime, we verify the theoretical ansatz that stealthy disordered\nground states behave like \"pseudo\" disordered equilibrium hard-sphere systems\nin Fourier space. These results show that as the density decreases from the\nhigh-density limit, the disordered ground states in the canonical ensemble are\ncharacterized by an increasing degree of short-range order and eventually the\nsystem undergoes a phase transition to crystalline ground states. We also\nprovide numerical evidence suggesting that different forms of stealthy pair\npotentials produce the same ground-state ensemble in the zero-temperature\nlimit. Our techniques may be applied to sample this limit of the canonical\nensemble of other potentials with highly degenerate ground states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 19:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

Firstly, we present a method to\ntransform a set of time series into a network using different distance\nfunctions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most\nsimilar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to\nidentify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and,\nconsequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a\ncomprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series\ndistance functions, network generation methods and community detection\ntechniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed\nnetwork-based approach achieves better results than various classic or\nup-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm\nthat the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such\nas $k$-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data\nsets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns\npresented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying\nnetwork constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other\ntechniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is\nrobust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time\nshifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed\nmethod is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to\ntopological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only\nfor time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 19:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

Related theoretical works disagree on whether or not\nstrong-coupling superconductivity is required to explain such effects, and\nwhether a critical interaction strength exists. In this work, we consider\nvarious versions of the model problem of pairing of electrons in the presence\nof an incipient band, within a simple multiband weak-coupling BCS\napproximation. We categorize the problem into two cases: case(I) where\nsuperconductivity arises from the \"incipient band pairing\" alone, and case(II)\nwhere it is induced on an incipient band by pairing due to Fermi-surface based\ninteractions. Negative conclusions regarding the importance of incipient bands\nhave been drawn so far largely based on case(I), but we show explicitly that\nmodels under case(II) are qualitatively different, and can explain the\nnon-exponential suppression of Tc, as well as robust large gaps on an incipient\nband. In the latter situation, large gaps on the incipient band do not require\na critical interaction strength. We also model the interplay between phonon and\nspin fluctuation driven superconductivity and describe the bootstrap of\nelectron-phonon superconductivity by spin fluctuations coupling the incipient\nand the regular bands. Finally, we discuss the effect of the dimensionality of\nthe incipient band on our results. We argue that pairing on incipient bands may\nbe significant and important in several Fe-based materials, including LiFeAs,\nFeSe intercalates and FeSe monolayers on strontium titanate, and indeed may\ncontribute to high critical temperatures in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 20:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

Following our earlier\ntheoretical study of charging effects on nanoscale confinement and squeezout of\na model IL, we present here molecular dynamics simulations of the frictional\nand lubrication properties of that model under charging conditions.First we\ndescribe the case when two equally charged plates slide while being held\ntogether to a confinement distance of a few molecular layers.The shear sliding\nstress is found to rise as the number of IL layers decreases stepwise. However\nthe shear stress shows, within each given number of layers, only a weak\ndependence upon the precise value of the normal load, a result in agreement\nwith data extracted from recent experiments.We subsequently describe the case\nof opposite charging of the sliding plates, and follow the shear stress when\nthe charging is slowly and adiabatically reversed in the course of time, under\nfixed load. Despite the fixed load, the number and structure of the confined IL\nlayers changes with changing charge, and that in turn drives strong friction\nvariations. The latter involve first of all charging-induced freezing of the IL\nfilm, followed by a discharging-induced melting, both made possible by the\nnanoscale confinement. Another mechanism for charging-induced frictional\nchanges is a shift of the plane of maximum shear from mid-film to the\nplate-film interface, and viceversa. While these occurrences and results\ninvariably depend upon the parameters of the model IL and upon its specific\ninteraction with the plates, the present study helps identifying a variety of\npossible behavior, obtained under very simple assumptions, while connecting it\nto an underlying equilibrium thermodynamics picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 21:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

In the context of \"bathtub\"-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads\nto mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR.

More massive BCGs tend to inhabit denser regions and more massive\nclusters than lower mass BCGs. Furthermore, cDs, which are BCGs with\nparticularly extended envelopes, seem to prefer marginally denser regions and\ntend to be hosted by more massive halos than elliptical BCGs. cD and elliptical\nBCGs show parallel positive correlations between their stellar masses and\nenvironmental densities. However, at a fixed environmental density, cDs are, on\naverage, ~40% more massive. Our results, together with the findings of previous\nstudies, suggest an evolutionary link between elliptical and cD BCGs. We\nsuggest that most present-day cDs started their life as ellipticals, which\nsubsequently grew in stellar mass and size due to mergers. In this process, the\ncD envelope developed. The large scatter in the stellar masses and sizes of the\ncDs reflects their different merger histories. The growth of the BCGs in mass\nand size seems to be linked to the hierarchical growth of the structures they\ninhabit: as the groups and clusters became denser and more massive, the BCGs at\ntheir centres also grew. This process is nearing completion since the majority\n(~60%) of the BCGs in the local Universe have cD morphology.

By\nusing a phenomenological equation of state (EOS) \"CRover\" which interpolates\nthe two phases at around 3 times the nuclear matter density, it is found that\nthe cold NSs with the gravitational mass larger than 2-solarmass can be\nsustained. This is in sharp contrast to the case of the first-order\nhadron-quark transition. The radii of the cold NSs with the CRover EOS are in\nthe narrow range which is insensitive to the NS masses. Due to the stiffening\nof the EOS induced by the hadron-quark crossover, the central density of the\nNSs is at most 4 times the nuclear matter density and the hyperon-mixing barely\noccurs inside the NS core.

We\ndemonstrate a structure for providing suitable practice that can be applied in\nany instructional setting that involves the acquisition of data and relating\nthat data to scientific models. This study reports the results of applying that\nstructure in an introductory physics lab course. Students in an experimental\ncondition were repeatedly instructed to make and act on quantitative\ncomparisons between datasets, and between data and models, an approach that is\ncommon to all science disciplines. These instructions were slowly faded across\nthe course. After the instructions had been removed, students in the\nexperimental condition were 12 times more likely to spontaneously propose or\nmake changes to improve their experimental methods than a control group, who\nperformed traditional experimental activities. They were also four times more\nlikely to identify and explain a limitation of a physical model using their\ndata. Students in the experimental condition also showed much more\nsophisticated reasoning about their data. These differences between the groups\nwere seen to persist into a subsequent course taken the following year.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 03:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

Because its mechanism is based on information obtained from only a\nsingle chain, SAA may present slow convergence in complex optimisation\nproblems.

Similarity-based\nanomaly detection algorithms detect abnormally large amounts of similarity or\ndissimilarity, e.g.~as measured by nearest neighbor Euclidean distances between\na test sample and the training samples. In many application domains there may\nnot exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous\npatterns. In such cases, multiple dissimilarity measures can be defined,\nincluding non-metric measures, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing\nusing a non-negative linear combination of them. If the relative importance of\nthe different dissimilarity measures are not known in advance, as in many\nanomaly detection applications, the anomaly detection algorithm may need to be\nexecuted multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear\ncombination. In this paper, we propose a method for similarity-based anomaly\ndetection using a novel multi-criteria dissimilarity measure, the Pareto depth.\nThe proposed Pareto depth analysis (PDA) anomaly detection algorithm uses the\nconcept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria\nwithout having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of\nweights.

In 3D\nultrasound imaging, 2D transducer arrays rather than 1D arrays are used, and\nmore scan-lines are needed. This implies that the amount of sampled data is\nvastly increased with respect to 2D imaging.

In the last five years the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\ninstrument detected GeV {\\gamma}-ray emission from five novae.

Aims.\nWe aim to explore the very-high-energy domain to search for {\\gamma}-ray\nemission above 50 GeV and to shed light on the acceleration process of leptons\nand hadrons in nova explosions. Methods. We have performed observations with\nthe MAGIC telescopes of the classical nova V339 Del shortly after the 2013\noutburst, triggered by optical and subsequent GeV {\\gamma}-ray detec- tions.

A typical passive approach periodically\ncheckpoints a processing task's runtime states and can recover a failed task by\nrestoring its runtime state using its latest checkpoint. On the other hand, an\nactive approach usually employs backup nodes to run replicated tasks. Upon\nfailure, the active replica can take over the processing of the failed task\nwith minimal latency. However, both approaches have their own inadequacies in\nMassively Parallel Stream Processing Engines (MPSPE). The passive approach\nincurs a long recovery latency especially when a number of correlated nodes\nfail simultaneously, while the active approach requires extra replication\nresources. In this paper, we propose a new fault-tolerance framework, which is\nPassive and Partially Active (PPA). In a PPA scheme, the passive approach is\napplied to all tasks while only a selected set of tasks will be actively\nreplicated. The number of actively replicated tasks depends on the available\nresources. If tasks without active replicas fail, tentative outputs will be\ngenerated before the completion of the recovery process.

Applications of this work include estimating the number of sensor\ndevices, online social users, active protein cells, etc. In anonymous graphs,\neach node possesses little or non-existing information on the network topology.\nIn particular, this paper assumes that each node only knows its unique\nidentifier. The aim is to estimate the cardinality of the graph and the\nneighbours of each node by querying a small portion of them. While the former\nallows the design of more efficient coding schemes for the network, the second\nprovides a reliable way for routing packets. As a reference for comparison,\nthis work considers the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). For dense\ngraphs and specific running times, the proposed algorithm produces a\ncardinality estimate proportional to the BLUE. Furthermore, for an arbitrary\nnumber of iterations, the estimate converges to the BLUE as the number of\nqueried nodes tends to the total number of nodes in the network. Simulation\nresults confirm the theoretical results by revealing that, for a moderate\nrunning time, asking a small group of nodes is sufficient to perform an\nestimation of 95% of the whole network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 08:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

ICA over finite fields is a special\ncase of ICA in which both the observations and the independent components are\nover a finite alphabet. In this work we consider a generalization of this\nframework in which an observation vector is decomposed to its independent\ncomponents (as much as possible) with no prior assumption on the way it was\ngenerated. This generalization is also known as Barlow's minimal redundancy\nrepresentation problem and is considered an open problem. We propose several\ntheorems and show that this NP hard problem can be accurately solved with a\nbranch and bound search tree algorithm, or tightly approximated with a series\nof linear problems. Our contribution provides the first efficient and\nconstructive set of solutions to Barlow's problem.The minimal redundancy\nrepresentation (also known as factorial code) has many applications, mainly in\nthe fields of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The Binary ICA (BICA) is also\nshown to have applications in several domains including medical diagnosis,\nmulti-cluster assignment, network tomography and internet resource management.\nIn this work we show this formulation further applies to multiple disciplines\nin source coding such as predictive coding, distributed source coding and\ncoding of large alphabet sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 09:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

Rather than\nattempting an exact analytical solution, we construct the pertinent\n(longitudinal) eigen-modes by matching relatively simple asymptotic expansions\nvalid in overlapping spatial domains. We thereby arrive at an effective\nboundary eigenvalue problem in a half-space representing the metal region in\nthe vicinity of the gap. Coupling with the gap field gives rise to a mixed-type\nboundary condition with varying coefficients, whereas coupling with the\nparticle-scale field enters through an integral eigenvalue selection rule\ninvolving the electrostatic capacitance of the configuration. By solving the\nreduced problem we obtain accurate closed-form expressions for the resonance\nvalues of the metal dielectric function.

The topology of\nnetworks of spatial contacts between different linguistic groups has been\nrecently characterized, showing atypical properties of the degree distribution\nand clustering, among others. Human demography, spatial conflicts, and the\nconstruction of networks of contacts between linguistic groups are mutually\ndependent processes. Here we introduce an adaptive network model that takes all\nof them into account and successfully reproduces, using only four model\nparameters, not only those features of linguistic groups already described in\nthe literature, but also correlations between demographic and topological\nproperties uncovered in this work. Besides their relevance when modeling and\nunderstanding processes related to human biogeography, our adaptive network\nmodel admits a number of generalizations that broaden its scope and make it\nsuitable to represent interactions between agents based on population dynamics\nand competition for space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 10:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

The two-component order parameter\nof the heterophase fluid describes the gas-like and liquid-like fractions. Its\ninterconnection with the van der Waals order parameter is ascertained. The\nnon-symmetric Ising-type equation of state of the heterophase fluid is analyzed\nusing the standard methods. The manifestations of the mesoscopic effects in the\nstructural and thermodynamic properties of the fluid are investigated. The\ndomain of applicability of a classical model is found using the mesoscopic\nOrnstein-Zernike equation.

After removing the Galactic evolution trend only the\ndifference in the [Mg/Si] elemental ratio between low-mass planet hosts and\nnon-hosts was present in a significant way. These results suggests that\nlow-mass planets are more prevalent around stars with high [Mg/Si]. Our results\ndemonstrate the importance of Galactic chemical evolution and indicate that it\nmay play an important role in the planetary internal structure and composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 12:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The paper discusses and employs the evolutionary\ngame theoretic insights to see the process of 'gantangan', of the intertwining\nsocial cohesion and economic expectation of the participation within the\ntraditional activities. The current development of the gantangan tradition is\napproached and generalized to propose a view between the economic and social\nsphere surrounding modern people. While some explanations due to the current\ndevelopment of gantangan is drawn, some aspects related to traditional views\ncomplying the modern life with social and economic expectations is outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 16:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-24"}

These\nquantities arise from imposing balance equations of the same asymptotic order\nas the evolution equations. In the case of an even bed, the conservation\nequations are satisfied exactly by the solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi\nsystem. The case of variable bathymetry is more complicated, with mass and\nmomentum conservation satisfied exactly, and energy conservation satisfied only\nin a global sense. In all cases, the quantities found here reduce correctly to\nthe corresponding counterparts in both the Boussinesq and the shallow-water\nscaling.\n  One consequence of the present analysis is that the energy loss appearing in\nthe shallow-water theory of undular bores is fully compensated by the emergence\nof oscillations behind the bore front. The situation is analyzed numerically by\napproximating solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations using a\nfinite-element discretization coupled with an adaptive Runge-Kutta time\nintegration scheme, and it is found that the energy is indeed conserved nearly\nto machine precision. As a second application, the shoaling of solitary waves\non a plane beach is analyzed. It appears that the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations\nare capable of predicting both the shape of the free surface and the evolution\nof kinetic and potential energy with good accuracy in the early stages of\nshoaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 12:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Phosphorus is identified as the\nunique biological element with a nuclear spin that can serve as a qubit for\nsuch putative quantum processing - a neural qubit - while the phosphate ion is\nthe only possible qubit-transporter. We identify the \"Posner molecule\",\n$\\text{Ca}_9 (\\text{PO}_4)_6$, as the unique molecule that can protect the\nneural qubits on very long times and thereby serve as a (working)\nquantum-memory. A central requirement for quantum-processing is quantum\nentanglement. It is argued that the enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction which\nbreaks a pyrophosphate ion into two phosphate ions can quantum entangle pairs\nof qubits. Posner molecules, formed by binding such phosphate pairs with\nextracellular calcium ions, will inherit the nuclear spin entanglement. A\nmechanism for transporting Posner molecules into presynaptic neurons during a\n\"kiss and run\" exocytosis, which releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic\ncleft, is proposed. Quantum measurements can occur when a pair of Posner\nmolecules chemically bind and subsequently melt, releasing a shower of\nintra-cellular calcium ions that can trigger further neurotransmitter release\nand enhance the probability of post-synaptic neuron firing. Multiple entangled\nPosner molecules, triggering non-local quantum correlations of neuron firing\nrates, would provide the key mechanism for neural quantum processing.\nImplications, both in vitro and in vivo, are briefly mentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 18:23:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 00:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

The\nHK theorems are generalized for spinless electrons to the added presence of an\nexternal uniform magnetostatic field by introducing the new constraint of fixed\ncanonical orbital angular momentum. Thereby a bijective relationship between\nthe external scalar and vector potentials, and the gauge invariant\nnondegenerate ground state density and physical current density, is proved. A\ncorresponding Euler variational principle in terms of these densities is also\ndeveloped. These theorems are further generalized to electrons with spin by\nimposing the added constraint of fixed canonical orbital and spin angular\nmomentum. The proofs differ from the original HK proof, and explicitly account\nfor the many-to-one relationship between the potentials and the nondegenerate\nground state wave function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 20:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}
