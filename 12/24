A decomposition\nspace is a simplicial $\\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition\nweaker than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses\ncomposition, the new condition expresses decomposition. In this paper, we\nintroduce various technical conditions on decomposition spaces. The first is a\ncompleteness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control\nsimplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a\ngeneral M\\\"obius inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of\n$\\infty$-groupoids.

The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees the existence of\nthe important length filtration on the associated incidence coalgebra. We show\nthat a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan\nextension of a semi-simplicial space. The second finiteness condition, local\nfiniteness, ensures we can take homotopy cardinality to pass from the level of\n$\\infty$-groupoids to the level of vector spaces. These three conditions -\ncompleteness, locally finite length, and local finiteness - together define our\nnotion of M\\\"obius decomposition space, which extends Leroux's notion of\nM\\\"obius category (in turn a common generalisation of the locally finite posets\nof Rota et al. and of the finite decomposition monoids of Cartier-Foata), but\nwhich also covers many coalgebra constructions which do not arise from M\\\"obius\ncategories, such as the Fa\\`a di Bruno and Connes-Kreimer bialgebras.

We first\ndiscuss several empirical evidences of the special role played by the T=1\npairing interaction. In particular, we show the peculiar features of the\nnuclear pairing interaction in the low density regime, and possible outcomes\nsuch as the BCS-BEC crossover in nuclear matter and, in an analogous way, in\nloosely bound nuclei. We then move to the competition between T=1 and T=0\npairing correlations. The effect of such competition on the low-lying spectra\nis studied in N=Z odd-odd nuclei by using a three-body model; it is shown that\nthe inversion of the 0+ and 1+ states near the ground state, and the strong\nmagnetic dipole transitions between them, can be considered as a clear\nmanifestation of strong T=0 pairing correlations in these nuclei. The effect of\nT=0 pairing correlations is also quite evident if one studies charge-changing\ntransitions. The Gamow-Teller (GT) states in N=Z+2 nuclei are studied here by\nusing self-consistent HFB+QRPA calculations in which the T=0 pairing\ninteraction is taken into account. Strong GT states are found, near the ground\nstate of daughter nuclei; these are compared with available experimental data\nfrom charge-exchange reactions, and such comparison can pinpoint the value of\nthe strength of the T=0 interaction. Pair transfer reactions are eventually\ndiscussed: while two-neutron transfer has been long proposed as a tool to\nmeasure the T=1 superfluidity in the nuclear ground states, the study of\ndeuteron transfer is still in its infancy, despite its potential interest in\nrevealing effects coming from both T=1 and T=0 interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 19:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Despite their common use, however, practical guidelines for the\nchoice of wavelet method, filter, and length have remained largely\nundelineated. Here, we explicitly explore the effects of wavelet method (MODWT\nvs. DWT), wavelet filter (Daubechies Extremal Phase, Daubechies Least\nAsymmetric, and Coiflet families), and wavelet length (2 to 24) - each\nessential parameters in wavelet-based methods - on the estimated values of\nnetwork diagnostics and in their sensitivity to alterations in psychiatric\ndisease.

At the same time, they are\nknown to be very sensitive to photon losses and rather hard to produce\nexperimentally. Concerning the former, here we present a scheme where NOON\nstates are the elementary resources for building quantum error correction codes\nagainst photon losses, thus demonstrating that such resources can also be\nuseful to suppress the effect of loss. Our NOON-code is an exact code that can\nbe systematically extended from one-photon to higher-number losses. Its loss\nscaling depending on the codeword photon number is the same as for some\nexisting, exact loss codes such as bosonic and quantum parity codes, but its\ncodeword mode number is intermediate between that of the other codes. Another\ngeneralisation of the NOON-code is given for arbitrary logical qudits instead\nof logical qubits. While, in general, the final codewords are always obtainable\nfrom multi-mode NOON states through application of beam splitters, both\ncodewords for the one-photon-loss qubit NOON-code can be simply created from\nsingle-photon states with beam splitters. We give various examples and also\ndiscuss a potential application of our qudit code for quantum communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

A large Yukawa coupling would rapidly run up with the scale and\nquickly reach the perturbativity bound, indicating that new physics, possibly\nwith a strong dynamics origin, is near by. The case becomes stronger especially\nif the ATLAS observation of a large width persists. In this paper we study the\nimplication on the scale of new physics from the 750 GeV diphoton excess using\nthe method of renormalization group running with careful treatment of different\ncontributions and perturbativity criterion.

The unitary update rule of this\nquantum walk shares many spectral characteristics with the critical\nAlmost-Mathieu Operator; however, it possesses a feature not present in the\nAlmost-Mathieu Operator, namely singularity of the associated cocycles (this\nfeature is, however, present in the so-called Extended Harper's Model). We show\nthat this operator has empty absolutely continuous spectrum and that the\nLyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum; hence, this model exhibits Cantor\nspectrum of zero Lebesgue measure for all irrational frequencies and arbitrary\nphase, which in physics is known as Hofstadter's butterfly. In fact, we will\nshow something stronger, namely, that all spectral parameters in the spectrum\nare of critical type, in the language of Avila's global theory of analytic\nquasiperiodic cocycles. We further prove that it has empty point spectrum for\neach irrational frequency and away from a frequency-dependent set of phases\nhaving Lebesgue measure zero. The key ingredients in our proofs are an\nadaptation of Avila's Global Theory to the present setting, self-duality via\nthe Fourier transform, and a Johnson-type theorem for singular dynamically\ndefined CMV matrices which characterizes their spectra as the set of spectral\nparameters at which the associated cocycles fail to admit a dominated\nsplitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 21:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Using the on-shell flame description, equations\ndescribing quasi-steady flame with a small but finite front thickness are\nobtained and solved numerically. It is found that near the limits of\ninflammability, solutions describing upward flame propagation come in pairs\nhaving close propagation speeds, and that the effect of gravity is to reverse\nthe burnt gas velocity profile generated by the flame. On the basis of these\nresults, a theory of partial flame propagation driven by the gravitational\nfield is developed. A complete explanation is given of the intricate observed\nbehavior of limit flames, including dependence of the inflammability range on\nthe size of the combustion domain, the large distances of partial flame\npropagation, and the progression of flame extinction. The role of the finite\nfront-thickness effects is discussed in detail. Also, various mechanisms\ngoverning flame acceleration in smooth tubes are identified. Acceleration of\nmethane-air flames in open tubes is shown to be a combined effect of the\nhydrostatic pressure difference produced by the ambient cold air and the\ndifference of dynamic gas pressure at the tube ends. On the other hand, a\nstrong spontaneous acceleration of the fast methane-oxygen flames at the\ninitial stage of their evolution in open-closed tubes is conditioned by\nmetastability of the quasi-steady propagation regimes.

Modelling\nsynthesises tissue in some regions and removes tissue in others. Remodelling\noverwrites old tissue material properties with newly formed, immature tissue\nproperties. As a result, tissues are made up of different \"patches\", i.e.,\nadjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,\nwithin evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the\nspatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum\nmodel. These equations take into account nonconservative, discontinuous surface\nmass balance due to creation and destruction of material at moving interfaces,\nand bulk balance due to tissue maturation. These equations make it possible to\nmodel patchy tissue states and their evolution without explicitly maintaining a\nrecord of when/where resorption and formation processes occurred. The time\nevolution of spatially averaged tissue properties is derived systematically by\nintegration. These spatially-averaged equations cannot be written in closed\nform as they retain traces that tissue destruction is localised at tissue\nboundaries.\n  The formalism developed in this paper is applied to bone tissues, which\nexhibit strong material heterogeneities due to their slow mineralisation and\nremodelling processes. Evolution equations are proposed in particular for\nosteocyte density and bone mineral density. Effective average equations for\nbone mineral density (BMD) and tissue mineral density (TMD) are derived using a\nmean-field approximation. The error made by this approximation when remodelling\npatchy tissue is investigated. The specific time signatures of BMD or TMD\nduring remodelling events may provide a way to detect these events occurring at\nlower, unseen spatial resolutions from microCT scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 21:43:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 13:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

This is largely because of the feasibility of modern\nBayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a\nmeasure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC\nalgorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for\nlarge-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient\nthermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a\nthermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior\ndistributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion\nincreases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so\nbetter use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use\nof an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the\ntraditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more\naccurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be\ndesirable in Bayesian deep learning.

Adaptable processes have named scopes and are\nsensible to actions of dynamic update at runtime; this allows to express\ndynamic and static topologies of adaptable processes as well as different\nevolvability patterns for concurrent processes. We introduce a core calculus of\nadaptable processes and consider verification problems for them: first based on\nspecific properties related to error occurrence, that we call bounded and\neventual adaptation, and then by considering a simple yet expressive temporal\nlogic over adaptable processes. We provide (un)decidability results of such\nverification problems over adaptable processes considering the spectrum of\ntopologies/evolvability patterns introduced.

However, the usual observables are the\nluminosity distances or the angular diameter distances, which measure the\ndistance-redshift relation. Actually, dark energy affects the distances (and\nthe growth factor) by a further integration over functions of $H(z)$. Thus, the\ndirect measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at different redshifts are\nof great importance for constraining the properties of dark energy. In this\npaper, we show how the typical dark energy models, for example, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, CPL, and holographic dark energy (HDE) models, can be\nconstrained by the current direct measurements of $H(z)$ (31 data in total,\ncovering the redshift range of $z\\in [0.07,2.34]$). In fact, the future\nredshift-drift observations (also referred to as the Sandage-Loeb test) can\nalso directly measure $H(z)$ at higher redshifts, covering the range of $z\\in\n[2,5]$. We thus discuss what role the redshift-drift observations can play in\nconstraining dark energy with the Hubble parameter measurements.

The maximum power factors (MPF) are extracted in n-type\nand p-type doping with GGA and GGA+SOC, and the MPF at 300 K with SOC is\npredicted to be about 4.25\\%$\\sim$44.13\\% smaller than that without SOC in the\ncase of p-type doping for $\\mathrm{ANiB}$ (A=Ti, Hf, Sc, Y; B=Sn, Sb, Bi).\nTherefore, it is crucial to consider SOC effects for theoretical analysis in\nthe case of p-type doping in half-Heusler compounds composed of heavy elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 04:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-25"}

The\ncenterpiece of ICN is named and addressable content, rather than hosts or\ninterfaces. Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a prominent ICN instance that\nshares the fundamental architectural design with its equally popular academic\nsibling Named-Data Networking (NDN). CCN eschews source addresses and creates\none-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an interest). As an\ninterest is forwarded it creates state in intervening routers and the requested\ncontent back is delivered over the reverse path using that state.\n  Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms of\nefficiency, and resilience to certain types of attacks, this has not been\ndecisively proven via realistic experiments. Since keeping per-interest state\ncomplicates router operations and makes the infrastructure susceptible to\nrouter state exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense\nagainst interest flooding attacks), the value of the stateful forwarding plane\nin CCN should be re-examined.\n  In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems of the\nstateful forwarding plane. We then argue that its benefits are uncertain at\nbest and it should not be a mandatory CCN feature. To this end, we propose a\nnew stateless architecture for CCN that provides nearly all functionality of\nthe stateful design without its headaches.

As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries\nat most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree\n(MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient\nfor both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts\nthat may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the\nnotion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency.\nThis adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been\ngaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof\nlabeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\\log n)$ bits per node), and\nwhose time complexity is $O(\\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\\Delta\n\\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of\nnodes. This answers an open problem posed by Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991).\nWe also show that $\\Omega(\\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous\nnetworks. Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the\nrequireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\\log\nn)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known\ntransformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes\nas input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing\nproof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm.\nWhen used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing\nalgorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even\nthan that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST\nalgorithms that used $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and\nthe time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof\nlabelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the\nfollowing two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended,\nthen they are detected by some nodes within $O(\\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous\nnetworks, or within $O(\\Delta \\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if\n$f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are\ndetected within the $O(f\\log n)$ locality of each of the faults. We also show\nhow to improve the above two properties, at the expense of some increase in the\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 12:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-25"}

Currently, there are two main\ndesign paradigms for RDMA-accelerated systems. The first allows the clients to\ndirectly operate the server's memory and totally bypasses the CPUs at server\nside. The second follows the traditional server-reply paradigm, which asks the\nserver to write results back to the clients. However, the first method has to\nexpose server's memory and needs tremendous re-design of upper-layer software,\nwhich is complex, unsafe, error-prone, and inefficient. The second cannot\nachieve high input/output operations per second (IOPS), because it employs\nout-bound RDMA-write at server side which is not efficient.\n  We find that the performance of out-bound RDMA-write and in-bound RDMA-read\nis asymmetric and the latter is 5 times faster than the former. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a novel design paradigm named Remote Fetching Paradigm\n(RFP). In RFP, the server is still responsible for processing requests from the\nclients. However, counter-intuitively, instead of sending results back to the\nclients through out-bound RDMA-write, the server only writes the results in\nlocal memory buffers, and the clients use in-bound RDMA-read to remotely fetch\nthese results. Since in-bound RDMA-read achieves much higher IOPS than\nout-bound RDMA-write, our model is able to bring higher performance than the\ntraditional models.\n  In order to prove the effectiveness of RFP, we design and implement an\nRDMA-accelerated in-memory key-value store following the RFP model. To further\nimprove the IOPS, we propose an optimization mechanism that combines status\nchecking and result fetching. Experiment results show that RFP can improve the\nIOPS by 160%~310% against state-of-the-art models for in-memory key-value\nstores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 12:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-25"}

However, by restricting the\norder of the potentials to be at most two, they fail to capture useful image\nstatistics. We propose a natural generalization of TCM to high-order random\nfields, which we call truncated max-of-convex models (TMCM). The energy\nfunction of TMCM consistsof two types of potentials: (i) unary potential, which\nhas no restriction on its form; and (ii) clique potential, which is the sum of\nthe m largest truncated convex distances over all label pairs in a clique. The\nuse of a convex distance function encourages smoothness, while truncation\nallows for discontinuities in the labeling. By using m > 1, TMCM provides\nrobustness towards errors in the definition of the cliques. In order to\nminimize the energy function of a TMCM over all possible labelings, we design\nan efficient st-MINCUT based range expansion algorithm. We prove the accuracy\nof our algorithm by establishing strong multiplicative bounds for several\nspecial cases of interest. Using synthetic and standard real data sets, we\ndemonstrate the benefit of our high-order TMCM over pairwise TCM, as well as\nthe benefit of our range expansion algorithm over other st-MINCUT based\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 13:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

We use\nthis method to investigate metallic gratings and find nearly degenerate\nplasmons at the interface between metal and amorphous silicon (a-Si). The\nplasmons cause large undesired absorption in the metal part of a grating as\nused in a-Si cells. We explore ways to alleviate the parasitic absorption in\nthe metal by appropriate choice of the geometry. Separating the diffraction\ngrating from the back reflector helps, lining silver or aluminum with a\ndielectric helps as well.

We also find that geometric asymmetry can improve the\nabsorption for PV.

Reducing $tau$ relax , is\nfrequently necessary, and is often obtained by a complex feedback process. To\novercome the limitations of such an approach, alternative methods based on\ndriving have been recently demonstrated [2, 3], for isolated quantum and\nclassical systems [4--9]. Their extension to open systems in contact with a\nthermostat is a stumbling block for applications. Here, we design a\nprotocol,named Engineered Swift Equilibration (ESE), that shortcuts\ntime-consuming relaxations, and we apply it to a Brownian particle trapped in\nan optical potential whose properties can be controlled in time. We implement\nthe process experimentally, showing that it allows the system to reach\nequilibrium times faster than the natural equilibration rate. We also estimate\nthe increase of the dissipated energy needed to get such a time reduction. The\nmethod paves the way for applications in micro and nano devices, where the\nreduction of operation time represents as substantial a challenge as\nminiaturization [10]. The concepts of equilibrium and of transformations from\nan equilibrium state to another, are cornerstones of thermodynamics. A textbook\nillustration is provided by the expansion of a gas, starting at equilibrium and\nexpanding to reach a new equilibrium in a larger vessel.

In\nview of general symmetries, however, these are singularly special since nematic\norder can in principle involve any point group symmetry. Given the progress in\ntailoring nano particles with particular shapes and interactions, this vast\nfamily of \"generalized nematics\" might become accessible in the laboratory.\nLittle is known since the order parameter theories associated with the highly\nsymmetric point groups are remarkably complicated, involving tensor order\nparameters of high rank. Here we show that the generic features of the\nstatistical physics of such systems can be studied in a highly flexible and\nefficient fashion using a mathematical tool borrowed from high energy physics:\ndiscrete non-Abelian gauge theory. Explicitly, we construct a family of lattice\ngauge models encapsulating nematic ordering of general three dimensional point\ngroup symmetries. We find that the most symmetrical \"generalized nematics\" are\nsubjected to thermal fluctuations of unprecedented severity. As a result, novel\nforms of fluctuation phenomena become possible.

Specifically, we discover a strong\ndichotomy among groups in terms of their lifecycle, and develop a separability\nmodel by taking into account a broad range of group-level features, showing\nthat long-term and short-term groups are inherently distinct. We also found\nthat the lifecycle of messaging groups is largely dependent on their social\nroles and functions in users' daily social experiences and specific purposes.\nGiven the strong separability between the long-term and short-term groups, we\nfurther address the problem concerning the early prediction of successful\ncommunities. In addition to modeling the growth and evolution from group-level\nperspective, we investigate the individual-level attributes of group members\nand study the diffusion process by which groups gain new members. By\nconsidering members' historical engagement behavior as well as the local social\nnetwork structure that they embedded in, we develop a membership cascade model\nand demonstrate the effectiveness by achieving AUC of 95.31% in predicting\ninviter, and an AUC of 98.66% in predicting invitee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 14:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 14:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb. For all considered\nkinematics, the mass dependence of the $T^{pN}_{A}$ can be captured by the\npower law $T^{pN}_{A} \\propto A^{- \\lambda}$ with $ 0.4 \\lesssim \\lambda\n\\lesssim 0.5 $. Apart from an overall reduction factor, we find that FSI only\nmodestly affects the distinct features of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ which are\ndictated by the c.m. distribution of close-proximity pairs.\n  Conclusion: The SCX mechanisms represent a relatively small (order of a few\npercent) contribution of SRC-driven $A(e,e'pN)$ processes. The mass dependence\nof FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ can be captured in a robust power law\nand is in agreement with the predictions obtained in a toy model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 15:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Although widely used, there is currently no atomic\npopulation analysis method suitable for being used as a default method in\nquantum chemistry programs. To address this challenge, we introduce a new\natoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties: (1) exactly one\nelectron distribution is assigned to each atom, (2) core electrons are assigned\nto the correct host atom, (3) NACs are formally independent of the basis set\ntype because they are functionals of the total electron distribution, (4) the\nassigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging\npolyatomic multipole expansion, (5) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling\nscale electronegativity trends, (6) NACs for a particular element have good\ntransferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded, (7)\nthe assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin\nmoments, (8) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a\nunique solution, and (9) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales\nlinearly with increasing system size. Across a broad range of material types,\nthe DDEC6 NACs reproduced electron transfer trends, core electron binding\nenergy shift trends, and electrostatic potentials across multiple system\nconformations with excellent accuracy compared to other charge assignment\nmethods. Due to non-nuclear attractors, Bader's quantum chemical topology could\nnot assign NACs for some of these materials. The DDEC6 method alleviates the\nbifurcation or runaway charges problem exhibited by earlier DDEC variants and\nthe Iterative Hirshfeld method. These characteristics make the DDEC6 method\nideally suited for use as a default charge assignment method in quantum\nchemistry programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 03:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

At last, we\nprove that the integral of an irreducible algebroidal function is also an\nirreducible algebroidal function if all the residues at critical points are\nzeros.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 15:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

We observe significant differences in the\nspectral shape measured below and above the PA transition, in particular, in\nthe 30-80 meV range. Guided by first-principle lattice dynamics calculations,\nwe interpret the changes in the phonon dispersion as the evolution from a\nquartz-like to a rutile-like coordination. Notably, such a crossover is\naccompanied by a cusp-like behavior in the pressure dependence of the elastic\nresponse of the system. Overall, the presented results highlight the complex\nfingerprint of PA phenomena on the high-frequency phonon dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 20:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}
