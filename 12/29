At leading order (1/N=0), this model produces a (discretized)\nlightcone string with a \"transverse space' of $s$ Grassmann worldsheet fields.\nHigher orders in the 1/N expansion are shown to be determined by the overlap of\na single large closed chain (discretized string) with two smaller closed\nchains. In the models studied here, the overlap is not accompanied with\noperator insertions at the break/join point. Then the requirement that the\ndiscretized overlap have a smooth continuum limit leads to the critical\nGrassmann \"dimension\" of s=24. This \"protostring\", a Grassmann analog of the\nbosonic string, is unusual, because it has no large transverse dimensions. It\nis a string moving in one space dimension and there are neither tachyons nor\nmassless particles. The protostring, derived from our pure spinor string bit\nmodel, has 24 Grassmann dimensions, 16 of which could be bosonized to form 8\ncompactified bosonic dimensions, leaving 8 Grassmann dimensions--the worldsheet\ncontent of the superstring. If the transverse space of the protostring could be\n\"decompactified\", string bit models might provide an appealing and solid\nfoundation for superstring theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 16:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Similar observations were\nreported for other proteins for the unfolding rate $k_\\mathrm{u}([C])$.

Various authors in the past several\ndecades demonstrated the validity of such an assumption for inviscid\nhydrodynamic flow. Inviscid approximation is a reasonable approach for low\nangular momentum advection dominated flow in connection to certain supermassive\nblack holes at the centres of the galaxies (including our own) fed from a\nnumber of stellar donors. Introduction of a weak viscosity, as a first order\nlinear correction involving the viscosity parameter, however, may sometimes\nprovide a more detail understanding of the observed black hole spectra. The\ntransonic behaviour of the stationary solutions have been studied for the\naforementioned quasi-viscous accretion for all possible geometric\nconfigurations of axisymmetric flow. For a sufficiently low range of the\nviscosity parameter, transonic solutions containing one or three critical\npoints have been found for allowed ranges in the astrophysical parameters under\nthe post-Newtonian pseudo-Schwarzschild scheme. With the introduction of such\nviscosity parameter, the only feasible critical points are of saddle and spiral\ntypes in contrary to the inviscid case where centre type points were formed\ninstead of spiral ones. Introduction of linear perturbations on stationary flow\nsolutions and their time evolution in both standing and radially propagating\nwave forms have been examined (completely analytically) in detail. Our analysis\nshows that similar kind of secular instability exists in all the considered\ndisk models at large distance in the asymptotic limit, however, the model\nitself is valid only within a certain length scale and the disks sustain within\nthat length scale only for at least a considerable time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 19:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The Bayesian Network, which is one of the most common PGMs\nused in machine learning and data mining, demonstrates this limitation when the\ntraining data consists of random variables, each of them has a large set of\npossible values. In the big data era, one would expect new extensions to the\nexisting PGMs to handle the massive amount of data produced these days by\ncomputers, sensors and other electronic devices.

Our goal is to explore whether the\npresence of substellar companions influences the Li content. Both 12C/13C and\nstellar rotation are measured as additional tracers of stellar mixing. One of\nthe companion hosts, NGC2423 3, is found to be Li-rich with A(Li)_NLTE=1.56\ndex, and this abundance is significantly higher than the A(Li) of the two\ncomparison stars in NGC2423. All three substellar companion hosts have the\nhighest A(Li) and 12C/13C when compared to the control red giants in their\nrespective clusters; however, except for NGC2423 3, at least one control star\nhas similarly high abundances within the uncertainties. Higher A(Li) could\nsuggest that the formation or presence of planets plays a role in the degree of\ninternal mixing on or before the red giant branch. However, a multitude of\nfactors affect A(Li) during the red giant phase, and when the abundances of our\nsample are compared to abundances of red giants in other open clusters\navailable in the literature, we find that they all fall well within a much\nlarger distribution of A(Li) and 12C/13C.

Using high-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)\nsimulations, we report the first direct observation of the early stage\nintermediates and subsequent formation of an InP cluster from separated indium\nand phosphorus precursors. In our simulations, indium agglomeration precedes\nformation of In-P bonds. We observe a predominantly intercomplex pathway in\nwhich In-P bonds form between one set of precursor copies while the carboxylate\nligand of a second indium precursor in the agglomerated indium abstracts a\nligand from the phosphorus precursor. This process produces an indium-rich\ncluster with structural properties comparable to those in bulk zinc-blende InP\ncrystals. Minimum energy pathway characterization of the AIMD-sampled reaction\nevents confirms these observations and identifies that In-carboxylate\ndissociation energetics solely determine the barrier along the In-P bond\nformation pathway, which is lower for intercomplex (13 kcal/mol) than\nintracomplex (21 kcal/mol) mechanisms. The phosphorus precursor chemistry, on\nthe other hand, controls the thermodynamics of the reaction. Our observations\nof the differing roles of precursors in controlling QD formation strongly\nsuggests that the challenges thus far encountered in InP QD synthesis\noptimization may be attributed to an overlooked need for a cooperative tuning\nstrategy that simultaneously addresses the chemistry of both indium and\nphosphorus precursors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 00:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

However, most chemists and\nphysicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated spin orientations\nare related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. The\nobjective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework of thinking\nabout and predicting the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion by\nexamining the relationship between the spin orientation and the local\nelectronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion (i.e., an ion\npossessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with\nmain-group ligand atoms to form a polyhedron, and the d-states of the\npolyhedron are split because the antibonding interactions of the metal\nd-orbitals with the p orbitals of the surrounding ligands depend on the\nsymmetries of the orbitals involved. The magnetic ion of the polyhedron has a\ncertain preferred spin direction because its split d-states interact among\nthemselves under SOC and because the energy lowering associated with the\nSOC-induced interactions depends on spin orientation. The preferred spin\ndirection can be readily predicted on the basis of perturbation theory, in\nwhich the SOC is taken as perturbation and the split d-states as unperturbed\nstates, by inspecting the magnetic quantum numbers of its d-orbitals present in\nthe HOMO and LUMO of the polyhedron. Experimentally, the determination of the\npreferred spin orientations of magnetic ions requires a sophisticated level of\nexperiments. Theoretically, it requires an elaborate level of DFT electronic\nstructure calculations.

We find that with sufficiently strong perturbations the string\ncontinues extending and plunges into the Poincar\\'e horizon. In the evolution,\neffective horizons are also dynamically created on the string worldsheet. The\nquark and antiquark are thus causally disconnected, and the string transitions\nto two straight strings. The forces acting on the endpoints vanish with a power\nlaw whose slope depends on the perturbations. The condition for this transition\nto occur is that energy injection exceeds the static energy between the\nquark-antiquark pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 01:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Although epigenetic modifications underlie the\ndevelopment of cancer, exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, such as alcohol, can\nalso contribute to disease development. However, the effects of chronic\nalcoholism on normal or pre-carcinogenic cells/tissues in different organelles\nare not well understood. Therefore, we herein study the effect of alcohol\nconsumption on colonic nucleus using control and azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran\nsulfate sodium (DSS) treated carcinogenic mice. Previous studies showed that\nprogression of carcinogenesis is associated with increase in the degree of\nintranuclear nanoscale structural disorder. In the present work, we quantify\nthe degree of nanostructural disorder as a measure of carcinogenesis. To\naccomplish this, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging of respective\ncolonic epithelial cell nuclei are used to construct disordered optical\nlattices, and the properties of nanoscale disorder are then studied by\nanalyzing the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the spatially localized\neigenfunctions of these optical lattices. Nanoscale structural disorder\nstrength, as a marker of cancer progression, is measured in the length scale of\n10 to 75 nm. Results show no significant visible effect in nanoscale structural\nchanges on colon cell nuclei from alcohol exposure. However, alcohol was found\nto act as an enhancer of nanoscale disorder in precancerous cells and, hence,\ncarcinogenic processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto quantify the effect of alcohol on early carcinogenic biological cells, using\nmesoscopic condensed matter physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 03:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

In Democracy and Education, Dewey links \"democracy\" with a\ndistinctive understanding of \"experience\". For Dewey, the value of educational\nexperiences lies in \"the unity or integrity of experience\" (DE, 248). In Art as\nExperience, Dewey presents aesthetic experience as the fundamental form of\nhuman experience that undergirds all other forms of experiences, and can also\nbring together multiple forms of experiences, locating this form of experience\nin the work of artists. Particularly relevant to our current concern\n(computational literacy), Dewey calls the process through which a person\ntransforms a material into an expressive medium an aesthetic experience (AE,\n68-69). We argue here that the kind of experience that is appropriate for a\ndemocratic education in the context of children's computational science is\nessentially aesthetic in nature. Given that aesthetics has received relatively\nlittle attention in STEM education research, our purpose here is to highlight\nthe power of Deweyan aesthetic experience in making computational thinking\navailable to and attractive to all children, including those who are\ndisinterested in computing, and especially those who are likely to be\ndiscounted by virtue of location, gender or race.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 08:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

We show the\nlocal-in-time existence of smooth solutions to the Cauchy problem for the\namplitude equation in noncanonical variables, and we derive a blow up\ncriterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 09:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two populations\ncalls for comparing these estimated GGMs. Our goal is to identify differences\nin GGMs known to have similar structure. We characterize the uncertainty of\ndifferences with confidence intervals obtained using a parametric distribution\non parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical\nguarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-sample\nsettings. Characterizing the distributions of sparse models is inherently\nchallenging as the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work invokes\nthe sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator\nsuch as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give confidence intervals\non edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of\ncomparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure\namong the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we derive\nthe distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters\nare known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the\ndebiased multi-task fused lasso, whose distribution can be characterized in an\nefficient manner.

In this\ngeneral context, the notion of frequency is defined using the spectrum of a\ndistinguished differential operator on the manifold, typically the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator. Our exposition starts with the case of the real\nline, which serves as motivation and blueprint for the material in the\nsubsequent sections.\n  After the discussion of the real line, our presentation starts out in the\nmost abstract setting proving rather general sampling-type results for\nappropriately defined Paley-Wiener vectors in Hilbert spaces. These results\nallow a handy construction of Paley-Wiener frames in $L_2(\\mfd{M})$, for a\nRiemann manifold of bounded geometry, essentially by taking a partition of\nunity in frequency domain. The discretization of the associated integral\nkernels then gives rise to frames consisting of smooth functions in\n$L_2(\\mfd{M})$, with fast decay in space and frequency. These frames are used\nto introduce new norms in corresponding Besov spaces on $\\mfd{M}$.\n  For compact Riemannian manifolds the theory extends to $L_p$ and Besov\nspaces. Moreover, for compact homogeneous manifolds, one obtains the so-called\nproduct property for eigenfunctions of certain operators and proves a cubature\nformulae with positive coefficients which allow to construct Parseval frames\nthat characterize Besov spaces in terms of coefficient decay.\n  Throughout the paper, the general theory is exemplified with the help of\nvarious concrete and relevant examples, such as the unit sphere and the\nPoincar\\'{e} half plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 12:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 11:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-01"}

We investigate the\nproblem of establishing, in an information-theoretic sense, a secret key\nbetween a user and a base-station (BS) (more generally, part of a wireless\ninfrastructure), but for two such user-BS pairs attempting the key\nestablishment simultaneously. The challenge in this novel setting lies in that\na user can eavesdrop another BS-user communications. It is thus paramount to\nensure the two keys are established with no leakage to the other user, in spite\nthe interference across neighboring cells. We model the system with BS-user\ncommunication through an interference channel and user-BS communication through\na public channel. We find the region including achievable secret key rates for\nthe general case that the interference channel (IC) is discrete and memoryless.\nOur results are examined for a Gaussian IC. In this setup, we investigate the\nperformance of different transmission schemes for power allocation. The chosen\ntransmission scheme by each BS essentially affects the secret key rate of the\nother BS-user. Assuming base stations are trustworthy but that they seek to\nmaximize the corresponding secret key rate, a game-theoretic setting arises to\nanalyze the interaction between the base stations.We model our key agreement\nscenario in normal form for different power allocation schemes to understand\nperformance without cooperation. Numerical simulations illustrate the\ninefficiency of the Nash equilibrium outcome and motivate further research on\ncooperative or coordinated schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 13:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

In this contribution we first identify those that\nwe consider as the major requirements to be fulfilled in order to realize an\neffective pervasive social computing infrastructure. We then conjecture that\nour service-oriented community and fractal social organization fulfill those\nrequirements and therefore constitute an effective strategy to design pervasive\nsocial computing infrastructures. In order to motivate our conjecture, in this\npaper we discuss a model of social translucence and discuss fractal social\norganization as a referral service empowering a social system's parts and\nwhole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 14:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 09:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

Already in the absence of interactions the Wilson loop in a Hilbert\nspace setting has a \"topological property\" which is missing in the gauge\ntheoretic description (Haag duality, Aharonov-Bohm effect); the conceptual\ndifferences increase in the presence of interactions. The Hilbert space\npositivity weakens the causal localization properties if interacting fields\nwhich results in the replacement of the gauge-variant point-local matter fields\nin Krein space by string-local physical fields in Hilbert space. The gauge\ninvariance of the perturbative S-matrix corresponds to its independence of the\nspacelike string direction of its interpolating.fields. In contrast to gauge\ntheory, whose physical range is limited to gauge invariant perturbative\nS-matrix and local observables, its Hilbert space string-local counterpart in\nis a full-fledged quantum field theory.
