In the same time, the structural and\nmagnetic stability of pure cobalt in hexagonal close packed (HCP), face\ncentered cubic (FCC) and body centered cubic (BCC) structures are reviewed. At\nequilibrium, non-spin polarized (NSP) and spin polarized (SP) calculations of\nthe energy versus volume show that the ground state is ferromagnetic in both\nmaterials. HCP-Co is found to be more stable than the cubic ones. Magnetic\nmoments of Co atoms in Co$_4$N nitride respectively belonging to two different\ncrystallographic sites are studied over a wide range of the cubic lattice\nconstant, and a comparison with the FCC-cobalt one is given. The volume\nexpansion in the nitride indicates that the corner Co$^{I}$ atoms show\nlocalized magnetism while face center Co$^{II}$ atoms exhibit an itinerant\nbehavior. Like in FCC-Fe/Fe$_{4}$N, a \"low volume-low moment\" and \"large\nvolume-high moment\" behavior is observed for FCC-Co/Co$_4$N. The density of\nstates of the Co$_{4}$N ferromagnetic ground state is interpreted within the\nrigid band model. The different bonding characters of Co$^I$-N versus\nCo$^{II}$-N are shown with help of electron localization fucntion ELF plots and\nspin resolved chemical bonding criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 16:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

Due to the insufficiency of harvested\nenergy, the sensor nodes have to work in duty cycles to harvest enough energy\nbefore turning active and performing tasks. One fundamental issue in this kind\nof network design is how to deploy the chargers to ensure that the battery-free\nnodes can maintain a designated duty cycle for continuous operation.

Building on the\ncommon assumption that the missing baryons are in the form of the Warm Hot\nIntergalactic Medium (WHIM), we further assumed here that the galaxy luminosity\ndensity can be used as a tracer of the WHIM. The latter assumption is supported\nby our finding of a significant correlation between the WHIM density and the\ngalaxy luminosity density in the hydrodynamical simulations of Cui et al.\n(2012). We further found that the fraction of the gas mass in the WHIM phase is\nsubstantially (by a factor of $\\sim$1.6) higher within the large scale galactic\nfilaments, i.e. $\\sim$70\\%, compared to the average in the full simulation\nvolume of $\\sim$0.1\\,Gpc$^3$.

One promis- ing approach is to locate users\nwith radio frequency fingerprints.

To address this\nproblem, we visualize the 3-D RF fingerprint data as a function of locations\n(x-y) and indices of access points (fingerprint), as a tensor and use tensor\nalgebraic methods for an adaptive tubal-sampling of this fingerprint space. In\nparticular using a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework in [1] we\ncapture the complexity of the fingerprint space as a low-dimensional\ntensor-column space. In this formulation the proposed scheme exploits\nadaptivity to identify reference points which are highly informative for\nlearning this low-dimensional space. Further, under certain incoherency\nconditions we prove that the proposed scheme achieves bounded recovery error\nand near-optimal sampling complexity. In contrast to several existing work that\nrely on random sampling, this paper shows that adaptivity in sampling can lead\nto significant improvements in localization accuracy. The approach is validated\non both data generated by the ray-tracing indoor model which accounts for the\nfloor plan and the impact of walls and the real world data.

We take the above as indications that at some level the small\nquantities are well-approximated by zero. In particular the mixing angles, to a\nzero order, should be either 0 or $\\pi/4$. Accordingly, in this model the\nType-II see-saw dominates and generates the larger atmospheric mass splitting\nand sets $\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4$.

For the\nsymmetric planted partition problem (also named community detection for the\nblock models) on sparse graphs, a simple observation is that local algorithms\ncannot have non-trivial performance.\n  In this work we consider the effect of side information on local algorithms\nfor community detection under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In\nthe block model with side information each of the $n$ vertices is labeled $+$\nor $-$ independently and uniformly at random; each pair of vertices is\nconnected independently with probability $a/n$ if both of them have the same\nlabel or $b/n$ otherwise.

In the context of the finite volume\nmethod no single local refinement criterion has been globally established as\noptimum for the selection of the control volumes to subdivide, since it is not\neasy to associate the discretisation error with an easily computable quantity\nin each control volume. Often the grid refinement criterion is based on an\nestimate of the truncation error in each control volume, because the truncation\nerror is a natural measure of the discrepancy between the algebraic\nfinite-volume equations and the original differential equations. However, it is\nnot a straightforward task to associate the truncation error with the optimum\ngrid density because of the complexity of the relationship between truncation\nand discretisation errors. In the present work several criteria based on a\ntruncation error estimate are tested and compared on a regularised lid-driven\ncavity case at various Reynolds numbers. It is shown that criteria where the\ntruncation error is weighted by the volume of the grid cells perform better\nthan using just the truncation error as the criterion. Also it is observed that\nthe efficiency of local refinement increases with the Reynolds number. The\ntruncation error is estimated by restricting the solution to a coarser grid and\napplying the coarse grid discrete operator. The complication that high\ntruncation error develops at grid level interfaces is also investigated and\nseveral treatments are tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 18:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

Here, we model this problem by\napproximating the slender body as an elastic filament that can impose\nnon-equilibrium velocities or stresses at the fluid-structure interface. We\nderive equations of motion for such an active filament by enforcing momentum\nconservation in the fluid-structure interaction and assuming slow viscous flow\nin the fluid. The fluid-structure interaction is obtained, to any desired\ndegree of accuracy, through the solution of an integral equation. A simplified\nform of the equations of motion, that allows for efficient numerical solutions,\nis obtained by applying the Kirkwood-Riseman superposition approximation to the\nintegral equation. We use this form of the equation of motion to study\ndynamical steady states in free and hinged minimally active filaments.

The bolometric peak luminosity of most TDE candidates, a\nfew x 10^{44} erg/s, implies that we observe only ~1% of the energy expected\nfrom radiatively efficient accretion. Motivated by these results, (Piran et\nal., 2015) suggested that the observed optical TDE emission is powered by\nshocks at the apocenter between freshly infalling material and earlier arriving\nmatter. This model explains the small radiated energy, the low temperature, and\nthe large radius implied by the observations as well as the t^{-5/3} light\ncurve. However the question of the system's low {bolometric} efficiency remains\nunanswered. We suggest that the high orbital energy and low angular momentum of\nthe flow make it possible for magnetic stresses to reduce the matter's already\nsmall angular momentum to the point at which it can fall ballistically into the\nSMBH before circularization. As a result, the efficiency is only ~1--10% of a\nstandard accretion disk's efficiency. Thus, the intrinsically high eccentricity\nof the tidal debris naturally explains why most TDE candidates are fainter than\nexpected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 20:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 19:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 10:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Developing a better understanding of the intricate correlations\nbetween these simultaneous processes, rather than focusing on the translation\nof a single isolated transcript, should help in gaining a better understanding\nof mRNA translation regulation and the way elongation rates affect organismal\nfitness. A model of simultaneous translation is specifically important when\ndealing with highly expressed genes, as these consume more resources. In\naddition, such a model can lead to more accurate predictions that are needed in\nthe interconnection of translational modules in synthetic biology. We develop\nand analyze a general model for large-scale simultaneous mRNA translation and\ncompetition for ribosomes. This is based on combining several ribosome flow\nmodels (RFMs) interconnected via a pool of free ribosomes.

The structure of smooth or equivalently low-sensitivity functions is\nstill a mystery. A well-known conjecture states that every such Boolean\nfunction can be computed by a shallow decision tree. While this conjecture\nimplies that smooth functions are easy to compute in the simplest computational\nmodel, to date no non-trivial upper bounds were known for such functions in any\ncomputational model, including unrestricted Boolean circuits. Even a bound on\nthe description length of such functions better than the trivial $2^n$ does not\nseem to have been known.\n  In this work, we establish the first computational upper bounds on smooth\nBoolean functions:\n  1) We show that every sensitivity s function is uniquely specified by its\nvalues on a Hamming ball of radius 2s.

In the case of random phases, the\nrepresentations are random as well and can be expressed with the help of It\\^o\nstochastic integrals.\n  We analyze the dynamics of the infinite state alone and the open system\ndynamics of small systems coupled to it. We show that under the free field\ndynamics, initial phase distributions are driven to the uniform distribution.\nWe demonstrate that coherences in small quantum systems, interacting with the\ninfinite coherent state, exhibit Gaussian time decay. The decoherence is\nqualitatively faster than the one caused by infinite thermal states, which is\nknown to be exponentially rapid only. This emphasizes the classical character\nof coherent states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 21:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Solar eruptions and high flare activity often accompany the rapid\nrotation of sunspots. The study of sunspot rotation and the mechanisms driving\nthis motion are therefore key to our understanding of how the solar atmosphere\nattains the conditions necessary for large energy release.\n  Aims. We aim to demonstrate and investigate the rotation of sunspots in a 3D\nnumerical experiment of the emergence of a magnetic flux tube as it rises\nthrough the solar interior and emerges into the atmosphere. Furthermore, we\nseek to show that the sub-photospheric twist stored in the interior is injected\ninto the solar atmosphere by means of a definitive rotation of the sunspots.\n  Methods. A numerical experiment is performed to solve the 3D resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations using a Lagrangian-Remap code. We track the\nemergence of a toroidal flux tube as it rises through the solar interior and\nemerges into the atmosphere investigating various quantities related to both\nthe magnetic field and plasma.\n  Results. Through detailed analysis of the numerical experiment, we find clear\nevidence that the photospheric footprints or sunspots of the flux tube undergo\na rotation. Significant vertical vortical motions are found to develop within\nthe two polarity sources after the field emerges. These rotational motions are\nfound to leave the interior portion of the field untwisted and twist up the\natmospheric portion of the field. This is shown by our analysis of the relative\nmagnetic helicity as a significant portion of the interior helicity is\ntransported to the atmosphere. In addition, there is a substantial transport of\nmagnetic energy to the atmosphere.

Somewhat\nsurprisingly, however, while the dependence of the convergence rate on the\nerror parameter $\\epsilon$ for packing problems was improved to\n$O(1/\\epsilon)$, which corresponds to what accelerated gradient methods are\ndesigned to achieve, the dependence for covering problems was only improved to\n$O(1/\\epsilon^{1.5})$, and even that required a different more complicated\nalgorithm.

To overcame\nthis lack of the information we successfully produced advanced nanostructures,\nnamely nanoparticles and nanotubes of that highlighted manganite by using a\nsol-gel modified method. High resolution transmission electron microscopy\nrevealed nanoparticle and nanotube diameters of 29 nm and 200 nm, respectively;\nand, in addition, this technique also showed that the wall of the nanotube is\nformed by the nanoparticles with 25 nm of diameter. The magnetocaloric\npotentials, ${\\Delta}S_M$ versus T curves, of the nanostructures were obtained\nand they are broader than the their bulk counterpart. This increases the useful\ntemperature range of a magnetic refrigerator. But also an undesired M-shape\nprofile for the nanotube sample was observed, due to the rising of a\nsuperparamagnetic behavior.

This problem is known as\n$\\mathit{rendezvous}$. Agents move in synchronous rounds. Each agent has a\ndistinct integer label from the set $\\{1,\\dots,L\\}$. Two main efficiency\nmeasures of rendezvous are its $\\mathit{time}$ (the number of rounds until the\nmeeting) and its $\\mathit{cost}$ (the total number of edge traversals). We\ninvestigate tradeoffs between these two measures. A natural benchmark for both\ntime and cost of rendezvous in a network is the number of edge traversals\nneeded for visiting all nodes of the network, called the exploration time.\nHence we express the time and cost of rendezvous as functions of an upper bound\n$E$ on the time of exploration (where $E$ and a corresponding exploration\nprocedure are known to both agents) and of the size $L$ of the label space. We\npresent two natural rendezvous algorithms.

To avoid intersymbol\ninterference (ISI), molecules of the same type should be released at time\ninstances that are sufficiently far apart.

At zero\ntemperature, we derive the phase diagram as a function of the two-body binding\nenergy and Zeeman field. In the ERD case, this phase diagram reveals several\ntopologically distinct uniform superfluid phases, classified according to the\nnodal structure of the quasiparticle excitation energies. Furthermore, we use a\nmomentum dependent SU(2)-rotation to transform the system into a generalized\nhelicity basis, revealing that spin-orbit coupling induces a triplet pairing\ncomponent of the order parameter. At non-zero temperature, we study the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition by including phase\nfluctuations of the order parameter up to second order.

This leads both to elliptic vortices and\nantivortices, and to anisotropic sound velocities. The latter prove to be\nsensitive to quantum phase transitions between topologically distinct phases.\nWe show further that at a fixed non-zero Zeeman field, the BKT critical\ntemperature is increased by the presence of ERD spin-orbit coupling.\nSubsequently, we demonstrate that the Clogston limit becomes infinite:\n$T_{\\rm{BKT}}$ remains non-zero at all finite values of the Zeeman field.

In this work, we investigate to which extent such\ncontributions influence, under a variety of hydrodynamic conditions, the force\nat the anchor point of a tethered cell and the survival probability of a\nbacterium that is attached to a host by either a slip or a catch bond via a\ntether with a few different biomechanical properties. We show that a\nconsequence of not including some of these contributions is that the force to\nwhich a bond is exposed can be significantly underestimated; in general by\n~32-46 %, where the influence of the surface corrections dominate (the parallel\nand normal correction coefficients contribute with ~5-8 or 23-26 %,\nrespectively). The Basset force is a major contributor, up to 20 %, for larger\ncells and shear rates. The lift force and inertia contribute when cells with\nradii >3 micrometer reside in shear rates >2000 1/s.

We considered all five archival XMM-Newton observations, and we\napplied the 'flux-flux plot' (FFP) method. We found that the flux-flux plots\nwere highly affected by the choice of the light curves' time bin size, most\nprobably because of the fast and large amplitude variations, and the intrinsic\nnon-linear flux--flux relations in this source. Therefore, we recommend that\nthe smallest bin-size should be used in such cases. Hence, We constructed FFPs\nin 11 energy bands below 1.7 keV, and we considered the 1.7-3 keV band, as\nbeing representative of the primary emission. The FFPs are reasonably well\nfitted by a 'power-law plus a constant' model. We detected significant positive\nconstants in three out of five observations. The best-fit slopes are flatter\nthan unity at energies below $\\sim 0.9$ keV, where the soft excess is\nstrongest. This suggests the presence of intrinsic spectral variability. A\npower-law-like primary component, which is variable in flux and spectral slope\n(as $\\Gamma\\propto N_{\\rm PL}^{0.1}$) and a soft-excess component, which varies\nwith the primary continuum (as $F_{\\rm excess}\\propto F_{\\rm primary}^{0.46}$),\ncan broadly explain the FFPs. In fact, this can create positive `constants',\neven when a stable spectral component does not exist. Nevertheless, the\npossibility of a stable, soft--band constant component cannot be ruled out, but\nits contribution to the observed 0.2-1 keV band flux should be less than $\\sim\n15$ %. The model constants in the FFPs were consistent with zero in one\nobservation, and negative at energies below 1 keV in another.

We consider a very transparent example of an\nideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a\nmulti-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses.\nCumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $\\chi_n^Q$ are calculated in a\nstatic and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental\ndata. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\\text{min}}\\leq p_t\\leq\np_{t_\\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions\nof effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts\nin $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We\ndiscuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of\nelectric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent\ndata of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We find that the different momentum\ncuts of $p_{t_\\text{min}}=0.2$~GeV (STAR) and $p_{t_\\text{min}}=0.3$~GeV\n(PHENIX) are responsible for more than 30\\% of the difference between these two\ndata sets. We argue that the $p_t$ cuts imposed on charged particles will\ninfluence the normalized kurtosis {$\\kappa_Q\\sigma_Q^2 = \\chi_4^Q/\\chi_2^Q$} of\nthe electric charge fluctuations. In particular, the reduction of\n$\\kappa_Q\\sigma_Q^2$ with increasing $p_{t_\\text{min}}$ will lead to\ndifferences between PHENIX and STAR data of ${\\cal O}(6\\%)$ which currently are\nburied under large statistical and systematic errors. We furthermore introduce\nthe relation between momentum cut-off and finite volume effects, which is of\nrelevance for the comparison between experimental data and lattice QCD\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 14:46:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 03:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The aim of the package is to facilitate\nanalyses requiring custom generated limb darkening profiles, such as the\nstudies of exoplanet transits--especially transmission spectroscopy, where the\ntransit modelling is carried out for custom narrow passbands--eclipsing\nbinaries (EBs), interferometry, and microlensing events. First, LDTk can be\nused to compute custom limb darkening profiles with uncertainties propagated\nfrom the uncertainties in the stellar parameter estimates. Second, LDTk can be\nused to estimate the limb-darkening-model specific coefficients with\nuncertainties for the most common limb-darkening models. Third, LDTk can be\ndirectly integrated into the log posterior computation of any pre-existing\nmodelling code with minimal modifications. The last approach can be used to\nconstrain the LD model parameter space directly by the LD profile, allowing for\nthe marginalization over the LD parameter space without the need to approximate\nthe constraint from the LD profile using a prior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 15:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}
