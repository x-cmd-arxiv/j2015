The s to\nr abundance ratio ([La/Eu]) of Cepheids shows a well defined anticorrelation\nwith of both Eu and Fe.

Standard feature\nselection issues remain such as how to determine a final model which\ngeneralizes well. This paper solves these problems with a sequential algorithm\ncalled Revisiting Alpha-Investing (RAI). RAI is motivated by the principle of\nmarginality and searches the feature-space of higher-order interactions by\ngreedily building upon lower-order terms. RAI controls a notion of false\nrejections and comes with a performance guarantee relative to the best-subset\nmodel. This ensures that signal is identified while providing a valid stopping\ncriterion to prevent over-selection.

In addition, several\naspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining\nworker's bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge\nof the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this\nwork we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that\nsimultaneously estimates a task's duration and obtains reliable aggregations of\ncrowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight\nthat the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of\nthe likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses\nlatent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers' completion\ntime, the tasks' duration and the workers' accuracy. To relate the quality of a\njudgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each\ntask is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a\npropensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are\nexpected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower\npropensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are\nassumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required\nby normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian\ninference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion\nmatrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker,\n(iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task.\nUsing two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that\nBCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more\ninformative estimates of a task's duration compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 16:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 21:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Observations reveal a point-like source\naligned with elongated diffuse emission. The X-ray spectra are best-fitted by\nabsorbed power laws with photon indices ~1.7 for the point-like and ~2.0 for\nthe extended one. Both sources show nonthermal radio-continuum counterparts\nthat might indicate a physical association. From the available data, we did not\ndetect variability on the point-like source in several timescales. Two possible\nscenarios are analyzed: first, based on HI line absorption, assuming a Galactic\norigin, we infer a distance upper bound of <2 kpc, which poses a constraint on\nthe height over the Galactic plane of <200 pc and on the linear size of the\nsystem of <2.3 pc. In this case, the X-ray luminosities are >10^32 erg/s and\n>7.5 x 10^32 erg/s, for the point-like and extended sources, respectively;\nsecond, an extra-Galactic nature is discussed, where the point-like source\nmight be the core of a radio galaxy and the extended source its lobe.

In this paper, we describe an approach for using the LISA Pathfinder\n(LPF) mission as an instrument to detect and characterize the dynamics of dust\nparticles in the vicinity of Earth-Sun L1. Launching in late 2015, LPF is a\ndedicated technology demonstrator mission that will validate several key\ntechnologies for a future space-based gravitational-wave observatory. The\nprimary science instrument aboard LPF is a precision accelerometer which we\nshow will be capable of sensing discrete momentum impulses as small as $4\\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\textrm{N}\\cdot\\textrm{s}$. We then estimate the rate of such impulses\nresulting from impacts of micrometeoroids based on standard models of the\nmicrometeoroid environment in the inner solar system. We find that LPF may\ndetect dozens to hundreds of individual events corresponding to impacts of\nparticles with masses $> 10^{-9}\\,$g during LPF's roughly six-month science\noperations phase in a $5\\times 10^5\\,\\textrm{km}$ by $8\\times\n10^5\\,\\textrm{km}$ Lissajous orbit around L1. In addition, we estimate the\nability of LPF to characterize individual impacts by measuring quantities such\nas total momentum transferred, direction of impact, and location of impact on\nthe spacecraft. Information on flux and direction provided by LPF may provide\ninsight as to the nature and origin of the individual impact and help constrain\nmodels of the interplanetary dust complex in general. Additionally, this direct\nin-situ measurement of micrometeoroid impacts will be valuable to designers of\nfuture spacecraft targeting the environment around L1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 19:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 19:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 13:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

The most flare\nprolific class, the delta sunspot-group, is characterised by opposite polarity\numbrae within a common penumbra, separated by less than 2 degrees. In this\narticle, we present a new system, called the Solar Monitor Active Region\nTracker - Delta Finder (SMART-DF), that can be used to automatically detect and\nclassify magnetic deltas in near-realtime. Using continuum images and\nmagnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA's\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we first estimate distances between opposite\npolarity umbrae. Opposite polarity pairs having distances of less that 2\ndegrees are then identified, and if these pairs are found to share a common\npenumbra, they are identified as a magnetic delta configuration. The algorithm\nwas compared to manual delta detections reported by the Space Weather\nPrediction Center (SWPC), operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA). SMART-DF detected 21 out of 23 active regions (ARs) that\nwere marked as delta spots by NOAA during 2011 - 2012 (within +/- 60 degrees\nlongitude).

The\nordinary one is decoupled via the high scale type-I seesaw mechanism, while the\nextra pairs off with its left-handed (LH) partner. The symmetry of lepton and\nquark contents was merely used as a guideline to the choice of parameters\nbecause it is not a proper symmetry. Here we argue that the underlying symmetry\nto take for this correspondence is presymmetry, the hidden electroweak symmetry\nof the SM extended with RH neutrinos defined by transformations which exchange\nlepton and quark bare states with the same electroweak charges and no Majorana\nmass terms in the underlying Lagrangian. It gives a topological character to\nfractional charges, relates the number of families to the number of quark\ncolors, and now guarantees the great disparity between the couplings of the two\nRH neutrinos. Thus, Dirac neutrinos with extremely small masses appear as\nnatural predictions of presymmetry, satisfying the 't Hooft's naturalness\nconditions in the extended seesaw where the extra RH neutrinos serve to\nadulterate the mass properties in the low scale effective theory, which retains\nwithout extensions the gauge and Higgs sectors of the SM. However, the high\nenergy threshold for the seesaw implies new physics to stabilize the quantum\ncorrections to the Higgs boson mass in agreement with the naturalness\nrequirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 20:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-23"}

Beginning with reasonable models for evolved VMSs with masses\nof $80~M_\\odot$ and $120~M_\\odot$, we simulate the change of state caused by a\ngiant eruption via two methods that explicitly conserve total energy: 1.\nSynthetically removing outer layers of mass of a few $M_\\odot$ while reducing\nthe energy of the inner layers. 2. Synthetically transferring energy from the\ncore to the outer layers, an operation that automatically causes mass ejection.\nOur focus is on the aftermath, not the poorly-understood eruption itself. Then,\nusing a radiation-hydrodynamic code in 1D with realistic opacities and\nconvection, the interior disequilibrium state is followed for about 200 years.\nTypically the star develops a $\\sim 400 ~\\rm{km}~\\rm{s}^{-1}$ wind with a mass\nloss rate that begins around $0.1 ~M_\\odot~\\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and gradually\ndecreases.

Members of a comet pair or group move in nearly identical\norbits and their origin as fragments of a common parent comet is\nunquestionable. The only variable is the time of perihelion passage, which\ndiffers from member to member considerably due primarily to an orbital-momentum\nincrement acquired during breakup. Meter-per-second separation velocities\naccount for gaps of years or tens of years, thanks to the orbital periods of\nmany millennia. The physical properties of individual members may not at all be\nalike, as illustrated by the trio of C/1988 A1, C/1996 Q1, and C/2015 F3. We\nexploit orbital similarity to examine whether the celebrated and as yet\nunidentified object, discovered from the Lick Observatory near the Sun at\nsunset on 1921 August 7, happened to be a member of such a pair and to track\ndown the long-period comet to which it could be genetically related.

The gap of 74.4\nyears between their perihelion times is consistent with a separation velocity\nof ~1 m/s that set the fragments apart following the parent's breakup in a\ngeneral proximity of perihelion during the previous return to the Sun in the\n7th millennium BCE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 21:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 17:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

The term magnetoelectric potential is sometimes used to signify the\nmagnetic-monopole induced dual to the usual electromagnetic potential. To this\nend, we introduce a general theory for describing modes and characteristics of\nwaveguides based on mixed-monopole materials, with both electric and magnetic\nresponses. Our theory accommodates exotic media such as double-negative,\nnear-zero and zero-index materials, and we demonstrate that our general theory\nexhibits the electromagnetic duality that would arise if we were to incorporate\nmagnetic monopoles into the media. We consider linear, homogeneous, isotropic\nwaveguide materials with slab and cylindrical geometries. To ensure manifest\nelectromagnetic duality, we construct generic electromagnetic susceptibilities\nthat are dual in both electric charges and magnetic monopoles using a\ngeneralized Drude-Lorentz model that manifests this duality. Our model reduces\nto standard cases in appropriate limits.

These are particularly effective for models of\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) in presence of $R$-parity conservation, owing to the\npresence in their spectra of a stable neutralino as dark matter candidate. We\nassume here as theoretical framework Supersymmetric ($B-L$) extension of the\nStandard Model (BLSSM), wherein a mediator for invisible decays can be $Z'$\nboson. The peculiarity of the signal is thus that the final state objects carry\na very large (transverse) missing energy, since the $Z'$ is naturally massive\nand constrained by direct searches and electro-weak precision tests to be at\nleast in TeV scale region. Under these circumstances the efficiency in\naccessing the invisible final state and rejecting the standard model background\nis very high. This somehow compensates the rather meagre production rates.\nAnother special feature of this invisible BLSSM signal is its composition,\nwhich is often dominated by sneutrino decays (alongside the more traditional\nneutrino and neutralino modes). Sensitivity of the CERN machine to these two\nfeatures can therefore help disentangling the BLSSM from more popular SUSY\nmodels.

This correlation effect in\ncombination with the nontrivial topology has two remarkable consequences: (i)\ncoexistence of light and heavy surface states at low temperatures.

Dramatic disappearance of strong absorption components\nat low radial velocity is seen towards three stars - HD 63578, HD 68217, HD\n76161 - over 15-18 years; HD 68217 and HD 76161 are associated with the Vela\nSNR but HD 63578 is likely associated with the wind bubble of g2 Velorum. The\nvanishing of these cold neutral clouds in the short time of 15 to 18 years\nneeds some explanation. Other changes are seen in high-velocity Na D\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 06:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Polar codes can be efficiently decoded by\nthe low-complexity successive cancelation (SC) algorithm and the SC list (SCL)\ndecoding algorithm. The belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm not only is\nan alternative to the SC and SCL decoders, but also provides soft outputs that\nare necessary for joint detection and decoding. Both the BP decoder and the\nsoft cancelation (SCAN) decoder were proposed for polar codes to output soft\ninformation about the coded bits. In this paper, first a belief propagation\ndecoding algorithm, called reduced complexity soft cancelation (RCSC) decoding\nalgorithm, is proposed. Let $N$ denote the block length. Our RCSC decoding\nalgorithm needs to store only $5N-3$ log-likelihood ratios (LLRs),\nsignificantly less than $4N-2+\\frac{N\\log_2N}{2}$ and $N(\\log_2N+1)$ LLRs\nneeded by the BP and SCAN decoders, respectively, when $N\\geqslant 64$.\nBesides, compared to the SCAN decoding algorithm, our RCSC decoding algorithm\neliminates unnecessary additions over the real field. Then the simplified SC\n(SSC) principle is applied to our RCSC decoding algorithm, and the resulting\nSSC-aided RCSC (S-RCSC) decoding algorithm further reduces the computational\ncomplexity. Finally, based on the S-RCSC decoding algorithm, we propose a\ncorresponding memory efficient decoder architecture, which has better error\nperformance than existing architectures. Besides, our decoder architecture\nconsumes less energy on updating LLRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 06:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the N-polar QWs\nexhibit abrupt interfaces and homogeneous composition, excluding emission from\nIn-rich clusters as the reason for this anomalous behavior. The microscopic\norigin of the luminescence in the N-polar QWs is elucidated using spatially\nresolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Regardless of well width, the\nluminescence is found to not originate from the N-polar QWs, but from the\nsemipolar facets of v-pit defects. These results cast serious doubts on the\npotential of N-polar QWs grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy for\nthe development of long-wavelength light emitting diodes. What remains to be\nseen is whether unconventional growth conditions may enable a significant\nreduction in the concentration of nonradiative defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 08:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

When analyzing texts, these patterns are\ncalled topics. Among numerous extensions of LDA, few of them can reliably\nanalyze multiple groups of documents and extract topic similarities.

We include a\ntime-dependent chemical network, self-shielding by gas and dust, and\nself-gravity. Pure thermal feedback alone is sufficient to produce the observed\nsurface brightness, although it is very sensitive to the supernova rate. Cosmic\nrays suppress this sensitivity and reduce the surface brightness because they\ndrive cooler outflows. Self-gravity has by far the largest effect because it\naccumulates the diffuse gas in the disk in dense clumps and filaments, so that\nsupernovae exploding in voids can eject a large amount of hot gas into the\nhalo. This can boost the surface brightness by several orders of magnitude.\nAlthough our simulations do not reach a steady state, all simulations produce\nsurface brightness values of the same order of magnitude as the observations,\nwith the exact value depending sensitively on the simulation parameters.

No O2 emission is detected\ntowards the Sgr A +50 km/s Cloud, but a number of strong emission lines of\nmethanol (CH3OH) and absorption lines of chloronium (H2Cl+) are observed. A 3\nsigma upper limit for the fractional abundance ratio of (O2)/(H2) in the Sgr A\n+50 km/s Cloud is found to be X(O2) less than 5 x 10(-8). However, since we can\nfind no other realistic molecular candidate than O2 itself, we very tentatively\nsuggest that two weak absorption lines at 487.261 and 487.302 GHz may be caused\nby the 487 GHz line of O2 in two foreground spiral arm clouds. By considering\nthat the absorption may only be apparent, the estimated upper limit to the O2\nabundance of less than (10-20) x 10(-6) in these foreground clouds is very\nhigh.

Line widths are\ngenerally high, typically around FWHM=800 km s^-1, consistent with wind\nvelocities in hydrodynamic models. A broad H-alpha line in one target implies a\nblack hole mass of a few 10^9 M$_sun. The ratio of line widths, sigma, to bulk\nvelocity, v, is so large that even the gas in galaxies with regular velocity\nfields is unlikely to be gravitationally bound. It is unclear, however, whether\nthe large line widths are due to turbulence or unresolved, local outflows as\nare sometimes observed at low redshifts. Comparison of the kinetic energy with\nthe energy supply from the AGN through jet and radiation pressure suggests that\nthe radio source still plays a dominant role for feedback, consistent with\nlow-redshift radio-loud quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 14:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Several new techniques to determine the metallicity of M dwarfs with\nbetter precision have been developed over the last decades. However, most of\nthese studies were based on empirical methods.

Aims. In this work we continue the reliability confirmation and\ndevelopment of metallicity determinations of M dwarfs using high- resolution\ninfrared spectra. The reliability was confirmed though analysis of M dwarfs in\nfour binary systems with FGK dwarf companions and by comparison with previous\noptical studies of the FGK dwarfs. Methods. The metallicity determination was\nbased on spectra taken in the J band (1.1-1.4 {\\mu}m) with the CRIRES\nspectrograph. In this part of the infrared, the density of stellar molecular\nlines is limited, reducing the amount of blends with atomic lines enabling an\naccurate continuum placement.

Significant\nspectroscopic variability suggestive of radial pulsations was found for the\nyellow supergiant VdBH 222 #505.

The class of such models under consideration have\ngeneral drift and diffusion coefficients and boundary points that are\nconsistent with the notion that demand should tend to decrease the inventory\nlevel. Characterization of the cost of a general $(s,S)$ policy as a function\n$F$ of two variables naturally leads to a nonlinear optimization problem over\nthe ordering levels $s$ and $S$. Existence of an optimizing pair $(s_*,S_*)$ is\nestablished for these models. Using the minimal value $F_*$ of $F$, along with\n$(s_*,S_*)$, a function $G$ is identified which is proven to be a solution of a\nquasi-variational inequality provided a simple condition holds. At this level\nof generality, optimality of the $(s_*,S_*)$ ordering policy is established\nwithin a large class of ordering policies such that local martingale and\ntransversality conditions involving $G$ hold. For specific models, optimality\nof an $(s,S)$ policy in the general class of admissible policies can be\nestablished using comparison results. This most general optimality result is\nshown for the classical drifted Brownian motion inventory model with holding\nand fixed plus proportional ordering costs and for a geometric Brownian motion\ninventory model with fixed plus level-dependent ordering costs. However, for a\ndrifted Brownian motion process with reflection at $\\{0\\}$, a new class of\nnon-Markovian policies is introduced which have lower costs than the $(s,S)$\npolicies. In addition, interpreting reflection at $\\{0\\}$ as \"just-in-time\"\nordering, a necessary and sufficient condition is given that determines when\njust-in-time ordering is better than traditional $(s,S)$ policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 15:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-23"}
