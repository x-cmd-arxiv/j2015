A\nwell-studied problem in such system is the design of linear beamformers for\npower minimization with the quality of service (QoS) constraints. The most\nrepresentative algorithms for solving this class of problems are the so-called\nMMSE-SOCP algorithm [11-12] and the UDD algorithm [9]. The former is based on\nalternating optimization of the transmit and receive beamformers, while the\nlatter is based on the well-known uplink-dowlink duality theory. Despite their\nwide applicability, the convergence (to KKT solutions) of both algorithms is\nstill open in the literature. In this paper, we rigorously establish the\nconvergence of these algorithms for QoS-constrained power minimization (QCPM)\nproblem with both single stream and multiple streams per user cases. Key to our\nanalysis is the development and analysis of a new MMSE-DUAL algorithm, which\nconnects the MMSE-SOCP and the UDD algorithm. Our numerical experiments show\nthat 1) all these algorithms can almost always reach points with the same\nobjective value irrespective of initialization, 2) the MMSE-SOCP/MMSE-DUAL\nalgorithm works well while the UDD algorithm may fail with an infeasible\ninitialization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 16:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

In the first approach, we\ntransform the MTC problem to a minimum set cover (MSC) problem and use the\ngreedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity property of the MSC problem to\ncompute the solution to the MTC problem. In the second approach, we develop a\nnew \\textit{augmented greedy} algorithm for solving the MTC problem. This\napproach does not require the transformation of the MTC to MSC. Our augmented\ngreedy algorithm provides in a significant computational improvement while\nguaranteeing the same approximation ratio as the first approach. We propose\nseveral metrics to evaluate the performance of the sensor placement designs.\nFinally, we present detailed computational experiments for a number of real\nwater distribution networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 21:21:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 22:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 03:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Many existing studies in data mining\nliterature solve data stream classification tasks in a batch learning setting,\nwhich suffers from poor efficiency and scalability when dealing with big data.\nTo overcome the limitations, this paper investigates an online learning\nframework for big data stream classification tasks.

In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic\nrisk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,\ncirculatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors\nintroduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between\ndeath events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables\nbased on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing\nand, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence\nannuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in\nhealth treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available\ndata for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nto identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term\nforecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion\nof deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987\nto 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the\nfuture gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.\nNeoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due\nto mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due\nto circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in\ndeaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a\nmassive impact on social systems as, typically, such patients need long-term\ngeriatric care.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 02:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Of\nspecific importance is the uniformity of Eshelby's tensor S. Following this\npaper a vast literature has been generated using and developing Eshelby's\nresult and ideas, leading to some beautiful mathematics and extremely useful\nresults in a wide range of application areas. In 1961 Eshelby conjectured that\nfor anisotropic materials only ellipsoidal inhomogeneities would lead to such\nuniform interior fields. Although much progress has been made since then, the\nquest to prove this conjecture is still not complete; numerous important\nproblems remain open. Following a different approach to that considered by\nEshelby, a closely related tensor P=S D^0 arises, where D^0 is the host medium\ncompliance tensor. The tensor P is associated with Hill and is of course also\nuniform when ellipsoidal inhomogeneities are embedded in a homogeneous host\nphase. Two of the most fundamental and useful areas of applications of these\ntensors are in Newtonian potential problems such as heat conduction,\nelectrostatics, etc. and in the vector problems of elastostatics.\nMicromechanical methods established mainly over the last half-century have\nenabled bounds on and predictions of the effective properties of composite\nmedia. In many cases such predictions can be explicitly written down in terms\nof the Hill, or equivalently the Eshelby tensor and can be shown to provide\nexcellent predictions in many cases.

As the mean does not exist for the Cauchy prior, a natural\nquestion is whether the posterior means of the regression coefficients exist\nunder separation. We prove theorems that provide necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of posterior means under independent Cauchy priors\nfor the logit link and a general family of link functions, including the probit\nlink. We also study the existence of posterior means under multivariate Cauchy\npriors. For full Bayesian inference, we develop a Gibbs sampler based on\nPolya-Gamma data augmentation to sample from the posterior distribution under\nindependent Student-t priors including Cauchy priors, and provide a companion R\npackage in the supplement.

While\nalternative algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler in Stan can greatly\nimprove mixing, in order to resolve the issue of extremely heavy tailed\nposteriors for Cauchy priors under separation, one would need to consider\nlighter tailed priors such as normal priors or Student-t priors with degrees of\nfreedom larger than one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 04:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 02:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

Based on\nthose results, in this paper we introduce the Multidimensional Iterative\nFiltering (MIF) technique for the decomposition and time-frequency analysis of\nnon-stationary high-dimensional signals. And we present the extension of FP\nfilters to higher dimensions. We illustrate the promising performance of MIF\nalgorithm, equipped with high-dimensional FP filters, when applied to the\ndecomposition of 2D signals.\n  [1] A. Cicone, J. Liu, and H.

In order\nto derive rigorous recovery results, the measurement map is usually modeled\nprobabilistically. We derive sufficient conditions on the minimal amount of\nmeasurements ensuring recovery via convex optimization. We establish our\nresults via certain properties of the null space of the measurement map. In the\nsetting where the measurements are realized as Frobenius inner products with\nindependent standard Gaussian random matrices we show that $10 r (n_1 + n_2)$\nmeasurements are enough to uniformly and stably recover an $n_1 \\times n_2$\nmatrix of rank at most $r$. We then significantly generalize this result by\nonly requiring independent mean-zero, variance one entries with four finite\nmoments at the cost of replacing $10$ by some universal constant. We also study\nthe case of recovering Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices from measurement matrices\nproportional to rank-one projectors. For $m \\geq C r n$ rank-one projective\nmeasurements onto independent standard Gaussian vectors, we show that nuclear\nnorm minimization uniformly and stably reconstructs Hermitian rank-$r$ matrices\nwith high probability. Next, we partially de-randomize this by establishing an\nanalogous statement for projectors onto independent elements of a complex\nprojective 4-designs at the cost of a slightly higher sampling rate $m \\geq C\nrn \\log n$. Moreover, if the Hermitian matrix to be recovered is known to be\npositive semidefinite, then we show that the nuclear norm minimization approach\nmay be replaced by minimizing the $\\ell_2$-norm of the residual subject to the\npositive semidefinite constraint. Then no estimate of the noise level is\nrequired a priori.

This was shown in the case of\nan ideal scheme whereby the architecture has no sources of error. In any\nrealistic implementation, however, physical errors are present, which corrupt\nthe output of the transformation. We investigate the dominant sources of error\nin this architecture --- loss and mode-mismatch --- and consider how it affects\nthe BosonSampling protocol, a key application for passive linear optics. For\nour loss analysis we consider two major components that contribute to loss ---\nfiber and switches --- and calculate how this affects the success probability\nand fidelity of the device. Interestingly, we find that errors due to loss are\nnot uniform (unique to time-bin encoding), which asymmetrically biases the\nimplemented unitary. Thus, loss necessarily limits the class of unitaries that\nmay be implemented, and therefore future implementations must prioritise\nminimising loss rates if arbitrary unitaries are to be implemented. Our\nformalism for mode-mismatch is generlized to account for various phenomenon\nthat may cause mode-mismatch, but we focus on two --- errors in fiber-loop\nlengths, and time-jitter of the photon source.

For other OPF problems where the SDP relaxation only\nprovides a lower bound on the objective value rather than the globally optimal\ndecision variables, recent literature has proposed a penalization approach to\nfind feasible points that are often nearly globally optimal. A disadvantage of\nthis penalization approach is the need to specify penalty parameters. This\npaper presents an alternative approach that algorithmically determines a\npenalization appropriate for many OPF problems. The proposed approach\nconstrains the generation cost to be close to the lower bound from the SDP\nrelaxation. The objective function is specified using iteratively determined\nweights for a Laplacian matrix. This approach yields feasible points to the OPF\nproblem that are guaranteed to have objective values near the global optimum\ndue to the constraint on generation cost. The proposed approach is demonstrated\non both small OPF problems and a variety of large test cases representing\nportions of European power systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 15:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 22:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

The behavior of such inequalities under\nLorentz transformation has been a source of debate and controversies in the\npast. In this paper, we consider the two most commonly studied three-particle\npure states, that of W and GHZ states which exhibit distinctly different type\nof entanglement. We discuss the various types of three-particle inequalities\nused in previous studies and point to their corresponding shortcomings and\nstrengths. Our main result is that if one uses Czachor's relativistic spin\noperator and Svetlichny's inequality as the main measure of non-locality and\nuses the same angles in the rest frame ($S$) as well as the moving frame\n($S^{\\prime}$), then maximally violated inequality in $S$ will decrease in the\nmoving frame, and will eventually lead to lack of non-locality ( i.e.\nsatisfaction of inequality) in the $v \\rightarrow c$ limit. This is shown for\nboth the GHZ and W states and in two different configurations which are\ncommonly studied (\\textbf{Case $I$} and \\textbf{Case $II$}). Our results are in\nline with a more familiar case of two particle case. We also show that the\nsatisfaction of Svetlichny's inequality in the $v\\rightarrow c$ limit is\nindependent of initial particles' velocity. Our study shows that whenever we\nuse Czachor's relativistic spin operator, results draws a clear picture of\nthree-particle non-locality making its general properties consistent with\nprevious studies on two-particle systems regardless of the W state or the GHZ\nstate is involved.....\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 08:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 10:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}
