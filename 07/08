Originally identified as an ultra-compact high velocity cloud and\ncandidate Local Group galaxy, AGC 226067 is spatially and kinematically\ncoincident with the Virgo cluster, and the identification by multiple groups of\nan optical counterpart with no resolved stars supports the interpretation that\nthis systems lies at the Virgo distance (D=17 Mpc). The combined observations\nreveal that the system consists of multiple components: a central HI source\nassociated with the optical counterpart (AGC 226067), a smaller HI-only\ncomponent (AGC 229490), a second optical component (AGC 229491), and extended\nlow surface brightness HI. Only ~1/4 of the single-dish HI emission is\nassociated with AGC 226067; as a result, we find M_HI/L_g ~ 6 Msun/Lsun, which\nis lower than previous work. At D=17 Mpc, AGC 226067 has an HI mass of 1.5 x\n10^7 Msun and L_g = 2.4 x 10^6 Lsun, AGC 229490 (the HI-only component) has\nM_HI = 3.6 x 10^6 Msun, and AGC 229491 (the second optical component) has L_g =\n3.6 x 10^5 Lsun. The nature of this system of three sources is uncertain: AGC\n226067 and AGC 229490 may be connected by an HI bridge, and AGC 229490 and AGC\n229491 are separated by only 0.5'. The current data do not resolve the HI in\nAGC 229490 and its origin is unclear. We discuss possible scenarios for this\nsystem of objects: an interacting system of dwarf galaxies, accretion of\nmaterial onto AGC 226067, or stripping of material from AGC 226067.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 16:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

By examining\nthe abundances of these molecules across a broad range of temperatures\n(spanning equilibrium temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via\ntemperature-pressure profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant\ncompared to carbon monoxide and water. Atmospheric mixing does not alter this\nconclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the atmosphere.\nCarbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable abundances if the\nmetallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is negated by temperatures\nabove 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, our generic result has the\nimplication that retrieval studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon\ndioxide as a prior of the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam\nfree as a fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of\nthe carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions. We discuss\nthe relevance of these implications for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b and suggest\nthat some of the previous results are chemically impossible. The relative\nabundance of carbon dioxide to acetylene is potentially a sensitive diagnostic\nof the carbon-to-oxygen ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 20:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 18:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

Moreover, since the model does\nnot rely on active-sterile mixing for producing the relic density, the mixing\nangles can be small enough to evade current x-ray or lifetime constraints.\nNevertheless, we discuss how future x-ray observations, future lepton number\nconstraints, and future observations and sophisticated simulations of\nlarge-scale structure could, in conjunction, provide evidence for this model\nand/or constrain and probe its parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 22:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 06:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

Clustering analysis\nof the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at $T_m$, with\nmultiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, show a network of\nmetastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral\npH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations\nresulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal\nthat Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination\nof nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism.

In this paper we analyze a stochastic version of NGD and prove its\nconvergence to a global minimum for a wider class of functions: we require the\nfunctions to be quasi-convex and locally-Lipschitz. Quasi-convexity broadens\nthe con- cept of unimodality to multidimensions and allows for certain types of\nsaddle points, which are a known hurdle for first-order optimization methods\nsuch as gradient descent. Locally-Lipschitz functions are only required to be\nLipschitz in a small region around the optimum.

Therefore, momentum exchanges between waves\npropagating in stars, differential rotation, and meridional circulation must be\ncarefully evaluated. In this work, we study axisymmetric mean flows in rapidly\nand initially uniformly rotating massive stars driven by small amplitude\nnon-axisymmetric $\\kappa$-driven oscillations. We treat them as perturbations\nof second-order of the oscillation amplitudes and derive their governing\nequations as a set of coupled linear ordinary differential equations. This\nallows us to compute 2-D zonal and meridional mean flows driven by low\nfrequency $g$- and $r$-modes in slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars and $p$-modes in\n$\\beta$ Cephei stars. Oscillation-driven mean flows usually have large\namplitudes only in the surface layers. In addition, the kinetic energy of the\ninduced 2-D zonal rotational motions is much larger than that of the meridional\nmotions. In some cases, meridional flows have a complex radial and latitudinal\nstructure. For SPB stars, we find that there are low frequency retrograde\n$g$-modes and $r$-modes that drive mean flows with positive velocity components\nin the radial and azimuthal directions at the stellar surface. This suggests\nthat low frequency retrograde modes can transport angular momentum to the\nsurface layers, which may help to form a circumstellar gaseous disc. Moreover,\npulsation-driven and rotation-driven meridional flows can have similar\namplitudes.

In this paper, a novel connectivity-aware approximation algorithm for\nrelay node placement in WSNs is proposed to offer a major step forward in\nsaving system overhead. Specifically, a unique Local Search Approximation\nAlgorithm (LSAA) is introduced to solve the Relay Node Single Cover (RNSC)\nproblem. In this proposed LSAA approach, the sensor nodes are allocated into\ngroups and then a local Set Cover (SC) for each group is achieved by a local\nsearch algorithm. The union set of all local SCs constitutes a SC of the RNSC\nproblem. The approximation ratio and the time complexity of the LSAA are\nanalyzed by rigorous proof. Additionally, the LSAA approach has been extended\nto solve the relay node double cover problem. Then, a Relay Location Selection\nAlgorithm (RLSA) is proposed to utilize the resulting SC from LSAA in combining\nRLSA with the minimum spanning tree heuristic to build the high-tier\nconnectivity. As the RLSA searches for a nearest location to the sink node for\neach relay node, the high-tier network built by RLSA becomes denser than that\nby existing works. As a result, the number of added relay nodes for building\nthe connectivity of the high-tier WSN can be significantly saved.

This second study of W3 within the HOBYS Key Program\nprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within W3 to further constrain the\nprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.\nProbability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative mass distributions (CMDs)\nwere created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction Av. The\nshape of the PDF, typically represented with a lognormal function at low Av\n\"breaking\" to a power-law tail at high Av, is influenced by various processes\nincluding turbulence and self-gravity. The breaks can also be identified, often\nmore readily, in the CMDs. The PDF break from lognormal (Av(SF)= 6-10 mag)\nappears to shift to higher Av by stellar feedback, so that high-mass\nstar-forming regions tend to have higher PDF breaks. A second break at Av > 50\nmag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. Because such a\nprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in W3, this second\nbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-mass\nstars/clusters. Stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving the\nlocal evolution and state of regions within W3. A high initial star formation\nefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leading\nto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., colliding\nflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. This scenario would be\ncompatible with the \"convergent constructive feedback\" model introduced in our\nprevious Herschel study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 07:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Nonetheless the interplay between Planck-scale effects and spacetime\ncurvature is still poorly understood, particularly in cases where curvature is\nnot constant. These challenges have been so far postponed by relying on an\nansatz, first introduced by Jacob and Piran. We here propose a general strategy\nof analysis of the effects of modifications of dispersion relation in FRW\nspacetimes, applicable both to cases where the relativistic equivalence of\nframes is spoiled (\"preferred-frame scenarios\") and to the alternative\npossibility of \"DSR-relativistic theories\", theories that are fully\nrelativistic but with relativistic laws deformed so that the modified\ndispersion relation is observer independent. We show that the Jacob-Piran\nansatz implicitly assumes that spacetime translations are not affected by the\nPlanck-scale, while under rather general conditions the same Planck-scale\nquantum-spacetime structures producing modifications of the dispersion relation\nalso affect translations. Through the explicit analysis of one of the effects\nproduced by modifications of the dispersion relation, an effect amounting to\nPlanck-scale corrections to travel times, we show that our concerns are not\nmerely conceptual but rather can have significant quantitative implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 07:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-30"}

Here we demonstrate for a 9-dimensional Lorenz-96 model\nhow to characterize the basin size of the global minimum when applying some\nparticular optimization based estimation algorithm. We compare three different\nstrategies for generating suitable initial guesses and we investigate the\ndependence of the solution on the given trajectory segment (underlying the\nmeasured time series). To address the question of how many state variables have\nto be measured for optimal performance, different types of multivariate time\nseries are considered consisting of 1, 2, or 3 variables. Based on these time\nseries the local observability of state variables and parameters of the\nLorenz-96 model is investigated and confirmed using delay coordinates. This\nresult is in good agreement with the observation that correct state and\nparameter estimation results are obtained if the optimization algorithm is\ninitialized with initial guesses close to the true solution. In contrast,\ninitialization with other exact solutions of the model equations (different\nfrom the true solution used to generate the time series) typically fails, i.e.\nthe optimization procedure ends up in local minima different from the true\nsolution. Initialization using random values in a box around the attractor\nexhibits success rates depending on the number of observables and the available\ntime series (trajectory segment).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 08:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-09"}

One method for calculating continuum damping is to\nsolve the MHD eigenvalue problem over a suitable contour in the complex plane,\nthereby satisfying the causality condition.

Extant\nliterature on teacher preparation suggests that pre-service teachers learn best\nwhen they are immersed in a community that allows them to develop dispositions,\nknowledge, and practical skills and share with the community a strong vision of\nwhat good teaching entails. However, despite having developed the requisite\ndispositions, knowledge, and skills in pursuing the shared vision of good\nteaching, the professional demands on a teacher's time are so great out of and\nso complex during class time that if every decision requires multiple\nconsiderations and deliberations with oneself, the productive decisions might\nnot materialize. We therefore argue that the missing link between intentional\ndecision-making and actual teaching practice are the teacher's habits\n(spontaneous responses to situational cues). Teachers unavoidably develop\nhabits with practical experience and under the influence of knowledge and\nbelief structures that in many ways condition the responses of teachers in\ntheir practical work. To steer new teachers away from developing unproductive\nhabits directed towards \"survival\" instead of student learning, we argue that\nany teacher preparation program (e.g., physics) should strive to develop in\npre-service teachers strong habits of mind and practice that will serve as an\nunderlying support structure for beginning teachers. These habits form the core\nof the conceptual model described in the paper.

This\ntheory uses a $k$- and $\\varepsilon$-explicit coercivity result for the\nunderlying sesquilinear form and shows, for example, that if $|\\varepsilon|\\sim\nk^2$, then classical overlapping additive Schwarz will perform optimally for\nthe absorptive problem, provided the subdomain and coarse mesh diameters are\ncarefully chosen. Extensive numerical experiments are given that support the\ntheoretical results. The theory for the absorptive case gives insight into how\nits domain decomposition approximations perform as preconditioners for the pure\nHelmholtz case $\\varepsilon = 0$. At the end of the paper we propose a\n(scalable) multilevel preconditioner for the pure Helmholtz problem that has an\nempirical computation time complexity of about $\\mathcal{O}(n^{4/3})$ for\nsolving finite element systems of size $n=\\mathcal{O}(k^3)$, where we have\nchosen the mesh diameter $h \\sim k^{-3/2}$ to avoid the pollution effect.\nExperiments on problems with $h\\sim k^{-1}$, i.e. a fixed number of grid points\nper wavelength, are also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 11:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 13:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

Our model shows that fractional\ndensity of dark energy $\\Omega_e$ is constant and close to zero during the\nearly evolution of the universe.\n  We have also constrained the model parameters for this class of models using\nthe astronomical data such as SNIa data, BAO, CMB, measurements of $H(z)$ and\nthe Alcock-Paczy{\\'n}ski test. In this context we formulate a simple criterion\nof variability of $\\Lambda$ with respect to $t$ in terms of variability of the\njerk or sign of estimator $(1-\\Omega_{\\text{m},0}-\\Omega_{\\Lambda,0})$. The\ncase study of our model enable us to find an upper limit $\\alpha^2 < 0.012$\n($2\\sigma$ C.L.) describing the variation from the cosmological constant while\nthe LCDM model seems to be consistent with various data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 12:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 13:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-29"}

This has made capsid\nassembly a rich field for computational models to attempt to fill the gaps in\nwhat is experimentally observable. Nonetheless, accurate simulation predictions\ndepend on accurate models and there are substantial obstacles to model\ninference for such systems. Here, we describe progress in learning parameters\nfor capsid assembly systems, particularly kinetic rate constants of coat-coat\ninteractions, by computationally fitting simulations to experimental data. We\npreviously developed an approach to learn rate parameters of coat-coat\ninteractions by minimizing the deviation between real and simulated light\nscattering data monitoring bulk capsid assembly in vitro. This is a difficult\ndata-fitting problem, however, because of the high computational cost of\nsimulating assembly trajectories, the stochastic noise inherent to the models,\nand the limited and noisy data available for fitting. Here we show that a newer\nclasses of methods, based on derivative-free optimization (DFO), can more\nquickly and precisely learn physical parameters from static light scattering\ndata. We further explore how the advantages of the approaches might be affected\nby alternative data sources through simulation of a model of time-resolved mass\nspectrometry data, an alternative technology for monitoring bulk capsid\nassembly that can be expected to provide much richer data.

First the\ncurrent network architectures (e.g. Two-stream ConvNets) are relatively shallow\ncompared with those very deep models in image domain (e.g. VGGNet, GoogLeNet),\nand therefore their modeling capacity is constrained by their depth.

However, this extension is not easy as the size of action recognition\nis quite small. We design several good practices for the training of very deep\ntwo-stream ConvNets, namely (i) pre-training for both spatial and temporal\nnets, (ii) smaller learning rates, (iii) more data augmentation techniques,\n(iv) high drop out ratio.

In this paper, we present an\nefficient computational method for the dynamic simulation of Brownian\nsuspensions with fluctuating hydrodynamics that handles both computations and\nprovides a similar approximation as Stokesian Dynamics for dilute and\nsemidilute suspensions. This advancement relies on combining the fluctuating\nforce-coupling method (FCM) with a new midpoint time-integration scheme we\nrefer to as the drifter-corrector (DC). The DC resolves the drift term for\nfluctuating hydrodynamics-based methods at a minimal computational cost when\nconstraints are imposed on the fluid flow to obtain the stresslet corrections\nto the particle hydrodynamic interactions.

This improves the users' reception\nquality and facilitates better service to cell-edge users. We consider a\nCoMP-enabled network, comprised of multiple BSs interconnected via a backhaul\nnetwork. We formulate the OFDMA Joint Scheduling (OJS) problem of determining a\nsubframe schedule and deciding if and how to use JT in order to maximize some\nutility function. We show that the OJS problem is NP-hard. We develop optimal\nand approximation algorithms for specific and general topologies, respectively.\nWe consider a time dimension and study a queueing model with packet arrivals in\nwhich the service rates for each subframe are obtained by solving the OJS\nproblem. We prove that when the problem is formulated with a specific utility\nfunction and solved optimally in each subframe, the resulting scheduling policy\nis throughput-optimal. Via extensive simulations we show that the bulk of the\ngains from CoMP with JT can be achieved with low capacity backhaul.

We start\nintroducing and reviewing cosmological reconstruction methods for metric $f(R)$\ntheories of gravity that can be considered as one of the straightforward\nmodifications of Einstein's gravity as soon as $f(R)\\neq R$. We then take into\naccount two possible $f(R)$ models which could give rise to (dark) radiation.\nConstraints on the models are found by using the Planck Collaboration 2015 data\nwithin a cosmographic approach and by obtaining the matter power spectrum of\nthose models. The conclusion is that $f(R)$ gravity can only contribute\nminimally to the (dark) radiation to avoid departures from the observed matter\npower spectrum at the smallest scales (of the order of $0.01$Mpc$^{-1}$), i.e.,\nprecisely those scales that exited the horizon at the radiation dominated\nepoch. This result could strongly contribute to select reliable $f(R)$ models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 20:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 19:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 15:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

We show that Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in long channels\nwith vortices exhibit a quantization of the current response with respect to\nthe spatial vortex distribution. The quantization originates from the\nwell-known topological property of the phase around a vortex --- it is an\ninteger multiple of $ 2 \\pi $. In a similar way to the integer quantum Hall\neffect, the current along the channel is related to this topological phase, and\ncan be extracted from two experimentally measurable quantities: the total\nmomentum of the BEC and the spatial distribution. The quantization is in units\nof $ m/2h $, where $ m $ is the mass of the atoms and $ h $ is Planck's\nconstant. We derive an exact vortex momentum-displacement relation for BECs in\nlong channels under general circumstances. Our results presents the possibility\nthat the configuration described here can be used as a novel way of measuring\nthe mass of the atoms in the BEC using a topological invariant of the system.\nIf an accurate determination of the plateaus are experimentally possible, this\ngives the possibility of a topological quantum mass standard and precise\ndetermination of the fine structure constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 06:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}
