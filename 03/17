[J. Contam. Hydrol. 145, 10-16 (2013)] observed that\nthe presence of suspended non-Brownian macroscopic particles decreased the\ndispersivity of a passive solute, for a pressure-driven flow in a narrow\nparallel-plates channel at low Reynolds number. This result contradicts the\nidea that the streamline distortion caused by the random diffusive motion of\nthe particles increases the dispersion and mixing of the solute. Therefore, to\nestimate the influence of this motion on the dispersivity of the solute, and\ninvestigate the origin of the reported decrease, we experimentally studied the\nprobability density functions (pdf) of the particle velocities, and\nspatio-temporal correlations, in the same experimental configuration. We\nobserved that, as the mean suspension velocity exceeds a critical value, the\npdf of the streamwise velocities of the particles markedly changes from a\nsymmetric distribution to an asymmetric one strongly skewed to high velocities\nand with a peak of most probable velocity close to the maximum velocity. The\nlatter observations and the analysis of suspension microstructure indicate that\nthe observed decrease in the dispersivity of the solute is due to particle\nmigration to the mid-plane of the channel, and consequent flattening of the\nvelocity profile. Moreover, we estimated the contribution of particle diffusive\nmotion to the solute dispersivity to be three orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe reported decrease, and thus negligible. Solute dispersion is then much more\naffected by how particles modify the flow velocity profile across the channel,\nthan by their diffusive random motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 16:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The\ntransverse spatial state of a photon is a convenient high-dimensional quantum\nsystem for study, as it has a well-understood classical analogue as the\ntransverse complex field profile of an optical beam. One severe drawback of all\ncurrently available quantum metrology techniques is the need for a\ntime-consuming characterization process, which scales very unfavorably with the\ndimensionality of the quantum system. Here we demonstrate a technique that\ndirectly measures a million-dimensional photonic spatial state in a single\nsetting. Through the arrangement of a weak measurement of momentum and parallel\nstrong measurements of position, the complex values of the entire photon state\nvector become measurable directly. The dimension of our measured state is\napproximately four orders of magnitude larger than previously measured. Our\nwork opens up a practical route for characterizing high-dimensional quantum\nsystems in real time. Furthermore, our demonstration also serve as a\nhigh-speed, extremely-high-resolution unambiguous complex field measurement\ntechnique for diverse classical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 16:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The performance of the well-designed\nfeatures for detecting the targeted operation usually degrades significantly\nfor other operations. On the other hand, a wise attacker can perform\nanti-forensics to fool the existing forensic methods, making countering\nanti-forensics become an urgent need.

Therefore, we model image\nprocessing/anti-forensic operations as steganography problems, and propose a\ndetection strategy by applying steganalytic features. With some advanced\nsteganalytic features, we are able to detect various image operations and\nfurther identify their types. In our experiments, we have tested several\nsteganalytic features on 11 different kinds of typical image processing\noperations and 4 kinds of anti-forensic operations.

Instead, the\noccupation of the open metal sites is governed by kinetics, whereby the\ninteraction of the guest molecules with the MOF organic linkers controls the\nreaction barrier for molecular exchange.

We describe a new protocol for\nevaluating fingerprint verification performance in order to improve the\nassessment of potential and limitations of fingerprint recognition systems.\nThis new evaluation protocol enables a more informed decision concerning the\noperating threshold in practical applications and the respective trade-off\nbetween security (low false acceptance rates) and usability (low false\nrejection rates). The skilled impostor attack is a general attack concept which\nis independent of specific databases or comparison algorithms. The proposed\nprotocol relying on skilled impostor attacks can directly be applied for\nevaluating the verification performance of other biometric modalities such as\ne.g. iris, face, ear, finger vein, gait or speaker recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 17:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The increase in near-infrared\nopacity of the dust at these distances roughly coincides with a sudden increase\nin expansion velocity as deduced from the gas-phase CO lines. Finally, the\nrecent mass loss of W Hya is confirmed to be highly variable and we identify a\nstrong peak in the mass-loss rate that occurred about 3500 years ago and lasted\nfor a few hundred years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 18:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this\npaper we present a first model and associated analysis for network formation\nunder the much more realistic assumption that the value of each additional\npiece of information depends on the type of that piece of information and on\nthe information already possessed: information may be complementary or\nredundant. We model the formation of a network as a non-cooperative game in\nwhich the actions are the formation of links and the benefit of forming a link\nis the value of the information exchanged minus the cost of forming the link.\nWe characterize the topologies of the networks emerging at a Nash equilibrium\n(NE) of this game and compare the efficiency of equilibrium networks with the\nefficiency of centrally designed networks. To quantify the impact of\ninformation redundancy and linking cost on social information loss, we provide\nestimates for the Price of Anarchy (PoA); to quantify the impact on individual\ninformation loss we introduce and provide estimates for a measure we call\nMaximum Information Loss (MIL). Finally, we consider the setting in which\nagents are not endowed with information, but must produce it. We show that the\nvalidity of the well-known \"law of the few\" depends on how information\naggregates; in particular, the \"law of the few\" fails when information displays\ncomplementarities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 19:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 05:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-13"}

In this work, we attempt to\nunderstand the source of the discrepancy by tracing the potential sources of\nsystematic and statistical error for the inverse-Compton Doppler factors. By\neliminating these sources of error, we provide stronger constrains on the value\nof the Doppler factor in blazar jets.

The physical processes\ndetermining this accretion rate remain unknown, partly due to a lack of\nobservational constraints on the gas at distances between ~10 and ~10$^5$\nSchwarzschild radii (Rs) from the black hole. Recent infrared observations\nidentify low-mass gas clouds, G1 and G2, moving on highly eccentric, nearly\nco-planar orbits through the accretion flow around Sgr A*. Although it is not\nyet clear whether these objects contain embedded stars, their extended gaseous\nenvelopes evolve independently as gas clouds. In this paper we attempt to use\nthese gas clouds to constrain the properties of the accretion flow at ~10$^3$\nRs. Assuming that G1 and G2 follow the same trajectory, we model the small\ndifferences in their orbital parameters as evolution resulting from interaction\nwith the background flow. We find evolution consistent with the G-clouds\noriginating in the clockwise disk. Our analysis enables the first unique\ndetermination of the rotation axis of the accretion flow: we localize the\nrotation axis to within 20 degrees, finding an orientation consistent with the\nparsec-scale jet identified in x-ray observations and with the circumnuclear\ndisk, a massive torus of molecular gas ~1.5 pc from Sgr A*. This suggests that\nthe gas in the accretion flow comes predominantly from the circumnuclear disk,\nrather than the winds of stars in the young clockwise disk. This result will be\ntested by the Event Horizon Telescope within the next year.

I map these as a function of solar\nconstant for planets ranging in size from Mars size to 10 Earth-mass. The\nstates are: globally ice covered (Ts< 245K), cold and damp (270 < Ts< 290K),\nhot and moist (350< Ts< 550K) and very hot and dry (Ts< 900K). No stable\nclimate exists for 290< Ts < 350K or 550 < Ts < 900K. The union of hot moist\nand cold damp climates describe the liquid water habitable zone, the width and\nlocation of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three\ndifferent climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong\nnon-linearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight.\n  Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to\nhigh altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth\nof unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet\nsurface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the\nformer dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker\ngravity: the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35Wm-2 higher for\nMars, 10Wm-2 higher for Earth or Venus but only a few Wm-2 higher for a 10\nEarth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion neglected) trend of\nincreasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40Wm-2 higher for\na 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that\nVenus-size (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway\ngreenhouse.\n  The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an\ninsolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone\nrequires background gas and greenhouse gas; N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are\nbiologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 20:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We represent the leading-order chiral EFT results\nfor the peripheral transverse densities as overlap integrals of chiral\nlight-front wave functions, describing the transition of the initial nucleon to\nsoft pion-nucleon intermediate states and back. The new representation (a)\nexplains the parametric order of the peripheral transverse densities; (b)\nestablishes an inequality between the spin-independent and -dependent\ndensities; (c) exposes the role of pion orbital angular momentum in chiral\ndynamics; (d) reveals a large left-right asymmetry of the current in a\ntransversely polarized nucleon and suggests a simple interpretation.

We selected two bright blazars, PKS 2149-306 at redshift z=2.345\nand S5 0836+710 at z=2.172, in order to observe them in the hard X-ray band\nwith the NuSTAR satellite. In this band the Compton component is rapidly rising\nalmost up to the peak of the emission. Simultaneous soft-X-rays and UV-optical\nobservations were performed with the Swift satellite, while near-infrared (NIR)\ndata were obtained with the REM telescope. To study their variability, we\nrepeated these observations for both sources on a timescale of a few months.\nWhile no fast variability was detected during a single observation, both\nsources were found to be variable in the X-ray band, up to 50%, between the two\nobservations, with larger variability at higher energies. No variability was\ndetected in the optical/NIR band. These data together with Fermi-LAT, WISE and\nother literature data are then used to study the overall spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of these blazars. Although the jet non-thermal emission\ndominates the SED, it leaves the UV band unhidden, allowing us to detect the\nthermal emission of the disc and to estimate the mass of the black hole. The\nnon-thermal emission is well reproduced by a one-zone leptonic model. The\nnon-thermal radiative processes are synchrotron, self-Compton and external\nCompton using seed photons from both the broad-line region (BLR) and the torus.\nWe find that our data are better reproduced if we assume that the location of\nthe dissipation region of the jet, R_diss, is in-between the torus, (at\nR_torus), and the BLR (R_torus>R_diss>R_BLR). The observed variability is\nexplained by changing a minimum number of model parameters by a very small\namount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 21:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 07:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Here we studied abnormalities in functional brain subnetworks in\nhigh-functioning individuals with ASD during free viewing of a movie containing\nsocial cues and interactions. Methods: Thirteen subjects with ASD and 13\nmatched-pair controls watched a 68 minutes movie during functional magnetic\nresonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson`s correlation between\nhaemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels. From the\nwhole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and group-level\nsubnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then calculated between\nall subject pairs to estimate intersubject similarity of connectivity structure\nof each subnetwork. Additional 27 individuals with ASD from the ABIDE\nresting-state database were included to test the reproducibility of the\nresults. Results: Between-group differences were observed in the composition of\ndefault-mode and a ventro-temporal-limbic (VTL) subnetwork. The VTL subnetwork\nincluded amygdala, striatum, thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior\ntemporal gyri. Further, VTL subnetwork similarity between subject pairs\ncorrelated significantly with similarity of symptom gravity measured with\nautism quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in\nthe reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores. Conclusions:\nReorganization of functional subnetworks in individuals with ASD clarifies the\nmixture of hypo- and hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the\nfunctional organization of the VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of\ninter-individual similarities that co-vary with behavioral measures across all\nparticipants. These findings suggest a pivotal role of ventro-temporal and\nlimbic systems in autism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 21:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Several theorems are\nintroduced that support the development of this State Following (StaF) method.\nIn particular, it is shown that there is a bound on the number of kernel\nfunctions required for the maintenance of an accurate function approximation as\na state moves through a compact set. Additionally, a weight update law, based\non gradient descent, is introduced where arbitrarily close accuracy can be\nachieved provided the weight update law is iterated at a sufficient frequency,\nas detailed in Theorem 6.1.\n  To illustrate the advantage, the impact of the StaF method is that for some\napplications the number of basis functions can be reduced.

The resulting theory\nconsiderably differs from LQG as well as from formulations that bound the\nprobability of violating state constraints. We develop results for optimal\nstate-feedback control in the two cases where i) steering of the state\ndistribution is to take place over a finite window of time with minimum energy,\nand ii) the goal is to maintain the state at a stationary distribution over an\ninfinite horizon with minimum power. For both problems the distribution of\nnoise and state are Gaussian. In the first case, we show that provided the\nsystem is controllable, the state can be steered to any terminal Gaussian\ndistribution over any specified finite time-interval. In the second case, we\ncharacterize explicitly the covariance of admissible stationary state\ndistributions that can be maintained with constant state-feedback control.

In\nthis approach, one has to solve two large scale Toeplitz linear systems in\nadvance. However, if the desired accuracy is high, the cost will be\nprohibitive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how to solve the\nToeplitz systems inexactly in this method. The contribution of this paper is in\nthree regards. First, we give a new stability analysis on the Gohberg-Semencul\nformula (GSF) and define the GSF condition number of a Toeplitz matrix. It is\nshown that, when the size of the Toeplitz matrix is large, our result is\nsharper than the one given in [M. Gutknecht and M.

Second, we establish a relation between the error of\nToeplitz systems and the residual of Toeplitz matrix exponential. We show that\nif the GSF condition number of the Toeplitz matrix is medium sized, then the\nToeplitz systems can be solved in a low accuracy. Third, based on this\nrelationship, we present a practical stopping criterion for relaxing the\naccuracy of the Toeplitz systems, and propose an inexact shift-and-invert\nArnoldi algorithm for the Toeplitz matrix exponential problem.

However, in reality, it is\neasier for us to observe the timestamps when different nodes in the network\nreact on a message, while the connections empowering the diffusion of the\nmessage remain hidden. This motivates recent extensive studies on the network\ninference problem: unveiling the edges from the records of messages\ndisseminated through them. Existing solutions are computationally expensive,\nwhich motivates us to develop an efficient two-step general framework,\nClustering Embedded Network Inference (CENI). CENI integrates clustering\nstrategies to improve the efficiency of network inference. By clustering nodes\ndirectly on the timelines of messages, we propose two naive implementations of\nCENI: Infection-centric CENI and Cascade-centric CENI. Additionally, we point\nout the critical dimension problem of CENI: instead of one-dimensional\ntimelines, we need to first project the nodes to an Euclidean space of certain\ndimension before clustering. A CENI adopting clustering method on the projected\nspace can better preserve the structure hidden in the cascades, and generate\nmore accurately inferred links. This insight sheds light on other related work\nattempting to discover or utilize the latent cluster structure in the\ndisseminated messages. By addressing the critical dimension problem, we propose\nthe third implementation of the CENI framework: Projection-based CENI. Through\nextensive experiments on two real datasets, we show that the three CENI models\nonly need around 20% $\\sim$ 50% of the running time of state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, the inferred edges of Projection-based CENI preserves or\neven outperforms the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 05:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

The framework of Hybrid\nautomata---introduced by Alur, Courcoubetis, Henzinger, and Ho---provides a\nformal modeling and specification environment to analyze the interaction\nbetween the discrete and continuous parts of a cyber-physical system.

How symbols can acquire meaning for the\nsystem itself, independent of external interpretation, is an unsolved problem.\nSome grounding of symbols can be obtained by embodiment, that is, by causally\nconnecting symbols (or sub-symbolic variables) to the physical environment,\nsuch as in a robot with sensors and effectors. However, a causal connection as\nsuch does not produce representation and aboutness of the kind that symbols\nhave for humans.

This paper aims to study such chemical effects and discusses\nthe feasibility of using molecular spectroscopy as a tracer of episodic\naccretion rates and timescales.\n  Methods: We simulate a strong accretion burst in a diverse sample of 25\nspherical envelope models by increasing the luminosity to 100 times the\nobserved value. Using a comprehensive gas-grain network, we follow the chemical\nevolution during the burst and for up to 10^5 yr after the system returns to\nquiescence.

Compared to previous environmental sensing approaches,\nthese new systems mitigate high installation and placement cost by providing a\nrobustness towards process noise. On the other hand, sensing focuses inward and\nattempts to capture mental activities such as cognitive load, fatigue or\nemotion through advances in, for instance, eye-gaze sensing systems or\ninterpretation of body gesture or pose.

Unlike the frequency domain empirical\nlikelihood (FDEL) methodology for time series (on a regular grid), the\nformulation of the spatial FDEL needs special care due to lack of the usual\northogonality properties of the discrete Fourier transform for irregularly\nspaced data and due to presence of nontrivial bias in the periodogram under\ndifferent spatial asymptotic structures. A spatial FDEL is formulated in the\npaper taking into account the effects of these factors. The main results of the\npaper show that Wilks' phenomenon holds for a scaled version of the logarithm\nof the proposed empirical likelihood ratio statistic in the sense that it is\nasymptotically distribution-free and has a chi-squared limit. As a result, the\nproposed spatial FDEL method can be used to build nonparametric, asymptotically\ncorrect confidence regions and tests for covariance parameters that are defined\nthrough spectral estimating equations, for irregularly spaced spatial data. In\ncomparison to the more common studentization approach, a major advantage of our\nmethod is that it does not require explicit estimation of the standard error of\nan estimator, which is itself a very difficult problem as the asymptotic\nvariances of many common estimators depend on intricate interactions among\nseveral population quantities, including the spectral density of the spatial\nprocess, the spatial sampling density and the spatial asymptotic structure.\nResults from a numerical study are also reported to illustrate the methodology\nand its finite sample properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 10:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Second, these likely diverse representatives are then used to\nproduce an extension of RF termed CLUB-DRF that is much smaller in size than\nRF, and yet performs at least as good as RF, and mostly exhibits higher\nperformance in terms of accuracy.

While most research had previously focused on 2D\nelectron systems, recently a three-dimensional (3D) form of such Rashba-effect\nwas found in a series of bismuth tellurohalides. Whereas these materials\nexhibit a very large spin-splitting, they lack an important property concerning\nfunctionalization, namely the possibility to switch or tune the spin texture.\nThis limitation can be overcome in a new class of functional materials\ndisplaying Rashba-splitting coupled to ferroelectricity: the ferroelectric\nRashba semiconductors (FERS). Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (SARPES) we show that GeTe(111) forms a prime member of this\nclass, displaying a complex spin-texture for the Rashba-split surface and bulk\nbands arising from the intrinsic inversion symmetry breaking caused by the\nferroelectric polarization of the bulk (FE).

It is rigorously shown\nthat if the heating of a reactive medium occurs within a sufficiently localized\nspot (e.g., heating of mantles by cosmic rays), then the subsequent thermal\nevolution is characterized by a single dimensionless number $\\lambda$. This\nnumber identifies a bifurcation between two distinct regimes: When $\\lambda$\nexceeds a critical value (threshold), the heat equation exhibits the explosive\nsolution, i.e., the thermal (chemical) explosion is triggered. Otherwise,\nthermal diffusion causes the deposited heat to spread over the entire grain --\nthis regime is commonly known as the whole-grain heating. The theory allows us\nto find a critical combination of the physical parameters that govern the\nexplosion of icy mantles due to impulsive spot heating. In particular, the\ncalculations suggest that heavy cosmic ray species (e.g., iron ions) colliding\nwith dust are able to trigger the explosion. Based on the recently calculated\nlocal cosmic-ray spectra, the expected rate of the explosive desorption is\nestimated. The efficiency of the desorption, which affects all solid species\nindependent of their binding energy, is shown to be comparable with other\ncosmic-ray desorption mechanisms typically considered in the literature. Also,\nthe theory allows us to estimate maximum abundances of reactive species that\nmay be stored in the mantles, which provides important constraints on available\nastrochemical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 12:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this paper, we propose CSR5 (Compressed Sparse\nRow 5), a new storage format, which offers high-throughput SpMV on various\nplatforms including CPUs, GPUs and Xeon Phi. First, the CSR5 format is\ninsensitive to the sparsity structure of the input matrix. Thus the single\nformat can support an SpMV algorithm that is efficient both for regular\nmatrices and for irregular matrices. Furthermore, we show that the overhead of\nthe format conversion from the CSR to the CSR5 can be as low as the cost of a\nfew SpMV operations. We compare the CSR5-based SpMV algorithm with 11\nstate-of-the-art formats and algorithms on four mainstream processors using 14\nregular and 10 irregular matrices as a benchmark suite. For the 14 regular\nmatrices in the suite, we achieve comparable or better performance over the\nprevious work.

Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is currently the most\nefficient method to generate a continuous additional off-axis toroidal plasma\ncurrent as well as reduce the poloidal flux consumption during the plasma\ncurrent ramp-up phase. The operation of the Tore Supra ITER-like LH launcher\nhas demonstrated the capability to couple LH power at ITER-like power densities\nwith very low reflected power during long pulses. In addition, the installation\nof eight 700kW/CW klystrons at the LH transmitter has allowed increasing the\ntotal LH power in long pulse scenarios. However, in order to achieve pure\nstationary LH sustained plasmas, some R\\&D are needed to increase the\nreliability of all the systems and codes, from the RF sources to the plasma\nscenario prediction. The CEA/IRFM is addressing some of these issues by leading\na R\\&D program towards an ITER LH system and by the validation of an integrated\nLH modeling suite of codes. In 2011, the RF design of a mode converter has been\nvalidated at low power. A 500 kW/5 s RF window is currently under manufacturing\nand will be tested at high power in 2012 in collaboration with NFRI. All of\nthis work aims to reduce the operational risks associated with the ITER\nsteady-state operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 13:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

The electron beam excites plasma waves whose wavelength and\nphase speed gradually decrease towards anode. The short waves near the anode\naccelerate plasma bulk electrons to suprathermal energies. The sheath near the\nanode reflects some of the accelerated electrons back into the plasma. These\nelectrons travel through the plasma, reflect near the cathode, and enter the\naccelerating area again but with a higher energy than before.

Some features of the mechanical design and the\nexperimental RF measurements at low power are reported in section 3. High power\nresults, made in collaboration with NFRI, are detailed in section 4. The\ndevelopment of CW windows is discussed in the conclusion. 2-RF AND MECHANICAL\nDESIGN The proposed 5 GHz RF window is based on a pill-box design [2] , i.e. a\nceramic brazed in portion of a circular waveguide, connected on either side to\na rectangular waveguide section. Typical design rules of thumb of such device\nare circular section diameter about the same size of the diagonal of the\nrectangular waveguide (cf. FIGURE 1). Without taking into account the ceramic,\nthe circular section length is approximately half a guided wavelength of the\ncircular TE 11 mode, in order for the device to act as a half-wave transformer.\nOnce optimized, taking into account the ceramic, matching is correct only for a\nnarrow band of frequency and is very sensitive to the device dimensions and the\nceramic relative permittivity. The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be\nextracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field\ntopology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent). Undesirable modes due\nto parasitic resonances can be excited in the ceramic volume, raising the\nelectric field and\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 14:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

And it is a notoriously difficult computational\nproblem to find binary sequences with low aperiodic autocorrelations. The\nproblem can also be stated in terms of finding binary sequences with minimum\nenergy levels or maximum merit factor defined by M.J.E. Golay, F=N^2/2E, N and\nE being the sequence length and energy respectively. Conjectured asymptotic\nvalue of F is 12.32 for very long sequences. In this paper, a theorem has been\nproved to show that there are finite number of possible energy levels, spaced\nat an equal interval of 4, for the binary sequence of a particular length. Two\nmore theorems are proved to derive the theoretical minimum energy level of a\nbinary sequence of even and odd length of N to be N/2, and N-1/2 respectively,\nmaking the merit factor equal to N and N^2/N-1 respectively. The derived\ntheoretical minimum energy level successfully explains the case of N =13, for\nwhich the merit factor (F =14.083) is higher than the conjectured value.\nSequence of lengths 4, 5, 7, 11, 13 are also found to be following the\ntheoretical minimum energy level. These sequences are exactly the Barker\nsequences which are widely used in direct-sequence spread spectrum and pulse\ncompression radar systems because of their low autocorrelation properties.\nFurther analysis shows physical reasoning in support of the conjecture that\nBarker sequences exists only when N <= 13 (this has been proven for all odd N).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 14:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

It is shown that the system of partial differential equations can be\nreduced to a single non-linear advection diffusion equation which describes the\ntime evolution of angular velocity.\n  In order to solve the equation three different turbulent viscosity\nprescriptions are considered. It is shown that for these parametrizations the\ndifferential equation allows for similarity transformations depending only on a\nsingle non-dimensional parameter. A detailed analysis of the similarity\nsolutions reveals that this parameter is the initial power law exponent of the\nangular velocity distribution at large radii.

The model contains two constant terms, as\nif a nonzero cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and a dissipative process are\noperative in a homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially flat universe. The\n$T$--$z$ relation is derived from a general radiative temperature law, as\nappropriate for describing nonequilibrium states in a creation of cold dark\nmatter (CCDM) model.

The main novelty of the study is\nin accounting not only for the normal (vertical), but also for tangential\nvertical (horisontal) displacements of the contacting surfaces. Exact general\nrelationships have been established between the contact approach and some\nintegral characteristics of the contact pressure, including the contact force.\nAsymptotic representations for the contact pressure integral characteristics\nare obtained in terms of the contact approach and some integral characteristics\nof the contact zone. The main result is represented by the first-order\napproximation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 14:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}
