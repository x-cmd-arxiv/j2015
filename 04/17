Here we show that for a simple molecular potential of\nethane, the critical influence zone covers a wide zone of tens of degrees\n(below the critical temperature) down to a transition temperature, at which the\napparent critical influence zone vanishes and the transition temperature can be\npredicted through a pressure analysis of the coexisting bulk liquid phase. The\nliquid phases within the apparent critical influence zone show low densities,\nmaking them behave internally like their corresponding vapor phases. Therefore,\nthe experimentally observed wide extension of the critical influence zone is\ndue to a vapor-like effect due to low bulk liquid phase densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 16:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

While PCM achieves\nlow energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly\nslower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before\nwearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware\ncache to absorb writes and provide faster access.

Because using hardware for detecting and\nremoving such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and\ncomplexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose.

We parametrize\nthe evolution of the first and second-order equations of motion as proposed by\nBellini and Sawicki (2014), where the free functions of the theory are assumed\nto be proportional to the dark energy density. We show that it is unnatural to\nhave large 10% ( 1%) deviations of the bispectrum introducing even larger ~ 30%\n(~ 5%) deviations in the linear growth rate. Considering that measurements of\nthe linear growth rate have much higher signal-to-noise than bispectrum\nmeasurements, this indicates that for Horndeski models which reproduce the\nexpansion history and the linear growth rate as predicted by GR the dark matter\nbispectrum kernel can be effectively modelled as the standard GR one. On the\nother hand, an observation of a large bispectrum deviation that can not be\nexplained in terms of bias would imply either that the evolution of\nperturbations is strongly different than the evolution predicted by GR or that\nthe theory of gravity is exotic (e.g., breaks the weak equivalence principle)\nand/or fine-tuned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 19:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 09:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

From the practical uses of clocks, we abstract a clock enlivened\nwith the computational capacity of a Turing machine, modified to transmit and\nto receive numerical communications. Such \"live clocks\" phase the steps of\ntheir computations to mesh with the arrival of transmitted numbers. We lift\nthis phasing, known in digital communications, to a principle of \\emph{logical\nsynchronization}, distinct from the synchronization defined by Einstein in\nspecial relativity.\n  Logical synchronization elevates digital communication to a topic in physics,\nincluding applications to biology. One explores how feedback loops in clocking\naffect numerical signaling among entities functioning in the face of\nunpredictable influences, making the influences themselves into subjects of\ninvestigation. The formulation of communications networks in terms of live\nclocks extends information theory by expressing the need to actively maintain\ncommunications channels, and potentially, to create or drop them.\n  We show how networks of live clocks are presupposed by the concept of\ncoordinates in a spacetime.

Satisfying this requirement becomes very\nchallenging in the case of long trajectories, due to the characteristic\ndivergences of chaotic dynamics. Here we examine schemes for addressing this\nproblem, which engineer correlation between a trial trajectory and its\nreference path, for instance using artificial forces. Our analysis is\nfacilitated by a modern perspective on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,\ninspired by non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, which clarifies the types of\nsampling strategies that can scale to long trajectories. Viewed in this light,\nthe most promising such strategy guides a trial trajectory by manipulating the\nsequence of random numbers that advance its stochastic time evolution, as done\nin a handful of existing methods. In cases where this \"noise guidance\"\nsynchronizes trajectories effectively, as the Glauber dynamics of a\ntwo-dimensional Ising model, we show that efficient path sampling can be\nachieved even for very long trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 19:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 21:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Proper neutrino physics, in\nparticular also neutrino absorption, have to be included in BNSM simulations\nbefore final conclusions can be drawn concerning r-processing in this\nenvironment and concerning observational consequences like kilonovae, whose\npeak brightness and color temperature are sensitive to the\ncomposition-dependent opacity of the ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 20:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

In this study we rely on a\nproduction function that is non-concave instead of the classical Cobb-Douglas\nproduction function. In order to model the physical capital diffusion through\nthe borders of the country, we developed a model based on a parabolic partial\ndifferential equation that describes the dynamics of physical capital and\nboundary conditions of Neumann type. Smuggling is present in many borders\nbetween countries and may include fuel, machinery and food. This smuggling\nthrough the borders is a problematic issue for the country's economies.

The\nformation of the $\\delta$-sunspot in such a realistic-scale domain produces\nemerging patterns similar to those formed in observations, e.g. the inverted\npolarity against Hale's law, the curvilinear motion of the spot, strong\ntransverse field with highly sheared magnetic and velocity fields at the PIL.\nStrong current builds up at the PIL, giving rise to reconnection, which\nproduces a complex coronal magnetic connectivity with non-potential fields in\nthe Delta-spot overlaid by more relaxed fields connecting the two polarities at\nthe two ends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 21:50:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Coronal rain is found to be a\nhighly multi-thermal phenomenon with a high degree of co-spatiality in the\nmulti-wavelength emission. EUV darkening and quasi-periodic intensity\nvariations are found to be strongly correlated to coronal rain showers.\nProgressive cooling of coronal rain is observed, leading to a height dependence\nof the emission. A fast-slow two-step catastrophic cooling progression is\nfound, which may reflect the transition to optically thick plasma states. The\nintermittent and clumpy appearance of coronal rain at coronal heights becomes\nmore continuous and persistent at chromospheric heights just before impact,\nmainly due to a funnel effect from the observed expansion of the magnetic\nfield. Strong density inhomogeneities on spatial scales of 0.2\"-0.5\" are found,\nin which TR to chromospheric temperature transition occurs at the lowest\ndetectable scales. The shape of the distribution of coronal rain widths is\nfound to be independent of temperature with peaks close to the resolution limit\nof each telescope, ranging from 0.2\" to 0.8\". However we find a sharp increase\nof clump numbers at the coolest wavelengths and especially at higher\nresolution, suggesting that the bulk of the rain distribution remains\nundetected.

During constrained optimization EAs\noften create solutions that fall outside the feasible region; hence a viable\nconstraint- handling strategy is needed. This paper focuses on the class of\nconstraint-handling strategies that repair infeasible solutions by bringing\nthem back into the search space and explicitly preserve feasibility of the\nsolutions. Several existing constraint-handling strategies are studied, and two\nnew single parameter constraint-handling methodologies based on parent-centric\nand inverse parabolic probability (IP) distribution are proposed. The existing\nand newly proposed constraint-handling methods are first studied with PSO, DE,\nGAs, and simulation results on four scalable test-problems under different\nlocation settings of the optimum are presented.

The first part\naddresses wind power dispatch into the electricity network using a battery\nenergy storage system (BESS). To manage the amount of energy sold to the\nelectricity market, a novel control scheme is developed based on discrete-time\nmodel predictive control (MPC) to ensure the optimal operation of the BESS in\nthe presence of practical constraints. The control scheme follows a decision\npolicy to sell more energy at peak demand times and store it at off-peaks in\ncompliance with the Australian National Electricity Market rules. The\nperformance of the control system is assessed under different scenarios using\nactual wind farm and electricity price data in simulation environment. The\nsecond part considers the control of overhead crane systems for automatic\noperation. To achieve high-speed load transportation with high-precision and\nminimum load swings, a new modeling approach is developed based on independent\njoint control strategy which considers actuators as the main plant. The\nnonlinearities of overhead crane dynamics are treated as disturbances acting on\neach actuator. The resulting model enables us to estimate the unknown\nparameters of the system including coulomb friction constants. A novel load\nswing control is also designed based on passivity-based control to suppress\nload swings. Two discrete-time controllers are then developed based on MPC and\nstate feedback control to track reference trajectories along with a feedforward\ncontrol to compensate for disturbances using computed torque control and a\nnovel disturbance observer. The practical results on an experimental overhead\ncrane setup demonstrate the high performance of the designed control systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 02:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 02:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

Traditional ways for collecting travel-speed oriented traffic data\nalways depend on dedicated sensors and supporting infrastructures, and are\ntherefore financial costly. Differently, vehicular crowdsensing as an\ninfrastructure-free way, can be used to collect data including real-time\nlocations and velocities of vehicles for road travel speed estimation, which is\na quite low-cost way. However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always\ncoarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of travel\nspeeds. Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate travel speed\naccurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the\nspatial-temporal correlation among travel speeds for roads by introducing the\ntime-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the\ntime consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly\ncalculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time\nlagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at\ndifferent roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation,\nwe further reduce the problem of single-road travel speed vacancy completion to\na minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of travel speed for\nroads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate\nexperiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the\nincompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based travel speed\nestimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated travel speed better, in\ncomparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 03:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 02:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 03:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}

In the literature, various statistical features\nserve as vector representations. In this work, we represent time series by a\ndensity model. The density model captures all the information available,\nincluding measurement errors. Hence, we view this model as a generalisation to\nthe static features which directly can be derived, e.g., as moments from the\ndensity. Similarity between each pair of time series is quantified by the\ndistance between their respective models. Classification is performed on the\nobtained distance matrix. In the numerical experiments, we use data from the\nOGLE and ASAS surveys and demonstrate that the proposed representation performs\nup to par with the best cur- rently used feature-based approaches. The density\nrepresentation preserves all static information present in the observational\ndata, in contrast to a less complete description by features. The density\nrepresentation is an upper boundary in terms of information made available to\nthe classifier. Consequently, the predictive power of the proposed\nclassification depends on the choice of similarity measure and classifier,\nonly. Due to its principled nature, we advocate that this new approach of\nrepresenting time series has potential in tasks beyond classification, e.g.,\nunsupervised learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 07:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 10:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

To ensure reliable information\nreception by all users, the conventional approach generally requires repeated\ntransmission by the source until all the users are able to decode the\ninformation, which is inefficient in many practical scenarios. In this paper,\nby exploiting the close proximity among the users, we propose a novel two-phase\nwireless broadcasting protocol with user cooperations based on an efficient\nbatched network code, known as batched sparse (BATS) code. In the first phase,\nthe information packets are encoded into batches with BATS encoder and\nsequentially broadcasted by the source node until certain terminating criterion\nis met. In the second phase, the users cooperate with each other by exchanging\nthe network-coded information via peer-to-peer (P2P) communications based on\ntheir respective received packets. A fully distributed and light-weight\nscheduling algorithm is proposed to improve the efficiency of the P2P\ncommunication in the second phase. The performance of the proposed two-phase\nprotocol is analyzed and the channel rank distribution at the instance of\ndecoding is derived, based on which the optimal BATS code is designed.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol significantly\noutperforms the existing schemes.

Based on the finite element software ANSYS, the mechanical analysis\nof electromagnetic stress, the thermal stress in the cooling down and the\nstress in the pumping are showed in detail.

In their turn, collimated jets in the post-AGB phase could\ndetermine the shape of planetary nebulae (PNe) once photoionization starts. We\nintend to find new cases of post-AGB stars and PNe with water maser emission,\nincluding water fountains or water-maser-emitting PNe. We observed water maser\nemission in a sample of 133 objects, with a significant fraction being post-AGB\nand young PN candidate sources with strong obscuration. We detected this\nemission in 15 of them, of which seven are reported here for the first time. We\nidentified three water fountain candidates: IRAS 17291-2147, with a total\nvelocity spread of ~96 km/s in its water maser components and two sources (IRAS\n17021-3109 and IRAS 17348-2906) that show water maser emission outside the\nvelocity range covered by OH masers. We have also identified IRAS 17393-2727 as\na possible new water-maser-emitting PN. The detection rate is higher in\nobscured objects (14%) than in those with optical counterparts (7%), consistent\nwith previous results. Water maser emission seems to be common in objects that\nare bipolar in the near-IR (43% detection rate). The water maser spectra of\nwater fountain candidates like IRAS 17291-2147 show significantly less maser\ncomponents than others (e.g., IRAS 18113-2503). We speculate that most\npost-AGBs may show water maser emission with wide enough velocity spread (> 100\nkm/s) when observed with enough sensitivity and/or for long enough periods of\ntime. Therefore, it may be necessary to single out a special group of \"water\nfountains\", probably defined by their high maser luminosities. We also suggest\nthat the presence of both water and OH masers in a PN is a better tracer of its\nyouth, rather than the presence of just one of these species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 11:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 10:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Recent studies, however, show apparently contradictory results of\neither some significant extra lift or power savings, or zero ground effect.\nHere we present a numerical study of fruitfly sized insect takeoff with a\nspecific focus on the significance of leg thrust and wing kinematics.\nFlapping-wing takeoff is studied using numerical modelling and high performance\ncomputing. The aerodynamic forces are calculated using a three-dimensional\nNavier--Stokes solver based on a pseudo-spectral method with volume\npenalization. It is coupled with a flight dynamics solver that accounts for the\nbody weight, inertia and the leg thrust, while only having two degrees of\nfreedom: the vertical and the longitudinal horizontal displacement. The natural\nvoluntary takeoff of a fruitfly is considered as reference. The parameters of\nthe model are then varied to explore possible effects of interaction between\nthe flapping-wing model and the ground plane. These modified takeoffs include\ncases with decreased leg thrust parameter, and/or with periodic wing\nkinematics, constant body pitch angle. The results show that the ground effect\nduring natural voluntary takeoff is negligible. In the modified takeoffs, when\nthe rate of climb is slow, the difference in the aerodynamic forces due to the\ninteraction with the ground is up to 6%. Surprisingly, depending on the\nkinematics, the difference is either positive or negative, in contrast to the\nintuition based on the helicopter theory, which suggests positive excess lift.\nThis effect is attributed to unsteady wing-wake interactions. A similar effect\nis found during hovering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 11:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 05:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 03:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

In the case of slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) pulsators, the\nsimple zero-rotation approach so far used for mode identification is usually\nnot valid because pulsational frequencies are often of the order of the\nrotational frequency. Moreover, this approach allows us to determine only the\nspherical harmonic degree, $\\ell$, while the azimuthal order, $m$, is beyond\nits reach. On the other hand, because of the density of oscillation spectra of\nSPB stars, knowledge of $m$ is indispensable if one wants to assign the radial\norder, $n$, to the observed frequency peaks.

GPS\nis widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and human\nbeings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both measurement and\ninterpolation error. In this article we show that measurement error causes a\nsystematic bias in distances recorded with a GPS: the distance between two\npoints recorded with a GPS is -- on average -- bigger than the true distance\nbetween these points. This systematic `overestimation of distance' becomes\nrelevant if the influence of interpolation error can be neglected, which is the\ncase for movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical\nexplanation of this phenomenon and we illustrate that it functionally depends\non the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error ($C$). We argue that $C$ can be\ninterpreted as a quality measure for movement data recorded with a GPS. If\nthere is strong autocorrelation any two consecutive position estimates have\nvery similar error. This error cancels out when average speed, distance or\ndirection are calculated along the trajectory.\n  Based on our theoretical findings we introduce a novel approach to determine\n$C$ in real-world GPS movement data sampled at high frequencies.

We\ninvestigate the collisional evolution experienced by the precursors of current\ncomet nuclei during the early stages of the Solar System, in the context of the\nso-called \"Nice Model\". We consider two environments for the collisional\nevolution: (1) the trans-planetary planetesimal disk, from the time of gas\nremoval until the disk was dispersed by the migration of the ice giants, and\n(2) the dispersing disk during the time that the scattered disk was formed.\nSimulations have been performed, using different methods in the two cases, to\nfind the number of destructive collisions typically experienced by a comet\nnucleus of 2km radius. In the widely accepted scenario, where the dispersal of\nthe planetesimal disk occurred at the time of the Late Heavy Bombardment about\n4Gy ago, comet-sized planetesimals have a very small chance to survive against\ndestructive collisions in the disk. On the extreme assumption that the disk was\ndispersed directly upon gas removal, there is a chance for a significant\nfraction of the planetesimals to remain intact. However, these survivors would\nstill bear the marks of many non-destructive impacts. Thus, the Nice Model of\nSolar System evolution predicts that typical km-sized comet nuclei are\npredominantly fragments resulting from collisions experienced by larger parent\nbodies. An important goal for further research is to investigate, whether the\nobserved properties of comet nuclei are compatible with such a collisional\norigin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 14:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

In our Scheme\n1A, the relays and receivers use compress-forward strategy and send the\ncompression indices to the transmitter through the feedback pipes. After\nobtaining the compression indices through feedback, the transmitter sends them\ntogether with the source message. Each receiver uses backward decoding to\njointly decode the source message and all compression indices. Our Scheme 1B is\nsimilar, except that here each relay not only uses compress forward to compress\nits channel outputs, but also performs partial decode forward to decode a\ncommon part of source message. Our Scheme 1C allows different relays to decode\ndifferent parts of the source message (in Scheme 1A, no relay decodes any part\nof the source message; in Scheme 1B, all relays decode the same part of source\nmessage), which can achieve higher rates than Scheme 1A and Scheme 1B.\n  Motivated by the feedback coding scheme, we propose a new coding scheme for\nDM-MN without feedback, where the transmitter decodes the compression indices\ninstead of obtaining them directly through feedback.

Our\nresults show that this new, third, knob acts on an equal footing with\nstoichiometry and surface decoration as a modifier of the electronic band\nstructure, and that it is in continuous competition with the latter. The data\nclearly point towards surface photovoltage and photo-induced desorption as the\nphysical phenomena behind modifications of the electronic band structure under\nexposure to high-flux photons. We show that the interplay of these phenomena\ncan minimize and even eliminate the adsorbate-related surface band bending on\ntypical binary, ternary and quaternary Bi-based topological insulators.\nIncluding the influence of the sample temperature, these data set up a\nframework for the external control of the electronic band structure in\ntopological insulator compounds in an ARPES setting. Four external knobs are\navailable: bulk stoichiometry, surface decoration, temperature and photon\nexposure. These knobs can be used in conjunction to tune the band energies near\nthe surface and consequently influence the topological properties of the\nrelevant electronic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 14:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

We focus on the cloud population\nbetween the two main spiral arms in M51 (the inter-arm region) where cloud\ndestruction via shear and star formation feedback dominates over formation\nprocesses. By monitoring the change in GMC number densities and properties from\none side of the inter-arm to the other, we estimate the lifetime as a fraction\nof the inter-arm travel time. We find that GMC lifetimes in M51's inter-arm are\nfinite and short, 20 to 30 Myr. Such short lifetimes suggest that cloud\nevolution is influenced by environment, in which processes can disrupt GMCs\nafter a few free-fall times. Over most of the region under investigation shear\nappears to regulate the lifetime. As the shear timescale increases with\ngalactocentric radius, we expect cloud destruction to switch primarily to star\nformation feedback at larger radii. We identify a transition from shear- to\nfeedback-dominated disruption through a change in the behavior of the GMC\nnumber density. The signature suggests that shear is more efficient at\ncompletely dispersing clouds, whereas feedback transforms the population, e.g.\nby fragmenting high mass clouds into lower mass pieces. Compared to the\ncharacteristic timescale for molecular hydrogen in M51, our short lifetimes\nsuggest that gas can remain molecular while clouds disperse and reassemble. We\npropose that galaxy dynamics regulates the cycling of molecular material from\ndiffuse to bound (and ultimately star-forming) objects, contributing to long\nobserved molecular depletion times in normal disk galaxies. We also speculate\nthat, in more extreme environments such as elliptical galaxies and concentrated\ngalaxy centers, star formation can be suppressed when the shear timescale\nbecomes so short that some clouds can not survive to collapse and form stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 15:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The\nweaker emission than in Taurus may suggest that the average disk size in the\n$\\rho$ Oph region is smaller than in the Taurus cloud.

We aim to describe the pre-main sequence and main-sequence evolution of\nX-ray and extreme-ultaviolet radiation of a solar mass star based on its\nrotational evolution starting with a realistic range of initial rotation rates.\n  Methods. We derive evolutionary tracks of X-ray radiation based on a\nrotational evolution model for solar mass stars and the rotation-activity\nrelation. We compare these tracks to X-ray luminosity distributions of stars in\nclusters with different ages.\n  Results. We find agreement between the evolutionary tracks derived from\nrotation and the X-ray luminosity distributions from observations. Depending on\nthe initial rotation rate, a star might remain at the X-ray saturation level\nfor very different time periods, approximately from 10 Myr to 300 Myr for slow\nand fast rotators, respectively.\n  Conclusions. Rotational evolution with a spread of initial conditions leads\nto a particularly wide distribution of possible X-ray luminosities in the age\nrange of 20 to 500 Myrs, before rotational convergence and therefore X-ray\nluminosity convergence sets in. This age range is crucial for the evolution of\nyoung planetary atmospheres and may thus lead to very different planetary\nevolution histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 15:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}
