In the second approach\nrecently proposed a $k_T$-factorization method is used. We discuss how results\nof the collinear parton model depend on the initial condition for the QCD\nevolution and discuss an approximate treatment where photon is excluded from\nthe combined QCD-QED evolution. We demonstrate that it is not necessary to put\nphoton into the evolution equation as often done recently but it is sufficient\nto use a simplified approach in which photon couples to quarks and antiquarks\nwhich by themselves undergo DGLAP evolution equations. We discuss sensitivity\nof the results to the choice of structure function parametrization and\nexperimental cuts in the $k_T$-factorization approach. A new optimal structure\nfunction parametrization is proposed. We compare results of our calculations\nwith recent experimental data for dilepton production and find that in most\ncases the contribution of the photon-photon mechanism is rather small.

Under\ntruthful bidding, the SMRA is known to output a Walrasian equilibrium that\nmaximizes social welfare provided the bidder valuation functions satisfy the\ngross substitutes property. Recently, it was shown that the combinatorial clock\nauction (CCA) provides good welfare guarantees for general classes of valuation\nfunctions. This motivates the question of whether similar welfare guarantees\nhold for the SMRA in the case of general valuation functions.\n  We show the answer is no. But we prove that good welfare guarantees still\narise if the degree of complementarities in the bidder valuations are bounded.\nIn particular, if bidder valuations functions are $\\alpha$-near-submodular\nthen, under truthful bidding, the SMRA has a welfare ratio (the worst case\nratio between the social welfare of the optimal allocation and the auction\nallocation) of at most $(1+\\alpha)$. The special case of submodular valuations,\nnamely $\\alpha=1$, and produces individually rational solutions. However, for\n$\\alpha>1$, this is a bicriteria guarantee, to obtain good welfare under\ntruthful bidding requires relaxing individual rationality.\n  Finally, we examine what strategies are required to ensure individual\nrationality in the SMRA with general valuation functions. First, we provide a\nweak characterization, namely \\emph{secure bidding}, for individual\nrationality. We then show that if the bidders use a profit-maximizing secure\nbidding strategy the welfare ratio is at most $1+\\alpha$. Consequently, by\nbidding securely, it is possible to obtain the same welfare guarantees as\ntruthful bidding without the loss of individual rationality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 16:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

A frequency domain representation for\ngraph signals can be defined using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of\nvariation operators that take into account the underlying graph connectivity.\nSmoothly varying signals defined on the nodes are of particular interest in\nvarious applications, and tend to be approximately bandlimited in the frequency\nbasis. Sampling theory for graph signals deals with the problem of choosing the\nbest subset of nodes for reconstructing a bandlimited signal from its samples.\nMost approaches to this problem require a computation of the frequency basis\n(i.e., the eigenvectors of the variation operator), followed by a search\nprocedure using the basis elements. This can be impractical, in terms of\nstorage and time complexity, for real datasets involving very large graphs. We\ncircumvent this issue in our formulation by introducing quantities called graph\nspectral proxies, defined using the powers of the variation operator, in order\nto approximate the spectral content of graph signals. This allows us to\nformulate a direct sampling set selection approach that does not require the\ncomputation and storage of the basis elements.

The model is obtained via a severe\ntruncation of quasi-geostrophic equations for the two fluids, and includes a\nsimple yet physically meaningful representation of their\ndynamical/thermodynamical coupling. The model has 36 degrees of freedom, and\nthe parameters are chosen so that a chaotic behaviour is observed. One finds\ntwo positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs), sixteen negative LEs, and eighteen\nnear-zero LEs. The presence of many near-zero LEs results from the vast\ntime-scale separation between the characteristic time scales of the two fluids,\nand leads to nontrivial error growth properties in the tangent space spanned by\nthe corresponding CLVs, which are geometrically very degenerate. Such CLVs\ncorrespond to two different classes of ocean/atmosphere coupled modes. The\ntangent space spanned by the CLVs corresponding to the positive and negative\nLEs has, instead, a non-pathological behaviour, and one can construct robust\nlarge deviations laws for the finite time LEs, thus providing a universal model\nfor assessing predictability on long to ultra-long scales along such\ndirections. It is somewhat surprising to find that the tangent space of the\nunstable manifold has strong projection on both atmospheric and oceanic\ncomponents. Our results underline the difficulties in using hyperbolicity as a\nconceptual framework for multiscale chaotic dynamical systems, whereas the\nframework of partial hyperbolicity seems better suited, possibly indicating an\nalternative definition for the chaotic hypothesis.

We observed\nMWC 314 with a combination of optical spectroscopy, broad-band ground- and\nspace-based photometry, as well as with long baseline, near-infrared\ninterferometry. We have revised the single-lined spectroscopic orbit and\nexplored the photometric variability. The orbital light curve displays two\nminima each orbit that can be partially explained in terms of the tidal\ndistortion of the primary that occurs around the time of periastron. The\nemission lines in the system are often double-peaked and stationary in their\nkinematics, indicative of a circumbinary disc. We find that the stellar wind or\ncircumbinary disc is partially resolved in the K\\prime-band with the longest\nbaselines of the CHARA Array. From this analysis, we provide a simple,\nqualitative model in an attempt to explain the observations. From the\nassumption of Roche Lobe overflow and tidal synchronisation at periastron, we\nestimate the component masses to be M1 $\\approx 5$ M$_\\odot$ and M2$\\approx 15$\nM$_\\odot$, which indicates a mass of the LBV that is extremely low. In addition\nto the orbital modulation, we discovered two pulsational modes with the MOST\nsatellite. These modes are easily supported by a low-mass hydrogen-poor star,\nbut cannot be easily supported by a star with the parameters of an LBV. The\ncombination of these results provides evidence that the primary star was likely\nnever a normal LBV, but rather is the product of binary interactions. As such,\nthis system presents opportunities for studying mass-transfer and binary\nevolution with many observational techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 17:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

The\nMHDP enables a robot to form object categories using multimodal information,\ne.g., visual, auditory, and haptic information, which can be observed by\nperforming actions on an object. However, performing many actions on a target\nobject requires a long time. In a real-time scenario, i.e., when the time is\nlimited, the robot has to determine the set of actions that is most effective\nfor recognizing a target object. We propose an MHDP-based active perception\nmethod that uses the information gain (IG) maximization criterion and lazy\ngreedy algorithm. We show that the IG maximization criterion is optimal in the\nsense that the criterion is equivalent to a minimization of the expected\nKullback--Leibler divergence between a final recognition state and the\nrecognition state after the next set of actions. However, a straightforward\ncalculation of IG is practically impossible. Therefore, we derive an efficient\nMonte Carlo approximation method for IG by making use of a property of the\nMHDP. We also show that the IG has submodular and non-decreasing properties as\na set function because of the structure of the graphical model of the MHDP.\nTherefore, the IG maximization problem is reduced to a submodular maximization\nproblem. This means that greedy and lazy greedy algorithms are effective and\nhave a theoretical justification for their performance. We conducted an\nexperiment using an upper-torso humanoid robot and a second one using synthetic\ndata. The experimental results show that the method enables the robot to select\na set of actions that allow it to recognize target objects quickly and\naccurately.

The core of the\nmodel is provided by a short chain of magnetosomes serving as a sensor which is\ncoupled by elastic linkers to the gating elements of ion channels forming a\nsmall cluster in the cell membrane. The magnetic sensor is fixed by one end on\ncytoskeleton elements attached to the membrane and is exposed to viscoelastic\ncytosol. Its free end can reorient stochastically and subdiffusively in\nviscoelastic cytosol responding to external magnetic field changes and open the\ngates of coupled ion channels. The sensor dynamics is generally bistable due to\nbistability of the gates which can be in two states with probabilities which\ndepend on the sensor orientation. For realistic parameters, it is shown that\nthis model channel can operate in the magnetic field of Earth for a small\nnumber (5 to 7) of single-domain magnetosomes constituting the sensor rod each\nof which has a typical size found in magnetotactic bacteria and other\norganisms, or even just one sufficiently large nanoparticle of a characteristic\nsize also found in nature. It is shown that due to viscoelasticity of medium\nthe bistable gating dynamics generally exhibits power law and stretched\nexponential distributions of the residence times of the channels in their open\nand closed states. This provides a generic physical mechanism for explanation\nof the origin of such anomalous kinetics for other ionic channels whose sensors\nmove in viscoelastic environment provided by either cytosol or biological\nmembrane, in a quite general context, beyond the fascinating hypothesis of\nmagnetosensitive ionic channels we explore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 20:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light\ncurves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability\nmechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe. Therefore,\nalternative models such as the magnetar mechanism or wind-interaction may still\nto be favourable to interpret rapidly rising SLSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 22:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-05"}

Since the first experimental\ndemonstrations using photonic qubits and continuous variables, the distance of\nphotonic quantum teleportation over free space channels has continued to\nincrease and has reached >100 km. On the other hand, quantum teleportation over\noptical fiber has been challenging, mainly because the multi-fold photon\ndetection that inevitably accompanies quantum teleportation experiments has\nbeen very inefficient due to the relatively low detection efficiencies of\ntypical telecom-band single photon detectors. Here, we report efficient quantum\nteleportation over optical fiber using four high-detection efficiency\nsuperconducting nanowire superconducting single-photon detectors (SNSPD) based\non MoSi. These SNSPDs make it possible to perform highly-efficient multi-fold\nphoton measurements, allowing us to confirm that the quantum states of input\nphotons were successfully teleported over 100 km of fiber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 02:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-05"}

Finally, and using the\nconsistency with the electroweak precision analyses of oblique parameters, we\ndescribe several implications from different regimes of the inert model on\ncharged and pseudoscalar Higgs searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 05:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 18:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 16:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 19:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

The correlators\nexhibit structures in their voltage dependency which are highly non-linear when\nthe coupling between the dot and the reservoirs is weak, and their behavior\nwith temperature is non-monotonous. Moreover the sign of heat cross-correlator\ncan change contrary to what happens with the charge cross-correlator which is\nalways negative. The presence of Coulomb interactions enlarges the domain of\nvoltage in which the heat cross-correlator is negative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 07:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-05"}

We are interested in zeros of the partition function\nin the cases of complex temperature or complex external field (Fisher and\nLee-Yang zeros respectively). For the model on an annealed scale-free network,\nwe find an integral representation for the partition function which, in the\ncase $\\lambda > 5$, reproduces the zeros for the Ising model on a complete\ngraph. For $3<\\lambda < 5$ we derive the $\\lambda$-dependent angle at which the\nFisher zeros impact onto the real temperature axis. This, in turn, gives access\nto the $\\lambda$-dependent universal values of the critical exponents and\ncritical amplitudes ratios. Our analysis of the Lee-Yang zeros reveals a\ndifference in their behaviour for the Ising model on a complete graph and on an\nannealed scale-free network when $3<\\lambda <5$. Whereas in the former case the\nzeros are purely imaginary, they have a non zero real part in latter case, so\nthat the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem is violated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 09:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Inspired by the success of convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) for image classification, recent attempts have been made to\nlearn 3D CNNs for recognizing human actions in videos. However, partly due to\nthe high complexity of training 3D convolution kernels and the need for large\nquantities of training videos, only limited success has been reported. This has\ntriggered us to investigate in this paper a new deep architecture which can\nhandle 3D signals more effectively. Specifically, we propose factorized\nspatio-temporal convolutional networks (FstCN) that factorize the original 3D\nconvolution kernel learning as a sequential process of learning 2D spatial\nkernels in the lower layers (called spatial convolutional layers), followed by\nlearning 1D temporal kernels in the upper layers (called temporal convolutional\nlayers). We introduce a novel transformation and permutation operator to make\nfactorization in FstCN possible. Moreover, to address the issue of sequence\nalignment, we propose an effective training and inference strategy based on\nsampling multiple video clips from a given action video sequence. We have\ntested FstCN on two commonly used benchmark datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51).\nWithout using auxiliary training videos to boost the performance, FstCN\noutperforms existing CNN based methods and achieves comparable performance with\na recent method that benefits from using auxiliary training videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 11:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-05"}

A\ndetailed study of these rare sources provides new perspectives for\ninvestigating the AGN duty cycle, AGN-galaxy feedback, and accretion\nmechanisms. Large catalogues of radio sources provide statistical information\nabout the evolution of the radio-loud AGN population out to high redshifts.\nUsing wide-field imaging with the LOFAR telescope, we study both a well-known\nDDRG as well as a large number of radio sources in the field of view. We\npresent a high resolution image of the DDRG B1834+620 obtained at 144 MHz using\nLOFAR commissioning data. Our image covers about 100 square degrees and\ncontains over 1000 sources. The four components of the DDRG B1834+620 have been\nresolved for the first time at 144 MHz. Inner lobes were found to point towards\nthe direction of the outer lobes, unlike standard FR~II sources. Polarized\nemission was detected in the northern outer lobe. The high spatial resolution\nallows the identification of a large number of small double-lobed radio\nsources; roughly 10% of all sources in the field are doubles with a separation\nsmaller than 1 arcmin. The spectral fit of the four components is consistent\nwith a scenario in which the outer lobes are still active or the jets recently\nswitched off, while emission of the inner lobes is the result of a mix-up of\nnew and old jet activity. From the presence of the newly extended features in\nthe inner lobes of the DDRG, we can infer that the mechanism responsible for\ntheir formation is the bow shock that is driven by the newly launched jet. We\nfind that the density of the small doubles exceeds the density of FR-II sources\nwith similar properties at 1.4 GHz, but this difference becomes smaller for low\nflux densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 12:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

This mechanism is based on\nshadowing of pseudo-orbits generated by two dynamics: an `outer dynamics',\ngiven by homoclinic trajectories to a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold,\nand an `inner dynamics', given by the restriction to that manifold. On the\ninner dynamics the only assumption is that it preserves area. Unlike other\napproaches, [25] does not rely on the KAM theory and/or Aubry-Mather theory to\nestablish the existence of diffusion. Moreover, it does not require to check\ntwist conditions or non-degeneracy conditions near resonances. The conditions\nare explicit and can be checked by finite precision calculations in concrete\nsystems.\n  As an application, we study the planar elliptic restricted three-body\nproblem. We present a rigorous theorem that shows that if some concrete\ncalculations yield a non zero value, then for any sufficiently small, positive\nvalue of the eccentricity of the orbits of the main bodies, there are orbits of\nthe infinitesimal body that exhibit a change of energy that is bigger than some\nfixed number, which is independent of the eccentricity.\n  We verify numerically these calculations for values of the masses close to\nthat of the Jupiter/Sun system.

We predict proton\ndecay paths induced by graviatoms in the matter as an observational signature\nfor heavy dark matter searches at the IceCUBE experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 11:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Formal verification\nis used for exhaustive investigation of the system space thus ensuring that\nundetected failures in the behavior are excluded.

The challenge\nis to develop a safe multi-agent robotic system, more specifically to ensure\nthe correctness properties of safety and liveness. Formal specifications based\non model-checking are flexible, have a concrete syntax, and play vital role in\ncorrectness of a multi-agent robotic system. To formally verify safety and\nliveness of such systems is important because they have high concurrency and in\nmost of the cases have dynamic environment. We have considered a case-study of\na multi-agent robotic system for the transport of stock between storehouses to\nexemplify our formal approach.
