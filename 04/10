Subsequently, we discuss the establishment\nof the multi-layer flow networks of international trade from two coupled\nviewpoints, i.e., the viewpoint of commodity flow and that of money flow. Thus,\nthe multi-layer flow networks of international trade is explored. First,\ntrading \"trophic levels\" are adopted to depict positions that economies\noccupied in the flow network. We find that the distributions of trading\n\"trophic levels\" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of\ncommodity, and there are some regularities between money flow network and\ncommodity flow network.

Specifically, these random\norientations result in exceedingly large energy variations of the electron spin\nlevels that render the polarization and coherent control of the\nnitrogen-vacancy center electron spins as well as the control of their coherent\ninteraction with the surrounding 13C nuclear spins highly inefficient.

These different\ntypes of interactions are often represented as layers, attributes on the edges\nor as a time-dependence of the network structure. Although they are crucial for\na more comprehensive scientific understanding, these representations offer\nsubstantial challenges. Namely, it is an open problem how to precisely\ncharacterize the large or mesoscale structure of network systems in relation to\nthese additional aspects. Furthermore, the direct incorporation of these\nfeatures invariably increases the effective dimension of the network\ndescription, and hence aggravates the problem of overfitting, i.e. the use of\noverly-complex characterizations that mistake purely random fluctuations for\nactual structure. In this work, we propose a robust and principled method to\ntackle these problems, by constructing generative models of modular network\nstructure, incorporating layered, attributed and time-varying properties, as\nwell as a nonparametric Bayesian methodology to infer the parameters from data\nand select the most appropriate model according to statistical evidence.

The estimation of stress at\na continuum point on the atomistic scale requires a pre-defined kernel\nfunction. This kernel function derives the stress at a continuum point by\naveraging the contribution from atoms within a region surrounding the continuum\npoint. Commonly the kernel weight assignment is isotropic: an identical weight\nis assigned to atoms at the same spatial distance, which is tantamount to a\nlocal constant regression model. In this paper we employ a local linear\nregression model and leverage the mechanism of automatic kernel carpentry to\nallow for spatial averaging adaptive to the local distribution of atoms. As a\nresult, different weights may be assigned to atoms at the same spatial\ndistance. This is of interest for determining atomistic stress at stacking\nfaults, interfaces or surfaces. It is shown in this study that for crystalline\nsolids, although the local linear regression model performs elegantly, the\nadditional computational costs are not justified compared to the local constant\nregression model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 16:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-10"}

In this paper we present the results of the\nanalysis of HST COS far-UV spectroscopy plus ancillary multi-waveband data of a\nsample of 22 low-redshift galaxies that are good analogs to typical\nstar-forming galaxies at high-redshift. We measure three parameters that\nprovide indirect evidence of the escape of ionizing radiation: (1) the residual\nintensity in the cores of saturated interstellar low-ionization\nabsorption-lines. (2) The relative amount of blue-shifted Lyman alpha line\nemission, and (3) the relative weakness of the [SII] optical emission lines. We\nuse these diagnostics to rank-order our sample in terms of likely leakiness,\nnoting that a direct measure of escaping Lyman continuum has recently been made\nfor one of the leakiest members of our sample. We then examine the correlations\nbetween our ranking and other proposed diagnostics of leakiness and find a\ncorrelation with the equivalent width of the Lyman alpha emission-line. Turning\nto galaxy properties, we find the strongest correlations with leakiness are\nwith the compactness of the star-forming region and the speed of the galactic\noutflow. This suggests that extreme feedback- a high intensity of ionizing\nradiation and strong pressure from both radiation and a hot galactic wind-\ncombines to create significant holes in the neutral gas.

As off-shell cross\nsection measurements in this channel suffer from a small signal yield, large\nbackgrounds, and theoretical uncertainties, we propose an alternative\ncomplementary constraint which is only possible through the combination of LEP\nand LHC measurements. Previous precision electroweak measurements at LEP allow\nfor the determination of indirect constraints on Higgs couplings to vector\nbosons by considering one-loop processes involving virtual Higgs exchange. As\nthe Higgs is off-shell in these diagrams we venture that LEP can be interpreted\nas an off-shell `Higgs Factory'. By combining these LEP constraints with\ncurrent LHC 8 TeV Higgs measurements a stronger limit on the Higgs width can be\nachieved than with LHC data alone for models with rescaled Higgs couplings.\nLooking to the future, avoiding ambiguities arising due to new physics\nmodifications of the $hGG$ coupling, a theoretically more robust constraint can\nbe achieved by correlating LEP measurements with WBF Higgs production followed\nby Higgs decays to $WW$ and $ZZ$. This method for indirectly constraining the\nHiggs width is very effective for specific BSM scenarios and is highly\ncomplementary to other proposed methods. The limits we obtain particularly\nhighlight the power of a concrete LEP+LHC combination, not only limited to\nHiggs width measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 19:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Young tidal dwarf\ngalaxies (TDGs), born in the tidal tails produced by interacting gas-rich\ngalaxies, have been thought to not follow the MZ relation, because they inherit\nthe metallicity of the more massive parent galaxies. We present chemical\nevolution models to investigate if TDGs that formed at very high redshifts,\nwhere the metallicity of their parent galaxy was very low, can produce the\nobserved MZ relation. Assuming that galaxy interactions were more frequent in\nthe denser high-redshift universe, TDGs could constitute an important\ncontribution to the dwarf galaxy population. The survey of chemical evolution\nmodels of TDGs presented here captures for the first time an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) of stars that is dependent on both the star formation rate and\nthe gas metallicity via the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. As TDGs\nform in the tidal debris of interacting galaxies, the pre-enrichment of the\ngas, an underlying pre-existing stellar population, infall, and mass dependent\noutflows are considered. The models of young TDGs that are created in strongly\npre-enriched tidal arms with a pre-existing stellar population can explain the\nmeasured abundance ratios of observed TDGs. The same chemical evolution models\nfor TDGs, that form out of gas with initially very low metallicity, naturally\nbuild up the observed MZ relation. The modelled chemical composition of ancient\nTDGs is therefore consistent with the observed MZ relation of satellite\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 20:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Earlier GC pulsar searches have been largely insensitive to such\nan MSP population, accounting for the lack of pulsar detections. We estimate\nthe best search frequency for such an MSP population with present and upcoming\nbroad-band radio telescopes for two possible scattering scenarios, the\n\"weak-scattering\" case suggested by the recent detection of a magnetar close to\nthe GC, and the \"strong-scattering\" case, with the scattering screen located\nclose to the GC.

The ability of chains of coupled\nunits to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions can lead to a\nself-organised escape. The mechanism at work is that the energies of the units\nbecome re-arranged, while keeping the total energy conserved, in forming\nlocalised energy modes that in turn trigger the cooperative escape. We present\nscenarios of significantly enhanced noise-free escape rates if compared to the\nnoise-assisted case.\n  The second part deals with the collective directed transport of systems of\ninteracting particles overcoming energetic barriers in periodic potential\nlandscapes.

This approximate,\nequation-of-state universality arises after one adimensionalizes the multipole\nmoments appropriately, which then begs the question of whether there are better\nways to adimensionalize the moments to obtain stronger universality. We here\ninvestigate this question in detail by considering slowly-rotating neutron\nstars both in the non-relativistic limit and in full General Relativity. We\nfind that there exist normalizations that lead to stronger equation-of-state\nuniversality in the relations among the moment of inertia and the quadrupole,\noctopole and hexadecapole moments of neutron stars. We determine the optimal\nnormalization that minimizes the equation-of-state dependence in these\nrelations.

We calculate all relevant nonlinear corrections\nat one-loop order, including effects from nonlinear density evolution, galaxy\nbiasing, and source density weighting. Contributions from density weighting are\nfound to be particularly important and lead to bias dependence of the IA\namplitude, even on large scales. This effect may be responsible for much of the\nluminosity dependence in IA observations. The increase in IA amplitude for more\nhighly biased galaxies reflects their locations in regions with large tidal\nfields. We also consider the impact of smoothing the tidal field on halo\nscales. We compare the performance of this consistent nonlinear model in\ndescribing the observed alignment of luminous red galaxies with the linear\nmodel as well as the frequently used \"nonlinear alignment model,\" finding a\nsignificant improvement on small and intermediate scales. We also show that the\ncross-correlation between density and IA (the \"GI\" term) can be effectively\nseparated into source alignment and source clustering, and we accurately model\nthe observed alignment down to the one-halo regime using the tidal field from\nthe fully nonlinear halo-matter cross correlation.

The hallmark of entanglement is\nthe detection of strong correlations between systems, for example by the\nviolation of Bell's inequality. Using the CHSH variant of the Bell test, this\nviolation has been observed with photons, atoms, solid state spins, and\nartificial atoms in superconducting circuits. For larger, more distinguishable\nstates, the conflict between quantum predictions and our classical expectations\nis typically resolved due to the rapid onset of decoherence. To investigate\nthis reconciliation, one can employ a superposition of coherent states in an\noscillator, known as a cat state. In contrast to discrete systems, one can\ncontinuously vary the size of the prepared cat state and therefore its\ndependence on decoherence. Here we demonstrate and quantify entanglement\nbetween an artificial atom and a cat state in a cavity, which we call a\n`Bell-cat' state. We use a circuit QED architecture, high-fidelity\nmeasurements, and real-time feedback control to violate Bell's inequality\nwithout post-selection or corrections for measurement inefficiencies.\nFurthermore, we investigate the influence of decoherence by continuously\nvarying the size of created Bell-cat states and characterize the entangled\nsystem by joint Wigner tomography. These techniques provide a toolset for\nquantum information processing with entangled qubits and resonators. While\nrecent results have demonstrated a high level of control of such systems, this\nexperiment demonstrates that information can be extracted efficiently and with\nhigh fidelity, a crucial requirement for quantum computing with resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 22:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-13"}

Over multiple trials, this method allows\ndistinguishing OAM eigenstates from superpositions of multiple such\neigenstates. Variations of the same method are then shown to be capable of\npreparing and detecting arbitrary linear combinations of states in Hilbert\nspace. One further variation allows the construction of chains of states\nobeying recurrence relations on the Hilbert space itself, opening a new range\nof possibilities for more abstract information-coding algorithms to be carried\nout experimentally in a simple manner.

A number\nof clustering problems arise in machine learning where the optimal clusters do\nnot follow such a locality property. Consider a variant of the $k$-means\nproblem that may be regarded as a general version of such problems.

In particular, the special structures of turn-off and red clump\nparts cannot be generated by stellar rotation, but age spread perfectly\nreproduces the observed features.

In this paper, we\npropose a sampling method that provably and accurately estimates the similarity\nbetween vertices. The algorithm is based on a novel idea of random path, and an\nextended method is also presented, to enhance the structural similarity when\ntwo vertices are completely disconnected. We provide theoretical proofs for the\nerror-bound and confidence of the proposed algorithm. We perform extensive\nempirical study and show that our algorithm can obtain top-k similar vertices\nfor any vertex in a network approximately 300x faster than state-of-the-art\nmethods. We also use identity resolution and structural hole spanner finding,\ntwo important applications in social networks, to evaluate the accuracy of the\nestimated similarities. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves clearly better performance than several alternative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 08:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 12:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

However, the tight\ncoupling of centralized control and complete visibility leads to a wide range\nof issues among which scalability has risen to prominence. To address this, we\npresent LazyCtrl, a novel hybrid control plane design for data center networks\nwhere network control is carried out by distributed control mechanisms inside\nindependent groups of switches while complemented with a global controller. Our\ndesign is motivated by the observation that data center traffic is usually\nhighly skewed and thus edge switches can be grouped according to traffic\nlocality. LazyCtrl aims at bringing laziness to the global controller by\ndynamically devolving most of the control tasks to independent switch groups to\nprocess frequent intra-group events near datapaths while handling rare\ninter-group or other specified events by the controller. We implement LazyCtrl\nand build a prototype based on Open vSwich and Floodlight. Trace-driven\nexperiments on our prototype show that an effective switch grouping is easy to\nmaintain in multi-tenant clouds and the central controller can be significantly\nshielded by staying lazy, with its workload reduced by up to 82%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 09:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-13"}

We have demonstrated\nthat the demagnetizing field provide graded increase of the refractive index\nfor spin waves, which is responsible for the bending.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 13:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 18:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

The difference between product of marginal Probability Density\nFunctions (PDFs) and joint PDF of a random vector is defined as Function\nDifference (FD) of a random vector. Assuming the PDFs are $k^{th}$ order\ndifferentiable, the results on generalized functions are applied to the\nindependence condition.

The growth of so-called frazil ice by\nsolidification of a supercooled aqueous salt solution is consistent with\ncrystal growth in the basal plane being limited by the diffusive removal of the\nlatent heat of solidification from the solid--liquid interface, while being\nlimited by attachment kinetics in the perpendicular direction. This leads to\nthe formation of approximately disk-shaped crystals with a low aspect ratio of\nthickness compared to radius, because radial growth is much faster than axial\ngrowth. We calculate numerically how fast disk-shaped crystals grow in both\npure and binary melts, accounting for the comparatively slow axial growth, the\neffect of dissolved solute in the fluid phase and the difference in thermal\nproperties between solid and fluid phases. We identify the main physical\nmechanisms that control crystal growth and show that the diffusive removal of\nboth the latent heat released and also the salt rejected at the growing\ninterface are significant.

On the other\nhand, no plausible physical reason has been proposed so far to explain the\nradiation source origin, and its effects on the linen fibres. However, some\nrecent studies, carried out by the first author and his Team at the Laboratory\nof Fracture Mechanics of the Politecnico di Torino, found that it is possible\nto generate neutron emissions from very brittle rock specimens in compression\nthrough piezonuclear fission reactions. Analogously, neutron flux increments,\nin correspondence to seismic activity, should be a result of the same\nreactions. A group of Russian scientists measured a neutron flux exceeding the\nbackground level by three orders of magnitude in correspondence to rather\nappreciable earthquakes (4th degree in Richter Scale). The authors consider the\npossibility that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image\nformation on Shroud linen fibres, trough thermal neutron capture by Nitrogen\nnuclei, and provided a wrong radiocarbon dating due to an increment in\nC(14,6)content.

(2010) define a general framework for analyzing capture-recapture\ndata with potential misidentifications. In this framework, the observed vector\nof counts, $y$, is considered as a linear function of a vector of latent\ncounts, $x$, such that $y = A x$, with $x$ assumed to follow a multinomial\ndistribution conditional on the model parameters, $\\theta$. Bayesian methods\nare then applied by sampling from the joint posterior distribution of both $x$\nand $\\theta$. In particular, Link et al. (2010) propose a Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm to sample from the full conditional distribution of $x$, where new\nproposals are generated by sequentially adding elements from a basis of the\nnull space (kernel) of $A$. We consider this algorithm and show that using\nelements from a simple basis for the kernel of $A$ may not produce an\nirreducible Markov chain. Instead, we require a Markov basis, as defined by\nDiaconis and Sturmfels (1998). We illustrate the importance of Markov bases\nwith three capture-recapture examples.
