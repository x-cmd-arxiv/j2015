Moreover, we show, through pump probe\nmeasurements, repeatable and reversible, large amplitude modulations in the\nresonances, especially at telecommunication wavelengths, over ps time scales\nand at powers far below those needed to produce a permanent phase transition.\nOur findings open a pathway to the design of hybrid metal PCM nanostructures\nwith ultrafast and widely tuneable resonance responses, which hold potential\nimpact on active nanophotonic devices such as tuneable optical filters, smart\nwindows, biosensors and reconfigurable memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 16:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 15:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 15:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

In\nthe latter case, biosensor sensitivity hinges on ligand proteins adsorbing on\nbioactive surfaces with a favorable orientation, exposing reaction sites to\ntarget molecules. Protein adsorption, being a free-energy-driven process, is\ndifficult to study experimentally. This paper develops and evaluates a\ncomputational model to study electrostatic interactions of proteins and charged\nnanosurfaces, via the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.

Since both curves are generically\nregular, the response to small perturbations is linearly small. However, a\ncrucial ingredient is absent of the theory, namely transactions themselves.\nWhat happens after they occur? To answer the question, we develop a dynamic\ntheory for supply and demand based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs. When\nthe inter-auction time is infinitely long, the Walrasian mechanism is\nrecovered. When transactions are allowed to happen in continuous time, a\npeculiar property emerges: close to the price, supply and demand vanish\nquadratically, which we empirically confirm on the Bitcoin. This explains why\nprice impact in financial markets is universally observed to behave as the\nsquare root of the excess volume. The consequences are important, as they imply\nthat the very fact of clearing the market makes prices hypersensitive to small\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 17:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

First, we propose spectral pooling, which performs dimensionality\nreduction by truncating the representation in the frequency domain. This\napproach preserves considerably more information per parameter than other\npooling strategies and enables flexibility in the choice of pooling output\ndimensionality.

Two\nproperties that particularly interest us are mechanical loss and breaking\nstrength. A decrease in mechanical loss would directly reduce the thermal noise\nassociated with the suspension, thus enhancing the noise performance of mirror\nsuspensions within the detector. An increase in strength could allow thinner\nwire to be safely used, which would enhance the dilution factor of the\nsuspension, again leading to lower suspension thermal noise. In this article we\ndescribe the results of an investigation into some of the mechanical properties\nof music wire, comparing untreated wire with the same wire which has been\ncryogenically treated. For the samples we studied we conclude that there is no\nsignificant difference in the properties of interest for application in\ngravitational wave detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 19:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

The field of cognitive science\nargues that the abstract concepts of mathematics are not Platonic, but are\nbuilt in the brain from these primordial perceptions, using what are known as\nconceptual metaphors. Known cognitive mechanisms give rise to the extremely\nprecise and logical language of mathematics. Thus all of the vastness of\nmathematics, with its beautiful theorems, is human mathematics. It resides in\nthe mind, and is not `out there'. Physics is an experimental science in which\nresults of experiments are described in terms of concrete concepts - these\nconcepts are also built from our primordial perceptions. The goal of\ntheoretical physics is to describe the experimentally observed regularity of\nthe physical world in an unambiguous, precise and logical manner. To do so, the\nbrain resorts to the well-defined abstract concepts which the mind has\nmetaphored from our primordial perceptions. Since both the concrete and the\nabstract are derived from the primordial, the connection between physics and\nmathematics is not mysterious, but natural. This connection is established in\nthe human brain, where a small subset of the vast human mathematics is\ncognitively fitted to describe the regularity of the universe. Theoretical\nphysics should be thought of as a branch of mathematics, whose axioms are\nmotivated by observations of the physical world. We use the example of quantum\ntheory to demonstrate the all too human nature of the physics-mathematics\nconnection: it is at times frail, and imperfect. Our resistance to take this\nimperfection sufficiently seriously [since no known experiment violates quantum\ntheory] shows the fundamental importance of experiments in physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 19:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

(1998) proposed Deuterium (DD) fusion at the core-mantle\ninterface of giant planets as a mechanism to explain their observed heat\nexcess. But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D\nlayer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine\nDD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated\ncore containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme\ntemperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As\nan application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times\n10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated\nsize of some giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\") may be linked to screened DD\nfusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution\nmodel suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important\nif there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective\nextra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD\nfusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with\nthe trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\rm\neq}$, and also depends on planetary mass. Although we do not consider the\neffect of incident stellar flux, we expect that a minimum level of irradiation\nis necessary to trigger core erosion and subsequent DD fusion inside the\nplanet.

However, most of\nthe existing works neither explicitly handle face images with arbitrary poses,\nnor perform large-scale experiments on non-frontal and profile face images. In\norder to address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel face alignment\nalgorithm that estimates both 2D and 3D landmarks and their 2D visibilities for\na face image with an arbitrary pose. By integrating a 3D deformable model, a\ncascaded coupled-regressor approach is designed to estimate both the camera\nprojection matrix and the 3D landmarks. Furthermore, the 3D model also allows\nus to automatically estimate the 2D landmark visibilities via surface normals.\nWe gather a substantially larger collection of all-pose face images to evaluate\nour algorithm and demonstrate superior performances than the state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 19:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Real-Time Bidding\n(RTB) mimics stock spot exchanges and utilises computers to algorithmically buy\ndisplay ads per impression via a real-time auction. Despite the new automation,\nthe ad markets are still informationally inefficient due to the heavily\nfragmented marketplaces. Two display impressions with similar or identical\neffectiveness (e.g., measured by conversion or click-through rates for a\ntargeted audience) may sell for quite different prices at different market\nsegments or pricing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel data mining\nparadigm called Statistical Arbitrage Mining (SAM) focusing on mining and\nexploiting price discrepancies between two pricing schemes. In essence, our\nSAMer is a meta-bidder that hedges advertisers' risk between CPA (cost per\naction)-based campaigns and CPM (cost per mille impressions)-based ad\ninventories; it statistically assesses the potential profit and cost for an\nincoming CPM bid request against a portfolio of CPA campaigns based on the\nestimated conversion rate, bid landscape and other statistics learned from\nhistorical data. In SAM, (i) functional optimisation is utilised to seek for\noptimal bidding to maximise the expected arbitrage net profit, and (ii) a\nportfolio-based risk management solution is leveraged to reallocate bid volume\nand budget across the set of campaigns to make a risk and return trade-off. We\npropose to jointly optimise both components in an EM fashion with high\nefficiency to help the meta-bidder successfully catch the transient statistical\narbitrage opportunities in RTB. Both the offline experiments on a real-world\nlarge-scale dataset and online A/B tests on a commercial platform demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed solution in exploiting arbitrage in various\nmodel settings and market environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 21:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

During the accretion outburst these reactions heat the\ncrust out of thermal equilibrium with the core. When accretion halts, the crust\ncools to its long-term equilibrium temperature on observable timescales. Here\nwe examine the accreting neutron star transient MAXI J0556-332, which is the\nhottest transient, at the start of quiescence, observed to date. Models of the\nquiescent light curve require a large deposition of heat in the shallow outer\ncrust from an unknown source. The additional heat injected is $\\approx\n4\\textrm{-}10\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ per accreted nucleon; when the observed decline in\naccretion rate at the end of the outburst is accounted for, the required\nheating increases to $\\approx 6\\textrm{-}16\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. This shallow\nheating is still required to fit the lightcurve even after taking into account\na second accretion episode, uncertainties in distance, and different surface\ngravities. The amount of shallow heating is larger than that inferred for other\nneutron star transients and is larger than can be supplied by nuclear reactions\nor compositionally driven convection; but it is consistent with stored\nmechanical energy in the accretion disk. The high crust temperature ($T_b\n\\gtrsim 10^{9} \\, {\\rm K}$) makes its cooling behavior in quiescence largely\nindependent of the crust composition and envelope properties, so that future\nobservations will probe the gravity of the source. Fits to the lightcurve\ndisfavor the presence of Urca cooling pairs in the crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 21:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

A\n$d$-dimensional zero-one matrix $A$ avoids another $d$-dimensional zero-one\nmatrix $P$ if no submatrix of $A$ can be transformed to $P$ by changing some\nones to zeros. A fundamental problem is to study the maximum number of nonzero\nentries in a $d$-dimensional $n \\times \\cdots \\times n$ matrix that avoids $P$.\nThis maximum number, denoted by $f(n,P,d)$, is called the extremal function.\n  We advance the extremal theory of matrices in two directions.

Firstly, we\nobtain non-trivial lower and upper bounds on $f(n,P,d)$ when $n$ is large for\nevery $d$-dimensional block permutation matrix $P$.

For a NS, the centre of mass lies inside\nthe WR envelope whose motion is then far below the observed 370 km/s RV\namplitude, while the velocity of the compact object is as high as 600 km/s. The\nresulting 0.4\\% doppler variation of X-ray spectral lines could be confirmed by\nmissions in development. These arguments also apply to other putative BH\nbinaries whose RV and eclipse curves are not yet phase-connected.

When there is a monopoly in the creation of currency as we\nhave in today's markets, you no longer have a true free market.

This paper examines how currency monopoly leads\nto the instabilities and imbalances that we see in today's economy.

By examining the voluntary exchange of goods and services at the\nscale of an entire society, it is shown that a new currency system, which\nresolves a lot of the problems caused by the current fiat currency system,\nemerges naturally from the free market. The new currency system is robust and\nefficient, and provides a way for public goods and services to be provided, and\nits providers compensated, without the need for direct taxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 07:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The first step of using such\nanalyses is localizing some important landmarks known as cephalometric\nlandmarks on craniofacial in x-ray image. The past decade has seen a growing\ninterest in automating this process. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is\nproposed for automatic detection of cephalometric landmarks. Here, the\nlandmarks are categorized into three main sets according to their anatomical\ncharacteristics and usage in well-known cephalometric analyses. Consequently,\nto have a reliable and accurate detection system, three methods named edge\ntracing, weighted template matching, and analysis based estimation are\ndesigned, each of which is consistent and well-suited for one category. Edge\ntracing method is suggested to predict those landmarks which are located on\nedges. Weighted template matching method is well-suited for landmarks located\nin an obvious and specific structure which can be extracted or searchable in a\ngiven x-ray image. The last but not the least method is named analysis based\nestimation. This method is based on the fact that in cephalometric analyses the\nrelations between landmarks are used and the locations of some landmarks are\nnever used individually. Therefore the third suggested method has a novelty in\nestimating the desired relations directly. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach is compared with the state of the art methods and the results were\npromising especially in real world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 08:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Not unexpectedly,\nresults obtained in the past about the friction force obtained via different\nroutes are sometimes, at least apparently, wildly different from each other.\n  Recently, we considered the Casimir friction force for two dielectric\nsemi-infinite plates moving parallel to each other [J. S. H{\\o}ye and I.\nBrevik, Eur. Phys. J. D {\\bf 68}, 61 (2014)], and managed to get essential\nagreement with results obtained by Pendry (1997), Volokitin and Persson (2007),\nand Barton (2011). Our method was based upon use of the Kubo formalism. In the\npresent paper we focus on the interaction between a polarizable particle and a\ndielectric half-space again, and calculate the friction force using the same\nbasic method as before. The new ingredient in the present analysis is that we\ntake into account radiative damping, and derive the modifications thereof. Some\ncomparisons are also made with works from others. Essential agreement with the\nresults of Intravaia, Behunin, and Dalvit can also be achieved using the\nmodification of the atomic polarizability by the metallic plate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 09:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 14:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Exploiting the virial\ntheorem, we derive expressions for the pressure of ABPs confined by solid walls\nor exposed to periodic boundary conditions. In both cases, the pressure\ncomprises three contributions: the ideal-gas pressure due to white-noise random\nforces, an activity-induce pressure (swim pressure), which can be expressed in\nterms of a product of the bare and a mean effective propulsion velocity, and\nthe contribution by interparticle forces.

Specifically, we consider questions of the existance of\ncompliant binary labelings on the vertices of iterated standard chromatic\nsubdivisions of an n-simplex. The existance of such labelings is equivalent to\nthe existance of distributed protocols solving Weak Symmetry Breaking task in\nthe standard computational model.\n  As a part of our formal model, we introduce function sb(n), defined for\nnatural numbers n, called the symmetry breaking function. From the geometric\npoint of view sb(n) denotes the minimal number of iterations of the standard\nchromatic subdivision of an (n-1)-simplex, which is needed for the compliant\nbinary labeling to exist. From the point of distributed computing, the function\nsb(n) measures the minimal number of rounds in a protocol solving the Weak\nSymmetry Breaking task.\n  In addition to the development of combinatorial topology, which is applicable\nin a broader context, our main contribution is the proof of new bounds for the\nfunction sb(n). Accordingly, the bulk of the paper is taken up by in-depth\nanalysis of the structure of adjacency graph on the set of n-simplices in\niterated standard chromatic subdivision of an n-simplex. On the algorithmic\nside, we provide the first distributed protocol solving Weak Symmetry Breaking\ntask in the layered immediate snapshot computational model for some number of\nprocesses.\n  It is well known, that the smallest number of processes for which Weak\nSymmetry Breaking task is solvable is 6.

Together these two theorems prove very powerful in\ndetermining the CGT values of large positions as the sum of the values of\nsmaller fragments, but also to compose larger positions with specified values\nfrom smaller fragments.

However, we prove that such single-component ups\nand downs easily can be constructed. Further, we find Domineering positions\nwith 11 different tinies and minies values. For each we give an example. Next,\nfor nimbers we find many Domineering positions with values up to *3. This is\nsurprising, since Drummond-Cole [10] suspected that no *2 and *3 positions in\nstandard Domineering would exist.

In photonic Bell experiments, a large amount of\nthe data that is generated comes from no-detection events and presumably\ncontains little randomness. This raises the question as to whether randomness\ncan be extracted only from the smaller post-selected subset corresponding to\nproper detection events, instead of from the entire set of data. This could in\nprinciple be feasible without opening an analogue of the detection loophole as\nlong as the min-entropy of the post-selected data is evaluated by taking all\nthe information into account, including no-detection events. The possibility of\nextracting randomness from a short string has a practical advantage, because it\nreduces the computational time of the extraction.\n  Here, we investigate the above idea in a simple scenario, where the devices\nand the adversary behave according to i.i.d. strategies.

The corresponding annihilation signal (in the\nform of gamma-rays, positrons and antiprotons) may be boosted for one or three\norders of magnitude due to the clustering of cold DM particles into the\nsmall-scale and very dense self-gravitating clumps. We discuss the formation of\nthese clumps from the initial density perturbations and their successive fate\nin the Galactic halo. Only a small fraction of these clumps, $\\sim0.1$%, in\neach logarithmic mass interval $\\Delta\\log M\\sim1$ survives the stage of\nhierarchical clustering. We calculate the probability of surviving the remnants\nof dark matter clumps in the Galaxy by modelling the tidal destruction of the\nsmall-scale clumps by the Galactic disk and stars. It is demonstrated that a\nsubstantial fraction of clump remnants may survive through the tidal\ndestruction during the lifetime of the Galaxy. The resulting mass spectrum of\nsurvived clumps is extended down to the mass of the core of the cosmologically\nproduced clumps with a minimal mass. The survived dense remnants of tidally\ndestructed clumps provide an amplification (boosting) of the annihilation\nsignal with respect to the diffuse DM in the Galactic halo.

Here we study how people resolve this moral conflict. What does telling\na white lie signal about a person's pro-social tendencies? To answer this\nquestion, we conducted a two-stage 2x2 experiment. In the first stage, we used\na Deception Game to measure aversion to telling a Pareto white lie (i.e., a lie\nthat helps both the liar and the listener), and aversion to telling an\naltruistic white lie (i.e., a lie that helps the listener at the expense of the\nliar). In the second stage we measured altruistic tendencies using a Dictator\nGame and cooperative tendencies using a Prisoner's dilemma. We found three\nmajor results: (i) both altruism and cooperation are positively correlated with\naversion to telling a Pareto white lie; (ii) both altruism and cooperation are\nnegatively correlated with aversion to telling an altruistic white lie; (iii)\nmen are more likely than women to tell an altruistic white lie, but not to tell\na Pareto white lie. Our results shed light on the moral conflit between\npro-sociality and truth-telling. In particular, the first finding suggests that\na significant proportion of people have non-distributional notions of what the\nright thing to do is: irrespective of their economic consequences, they tell\nthe truth, they cooperate, they share their money.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 10:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 17:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

While this result has been\nknown for over 30 years, it has largely been forgotten. We shall focus on the\nearly-stage low-temperature regime, and shall confront numerical estimates with\nsemi-analytic approximations based on a naive Planck spectrum. First we shall\nidentify several natural dimensionless figures of merit, and thereby compare\nthe mean time between emission of successive Hawking quanta to several distinct\nbut quite natural timescales that can be associated with the emitted quanta,\ndemonstrating that very large ratios are typical for emission of massless\nquanta from a Schwarzschild black hole. Furthermore these ratios are\nindependent of the mass of the black hole as it slowly evolves. We shall then\nshow that the situation for the more general Reissner-Nordstrom and generic\n\"dirty'' black holes is even worse, at least as long as the surrounding matter\nsatisfies some suitable energy conditions. The situation for the Kerr and\nKerr--Newman black holes (or even for charged particle emission from a\nReissner--Nordstrom black hole) is considerably trickier, and depends on a\ncareful accounting of the super-radiant modes. Overall, the Hawking quanta are\nseen to be dribbling out of the black hole one at a time, in an extremely slow\ncascade of 2-body decays. Among other things, this implies that the Hawking\nflux is subject to \"shot noise''. Observationally, the Planck spectrum of the\nHawking flux can only be determined by collecting and integrating data over a\nvery long timescale. We conclude by connecting these points back to various\nkinematic aspects of the Hawking evaporation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 10:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 04:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

They\nare stable at low powers, but become unstable at powers well below the critical\npower for collapse Pcr. This is in contrast with the ground-state\n(single-pearl) solitary waves on bounded domains, which are stable at any power\nbelow Pcr. On annular domains, the ground state solitary waves are radial at\nlow powers, but undergo a symmetry breaking at a threshold power well below\nPcr. As in the case of convex bounded domains, necklace solitary waves on the\nannulus are stable at low powers and become unstable at powers well below Pcr.\nUnlike on convex bounded domains, however, necklace solitarywaves on the\nannulus have a second stability regime at powers well above Pcr.

Here we present a sample of new\nresults from the CORIMP CME catalog, and directly compare them with the other\nautomated catalogs of Computer Aided CME Tracking (CACTus) and Solar Eruptive\nEvents Detection System (SEEDS), as well as the manual CME catalog at the\nCoordinated Data Analysis Workshop (CDAW) Data Center and a previously\npublished study of the sample events. We further investigate a form of\nunsupervised machine learning by using a k-means clustering algorithm to\ndistinguish detections of multiple CMEs that occur close together in space and\ntime. While challenges still exist, this investigation and comparison of\nresults demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the CORIMP catalog,\nproving its effectiveness at detecting and tracking CMEs throughout the LASCO\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 15:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

The basic idea is to apply the method of\nnumerical continuation to a feedback-controlled physical experiment. Since in\nan experiment it is not (generally) possible to set the state of the system\ndirectly, the control target is used as a proxy for the state. The challenge\nthen becomes to determine a control target such that the control is\nnon-invasive, that is, it stabilises a steady-state (or periodic orbit) of the\noriginal open-loop experiment without altering it otherwise.\n  Once implemented, control-based continuation enables the systematic\ninvestigation of the bifurcation structure of a physical system, much like if\nit was numerical model. However, stability information (and hence bifurcation\ndetection and classification) is not readily available due to the presence of\nstabilising feedback control. This paper uses methods from the system\nidentification community to extract stability information in the form of\nFloquet multipliers from the closed-loop experiment, thus enabling the direct\ndetection of bifurcations. In particular, it is shown that a periodic\nauto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) can be constructed that\napproximates the time-varying linearisation of the experiment around a\nparticular periodic orbit. This method is demonstrated using a physical\nnonlinear tuned mass damper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 15:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 12:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 10:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 13:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}
