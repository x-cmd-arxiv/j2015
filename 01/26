Notice that, unlike in the spheres, in the Euclidean spaces and the\nLobachevsky spaces of dimensions 4 and higher, still no example of an embedded\nflexible polyhedron is known. Second, we show that the volumes of the\nconstructed flexible cross-polytopes are non-constant during the flexion. Hence\nthese cross-polytopes give counterexamples to the Bellows Conjecture for\nspherical polyhedra.

A subjective visual property is useful\neither on its own (e.g. image and video interestingness) or as an intermediate\nrepresentation for visual recognition (e.g. a relative attribute). Due to its\nambiguous nature, annotating the value of a subjective visual property for\nlearning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation more\nreliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise\ncomparison labels because human annotators are much better at ranking two\nimages/videos (e.g. which one is more interesting) than giving an absolute\nvalue to each of them separately. However, using crowdsourced data also\nintroduces outliers. Existing methods rely on majority voting to prune the\nannotation outliers/errors. They thus require large amount of pairwise labels\nto be collected. More importantly as a local outlier detection method, majority\nvoting is ineffective in identifying outliers that can cause global ranking\ninconsistencies. In this paper, we propose a more principled way to identify\nannotation outliers by formulating the subjective visual property prediction\ntask as a unified robust learning to rank problem, tackling both the outlier\ndetection and learning to rank jointly. Differing from existing methods, the\nproposed method integrates local pairwise comparison labels together to\nminimise a cost that corresponds to global inconsistency of ranking order. This\nnot only leads to better detection of annotation outliers but also enables\nlearning with extremely sparse annotations. Extensive experiments on various\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our new approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2015 20:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 05:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 18:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 14:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

However, currently the asteroids have orbits with all\npossible values of eccentricities and inclinations compatible with long-term\ndynamical stability, whereas the initial planetesimal orbits should have been\nquasi-circular and almost co-planar. The total mass in the asteroid population\nis a small fraction of that existing primordially. Also, asteroids with\ndifferent chemical/mineralogical properties are not ranked in an orderly manner\nwith mean heliocentric distance as one could expect from the existence of a\nradial gradient of the temperature in the proto-planetary disk, but they are\npartially mixed. These properties show that the asteroid belt has been severely\nsculpted by one or a series of processes during its lifetime. This paper\nreviews the processes that have been proposed so far, discussing the properties\nthat they explain and the problems that they are confronted with. Emphasis is\npaid to the interplay between the dynamical and the collisional evolution of\nthe asteroid population, which allows the use of the size distribution to\nconstrain the dynamical models. We divide the asteroid belt evolution into\nthree phases. The first phase started during the lifetime of the gaseous\nproto-planetary disk, when the giant planets formed and presumably experienced\nlarge-scale migrations, and continued after the removal of the gas, during the\nbuild-up of the terrestrial planets. The second phase occurred after the\nremoval of the gaseous proto-planetary disk and it became particularly lively\nfor the asteroid belt when the giant planets suddenly changed their orbits, as\na result of a mutual dynamical instability and the interaction with the\ntrans-Neptunian planetesimal disk. The third phase covers the aftermath of the\ngiant planet instability, until today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2015 20:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The data reveal highly\ndynamic, dark, short-lived structures known as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted\nExcursions (RREs, RBEs) that are on-disk absorption features observed in the\nred and blue wings of spectral lines formed in the chromosphere. We study the\ndynamics of RREs and RBEs by tracking their evolution in space and time,\nmeasuring the speed of the apparent motion, line-of-sight Doppler velocity, and\ntransverse velocity of individual structures. A statistical study of their\nmeasured properties shows that RREs and RBEs have similar occurrence rates,\nlifetimes, lengths, and widths. They also display non-periodic, non-linear\ntransverse motions perpendicular to their axes at speeds of 4 - 31 km/s.\nFurthermore, both types of structures either appear as high speed jets and\nblobs that are directed outwardly from a magnetic bright point with speeds of\n50 - 150 km/s, or emerge within a few seconds. A study of the different\nvelocity components suggests that the transverse motions along the\nline-of-sight of the chromospheric flux tubes are responsible for the formation\nand appearance of these redshifted/blueshifted structures. The short lifetime\nand fast disappearance of the RREs/RBEs suggests that, similar to type II\nspicules, they are rapidly heated to transition region or even coronal\ntemperatures. We speculate that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability triggered by\nobserved transverse motions of these structures may be a viable mechanism for\ntheir heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2015 20:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We\nevaluated the contribution of the granulation to the ToV. We showed that the\ngranulation pattern can partially explain the observed discrepancies between\nmodels and data. This confirms that the limb-darkening and the granulation\npattern simulated in 3D RHD Sun represent well what is imaged by HINODE. In the\nend, we found that the Venus's aureole contribution during ToV is less intense\nthan the solar photosphere, and thus negligible. Being able to explain\nconsistently the data of 2004 ToV is a new step forward for 3D RHD simulations\nthat are becoming essential for the detection and characterization of\nexoplanets. They show that the granulation have to be considered as an\nintrinsic incertitude, due to the stellar variability, on precise measurements\nof exoplanet transits of, most likely, planets with small diameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jan 2015 20:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

It plays an important role in\nthe theory, but it appears as a postulate based on intuition rather than a\nwell-defined object. All previous attempts to supply Feynman's theory with\nrigorous mathematics have not been satisfactory. The difficulty comes from a\nneed to define a measure on the infinite dimensional space of paths and to\ncreate an integral that would possess all of the properties requested by\nFeynman.\n  In the present paper, we consider a new approach to defining the Feynman's\npath integral, based on the theory developed by P. Muldowney. Muldowney uses\nthe Henstock integration technique, and non-absolute integrability of the\nFresnel integrals in order to obtain a representation of the Feynman's path\nintegral as a functional. This approach offers a mathematically rigorous\ndefinition supporting Feynman's intuitive derivations. But in his work,\nMuldowney gives only local in space-time solutions. A physical solution to the\nnon-relativistic Schr\\\"odinger equation must be global, and it must be given in\nthe form of a unitary one-parameter group in L^2.

This implies that small, including Earth-size,\nplanets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the Universe's history\nwhen metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of\nKepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic\nthick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets with\nsizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We validate this system as a true\nfive-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailed\ncharacterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysis\nof the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected\nsolar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology to directly measure a precise\nage of 11.2+/-1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when\nthe Universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest\nknown system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets\nhave formed throughout most of the Universe's 13.8-billion-year history,\nleaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy.\nThe age of Kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among the\nhosts to the first Galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint the\nbeginning of the era of planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 01:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

The key challenge of this problem is how to learn a metric,\nsuch that the instances sharing the same label are more likely close to each\nother on the embedded space. However, little attention has been paid to learn\nbetter representations when the data lie on non-linear manifold. Fortunately,\ndeep learning has led to great success on feature learning recently. Inspired\nby the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive\nsemi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach. More specifically, given\npairwise constraints, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a\nnon-linear mapping under maximum margin framework for clustering analysis.\nThus, our model unifies transductive learning, feature learning and maximum\nmargin techniques in the semi-supervised clustering framework.

We observed that impurities give similar\neffects on various optical constants of $s$- and $d$-wave superconductors; the\nmore impurities give the more distinct gap feature and the less superfluid\ndensity. However, the $s$-wave superconductor gives the superconducting gap\nfeature more clearly than the $d$-wave superconductor because in the $d$-wave\nsuperconductors the optical quantities are averaged over the anisotropic Fermi\nsurface. Our results also supply helpful information to see how characteristic\nfeatures of the electron-boson spectral function and the $s$- and $d$-wave\nsuperconducting gaps appear in various optical constants including raw\nreflectance spectrum. Our study also may help to understand the usual optical\nanalysis process thoroughly. Further systematic study of experimental data\ncollected at various conditions using the optical analysis process will help to\nreveal the origin of the mediated boson in the boson-exchange superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 03:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

However, it has been difficult to quantify the\ncontribution of coastal rainfall features to the overall local rainfall. We\ndevelop a novel technique to objectively identify precipitation associated with\nland-sea interaction and apply it to satellite based rainfall estimates. The\nMaritime Continent, the Bight of Panama, Madagascar and the Mediterranean are\nfound to be regions where land-sea interactions plays a crucial role in the\nformation of precipitation. In these regions $\\approx$ 40% to 60% of the total\nrainfall can be related to coastline effects. Due to its importance for the\nclimate system, the Maritime Continent is a particular region of interest with\nhigh overall amounts of rainfall and large fractions resulting from land-sea\ninteractions throughout the year. To demonstrate the utility of our\nidentification method we investigate the influence of several modes of\nvariability, such as the Madden-Julian-Oscillation and the El Ni\\~no Southern\nOscillation, on coastal rainfall behavior. The results suggest that during\nlarge scale suppressed convective conditions coastal effects tend modulate the\nrainfall over the Maritime Continent leading to enhanced rainfall over land\nregions compared to the surrounding oceans.

It is frequently implied that, in principle, closed models can be\nwritten down at arbitrary order if only we had the time and patience to do\nthis. However, for epidemic dynamics on networks, these higher-order models\nhave not been defined explicitly. Here we unambiguously define hierarchies of\napproximate closed models that can utilise subsystem states of any order, and\nshow how well-known models are special cases of these hierarchies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 11:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 09:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}

Unless\ngluinos are discovered at LHC13, the commonly assumed unification of gaugino\nmass parameters will imply correspondingly heavy winos and binos, resulting in\na higgsino-like LSP and small inter-higgsino mass splittings. The small visible\nenergy release in higgsino decays makes their pair production difficult to\ndetect at the LHC. Relaxing gaugino mass universality allows for relatively\nlight winos and binos without violating LHC gluino mass bounds and without\naffecting naturalness. In the case where the bino mass M_1<~ \\mu, then one\nobtains a mixed bino-higgsino LSP with instead sizable w_1-z_1 and z_2-z_1 mass\ngaps. The thermal neutralino abundance can match the measured dark matter\ndensity in contrast to models with a higgsino-like LSP where WIMPs (weakly\ninteracting massive particles) are underproduced by factors of 10-15.

At full spatial resolution\nthe linear polarization signals are very significant all over the solar disk,\nwith a large fraction of the field of view showing line-center amplitudes well\nabove the 1% level. Via the Hanle effect the line-center polarization signals\nare sensitive to the magnetic field of the model's transition region, even when\nits mean field strength is only 15 G. The breaking of the axial symmetry of the\nradiation field produces significant forward-scattering polarization in\nLy$\\alpha$, without the need of an inclined magnetic field. Interestingly, the\nHanle effect tends to decrease such forward-scattering polarization signals in\nmost of the points of the field of view. When the spatial resolution is\ndegraded, the line-center polarization of Ly$\\alpha$ drops below the 1% level,\nreaching values similar to those previously found in 1D semi-empirical models\n(i.e., up to about 0.5%).

This is the so-called missing heritability\nproblem. Evidence has indicated that many complex diseases are genetically\nrelated, meaning these diseases share common genetic risk variants. Therefore,\nexploring the genetic correlations across multiple related studies could be a\npromising strategy for removing spurious associations and identifying\nunderlying genetic risk variants, and thereby uncovering the mystery of missing\nheritability in complex diseases. Results: We present a general and robust\nmethod to identify genetic patterns from multiple large-scale genomic datasets.\nWe treat the summary statistics as a matrix and demonstrate that genetic\npatterns will form a low-rank matrix plus a sparse component. Hence, we\nformulate the problem as a matrix recovering problem, where we aim to discover\nrisk variants shared by multiple diseases/traits and those for each individual\ndisease/trait. We propose a convex formulation for matrix recovery and an\nefficient algorithm to solve the problem. We demonstrate the advantages of our\nmethod using both synthesized datasets and real datasets. The experimental\nresults show that our method can successfully reconstruct both the shared and\nthe individual genetic patterns from summary statistics and achieve better\nperformance compared with alternative methods under a wide range of scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 13:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

Here, in an attempt to model\ncharge and orbital ordering in manganites displaying C-type\nantiferromaganetism, we study cooperative Jahn-Teller effect in two-band\none-dimensional chains in the regimes of both strong and weak electron-phonon\ncouplings. These chains exhibit orbital ferromagnetism with only $d_{z^2}$\norbitals being occupied. At strong coupling and in the antiadiabatic regime,\nusing a controlled analytic nonperturbative treatment that accounts for the\nquantum nature of the phonons, we derive the effective polaronic Hamiltonians\nfor a single chain as well as for interacting identically-long chains. Due to\ncooperative effects, these effective Hamiltonians manifest a dominant\nnext-nearest-neighbor hopping compared to the usual nearest-neighbor hopping\nand a significantly enhanced nearest-neighbor repulsion.

For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves\ncan be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed\nas a free parameter. Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the\npredicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies.

Stochastic block\nmodel (SBM) is a popular approach for grouping the individuals with respect to\ntheir social comportment. When several relationships of various types can occur\njointly between the individuals, the data are represented by multiplex networks\nwhere more than one edge can exist between the nodes. In this paper, we extend\nthe SBM to multiplex networks in order to obtain a clustering based on more\nthan one kind of relationship.

In this and other similar applications, the\nmean of the inter-delivery times of packets, i.e., throughput, is not\nsufficient to guarantee service-regularity. The time-averaged variance of the\ninter-delivery times of packets is also an important metric.\n  So motivated, we consider a wireless network where an Access Point schedules\nreal-time generated packets to nodes over a fading wireless channel. We are\ninterested in designing simple policies which achieve optimal mean-variance\ntradeoff in interdelivery times of packets by minimizing the sum of\ntime-averaged means and variances over all clients. Our goal is to explore the\nfull range of the Pareto frontier of all weighted linear combinations of mean\nand variance so that one can fully exploit the design possibilities.

With the upgrading of\nphysical goal and the developing of electronics, modern time measurement system\nmeets the requirement of excellent resolution specification as well as high\nintegrity. Due to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), FPGA time-to-digital\nconverter (TDC) becomes one of mature and prominent time measurement methods in\nrecent years. For correcting time-walk effect caused by leading timing,\ntime-over-threshold (TOT) measurement should be added in the FPGA TDC. TOT can\nbe obtained by measuring the interval time of signal leading and trailing edge.\nUnfortunately, a traditional TDC can recognize only one kind of signal edge,\nthe leading or the trailing. Generally, to measure the interval, two TDC\nchannels can be used at the same time, one for leading, the other for trailing.\nHowever, this method will increase the amount of used FPGA resource and reduce\nthe TDC's integrity unavoidably. This paper presents one method of TOT\nmeasurement implemented in a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. In this method, TOT measure\ncan be achieved in only one TDC input channel. The consumed resources and time\nresolution can both be guaranteed. Test shows that this TDC can achieve\nresolution better than 15 ps for leading edge measurement and 37 ps for TOT\nmeasurement. Furthermore, the TDC measuring dead time is about 2 clock cycles,\nwhich makes it be good for applications of higher physical event rate\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 07:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}
