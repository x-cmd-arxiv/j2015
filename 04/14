Our assertion is that the Consistent\nHistories formalism does not meet the second criterion. We also argue that the\nso-called second measurement problem, i.e., the inability to explain how an\nexperimental result is related to a property possessed by the measured system\nbefore the measurement took place, is only a pseudo-problem.

In these scenarios, intermediate-age MC clusters would\nbe simple stellar populations, in close analogy with younger clusters.\n  Here we provide the first evidence for an eMSTO in a young stellar cluster.\nWe exploit multi-band Hubble Space Telescope photometry to study the ~300-Myr\nold star cluster NGC1856 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and detected a broadened\nMSTO that is consistent with a prolonged star-formation which had a duration of\nabout 150 Myrs. Below the turn-off, the MS of NGC1856 is split into a red and\nblue component, hosting 33+/-5% and 67+/-5% of the total number of MS stars,\nrespectively. We discuss these findings in the context of\nmultiple-stellar-generation, stellar-rotation, and interacting-binary\nhypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 16:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The radiative corrections do not decouple with the scale of\nSupersymmetry and persist when the spectrum is shifted to higher values.\nMoreover, the mixing matrix renormalization with flavor-changing self-energies\nis not restricted to supersymmetric theories and give similar results in any\ntheory with new flavor structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 17:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

In\npractice, it is infeasible for anyone but the owner of the network (if\nexistent) to monitor all nodes at all times. In this work we study the\nconstrained setting when the observer can only probe a small set of nodes at\neach time step to check whether new pieces of information (items) have reached\nthose nodes.\n  We formally define the problem through an infinite time generating process\nthat places new items in subsets of nodes according to an unknown probability\ndistribution. Items have an exponentially decaying novelty, modeling their\ndecreasing value. The observer uses a probing schedule (i.e., a probability\ndistribution over the set of nodes) to choose, at each time step, a small set\nof nodes to check for new items. The goal is to compute a schedule that\nminimizes the average novelty of undetected items. We present an algorithm,\nWIGGINS, to compute the optimal schedule through convex optimization, and then\nshow how it can be adapted when the parameters of the problem must be learned\nor change over time. We also present a scalable variant of WIGGINS for the\nMapReduce framework.

One of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellar\nabundance patterns as \"chemical tags\" to identify stars that were born in the\nsame molecular cloud. In this paper we assess the prospects of chemical tagging\nas a function of several key underlying parameters. We show that in the\nfiducial case of $10^4$ distinct cells in chemical space and $10^5-10^6$ stars\nin the survey, one can expect to detect $\\sim 10^2-10^3$ groups that are $\\ge\n5\\sigma$ overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very\nlarge overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is\ndue to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our\nfiducial model parameters, the typical $5\\sigma$ overdensity is comprised of\nstars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing\nonly 25% of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification\nof disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in\nthe chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar\npopulation. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic\nobservational plans.

Such a corona forms through irradiation of the outer disk by radiation\nproduced in the inner accretion flow. The same irradiation can produce a strong\noutflow from the disk at sufficiently large radii. Outflowing gas has been\nrecently detected in several X-ray binaries via blue-shifted absorption lines.\nHowever, the causal connection between winds produced by irradiation and the\nblue-shifted absorption lines is problematic, particularly in the case of GRO\nJ1655-40. Observations of this source imply wind densities about two orders of\nmagnitude higher than theoretically predicted. This discrepancy does not mean\nthat these `thermal disk-winds' cannot explain blue-shifted absorption in other\nsystems, nor that they are unimportant as a sink of matter. Motivated by the\ninevitability of thermal disk-winds and wealth of data taken with current\nobservatories such as Chandra, XMM-Newton and Suzaku, as well as the future\nAstroH mission, we decided to investigate the requirements to produce very\ndense winds. Using physical arguments, hydrodynamical simulations and\nabsorption line calculations, we found that modification of the heating and\ncooling rates by a factor of a few results in an increase of the wind density\nof up to an order of magnitude and the wind velocity by a factor of about two.\nTherefore, the mass loss rate from the disk can be one, if not even two orders\nof magnitude higher than the accretion rate onto the central object. Such a\nhigh mass loss rate is expected to destabilize the disk and perhaps provides a\nmechanism for state change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 14:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

This secular evolution is a new area of galaxy\nevolution work that complements hierarchical clustering. 2 - Disks of\nhigh-redshift galaxies are unstable to the formation of mass clumps that sink\nto the center and merge - an alternative channel for the formation of classical\nbulges.

We estimate the pairwise momentum of the kSZ temperature fluctuations at\nthe positions of the CGC (Central Galaxy Catalogue) samples extracted from\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (DR7) data. For the foreground-cleaned maps, we find\n$1.8$-$2.5\\sigma$ detections of the kSZ signal, which are consistent with the\nkSZ evidence found in individual Planck raw frequency maps, although lower than\nfound in the WMAP-9yr W band ($3.3\\sigma$). We further reconstruct the peculiar\nvelocity field from the CG density field, and compute for the first time the\ncross-correlation function between kSZ temperature fluctuations and estimates\nof CG radial peculiar velocities. This correlation function yields a\n$3.0$-$3.7$$\\sigma$ detection of the peculiar motion of extended gas on Mpc\nscales, in flows correlated up to distances of 80-100 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. Both the\npairwise momentum estimates and kSZ temperature-velocity field correlation find\nevidence for kSZ signatures out to apertures of 8 arcmin and beyond,\ncorresponding to a physical radius of $> 1$ Mpc, more than twice the mean\nvirial radius of halos. This is consistent with the predictions from hydro\nsimulations that most of the baryons are outside the virialized halos. We fit a\nsimple model, in which the temperature-velocity cross-correlation is\nproportional to the signal seen in a semi-analytic model built upon N-body\nsimulations, and interpret the proportionality constant as an \"effective\"\noptical depth to Thomson scattering. We find $\\tau_T=(1.4\\pm0.5)\\times\n10^{-4}$; the simplest interpretation of this measurement is that much of the\ngas is in a diffuse phase, which contributes little signal to X-ray or thermal\nSZ observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 20:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 17:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Most of the carbon in the Universe is\nbelieved to originate from stars with masses up to a few solar masses. Although\nthere is a chemical dichotomy between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich evolved\nstars, the dredge-up itself has never been directly observed. In the last three\ndecades, however, a few stars have been shown to display both carbon- and\noxygen-rich material in their circumstellar envelopes. Two models have been\nproposed to explain this dual chemistry: one postulates that a recent dredge-up\nof carbon produced by nucleosynthesis inside the star during the Asymptotic\nGiant Branch changed the surface chemistry of the star. The other model\npostulates that oxygen-rich material exists in stable keplerian rotation around\nthe central star. The two models make contradictory, testable, predictions on\nthe location of the oxygen-rich material, either located further from the star\nthan the carbon-rich gas, or very close to the star in a stable disk. Using the\nFaint Object InfraRed CAmera (FORCAST) instrument on board the Stratospheric\nObservatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Telescope, we obtained images of the\ncarbon-rich planetary nebula (PN) BD+30 3639 which trace both carbon-rich\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and oxygen-rich silicate dust. With the\nsuperior spectral coverage of SOFIA, and using a 3D photoionisation and dust\nradiative transfer model we prove that the O-rich material is distributed in a\nshell in the outer parts of the nebula, while the C-rich material is located in\nthe inner parts of the nebula. These observations combined with the model,\nsuggest a recent change in stellar surface composition for the double chemistry\nin this object.

With the introduction of line\nedge roughness, the phonon transmission is reduced, but non-uniformly\nthroughout the spectrum. We identify four distinct behaviors within the phonon\nspectrum in the presence of disorder: i) the low-energy, low-wavevector\nacoustic branches have very long mean-free-paths and are affected the least by\nedge disorder, even in the case of ultra-narrow W=1nm wide GNRs; ii) energy\nregions that consist of a dense population of relatively flat phonon modes\n(including the optical branches) are also not significantly affected, except in\nthe case of the ultranarrow W=1nm GNRs, in which case the transmission is\nreduced because of band mismatch along the phonon transport path; iii)\nquasi-acoustic bands that lie within the intermediate region of the spectrum\nare strongly affected by disorder as this part of the spectrum is depleted of\npropagating phonon modes upon both confinement and disorder especially as the\nchannel length increases; iv) the strongest reduction in phonon transmission is\nobserved in energy regions that are composed of a small density of phonon\nmodes, in which case roughness can introduce transport gaps that greatly\nincrease with channel length.

The Eu detection for one star with\n[Fe/H]=-1.45 confirms a broadly constant [Eu/H] of ~-1.3 for stars with\n[Fe/H]>-2.

It\ncan be read in two ways: as a research paper interspersed with lengthy\ndigressions into rethinking of standard material; or as an elementary (but\nhighly unconventional) introduction to first-order intuitionistic logic. For\nthe latter purpose, no training in formal logic is required, but a modest\nliteracy in mathematics, such as topological spaces and posets, is assumed.\n  The main theme of this work is the search for a formal semantics adequate to\nKolmogorov's informal interpretation of intuitionistic logic (whose simplest\npart is more or less the same as the so-called BHK interpretation). This search\ngoes beyond the usual model theory, based on Tarski's notion of semantic\nconsequence, and beyond the usual formalism of first-order logic, based on\nschemata. Thus we study formal semantics of a simplified version of Paulson's\nmeta-logic, used in the Isabelle prover.\n  By interpreting the meta-logical connectives and quantifiers constructively,\nwe get a generalized model theory, which covers, in particular,\nrealizability-type interpretations of intuitionistic logic. On the other hand,\nby analyzing Kolmogorov's notion of semantic consequence (which is an\nalternative to Tarski's standard notion), we get an alternative model theory.\nBy using an extension of the meta-logic, we further get a generalized\nalternative model theory, which suffices to formalize Kolmogorov's semantics.\n  On the other hand, we also formulate a modification of Kolmogorov's\ninterpretation, which is compatible with the usual, Tarski-style model theory.\nNamely, it can be formalized by means of sheaf-valued models, which turn out to\nbe a special case of Palmgren's categorical models; intuitionistic logic is\ncomplete with respect to this semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 22:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 00:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 17:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

This problem can be remedied by using the two-stage least\nsquares (TSLS) estimator, based on the availability of valid instrumental\nvariables (IVs). This reduction in bias, however, is offset by an increase in\nvariance. Under standard assumptions, the OLS has indeed a larger bias than the\nTSLS estimator; and moreover, one can prove that the sample variance of the OLS\nestimator is no greater than the one of the TSLS. Therefore, it is natural to\nask whether one could combine the desirable properties of the OLS and TSLS\nestimators. Such a trade-off can be achieved through a convex combination of\nthese two estimators, thereby producing our proposed convex least squares (CLS)\nestimator. The relative contribution of the OLS and TSLS estimators is here\nchosen to minimize a sample estimate of the mean squared error (MSE) of their\nconvex combination. This proportion parameter is proved to be unique, whenever\nthe OLS and TSLS differ in MSEs. Remarkably, we show that this proportion\nparameter can be estimated from the data, and that the resulting CLS estimator\nis consistent. We also show how the CLS framework can incorporate other\nasymptotically unbiased estimators, such as the jackknife IV estimator (JIVE).\nThe finite-sample properties of the CLS estimator are investigated using Monte\nCarlo simulations, in which we independently vary the amount of confounding and\nthe strength of the instrument. Overall, the CLS estimator is found to\noutperform the TSLS estimator in terms of MSE. The method is also applied to a\nclassic data set from econometrics, which models the financial return to\neducation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 22:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

We also examine the SOS-rank of SOS tensor decomposition and the\nSOS-width for SOS tensor cones. The SOS-rank provides the minimal number of\nsquares in the SOS tensor decomposition, and, for a given SOS tensor cone, its\nSOS-width is the maximum possible SOS-rank for all the tensors in this cone. We\nfirst deduce an upper bound for general tensors that have SOS decomposition and\nthe SOS-width for general SOS tensor cone using the known results in the\nliterature of polynomial theory.

Our society comprises a\ncollection of such individuals, and the society is expected to maximise the\ntotal rewards, while the individuals compete for common rewards.

Herein, we demonstrate a\nprototype of an analog computer that efficiently solves CBPs by exploiting the\nphysical dynamics of numerous fluids in coupled cylinders. This device enables\nthe maximisation of the total rewards for the society without paying the\nconventionally required computational cost; this is because the fluids estimate\nthe reward probabilities of the options for the exploitation of past knowledge\nand generate random fluctuations for the exploration of new knowledge. Our\nresults suggest that to optimise the social rewards, the utilisation of\nfluid-derived natural fluctuations is more advantageous than applying\nartificial external fluctuations.

An energy\nestimation shows that the radiation is higher than the heat input, which\nindicates so-called catastrophic cooling. The cooling was accompanied by the\nformation of coronal rain in the form of falling cold plasma. We studied two\ndifferent sequences of falling blobs. The first sequence includes three\ndifferent blobs. The mean velocities of the blobs were estimated to be 50 km\ns$^{-1}$, 60 km s$^{-1}$ and 40 km s$^{-1}$. A polynomial fit shows the\ndifferent values of the acceleration for different blobs, which are lower than\nfree-fall in the solar corona. The first and second blob move along the same\npath, but with and without acceleration, respectively. We performed simple\nnumerical simulations for two consecutive blobs, which show that the second\nblob moves in a medium that is modified by the passage of the first blob.\nTherefore, the second blob has a relatively high speed and no acceleration, as\nis shown by observations. The second sequence includes two different blobs with\nmean velocities of 100 km s$^{-1}$ and 90 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 09:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The analysis\nis then extended to ergodic fading channels, for which tight lower and upper\nbounds of the GMI are obtained. Impacts of dithering and imperfect channel\nstate information (CSI) are also investigated, and it is shown that dithering\ncan remarkably improve the system performance while imperfect CSI only\nintroduces a marginal rate loss. Finally, the analytical framework is applied\nto the multi-user access scenario. Numerical results demonstrate that the\nmixed-ADC architecture with a relatively small number of high-resolution ADCs\nis able to achieve a large fraction of the channel capacity of conventional\narchitecture, while reduce the energy consumption considerably even compared\nwith antenna selection, for both single-user and multi-user scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 12:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 08:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The\n\\emph{workflow satisfiability problem} (WSP) is the problem of determining\nwhether there exists an assignment of users to workflow steps that satisfies\nall such authorizations and constraints. An algorithm for solving WSP is\nimportant, both as a static analysis tool for workflow specifications, and for\nthe construction of run-time reference monitors for workflow management\nsystems.

We first show that, from the bottom-up perspective, such models admit a\nvariety of different regimes for the enhancement of the effective axion decay\nconstant, depending on the amount of alignment and the number of instanton\nterms that contribute to the scalar potential. This includes regimes of no\nenhancement, power-law enhancement and exponential enhancement with respect to\n$N$. As special cases, we recover the Pythagorean enhancement of $N$-flation,\nthe $N$ and $N^{3/2}$ enhancements derived by Bachlechner, Long and McAllister\nand the exponential enhancement by Choi, Kim and Yun. We then analyze which\ntop-down constraints are put on such models from the requirement of consistency\nwith quantum gravity. In particular, the WGC appears to imply that the\nenhancement of the effective axion decay constant must not grow parametrically\nwith $N$ for $N \\gg 1$. On the other hand, recent works proposed that axions\nmight be able to violate this bound under certain circumstances. Our general\nexpression for the enhancement allows us to translate this possibility into a\ncondition on the number of instantons that couple to the axions. We argue that,\nat large $N$, models consistent with quantum gravity must either allow\nsuper-Planckian field excursions or have an enormous, possibly even\nexponentially large, number of dominant instanton terms in the scalar\npotential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 14:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 15:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The theory and modeling of crystalline materials is in\nsome sense a solved problem, where one can now calculate the thermal\nconductivity of any crystalline line compound from first principles [1,2] using\nexpressions based on the phonon gas model (PGM)[3,4]. However, modeling of\namorphous materials still has many open questions, because the PGM itself\nbecomes questionable when one cannot rigorously define the phonon velocities.\nNew theories and methods are therefore needed to understand phonon transport in\namorphous materials. In this letter, we used our recently developed Green-Kubo\nmodal analysis (GKMA) method to study amorphous silica (a-SiO2). The predicted\nthermal conductivities exhibit excellent agreement with experiments at all\ntemperatures and anharmonic effects are included in the thermal conductivity\ncalculation for all types of modes in a-SiO2 for the first time. Previously,\nlocalized modes (locons) have been thought to have a negligible contribution to\nthermal conductivity, due to their highly localized nature, which conceptually\nshould prevent them from moving energy to another location. However, in a-SiO2\nour results indicate that locons contribute more than 10% to the total thermal\nconductivity from 400K to 800K and they are largely responsible for the\nincrease in thermal conductivity of a-SiO2 above room temperature.

Interaction with other agents or\nsubsystems takes place, in general, through a digital communication channel\nwith limited bandwidth where transmission of continuous-time signals is not\npossible.
