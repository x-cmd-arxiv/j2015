We find that the\nluminosity of supernovae from such progenitors with the canonical explosion\nenergy of 1e51 erg and 56Ni mass of 0.05 Msun can increase temporarily shortly\nbefore all the hydrogen in the envelope recombines. As a result, a bump appears\nin their light curves. The bump appears because the heating from the nuclear\ndecay of 56Ni can keep the bottom of hydrogen-rich layers in the ejecta\nionized, and thus the photosphere can stay there for a while. We find that the\nlight-curve bump becomes less significant when we make explosion energy larger\n(>~ 2e51 erg), 56Ni mass smaller (<~ 0.01 Msun), 56Ni mixed in the ejecta, or\nthe progenitor radius larger. Helium mixing in hydrogen-rich layers makes the\nlight-curve decline rates large but does not help reducing the light-curve\nbump. Because the light-curve bump we found in our light-curve models has not\nbeen observed in rapidly fading Type II supernovae, they may be characterized\nby not only low-mass hydrogen-rich envelopes but also higher explosion energy,\nlarger degrees of 56Ni mixing, and/or larger progenitor radii than slowly\nfading Type II supernovae, so that the light-curve bump does not become\nsignificant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 16:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

Resulting 3D reconstruction recovers shape\nfaithfully, but not scale. However, preservation of scale becomes critical in\napplications, such as multi-party telepresence, where multiple 3D scenes need\nto be fused into a single coordinate system. In this context, we propose a\ncamera network configuration that includes a stereo pair with known baseline\nseparation, and analytically demonstrate Euclidean auto calibration of such\nnetwork under mild conditions. Further, we experimentally validate our theory\nusing a four-camera network. Importantly, our method not only recovers scale,\nbut also compares favorably with the well known Zhang and Pollefeys methods in\nterms of shape recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 16:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Our approach\nyields a novel perspective on the complexity, controllability, causality and\n(re)programmability discrete dynamical systems. We find evidence that the\ndensity of (qualitatively different) computer programs that can be reprogrammed\ngrows asymptotically as a function of program and compiler size. To illustrate\nthese findings we show a series of behavioural boundary crossing results,\nincluding emulations (for all initial conditions) of Wolfram class 2 Elementary\nCellular Automata (ECA) by Class 1 ECA, emulations of Classes 1, 2 and 3 ECA by\nClass 2 and 3 ECA, and of Classes 1, 2 and 3 by Class 3 ECA, along with results\nof even greater emulability for general CA (neighbourhood $r=3/2$), including\nClass 1 CA emulating Classes 2 and 3, and Classes 3 and 4 emulating all other\nclasses (1, 2, 3 and 4).

The increase of\nLHC luminosity leads to signal pile-up that deforms the signal of interest and\ncompromises the amplitude estimation performance. This work presents the\nproposed algorithm for energy estimation during LHC Run 2. The method is based\non the same approach used during LHC Run 1, namely the Optimal Filter. The only\ndifference is that the signal baseline (pedestal) will be subtracted from the\nreceived digitized samples, while in Run 1 this quantity was estimated on an\nevent-by-event basis. The pedestal value is estimated through special\ncalibration runs and it is stored in a data base for online and offline usage.\nAdditionally, the background covariance matrix will also be used for the\ncomputation of the Optimal Filter weights for high occupancy channels. The use\nof such information reduces the bias and uncertainties introduced by signal\npile-up. The performance of the Optimal Filter version used in Run 1 and Run 2\nis compared using Monte Carlo data. The efficiency achieved by the methods is\nshown in terms of error estimation, when different conditions of luminosity and\noccupancy are considered. Concerning future work, a new method based on linear\nsignal deconvolution has been recently proposed and it is under validation. It\ncould be used for Run 2 offline energy reconstruction and future upgrades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 18:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

By scattering stellar light, clouds increase the planetary albedo\nto 0.4-0.6 and cool the atmosphere below 1 mbar.

The\nsample presented in this work is obtained from the High $A_V$ Quasar (HAQ)\nsurvey. The quasar candidates were selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and follow-up\nspectroscopy was carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) and the New\nTechnology Telescope (NTT). To study dust extinction curves intrinsic to the\nquasars, from the HAQ survey we selected 16 cases where the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) law could not provide a good solution to the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs). We derived the extinction curves using Fitzpatrick &\nMassa 1986 (FM) law by comparing the observed SEDs to the combined quasar\ntemplate from Vanden Berk et al. 2001 and Glikman et al. 2006. The derived\nextinction, $A_V$, ranges from 0.2-1.0 mag. All the individual extinction\ncurves of our quasars are steeper ($R_V=2.2$-2.7) than that of the SMC, with a\nweighted mean value of $R_V=2.4$. We derive an `average quasar extinction\ncurve' for our sample by fitting SEDs simultaneously by using the weighted mean\nvalues of the FM law parameters and a varying $R_V$. The entire sample is well\nfit with a single best-fit value of $R_V=2.2\\pm0.2$. The `average quasar\nextinction curve' deviates from the steepest Milky Way and SMC extinction\ncurves at a confidence level $\\gtrsim95\\%$. Such steep extinction curves\nsuggest a significant population of silicates to produce small dust grains.\nMoreover, another possibility could be that the large dust grains may have been\ndestroyed by the activity of the nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), resulting\nin steep extinction curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 19:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 17:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 01:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

Since strong\ndisturbances to a halo (such as might be indicated by a large change in the\nspin direction) are likely also to disturb the galaxy evolving within, spin\nflips could be a mechanism for galaxy morphological transformation without\ninvolving major mergers. We find that 35% of haloes have, at some point in\ntheir lifetimes, had a spin flip of at least $45\\deg$ that does not coincide\nwith a major merger. Over 75% of large spin flips coincide with non-major\nmergers; only a quarter coincide with major mergers. We find a similar picture\nfor changes to the inner-halo spin orientation, although here there is an\nincreased likelihood of a flip occurring. Changes in halo angular momentum\norientation, and other such measures of halo perturbation, are therefore very\nimportant quantities to consider, in addition to halo mergers, when modelling\nthe formation and evolution of galaxies and confronting such models with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 19:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 19:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

Due to the axial anomaly, the pseudo-scalar operator for the gluonic\nfield strength mixes with the divergence of the axial vector current. Working\nin dimensional regularization and using the 't~Hooft-Veltman prescription for\nthe axial vector current, we compute the three-loop pseudo-scalar form factors\nfor massless quarks and gluons. Using the universal infrared factorization\nproperties, we independently derive the three-loop operator mixing and finite\noperator renormalisation from the renormalisation group equation for the form\nfactors, thereby confirming recent results in the operator product expansion.\nThe finite part of the three-loop form factor is an important ingredient to the\nprecise prediction of the pseudo-scalar Higgs boson production cross section at\nhadron colliders. We discuss potential applications and derive the hard\nmatching coefficient in soft-collinear effective theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 19:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 14:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The\nidentification of variable sources, such as AGNs, and the achievable redshift\naccuracy for varying objects are important in view of the science goals of the\nEUCLID and eROSITA missions. We probe AGN optical variability for a large\nsample of X-ray-selected AGNs in the XMM-COSMOS field, using the light curves\nprovided by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3pi and MDF04 surveys. Utilizing two\ndifferent variability parameters, we defined a sample of varying AGNs for every\nPS1 band. We investigated the influence of variability on the calculation of\nphoto-z by applying three different input photometry sets for our fitting\nprocedure. For each of the five PS1 bands, we chose either the epochs\nminimizing the interval in observing time, the median magnitude values, or\nrandomly drawn light curve points to compute the redshift. In addition, we\nderived photo-z using PS1 photometry extended by GALEX/IRAC bands. We find that\nthe photometry produced by the 3pi survey is sufficient to reliably detect\nvariable sources provided that the fractional variability amplitude is at least\n3%. Considering the photo-z of variable AGNs, we observe that minimizing the\ntime spacing of the chosen points yields superior photo-z in terms of the\npercentage of outliers (33%) and accuracy (0.07), outperforming the other two\napproaches. Drawing random points from the light curve gives rise to typically\n57% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.4. Adding GALEX/IRAC bands for the\nredshift determination weakens the influence of variability. Although the\nredshift quality generally improves when adding these bands, we still obtain\nnot less than 26% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.05 at best, therefore\nvariable sources should receive a flag stating that their photo-z may be low\nquality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 20:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

This significance is typically addressed by\nrunning a large number of simulations to derive the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the feature-amplitude in the Gaussian case. Although these\nsimulations are tractable for the power spectrum, for the bispectrum they\nrequire significant computational resources. We show that, by assuming that the\nPDF is given by a multi-variate Gaussian where the covariance is determined by\nthe Fisher matrix of the sine and cosine terms, we can efficiently produce\nspectra that are statistically close to those derived from full simulations. By\ndrawing a large number of spectra from this PDF, both for the power spectrum\nand the bispectrum, we can quickly determine the statistical significance of\ncandidate signatures in the CMB, considering both single frequency and\nmulti-frequency estimators. We show that for resonance models, cosmology and\nforeground parameters have little influence on the estimated amplitude, which\nallows to simplify the analysis considerably. A more precise likelihood\ntreatment can then be applied to candidate signatures only.

Here we resolve this\napparent contradiction by introducing a model where a current flows in response\nto a magnetic field even without Weyl nodes. We point out that the previous\nderivation of a vanishing CME in the limit of vanishing real frequency is a\nconsequence of the assumption of periodic boundary conditions of the system. A\nmore realistic system with open boundary conditions is not subject to these\nconstraints and can have a non-vanishing CME. Consistent with recent work, we\nfound the finite frequency CME to be non-vanishing in general when there was a\nnon-vanishing Berry curvature on the Fermi surface. This does not necessitate\nhaving a topological Berry flux as in the case of a Weyl node. Finally, we\nstudy how the perturbation theory in magnetic field might be more stable in the\npresence of disorder. Using the standard diagrammatic treatment of disorder\nwithin the Born approximation, we have found that in a realistic disordered\nsystem, the chiral magnetic response is really a dynamical phenomena and\nvanishes in the DC limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 21:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Blue stragglers are easy to identify in globular clusters, but are\nmuch harder to identify in the field. Here we present the serendipitous\ndiscovery of one field blue straggler, HIP 10725, that closely matches the Sun\nin mass and age, but with a metallicity slightly lower than the Sun's.\n[Methods]. We employ high resolution (R $\\sim 10^5$) high S/N (330) VLT/UVES\nspectra to perform a differential abundance analysis of the solar analogue HIP\n10725. Radial velocities obtained by other instruments were also used to check\nfor binarity. We also study its chromospheric activity, age and rotational\nvelocity. [Results]. We find that HIP 10725 is severely depleted in beryllium\n([Be/H] <= -1.2 dex) for its stellar parameters and age. The abundances\nrelative to solar of the elements with Z <= 30 show a correlation with\ncondensation temperature and the neutron capture elements produced by the\ns-process are greatly enhanced, while the r-process elements seem normal. We\nfound its projected rotational velocity (v sin i = 3.3+/-0.1 km/s) to be\nsignificantly larger than solar, and incompatible with its isochrone-derived\nage. Radial velocity monitoring shows that the star has a binary companion.\n[Conclusions]. Based on the high s-process element enhancements and low\nberyllium abundance, we suggest that HIP 10725 has been polluted by\nmass-transfer from an AGB star, probably with initial mass of about 2 M_Sun.\nThe radial velocity variations suggest the presence of an unseen binary\ncompanion, probably the remnant of a former AGB star. Isochrones predict a\nsolar-age star, but this is in disagreement with the high projected rotational\nvelocity and high chromospheric activity. We conclude that HIP 10725 is a field\nblue straggler, rejuvenated by the mass transfer process of its former AGB\ncompanion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 00:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

For the first\ntime, the multi-wavelength spectral evolutions of Mrk 421 during different\nstates were systematically analyzed. During the outburst phase and the seven\nflaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from\nsub-keV to few keV. The TeV $\\gamma$-ray flux increases up to 0.9$-$7.2 times\nthe flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV $\\gamma$-rays is found to vary\ndepending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three\ngroups according to the GeV flux variation.

Despite significant efforts and\nsuccesses over last few years, theoretical guarantees of source localization\nalgorithms were established only for tree networks due to the complexity of the\nproblem.

The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced\ntreatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes).\nIndeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations\non top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a\n`no-geometry' state): in such states, most holonomies are totally spread,\nmaking it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4-geometry. However,\ngoing beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers\na deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect\nto a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in\nthe case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic\nimplications for other gauge groups, eg. $\\mathcal{SU}(2)$). Specifically, we\nshow that, in this case, there does not exist any state on the holonomy-flux\nalgebra in which the variances of the holonomies and fluxes observables would\nall be finite, let alone small. It is important to note that this obstruction\ncannot be bypassed by further enlarging the quantum state space, for it arises\nfrom the structure of the algebra itself: as there are too many (uncountably\nmany) non-vanishing commutators between the holonomy and flux operators, the\ncorresponding Heisenberg inequalities force the quantum uncertainties to blow\nup uncontrollably. A way out would be to suitably restrict the algebra of\nobservables. In a companion paper we take the first steps in this direction by\ndeveloping a general framework to perform such a restriction without giving up\nthe universality and diffeomorphism invariance of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 12:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

One can thus bypass the need to select a\nvacuum state for the theory, and still be provided with an explicit and\nconstructive description of the quantum state space, at least as long as the\nlabel set indexing the projective structure is countable. Because uncountable\nlabel sets are much less practical in this context, we develop in the present\narticle a general procedure to trim an originally uncountable label set down to\ncountable cardinality. In particular, we investigate how to perform this\ntightening of the label set in a way that preserves both the physical content\nof the algebra of observables and its symmetries.

Results: We report here our results on star forming blue\nearly-type galaxies with tidal trails and in close proximity to neighbouring\ngalaxies that are evidence of ongoing or recent interactions between galaxies.\nThere are 12 galaxies with close companions with similar redshifts, among which\ntwo galaxies are having ongoing interactions that potentially trigger the star\nformation. Two galaxies show a jet feature that could be due to the complete\ntidal disruption of the companion galaxy. The interacting galaxies have high\nstar formation rates and very blue optical colours. Galaxies with no companion\ncould have undergone a minor merger in the recent past. Conclusions: The recent\nor ongoing interaction with a gas-rich neighbouring galaxy could be responsible\nfor bringing cold gas to an otherwise passively evolving early-type galaxy. The\nsudden gas supply could trigger the star formation, eventually creating a blue\nearly-type galaxy. The galaxies with ongoing tidal interaction are blue and\nstar forming, thereby implying that blue early-type galaxies can exist even\nwhen the companion is on flyby so does not end up in a merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 13:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

However, these classical implementations in general only use a subset of\nthe available observational data. Freedman & Madore (2010) suggested a more\nphysical approach in the implementation of the parallax of pulsation in order\nto treat all available data. We present a global and model-based\nparallax-of-pulsation method that enables including any type of observational\ndata in a consistent model fit, the SpectroPhoto-Interferometric modeling of\nPulsating Stars (SPIPS). We implemented a simple model consisting of a\npulsating sphere with a varying effective temperature and a combina- tion of\natmospheric model grids to globally fit radial velocities, spectroscopic data,\nand interferometric angular diameters. We also parametrized (and adjusted) the\nreddening and the contribution of the circumstellar envelopes in the\nnear-infrared photometric and interferometric measurements. We show the\nsuccessful application of the method to two stars: delta Cep and eta Aql. The\nagreement of all data fitted by a single model confirms the validity of the\nmethod. Derived parameters are compatible with publish values, but with a\nhigher level of confidence. The SPIPS algorithm combines all the available\nobservables (radial velocimetry, interferometry, and photometry) to estimate\nthe physical parameters of the star (ratio distance/ p-factor, Teff, presence\nof infrared excess, color excess, etc). The statistical precision is improved\n(compared to other methods) thanks to the large number of data taken into\naccount, the accuracy is improved by using consistent physical modeling and the\nreliability of the derived parameters is strengthened thanks to the redundancy\nin the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 13:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

A distinct feature of our results lies in the local optimality and\nrobustness achieved by our proposed consensus control algorithm.

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study of the relation between two profile observables,\nconcentration ($\\mathrm{c_{vir}}$) and mass ($\\mathrm{M_{vir}}$). We have\ncollected the largest known sample of measurements from the literature which\nmake use of one or more of the following reconstruction techniques: Weak\ngravitational lensing (WL), strong gravitational lensing (SL), Weak+Strong\nLensing (WL+SL), the Caustic Method (CM), Line-of-sight Velocity Dispersion\n(LOSVD), and X-ray. We find that the concentration-mass (c-M) relation is\nhighly variable depending upon the reconstruction technique used. We also find\nconcentrations derived from dark matter only simulations (at approximately\n$\\mathrm{M_{vir} \\sim 10^{14} M_{\\odot}}$) to be inconsistent with the WL and\nWL+SL relations at the $\\mathrm{1\\sigma}$ level, even after the projection of\ntriaxial halos is taken into account.

There are at least four natural effects that cause deviations\nfrom ideal power law size distributions, which we model here in a generalized\nway: (1) a physical threshold of an instability; (2) incomplete sampling of the\nsmallest events below a threshold $x_0$; (3) contamination by an\nevent-unrelated background $x_b$; and (4) truncation effects at the largest\nevents due to a finite system size. These effects can be modeled in simplest\nterms with a \"thresholded power law\" distribution function (also called\ngeneralized Pareto [type II] or Lomax distribution), $N(x) dx \\propto\n(x+x_0)^{-a} dx$, where $x_0 > 0$ is positive for a threshold effect, while\n$x_0 < 0$ is negative for background contamination. We analytically derive the\nfunctional shape of this thresholded power law distribution function from an\nexponential-growth evolution model, which produces avalanches only when a\ndisturbance exceeds a critical threshold $x_0$. We apply the thresholded power\nlaw distribution function to terrestrial, solar (HXRBS, BATSE, RHESSI), and\nstellar flare (Kepler) data sets. We find that the thresholded power law model\nprovides an adequate fit to most of the observed data. Major advantages of this\nmodel are the automated choice of the power law fitting range, diagnostics of\nbackground contamination, physical inastability thresholds, instrumental\ndetection thresholds, and finite system size limits. When testing\nself-organized criticality models, which predict ideal power laws, we suggest\nto include these natural truncation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 15:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-25"}

In this paper we study, both numerically and analytically,\nthree-flavour neutrino transformation through fluctuating matter built from two\nand three Fourier modes. We find flavor transformation effects which cannot\noccur with just two flavours. For the case of two Fourier modes we observe the\nequivalent of \"induced transparency\" from quantum optics whereby transitions\nbetween a given pair of states are suppressed due to the presence of a resonant\nmode between another pair. When we add a third Fourier mode we find a new\neffect whereby the third mode can manipulate the transition probabilities of\nthe two mode case so as to force complete transparency or, alternatively,\nrestore \"opacity\" meaning the perturbative Hamiltonian regains its ability to\ninduce neutrino flavour transitions. In both applications we find analytic\nsolutions are able to match the amplitude and wavenumber of the numerical\nresults to within a few percent. We then consider a case of turbulence and show\nhow the theory can be used to understand the very different response of a\nneutrino to what appears to be two, almost identical, instances of turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 15:54:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 12:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

The interpretation of these limits within\nrealistic BSM scenarios is non-trivial and best done by automated computational\ntools. To this end we have developed SModelS, a public tool that can test any\ngiven BSM model with a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry by decomposing it into its SMS\ncomponents and confronting them with a large database of SMS results. This\nallows to easily evaluate the main LHC constraints on the model. Additionally,\nSModelS returns information on important signatures that are not covered by the\nexisting SMS results. This may be used to improve the coverage of BSM searches\nand SMS interpretations. We present the working principle of SModelS, in\nparticular the decomposition procedure, the database and matching of applicable\nexperimental results. Moreover, we present applications of SModelS to different\nmodels: the MSSM, a model with a sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle and the UMSSM.

If this rough definition is not enough, then a mathematician\nmay provide a formal definition of the real numbers in the set theoretic and\naxiomatic fashion, i.e. via Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts, or as the\ncollection of axioms characterizing exactly (up to isomorphism) the set of real\nnumbers as the complete and totally ordered Archimedean field. Actually, the\nabove notions of the real numbers are abstract and do not have a constructive\ngrounding. Definition of Cauchy sequences, and equivalence classes of these\nsequences explicitly use the actual infinity. The same is for Dedekind cuts,\nwhere the set of rational numbers is used as actual infinity. Although there is\nno direct constructive grounding for these abstract notions, there are so\ncalled intuitions on which they are based. A rigorous approach to express these\nvery intuition in a constructive way is proposed.

We took\ndata on 23 nights at three observatories, one in India and two in Bulgaria,\nmaking quasi-simultaneous observations in B, V, R, and I bands. We measured\nmulti-band optical fluxes, colour and spectral variations for this blazar on\nintraday and short timescales. The source was in a flaring state during the\nperiod analyzed and displayed intense variability in all wavelengths. R band\nmagnitude of 11.6 was attained by the target on 18 Jan 2015, which is the\nbrightest value ever recorded for S5 0716+714. The discrete correlation\nfunction method yielded good correlation between the bands with no measurable\ntime lags, implying that radiation in these bands originate from the same\nregion and by the same mechanism. We also used the structure function technique\nto look for characteristic timescales in the light curves. During the times of\nrapid variability, no evidence for the source to display spectral changes with\nmagnitude was found on either of the timescales. The amplitude of variations\ntends to increase with increasing frequency with a maximum of $\\sim$ 22% seen\nduring flaring states in B band. A mild trend of larger variability amplitude\nas the source brightens was also found. We found the duty cycle of our source\nduring the analyzed period to be $\\sim$ 90%. We also investigated the optical\nspectral energy distribution of S5 0716+714 using B, V, R, and I data points\nfor 21 nights. We briefly discuss physical mechanisms most likely responsible\nfor its flux and spectral variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 06:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

These\nobservations display a mini-flare, a nearly constant flux period and a strong\nflux increase. We performed a time-resolved spectral study of the data, by\ndividing the data into eight segments. We fitted the data with a power-law and\na broken power-law model, and in some of the segments we found a noticeable\nspectral flattening of the source's spectrum below 10 keV. We also performed\ntime-resolved cross-correlation analyses and detected significant hard and soft\nlags (for the first time in a single observation of this source) during the\nfirst and last parts of the observation, respectively. Our analysis of the\nspectra, the variations of photon-index with flux as well as the correlation\nand lags between the harder and softer X-ray bands indicate that both the\nparticle acceleration and synchrotron cooling processes make an important\ncontribution to the emission from this blazar. The hard lags indicate a\nvariable acceleration process. We also estimated the magnetic field value using\nthe soft lags. The value of the magnetic field is consistent with the values\nderived from the broad-band SED modeling of this source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 07:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

The solid is discretised into\npseudo-particles using the meshfree moving least squares method. The particles\ncarry strain and stress tensor variables that are mapped to deformation\nconstraints and constraint forces. The discretised solid model thus fit a\nunified framework for nonsmooth multidomain dynamics for realtime simulations\nincluding strong coupling of rigid multibodies with complex kinematic\nconstraints such as articulation joints, unilateral contacts with dry friction,\ndrivelines and hydraulics. The nonsmooth formulation allow for impulses, due to\nimpacts for instance, to propagate instantly between the rigid multibody and\nthe solid. Plasticity is introduced through an associative perfectly plastic\nmodified Drucker-Prager model. The elastic and plastic dynamics is verified for\nsimple test systems and the capability of simulating tracked terrain vehicles\ndriving on a deformable terrain is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 20:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}
