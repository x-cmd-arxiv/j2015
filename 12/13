Precision/Personalized evidence-based\nmedicine (pEBM) requires theoretical support for decision making and\ninformation management. This study aims to provide the required methodological\nframework. Generalized Resemblance Theory of Evidence mainly rests upon\nGeneralized Theory of Uncertainty which manages information as generalized\nconstraints rather than limited statistical data, and also Prototype\nResemblance Theory of Disease which defines diseases/conditions when there is a\nsimilarity relationship with prototypes (best examples of the disease). The\nproposed theory explains that precisely-personalized structure of evidence is\nformed as a generalized constraint on particular research questions, where the\nconstraining relation deals with averaged effect sizes of studies and its\ncomparison to null hypothesis; which might be of either probabilistic or\npossibilistic nature. Similarity measures were employed to deal with\ncomparisons of high-dimensional characteristics. Real examples of a\nmeta-analysis and its clinical application are provided. This is one of the\nfirst attempts for introducing a framework in medicine, which provides optimal\nbalance between generalizability of formed evidence and homogeneity of studied\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 11:15:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

The low\ndimensionality of the system allows the investigation of a wide range of fluid\nReynolds number Re, magnetic Reynolds number Rm and forcing length scales\nrelative to the domain size that is still prohibited for full three dimensional\nnumerical simulations.

In particular it has been shown that: In a\nnon-helical flow in an infinite domain the critical magnetic Reynolds number\nRmc becomes a constant in the large Re limit. A helical flow always results in\ndynamo in agreement with mean field predictions. For thin layers for both\nhelical and nonhelical flows the Rmc scales as a power-law of Re.

We consider two dust populations for each region: one\nwhose initial size distribution is monodisperse, with monomer radius equal to 1\n$\\mu$m, and another one whose initial size distribution follows the\nMathis-Rumpl-Nordsieck distribution for interstellar dust grains, with an\ninitial range of monomer radii between 0.5 and 10 $\\mu$m. Our Monte Carlo\ncalculations show initial growth of dust aggregates followed by compaction in\nall cases but one, that of aggregates belonging to the initially monodisperse\npopulation subject to gas conditions outside the gap. In this latter case, the\nmass-weighted (MW) average porosity of the population reaches extremely high\nfinal values of 98\\%. The final MW porosities in all other cases range between\n30\\% and 82\\%. The efficiency of compaction is due to high turbulent relative\nspeeds between dust particles. Future studies will need to explore the effect\nof different planet masses and electric charge on grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2015 18:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

However, these\nmodels fail to account for random fluctuations due to demographic and\nenvironmental stochasticity which are experienced by all populations. I review\nsome recent mathematical results about persistence and coexistence for models\naccounting for each of these forms of stochasticity. Demographic stochasticity\nstems from populations and communities consisting of a finite number of\ninteracting individuals, and often are represented by Markovian models with a\ncountable number of states. For closed populations in a bounded world,\nextinction occurs in finite time but may be preceded by long-term transients.\nQuasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) of these Makov models characterize this\nmeta-stable behavior. For sufficiently large \"habitat sizes\", QSDs are shown to\nconcentrate on the positive attractors of deterministic models. Moreover, the\nprobability extinction decreases exponentially with habitat size.\nAlternatively, environmental stochasticity stems from fluctuations in\nenvironmental conditions which influence survival, growth, and reproduction.\nStochastic difference equations can be used to model the effects of\nenvironmental stochasticity on population and community dynamics. For these\nmodels, stochastic persistence corresponds to empirical measures placing\narbitrarily little weight on arbitrarily low population densities. Sufficient\nand necessary conditions for stochastic persistence are reviewed. These\nconditions involve weighted combinations of Lyapunov exponents corresponding to\n\"average\" per-capita growth rates of rare species. The results are illustrated\nwith Bay checkerspot butterflies, coupled sink populations, the storage effect,\nand stochastic rock-paper-scissor communities.

Action recognition tasks usually relies on complex handcrafted\nstructures as features to represent the human action model. Convolutional\nNeural Nets (CNN) have shown to be a powerful tool that eliminate the need for\ndesigning handcrafted features. Usually, the output of the last layer in CNN (a\nlayer before the classification layer -known as fc7) is used as a generic\nfeature for images. In this paper, we show that fc7 features, per se, can not\nget a good performance for the task of action recognition, when the network is\ntrained only on images. We present a feature structure on top of fc7 features,\nwhich can capture the temporal variation in a video. To represent the temporal\ncomponents, which is needed to capture motion information, we introduced a\nhierarchical structure. The hierarchical model enables to capture sub-actions\nfrom a complex action. At the higher levels of the hierarchy, it represents a\ncoarse capture of action sequence and lower levels represent fine action\nelements.

Isothermal, well-mixed systems\ncan be modelled as Markov processes, typically simulated using the Gillespie\nStochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). While easy to implement and exact, the\ncomputational cost of using the Gillespie SSA to simulate such systems can\nbecome prohibitive as the frequency of reaction events increases. This has\nmotivated numerous coarse-grained schemes, where the \"fast\" reactions are\napproximated either using Langevin dynamics or deterministically. While such\napproaches provide a good approximation when all reactants are abundant, the\napproximation breaks down when one or more species exist only in small\nconcentrations and the fluctuations arising from the discrete nature of the\nreactions becomes significant. This is particularly problematic when using such\nmethods to compute statistics of extinction times for chemical species, as well\nas simulating non-equilibrium systems such as cell-cycle models in which a\nsingle species can cycle between abundance and scarcity. In this paper, a\nhybrid jump-diffusion model for simulating well- mixed stochastic kinetics is\nderived. It acts as a bridge between the Gillespie SSA and the chemical\nLangevin equation. For low reactant reactions the underlying behaviour is\npurely discrete, while purely diffusive when the concentrations of all species\nis large, with the two different behaviours coexisting in the intermediate\nregion. A bound on the weak error in the classical large volume scaling limit\nis obtained, and three different numerical discretizations of the\njump-diffusion model are described. The benefits of such a formalism are\nillustrated using computational examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 02:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

This dissertation examines the role of stellar radiation in\ndriving (ablating) material away from these circumstellar disks.\n  A key result is that the observed month to year decay of Classical Be disks\ncan be explained by line-driven ablation without, as previously done, appealing\nto anomalously strong viscous diffusion. Moreover, the higher luminosity of O\nstars leads to ablation of optically thin disks on dynamical timescales of\norder a day, providing a natural explanation for the lack of observed Oe stars.\nIn addition to the destruction of Be disks, this dissertation also introduces a\nmodel for their formation by coupling observationally inferred non-radial\npulsation modes and rapid stellar rotation to launch material into orbiting\nKeplerian disks.\n  In contrast to such Be decretion disks, star-forming accretion disks are much\ndenser and so are generally optically thick to continuum processes. To\ncircumvent the computational challenges associated with radiation hydrodynamics\nthrough optically thick media, we develop an approximate method for treating\ncontinuum absorption in the limit of geometrically thin disks. The comparison\nof ablation with and without continuum absorption shows that accounting for\ndisk optical thickness leads to less than a 50$\\%$ reduction in ablation rate,\nimplying that ablation rate depends mainly on stellar properties like\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 05:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

After reviewing the original construction based on its Hamiltonian\nin the vielbein formalism, we reformulate it in terms of its Lagrangian in both\nthe vielbein and the metric formalisms. It then becomes obvious that, unlike\nprevious attempts in the literature of Lorentz-violating massive gravity, not\nonly the potential but also the kinetic structure of the action is modified\nfrom the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. We confirm\nthat the number of physical degrees of freedom in MTMG is two at fully\nnonlinear level. This proves the absence of various possible pathologies such\nas superluminality, acausality and strong coupling. Afterwards, we discuss the\nphenomenology of MTMG in the presence of a dust fluid. We find that on a flat\nhomogeneous and isotropic background we have two branches. One of them\n(self-accelerating branch) naturally leads to acceleration without the genuine\ncosmological constant or dark energy. For this branch both the scalar and the\nvector modes behave exactly as in general relativity (GR). The phenomenology of\nthis branch differs from GR in the tensor modes sector, as the tensor modes\nacquire a non-zero mass. Hence, MTMG serves as a stable nonlinear completion of\nthe self-accelerating cosmological solution found originally in dRGT theory.\nThe other branch (normal branch) has a dynamics which depends on the\ntime-dependent fiducial metric. For the normal branch, the scalar mode sector,\neven though as in GR only one scalar mode is present (due to the dust fluid),\ndiffers from the one in GR, and, in general, structure formation will follow a\ndifferent phenomenology.

The heaviest path of length l in the\ngraph, simply means a sequence of nodes with edges between them, such that the\nsum of edge weights is maximum among all paths of length l. It is trivial to\nstate the heaviest edge in the graph is the heaviest path of length 1, that\nrepresents a heavy connection between (any) two existing nodes.

The dynamics resulting from changes in the\ntransition frequency is a problem studied since the early days of quantum\nmechanics. It has been of constant interest both experimentally and\ntheoretically since, with the simple two-state model providing an inexhaustible\nsource of novel concepts. When the transition frequency of a quantum system is\nmodulated, several phenomena can be observed, such as\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana interference, motional averaging and\nnarrowing, and the formation of dressed states with the presence of sidebands\nin the spectrum. Adiabatic changes result in the accumulation of geometric\nphases, which can be used to create topological states. In recent years, an\nexquisite experimental control in the time domain was gained through the\nparameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed\nthe state of the system to be monitored non-destructively. These developments\nwere made in the field of quantum devices, especially in superconducting\nqubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases. As a\nresult of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate many of the\nfundamental effects that arise in a quantum system when its transition\nfrequencies are modulated. The purpose of this review is to present some of\nthese developments, from two-state atoms and harmonic oscillators to multilevel\nand many-particle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 09:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 09:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

In this work the bending of trajectories of\nmassive objects in a Schwarzschild spacetime and the corresponding\ngravitational lensing (GL) effects are studied. A particle sphere for\nSchwarzschild black hole (BH) is found with its radius a simple function of the\nparticle velocity and proportional to the BH mass. A single master formula for\nboth the massless and massive particle bending angle is found, in the form of\nan elliptic function depending only on the velocity and impact parameter. This\nbending angle is expanded in both large and small velocity limits and large and\nsmall impact parameter limits. The corresponding deflection angle for weak and\nstrong GL of massive particles are analyzed, and their corrections to the light\nray deflection angles are obtained. The dependence of the deflection angles on\nthe source angle and the particle speed is investigated. Finally we discuss the\npotential applications of the results in hypervelocity star observations and in\ndetermining mass/mass hierarchy of slow particles/objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 11:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2016 14:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-02"}

A common recipe for such\nparameterisations is to invoke down-gradient mixing, or diffusion, of some\ntracer quantity, such as potential vorticity or buoyancy. However, it is well\nknown that eddy fluxes include large rotational components which necessarily do\nnot lead to any mixing; eddy diffusivities diagnosed from unfiltered fluxes are\nthus contaminated by the presence of these rotational components. Here a new\nmethodology is applied whereby eddy diffusivities are diagnosed directly from\nthe eddy force function. The eddy force function depends only upon flux\ndivergences, is independent of any rotational flux components, and is\ninherently non-local and smooth. A one-shot inversion procedure is applied,\nminimising the mis-match between parameterised force functions and force\nfunctions derived from eddy resolving calculations. This enables diffusivities\nassociated with the eddy potential vorticity and buoyancy fluxes to be\ndiagnosed. The methodology is applied to multi-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean\ngyre simulations. It is found that: (i) a strictly down-gradient mixing scheme\nhas limited success in reducing the mis-match compared to one with no sign\nconstraint on the diffusivity; (ii) negative signals of diffusivities are\nprevalent around the time-mean jet; (iii) there is some indication that the\nmagnitude of the diffusivity correlates well the eddy energy. Implications for\nparameterisation are discussed in light of these diagnostic results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 12:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser\ninterference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as\nopposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited\nregime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and\non proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet,\nthese regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design,\nwith the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance. In\nthis paper, we investigate these regimes in terms of collision probability and\nthroughput. We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision\nprobability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under\nslotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a\nnon-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an\ninterference-limited one, depending on the density of the transmitters, density\nand size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and\ntransmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of\nadaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based\nand contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free\nphase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the\ncontention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of\ninterference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks. We\nconclude that, unless proper hybrid schemes are investigated, the severity of\nthe transitional behavior may significantly reduce throughput/delay performance\nof mmWave networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 14:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

One can thus conceive the space-time manifold as a purely\ntheoretical arena, where quantum states are defined, with the additional\nfreedom of changing coordinates like any other symmetry. Observables, including\npositions and distances, should then be described by suitable operators acting\non such quantum states. In principle, the top-down (canonical) quantisation of\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity falls right into this picture, but is notoriously very\ninvolved. The complication stems from allowing all the classical canonical\nvariables that appear in the (presumably) fundamental action to become quantum\nobservables acting on the \"superspace\" of all metrics, regardless of whether\nthey play any role in the description of a specific physical system. On can\ninstead revisit the more humble \"minisuperspace\" approach and choose the\ngravitational observables not simply by imposing some symmetry, but motivated\nby their proven relevance in the (classical) description of a given system. In\nparticular, this review focuses on compact, spherically symmetric, quantum\nmechanical sources, in order to determine the probability they are black holes\nrather than regular particles. The gravitational radius is therefore lifted to\nthe status of a quantum mechanical operator acting on the \"horizon\nwave-function\", the latter being determined by the quantum state of the source.\nThis formalism is then applied to several sources with a mass around the\nfundamental scale, which are viewed as natural candidates of quantum black\nholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 15:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

A gauge field formalism, where the SOC is expressed as a\nnon-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field is used. A new practical approach, based on the\nphysical argument that upon confining the particle to the surface by a\npotential, then it is the physical Hermitian momentum operator transverse to\nthe surface, rather than just the derivative with respect to the transverse\ncoordinate that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian.Doing so, it is shown\nthat the Hermitian Hamiltonian for SOC is obtained with the geometric potential\nand the geometric kinetic energy terms emerging naturally. The geometric\npotential is shown to represent a coupling between the transverse component of\nthe gauge field and the mean curvature of the surface that replaces the\ncoupling between the transverse momentum and the gauge field. The most general\nHermitian Hamiltonian with linear SOC on a general surface embedded in any 3D\nOCC system is reported. Explicit plug-and-play formulae for this Hamiltonian on\nthe surfaces of a cylinder, a sphere and a torus are given. The formalism is\napplied to the Rashba SOC in three dimensions (3D RSOC) and the explicit\nexpressions for the surface Hamiltonians on these three geometries are worked\nout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 13:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The simulations, based on actual data gathered\nfrom contacts with rangers and parks administrators, field samplings and\npublished material, provide useful information on the behavior of the\nvegetation-wild herbivores interactions and the possible medium-long term\nevolution of these ecosystems. At the same time they show that these ecosystems\nare in a very delicate situation, for which the animal populations could become\nextinguished in case of adverse environmental conditions.

A major obstacle to extracting useful information\nfrom this data is the problem of name disambiguation: linking alternate\nspellings of individuals or institutions to a single identifier to uniquely\ndetermine the parties involved in the creation of a technology. In this paper,\nwe describe a new algorithm that uses high-resolution geolocation to\ndisambiguate both inventor and assignees on more than 3.6 million patents found\nin the European Patent Office (EPO), under the Patent Cooperation treaty (PCT),\nand in the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We show that our algorithm\nhas both high precision and recall in comparison to a manual disambiguation of\nEPO assignee names in Boston and Paris, and show it performs well for a\nbenchmark of USPTO inventor names that can be linked to a high-resolution\naddress (but poorly for inventors that never provided a high quality address).\nThe most significant benefit of this work is the high quality assignee\ndisambiguation with worldwide coverage coupled with an inventor disambiguation\nthat is competitive with other state of the art approaches. To our knowledge\nthis is the broadest and most accurate simultaneous disambiguation and\ncross-linking of the inventor and assignee names for a significant fraction of\npatents in these three major patent collections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 14:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-11"}
