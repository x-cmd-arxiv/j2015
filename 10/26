The underlying supersymmetric particle physics model\npossesses, for the chosen values of the parameters, practically two\ninflationary paths, the trivial and the semi-shifted one. The trivial path is\nstabilized by supergravity and supports a first stage of inflation with a\nlimited number of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio can become appreciable\nwith the scalar spectral index remaining acceptable, as a result of the\ncompetition between the relatively mild supergravity and the strong radiative\ncorrections to the inflationary potential.

Then, we introduce a\nnon-traditional stack run encoding scheme with 5 symbols for detecting\ntransition states as well as to encode MT experimental data. The peak detection\nis carried out in the wavelet domain to effectively detect these three\ntransition states. One of the added advantages of including peak information\nwhile encoding being that it enables to detect the peaks efficiently and\nencodes them simultaneously in the wavelet domain without having the need to do\nfurther processing after the decoding stage. Experimental results show that\nusing this form of non-traditional stack run encoding has better compression\nand reconstruction performance as opposed to traditional stack run encoding and\nrun length encoding schemes. Parameters for MTs modeled in the three states are\nestimated and is shown to closely approximate original MT data for lower\ncompression rates. As the compression rate increases, we may end up throwing\naway details that are required to detect transition states of MTs.

Theory suggests, generalist\npredators are poor agents for biological control, primarily due to mutual\ninterference. However field evidence shows they are actually quite effective in\nregulating pest densities. In this work we provide a plausible answer to this\nparadox. We analyze a three species model, where a generalist top predator is\nintroduced into an ecosystem as a biological control, to check the population\nof a middle predator, that in turn is depredating on a prey species. We show\nthat the inclusion of predator interference alone, can cause the solution of\nthe top predator equation to blow-up in finite time, while there is global\nexistence in the no interference case. This result shows that interference\ncould actually cause a population explosion of the top predator, enabling it to\ncontrol the target species, thus corroborating recent field evidence. Our\nresults might also partially explain the population explosion of certain\nspecies, introduced originally for biological control purposes, such as the\ncane toad (\\emph{Bufo marinus}) in Australia, which now functions as a\ngeneralist top predator.

To extract more of the information\nprovided by LCDM distances, we perform pooling and censoring of LCDM distances.\nIn particular, we employ Brown-Forsythe (BF) test of homogeneity of variance\n(HOV) on the LCDM distances. HOV analysis of pooled distances provides an\noverall analysis of morphometric variability of the LCDMs due to the disease in\nquestion, while the HOV analysis of censored distances suggests the location(s)\nof significant variation in these differences (i.e., at which distance from the\nGM/WM surface the morphometric variability starts to be significant). We also\ncheck for the influence of assumption violations on the HOV analysis of LCDM\ndistances. In particular, we demonstrate that BF HOV test is robust to\nassumption violations such as the non-normality and within sample dependence of\nthe residuals from the median for pooled and censored distances and are robust\nto data aggregation which occurs in analysis of censored distances. We\nillustrate the methodology on a real data example, namely, LCDM distances of GM\nvoxels in ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) to see the effects of\ndepression or being of high risk to depression on the morphometry of VMPFCs.\nThe methodology used here is also valid for morphometric analysis of other\ncortical structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 20:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

This\ndataset is used to evaluate temporal occlusion boundaries and provides a much\nneeded baseline for future studies. We perform experiments to demonstrate the\nrole of scene layout, and temporal information for occlusion reasoning in\ndynamic scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 23:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Manipulating phonons using such nonreciprocal\ndevices may have a range of applications such as phonon diodes, transistors,\nswitches, etc. One way of achieving nonreciprocal phononic devices is to use\nmaterials with strong nonlinear response to phonons. However, it is not easy to\nobtain the required strong mechanical nonlinearity, especially for few-phonon\nsituations. Here, we present a general mechanism to amplify nonlinearity using\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric structures, and show that an on-chip micro-scale\nphonon diode can be fabricated using a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mechanical\nsystem, in which a lossy mechanical-resonator with very weak mechanical\nnonlinearity is coupled to a mechanical resonator with mechanical gain but no\nmechanical nonlinearity. When this coupled system transits from the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime to the broken-$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime,\nthe mechanical nonlinearity is transferred from the lossy resonator to the one\nwith gain, and the effective nonlinearity of the system is significantly\nenhanced. This enhanced mechanical nonlinearity is almost lossless because of\nthe gain-loss balance induced by the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric structure. Such\nan enhanced lossless mechanical nonlinearity is then used to control the\ndirection of phonon propagation, and can greatly decrease (by over three orders\nof magnitude) the threshold of the input-field intensity necessary to observe\nthe unidirectional phonon transport. We propose an experimentally realizable\nlossless low-threshold phonon diode of this type. Our study opens up new\nperspectives for constructing on-chip few-phonon devices and hybrid\nphonon-photon components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 01:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

In the classical setting,\ntwo honest parties (Alice and Bob) use public discussion and local randomness\nto distill secret key from some distribution $p_{XYZ}$ that is shared with an\nunwanted eavesdropper (Eve). In the quantum settings, the correlations\n$p_{XYZ}$ are delivered to the parties as either an \\textit{incoherent} mixture\nof orthogonal quantum states or as \\textit{coherent} superposition of such\nstates; in both cases, Alice and Bob use public discussion and local quantum\noperations to distill secret key. While the power of quantum mechanics\nincreases Alice and Bob's ability to generate shared randomness, it also equips\nEve with a greater arsenal of eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, it is not\nobvious who gains the greatest advantage for distilling secret key when\nreplacing a classical source with a quantum one.\n  In this paper we first demonstrate that the classical key rate is equivalent\nto the quantum key rate when the correlations are generated incoherently in the\nquantum setting. For coherent sources, we next show that the rates are\nincomparable, and in fact, their difference can be arbitrarily large in either\ndirection. However, we identify a large class of non-trivial distributions\n$p_{XYZ}$ that possess the following properties: (i) Eve's advantage is always\ngreater in the quantum source than in its classical counterpart, and (ii) for\nthe quantum entanglement shared between Alice and Bob in the coherent source,\nthe so-called entanglement cost/squashed entanglement/relative entropy of\nentanglement can all be computed. With property (ii), we thus present a rare\ninstance in which the various entropic entanglement measures of a quantum state\ncan be explicitly calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 01:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

Thus it is desirable to consider the uncertain\nprior distribution, which is expressed as the mixture of a one-point\ndistribution and a proper prior distribution. In this paper, we develop an\nempirical Bayes approach for estimating area-level means, using the uncertain\nprior distribution in the context of a natural exponential family, which we\ncall the empirical uncertain Bayes (EUB) method. The regression model\nconsidered in this paper includes the Poisson-gamma and the binomial-beta, and\nthe normal-normal (Fay-Herriot) model, which are typically used in small area\nestimation.

For risk evaluation of the EUB\nestimator, we derive a second-order unbiased estimator of a conditional mean\nsquared error by using some techniques of numerical calculation.

In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on\nion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are\nreleased from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal.\nExploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying\nmodulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal,\ni.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is\nderived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a\nclosed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is\nobtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released\nmolecules regardless of this assumption.

Our methods\nare even more general. They can be used to shift a Hamiltonian's density of\nstates away from the ground state, so that fewer states occupy the low-lying\nenergies near the minimum, hence allowing for faster adiabatic passages to find\nthe ground state with less risk of getting caught in an undesired low-lying\nexcited state during the passage. Even more generally, our methods can be used\nto transform a discrete optimization problem into a new one whose unique\nminimum still encodes the desired answer, but with the objective function's\nvalues forming a different landscape. Aspects of the landscape such as the\nobjective function's range, or the values of certain coefficients, or how many\ndifferent inputs lead to a given output value, can be decreased *or* increased.\nOne of the many examples for which these methods are useful is in finding the\nground state of a Hamiltonian using NMR: If it is difficult to find a molecule\nsuch that the distances between the spins match the interactions in the\nHamiltonian, the interactions in the Hamiltonian can be changed without at all\nchanging the ground state.

This behaviour contradicts standard\nastrophysical mechanisms, in which positrons are secondary particles, produced\nin the interactions of primary cosmic rays during the propagation in the\ninterstellar medium. The observed anomaly in the positron fraction triggered a\nlot of excitement, as it could be interpreted as an indirect signature of the\npresence of dark matter species in the Galaxy. Alternatively, it could be\nproduced by nearby astrophysical sources, such as pulsars. Both hypotheses are\nprobed in this work in light of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction\nmeasurements. The transport of primary and secondary positrons in the Galaxy is\ndescribed using a semi-analytic two-zone model. MicrOMEGAs is used to model the\npositron flux generated by dark matter species.

These local features can be aggregated\nusing aggregation approaches developed for local features (e.g. Fisher\nvectors), thus providing new powerful global descriptors.\n  In this paper we investigate possible ways to aggregate local deep features\nto produce compact global descriptors for image retrieval. First, we show that\ndeep features and traditional hand-engineered features have quite different\ndistributions of pairwise similarities, hence existing aggregation methods have\nto be carefully re-evaluated. Such re-evaluation reveals that in contrast to\nshallow features, the simple aggregation method based on sum pooling provides\narguably the best performance for deep convolutional features. This method is\nefficient, has few parameters, and bears little risk of overfitting when e.g.\nlearning the PCA matrix. Overall, the new compact global descriptor improves\nthe state-of-the-art on four common benchmarks considerably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 14:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

To improve throughput and to\nreduce decoding latency of polar decoders, maximum likelihood (ML) decoding\nunits are used by successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders as well as\nsuccessive cancellation (SC) decoders. This paper proposes an approximate ML\n(AML) decoding unit for SCL decoders first. In particular, we investigate the\ndistribution of frozen bits of polar codes designed for both the binary erasure\nand additive white Gaussian noise channels, and take advantage of the\ndistribution to reduce the complexity of the AML decoding unit, improving the\narea efficiency of SCL decoders. Furthermore, a multi-mode SCL decoder with\nvariable list sizes and parallelism is proposed. If high throughput or small\nlatency is required, the decoder decodes multiple received codewords in\nparallel with a small list size. However, if error performance is of higher\npriority, the multi-mode decoder switches to a serial mode with a bigger list\nsize. Therefore, the multi-mode SCL decoder provides a flexible tradeoff\nbetween latency, throughput and error performance, and adapts to different\nthroughput and latency requirements at the expense of small overhead. Hardware\nimplementation and synthesis results show that our polar decoders not only have\na better area efficiency but also easily adapt to different communication\nchannels and applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 15:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

The proposed algorithm utilizes the Rayleigh-Ritz\nprocedure to compute all eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors lying\nwithin a given contour in the complex plane. The main novelties are the\nfollowing. First and foremost, the approximate eigenspace is constructed by\nusing the values of the resolvent at a series of sampling points on the\ncontour, which effectively circumvented the unreliability of previous schemes\nthat using high-order contour moments of the resolvent. Secondly, an improved\nSakurai-Sugiura algorithm is proposed to solve the projected NEPs with\nenhancements on reliability and accuracy. The user-defined probing matrix in\nthe original algorithm is avoided and the number of eigenvalues is determined\nautomatically by provided strategies. Finally, by approximating the projected\nmatrices with the Chebyshev interpolation technique, RSRR is further extended\nto solve NEPs in the boundary element method, which is typically difficult due\nto the densely populated matrices and high computational costs. The good\nperformance of RSRR is demonstrated by a variety of benchmark examples and\nlarge-scale practical applications, with the degrees of freedom ranging from\nseveral hundred up to around one million.

Then we\nconcentrate on a particular BSM scenario, namely, the two Higgs-doublet models\n(2HDMs).

Existing\ntechniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1\nminute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per\nmonth, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new\ntechnique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring'\nhomes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The\nkey intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy\nconsumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home\nwith a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e.\npower meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist.\nThen, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to\nbe the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes\nand results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend\non manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show\nthat Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy disaggregating fridge\nand heating/cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM.\nFurthermore, it achieves up to 64% accuracy on washing machine, dryer,\ndishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported\nresults. Many existing techniques are not able to disaggregate these loads at\nall. These results indicate a potentially substantial advantage to installing\nsubmetering infrastructure in a select few homes rather than installing new\nhigh-frequency smart metering infrastructure in all homes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 07:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}
