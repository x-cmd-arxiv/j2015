Flow distances (first-passage or total) between any\ngiven two nodes $i$ and $j$ are defined as the average number of transition\nsteps of a random walker along the network from $i$ to $j$ under some\nconditions.

Flow distances are explicitly expressed by underlying Markov matrix of\na flow system in this paper. With this novel theoretical conception, we can\nvisualize open flow networks, calculating centrality of each node, and\nclustering nodes into groups. We apply flow distances to two kinds of empirical\nopen flow networks, including energetic food webs and economic input-output\nnetwork.

In\ninput-output network, we rank sectors according to their average distances away\nother sectors, and cluster sectors into different groups.

We calculate the\nweak localization correction to the Casimir force as a function of magnetic\nfield and temperature and demonstrate that the quantum interference suppression\nof the Casimir force is a strong, observable effect. The coexistence of weak\nlocalization suppression in electronic transport and Casimir pressure would\nlend credence to the Drude theory of the Casimir effect, while the lack of such\ncorrelation would indicate a fundamental problem with the existing theory.

The patterns of vocal elements in\nbirdsong are a prime example. The encoding of such rules in neural circuits is\npoorly understood. Here we locate the site of song syntax in the Bengalese\nfinch by rapidly and reversibly manipulating the temperature in the song\nproduction pathway. Changing the temperature in the premotor nucleus HVC\n(proper name) alters the transition probabilities between syllables. Most\nprominently, cooling reduces the number of repetitions of long repeated\nsyllables, while heating increases repetition. In contrast, changing the\ntemperature of the downstream motor area RA (robust nucleus of the\nacropallium), which is critical for singing, does not affect the song syntax.\nComputational modeling suggests that temperature can alter the transition\nprobabilities by affecting the efficacy of the synapses in HVC that carry\nauditory feedback to the motor circuits. The model is supported by a real-time\ndistorted auditory feedback experiment, which shows that perturbing auditory\nfeedback shortens syllable repeats similar to cooling HVC.

Without further\nconstraints, BIPs are usually ill-posed. In practice, properties of natural\nsignals are exploited to solve BIPs. For example, subspace constraints or\nsparsity constraints are imposed to reduce the search space. These approaches\nhave shown some success in practice. However, there are few results on\nuniqueness in BIPs. For most BIPs, the fundamental question of under what\ncondition the problem admits a unique solution, is yet to be answered. For\nexample, blind gain and phase calibration (BGPC) is a structured bilinear\ninverse problem, which arises in many applications, including inverse rendering\nin computational relighting (albedo estimation with unknown lighting), blind\nphase and gain calibration in sensor array processing, and multichannel blind\ndeconvolution (MBD). It is interesting to study the uniqueness of such\nproblems.\n  In this paper, we define identifiability of a BIP up to a group of\ntransformations. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such\nidentifiability, i.e., the conditions under which the solutions can be uniquely\ndetermined up to the transformation group. Applying these results to BGPC, we\nderive sufficient conditions for unique recovery under several scenarios,\nincluding subspace, joint sparsity, and sparsity models. For BGPC with joint\nsparsity or sparsity constraints, we develop a procedure to compute the\nrelevant transformation groups.

As a result of this competition, the microscopic order parameter,\nthat is firmly identified to be the local field estimated from the ionic\npolarization at the sub-unit level (one half of the unit cell), shows a strong\ntemperature as well as chemical doping dependence. While the out-of-plane\nionicity is responsible for the interlayer charge transfer (electrons) that\nreduces it leading to IMT, the in-plane covalency is responsible for the\nin-plane intersite transfer of charge (holes) that increases the ionicity and\nleads to MST. This interplay of charge transfer, driven by the out-of-plane\nionicity and the in-plane covalency, leads at the critical temperature Tc to a\nlocal field avalanche (ionic polarization catastrophe at the sub-unit cell\nlevel) that triggers an out-of-plane correlation between the local polarization\nfields at the unit cell and drives the compound into the superconducting state.\nThe asymmetry of the free charge carrier density breaks locally the inversion\nsymmetry of the order parameter leading to an unconventional pairing mechanism\ncharacterized by the CPT transformation where C is the charge conjugation\nsymmetry, P is the parity symmetry and T is the time reversal symmetry.

Here, we use the\nchemical master equation to model the kinetics of a single fluctuating enzyme\nthat can yield a product through either parallel or off-pathway mechanisms. An\nexact expression is obtained for the turnover time distribution from which the\nmean turnover time and randomness parameters are calculated.

In this problem we\nreceive a sequence of requests for a service at nodes in a metric space and a\ntime window for each request. The goal of the online algorithm is to maximize\nthe number of requests served during their time window. The time to traverse an\nedge is the distance between the incident nodes of that edge. Serving a request\nrequires unit time. We characterize the competitive ratio for each metric space\nseparately. The competitive ratio depends on the relation between the minimum\nlaxity (the minimum length of a time window) and the diameter of the metric\nspace.

I adopt the\nconception of duality as 'isomorphism', cashing it out in terms of three\nconditions. These three conditions prompt two conceptually different ways in\nwhich a duality can be modified to make room for emergence; and I argue that\nthis exhausts the possibilities for combining dualities and emergence (via\ncoarse-graining).\n  I apply this framework to gauge/gravity dualities, considering in detail\nthree examples: AdS/CFT, Verlinde's scheme, and black holes. My main point\nabout gauge/gravity dualities is that the theories involved, qua theories of\ngravity, must be background-independent. I distinguish two senses of\nbackground-independence: (i) minimalistic and (ii) extended. The former is\nsufficiently strong to allow for a consistent theory of quantum gravity; and\nAdS/CFT is background-independent on this account; while Verlinde's scheme best\nfits the extended sense. I argue that this extended sense should be applied\nwith some caution: on pain of throwing the baby (general relativity) out with\nthe bath-water (extended background-independence). Nevertheless, it is an\ninteresting and potentially fruitful heuristic principle for quantum gravity\ntheory construction. The interpretation of dualities is articulated in terms\nof: (i) epistemic and metaphysical commitments; (ii) parts vs. wholes.\n  I then analyse the emergence of gravity in gauge/gravity dualities in terms\nof the two available conceptualisations of emergence; and I show how emergence\nin AdS/CFT and in Verlinde's scenario differ from each other.

The results, obtained for \\textit{k} ranging from 2 to 64,\nrevealed that (i) in the case of dimers ($k=2$), the jamming coverage is\n$\\theta_j=0.918388(16)$.

The findings indicate that ${\\cal P}^*$ may be a\nmixture.

In [1] the fitness of a colony of\ncells is considered in terms of its two basic components, viability and\nfecundity. Intrinsic trade-off function of each cell defines a type of cell. We\nelaborate models providing in [1]. Assuming that all intrinsic trade-off\nfunctions are linear, we construct a model with different cell types and show\nthat the differentiation of these types tends to full specialization. In\naddition, we attempt to consider the fact that environmental factors influence\non the fitness of the colony. Thus, we introduce an energy restriction to the\nmodel and show that in optimum we get situations in which there exists a set of\nstates, each of them allowing colony to achieve the same maximum level of\nfitness. In some states arbitrary chosen cell may be specialized, in some -\nunspecialized, but fecundity and viability of each cell belong to limited\nranges (which are unique for each cell).

Here we develop non-robust models\nprovided in [1] and attempt to get robust models investigated how\ndifferentiation of types and energy constraints influence on the optimal\nbehavior of colonies with different size. Constructed models show that each\nlarge-sized colony with high initial costs of reproduction tends to full\nspecialization, no matter are all cells in this colony identical or are there\ncells with different types in this colony. The level of type's diversity\ndetermines the number of cells specialized in soma. In small - sized colonies\nwith low initial costs of reproduction, when type's diversity is week, an\nunspecialized state may bring colony some benefits. However, these benefits may\nbe only local and in optimum in the colony some cells would be specialized,\nothers - unspecialized. The amount of specialized cells in small - sized colony\ndepends on the level of type's diversity in this colony. Adding energy\nconstraint, we may receive robust models even in convex case. In optimum, the\ncolony with different types of cells and energy restriction may be indifferent\nbetween some optimal patterns of states. Arbitrary chosen cell may be soma or\ngerm in some states or may be unspecialized in other. Moreover, in each optimal\nstate levels of fecundity and viability of each cell lie in limited ranges.\nThis result reflects the fact that some cell in the colony may lose the\npotential ability to achieve, for example, high level of fecundity, but does\nnot lose the possibility to perform a reproductive function at all. It means\nthat provided model can describe organisms, which represents the intermediate\nbetween unspecialized colonies and full-specialized multicellular organisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 23:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}
