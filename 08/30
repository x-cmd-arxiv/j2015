A major shortcoming of the VAR that has hindered its applicability\nis its heavy parameterization: the parameter space grows quadratically with the\nnumber of series included, quickly exhausting the available degrees of freedom.\nConsequently, forecasting using VARs is intractable for low-frequency,\nhigh-dimensional macroeconomic data. However, empirical evidence suggests that\nVARs that incorporate more component series tend to result in more accurate\nforecasts. Conventional methods that allow for the estimation of large VARs\neither tend to require ad hoc subjective specifications or are computationally\ninfeasible. Moreover, as global economies become more intricately intertwined,\nthere has been substantial interest in incorporating the impact of stochastic,\nunmodeled exogenous variables. Vector autoregression with exogenous variables\n(VARX) extends the VAR to allow for the inclusion of unmodeled variables, but\nit similarly faces dimensionality challenges.\n  We introduce the VARX-L framework, a structured family of VARX models, and\nprovide methodology that allows for both efficient estimation and accurate\nforecasting in high-dimensional analysis. VARX-L adapts several prominent\nscalar regression regularization techniques to a vector time series context in\norder to greatly reduce the parameter space of VAR and VARX models. We also\nhighlight a compelling extension that allows for shrinking toward reference\nmodels, such as a vector random walk.

The system covers the\nHubbard model with a nearest-neighbor hopping term, on-site interactions,\nexponentially decaying density-density interactions and exponentially decaying\nspin-spin interactions.

The flux configuration and the sign of the\nnearest-neighbor density-density/spin-spin interactions can be adjusted so that\nthe free energy density is minimum among all the flux configurations.\nConsequently, the minimum free energy density is proved to converge to an\nanalytic function of the coupling constants in the infinite-volume,\nzero-temperature limit.

Based on the obtained formula on\nthe number of length-n codewords for a given UW, the per-letter average\ncodeword length of UDOOC for the optimal compression of a given source\nstatistics can be computed. Several upper bounds on the average codeword length\nof such UDOOCs are next established. The analysis on the bounds of average\ncodeword length then leads to two asymptotic bounds for sources having\ninfinitely many alphabets, one of which is achievable and hence tight for a\ncertain source statistics and UW, and the other of which proves the\nachievability of source entropy rate of UDOOCs when both the block size of\nsource letters for UDOOC compression and UW length go to infinity. Efficient\nencoding and decoding algorithms for UDOOCs are also given in this paper.\nNumerical results show that the proposed UDOOCs can potentially result in\ncomparable compression rate to the Huffman code under similar decoding\ncomplexity and yield a smaller average codeword length than that of the\nLempel-Ziv code, thereby confirming the practicability of UDOOCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2015 12:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

Unfortunately, the fundamental gap is not generally equal to the\nKohn-Sham gap of density functional theory (DFT), even in principle. The two\ngaps differ precisely by the derivative discontinuity, namely, an abrupt change\nin slope of the exchange-correlation (xc) energy as a function of electron\nnumber, expected across an integer-electron point. Popular approximate\nfunctionals are thought to be devoid of a derivative discontinuity, strongly\ncompromising their performance for prediction of spectroscopic properties. Here\nwe show that, in fact, all exchange-correlation functionals possess a\nderivative discontinuity, which arises naturally from the application of\nensemble considerations within DFT, without any empiricism. This derivative\ndiscontinuity can be expressed in closed form using only quantities obtained in\nthe course of a standard DFT calculation of the neutral system. For small,\nfinite systems, addition of this derivative discontinuity indeed results in a\ngreatly improved prediction for the fundamental gap, even when based on the\nmost simple approximate exchange-correlation density functional - the local\ndensity approximation (LDA).

One is faced with the task of\ncalculating the evolution of a reduced density matrix, where successively less\nenergetic (jet) regions are integrated out, to gain control of the calculation.\nI relate the decay rates governing the flow into the IR to an effective field\ntheory expansion in soft jets, allowing a systematic and resummed calculation\nof these rates, while further relating them to physically observable features\nof the QCD cascade. To demonstrate the utility of the soft jet expansion, I\npresent a factorization theorem for a soft subjet collinearly splitting in and\nout of a parent fat jet.

And we confine ourselves in the Hermite\ncase and the three distinct eigenvalues are $-a,0,a$. For the case $a^2>3$, we\nestablish the universal behavior of local eigenvalue correlations in the limit\n$n\\rightarrow \\infty$, which is known from unitarily invariant random matrix\nmodels. Thus, local eigenvalue correlations are expressed in terms of the sine\nkernel in the bulk and in terms of the Airy kernel at the edge of the spectrum.\nThe result can be obtained by analyzing $4\\times 4$ Riemann-Hilbert problem via\nnonlinear steepest decent method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2015 11:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

We have developed the theory for a quantitative\nunderstanding and analysis of modulations in ionic current that arise from\nrotational dynamics of single proteins as they move through the electric field\ninside a nanopore. The resulting multi-parametric information raises the\npossibility to characterize, identify, and quantify individual proteins and\nprotein complexes in a mixture. This approach interrogates single proteins in\nsolution and determines parameters such as the approximate shape and dipole\nmoment, which are excellent protein descriptors and cannot be obtained\notherwise from single protein molecules in solution. Taken together, this\nfive-dimensional characterization of biomolecules at the single particle level\nhas the potential for instantaneous protein identification, quantification, and\npossibly sorting with implications for structural biology, proteomics,\nbiomarker detection, and routine protein analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 20:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}
