From an observational point of view, we perform a height-dependent\nstudy of RPWs, compare their wave characteristics and aim to track down these\nso far only chromospherically observed phenomena to photospheric layers to\nprove the upward propagating field-guided nature of RPWs.

Those continuous\noscillations occur preferably at periods between 4-6\\,min starting at the inner\npenumbral boundary. The photospheric oscillations all have a slightly delayed,\nmore defined chromospheric counterpart with larger relative velocities (which\nare linked to preceding UF events). In all layers the power of RPWs follows a\nfilamentary fine-structure and shows a typical ring-shaped power distribution\nincreasing in radius for larger wave periods. The analysis of time-slices\nreveals apparent horizontal velocities for RPWs at photospheric layers of\n$\\approx50\\,\\rm{km/s}$ which decrease to $\\approx30\\,\\rm{km/s}$ at\nchromospheric heights.

As\nour first contribution, we differentiate between three types of reference set.\nFirst, we introduce the notion of unary reference set (URS) corresponding to a\ngiven projection of an evaluated DMU. The URS includes efficient DMUs that are\nactive in a specific convex combination producing the projection. Because of\nthe occurrence of multiple URSs, we introduce the notion of maximal reference\nset (MRS) and define it as the union of all the URSs associated with the given\nprojection. Since multiple projections may occur in non-radial DEA models, we\nfurther define the union of the MRSs associated with all the projections as\nunique global reference set (GRS) of the evaluated DMU. As the second\ncontribution, we propose and substantiate a general linear programming (LP)\nbased approach to identify the GRS. Since our approach makes the identification\nthrough the execution of a single primal-based LP model, it is computationally\nmore efficient than the existing methods for its easy implementation in\npractical applications. Our last contribution is to measure returns to scale\nusing a non-radial DEA model. This method effectively deals with the occurrence\nof multiple supporting hyperplanes arising either from multiplicity of\nprojections or from non-full dimensionality of minimum face. Finally, an\nempirical analysis is conducted based on a real-life data set to demonstrate\nthe ready applicability of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 16:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Using\nparticle diagrams and the attendant methodology including loop counting it\nbecomes possible to calculate the fourth, sixth and eighth moments of embedded\nensembles in a straightforward way. The method, which will be called the method\nof particle diagrams, proves useful firstly by providing a means of classifying\nthe components of moments into particle paths, or loops, and secondly by giving\na simple algorithm for calculating the magnitude of combinatorial expressions\nprior to calculating them explicitly. By confining calculations to the limit\ncase $m \\ll l\\to\\infty$ this in many cases provides a sufficient excuse not to\ncalculate certain terms at all, since it can be foretold using the method of\nparticle diagrams that they will not survive in this asymptotic regime.\nApplying the method of particle diagrams washes out a great deal of the\ncomplexity intrinsic to the problem, with sufficient mathematical structure\nremaining to yield limiting statistics for the unified phase space of random\nmatrix theories.\n  Finally, since the unified form of random matrix theory is essentially the\nset of all randomised k-body potentials, it should be no surprise that the\nearly statistics calculated for the unified random matrix theories in some\ninstances resemble the statistics currently being discovered for quantum spin\nhypergraphs and other randomised potentials on graphs [HMH05,ES14,KLW14].

Although the exact mechanism of the spin-down is\na question of debate in detail, the commonly accepted view is that it arises\nthrough emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) from a rotating magnetized\nbody. Other processes, including the emission of gravitational radiation, and\nof relativistic particles (pulsar wind), are also being considered. The\ncalculated energy loss by a rotating pulsar with a constant moment of inertia\nis assumed proportional to a model dependent power of $\\Omega$. This relation\nleads to the power law $\\dot{\\Omega}$ = -K $\\Omega^{\\rm n}$ where $n$ is called\nthe braking index. The MDR model predicts $n$ exactly equal to 3. Selected\nobservations of isolated pulsars provide rather precise values of $n$,\nindividually accurate to a few percent or better, in the range 1$ <$ n $ < $\n2.8, which is consistently less than the predictions of the MDR model. In spite\nof an extensive investigation of various modifications of the MDR model, no\nsatisfactory explanation of observation has been found as yet.\n  We employ four physically realistic equations of state, and two computational\ncodes, to model the dynamical effects of rotation on the braking index in the\nMDR model.

A previously\nestablished agent-based model that includes innate and adaptive immunity was\nused to simulate malaria infections and transmission.

Therefore, it is important to\nunderstand the dynamic properties of blast forces on brain cells, including the\nendothelial cells that maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which regulates\nthe passage of nutrients into the brain and protects it from toxins in the\nblood. To better understand the effect of shock waves on the BBB we have\ninvestigated an {\\em in vitro} model in which BBB endothelial cells are grown\nin transwell vessels and exposed in a shock tube, confirming that BBB integrity\nis directly related to shock wave intensity. It is difficult to directly\nmeasure the forces acting on these cells in the transwell container during the\nexperiments, and so a computational tool has been developed and presented in\nthis paper.\n  Two-dimensional axisymmetric Euler equations with the Tammann equation of\nstate were used to model the transwell materials, and a high-resolution finite\nvolume method based on Riemann solvers and the Clawpack software was used to\nsolve these equations in a mixed Eulerian/Lagrangian frame. Results indicated\nthat the geometry of the transwell plays a significant role in the observed\npressure time series in these experiments. We also found that pressures can\nfall below vapor pressure due to the interaction of reflecting and diffracting\nshock waves, suggesting that cavitation bubbles could be a damage mechanism.\nComputations that include a simulated hydrophone inserted in the transwell\nsuggest that the instrument itself could significantly alter blast wave\nproperties. These findings illustrate the need for further computational\nmodeling studies aimed at understanding possible blast-induced BBB damage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 18:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 21:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

In\nsuch protocols, when an agent $a$ of type (species) $i$ interacts with an agent\n$b$ of type (species) $j$ with $a$ as the initiator, then $b$'s type becomes\n$i$ with probability $P\\_{ij}$. In such an interaction, we think of $a$ as the\npredator, $b$ as the prey, and the type of the prey is either converted to that\nof the predator or stays as is. Such protocols capture the dynamics of some\nopinion spreading models and generalize the well-known Rock-Paper-Scissors\ndiscrete dynamics. We consider the pairwise interactions among agents that are\nscheduled uniformly at random. We start by considering the convergence time and\nshow that any Lotka-Volterra-type protocol on an $n$-agent population converges\nto some absorbing state in time polynomial in $n$, w.h.p., when any pair of\nagents is allowed to interact. By contrast, when the interaction graph is a\nstar, even the Rock-Paper-Scissors protocol requires exponential time to\nconverge.

For CE\nprecoding in a single-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel, a\ndesired constellation is feasible at the receiver if and only if it can be\nscaled to lie in an annulus, whose boundaries are characterized by the\ninstantaneous channel realization. Therefore, if a fixed receiver constellation\nis used for CE precoding in a fading channel, where the annulus is\ntime-varying, there is in general a non-zero probability of encountering a\nchannel that makes CE precoding infeasible, thereby causing a high probability\nof error. To tackle this problem, this paper studies the adaptive receiver\nconstellation design for CE precoding in a single-user MISO flat-fading channel\nwith an arbitrary number of antennas at the transmitter. We first investigate\nthe fixed-rate adaptive receiver constellation design to minimize the symbol\nerror rate (SER). Specifically, an efficient algorithm is proposed to find the\noptimal amplitude-and-phase shift keying (APSK) constellation with two rings\nthat is both feasible and of the maximum minimum Euclidean distance (MED), for\nany given constellation size and instantaneous channel realization. Numerical\nresults show that by using the optimized fixed-rate adaptive receiver\nconstellation, our proposed scheme achieves significantly improved SER\nperformance over CE precoding with a fixed receiver constellation. Furthermore,\nbased on the family of optimal fixed-rate adaptive two-ring APSK constellation\nsets, a variable-rate CE transmission scheme is proposed and numerically\nexamined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 19:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 19:52:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 19:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 18:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 08:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

However, bright galaxies\nat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly bright\ngalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formation\nrates and levels of dust attenuation. We match the abundances of these bright\nz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the Bolshoi Lambda-CDM simulation to\nestimate the halo masses. We find that the typical halo masses in ~M*_UV\ngalaxies decrease from log(M_h/Msol)=11.9 at z=4 to log(M_h/Msol)=11.4 at z=7.\nThus, although we are studying galaxies at a similar mass across multiple\nredshifts, these galaxies live in lower mass halos at higher redshift.

Thus the fate of\nrapidly-accreting Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate\nchannel remains more mysterious then ever. In this paper, we clarify the nature\nof ignition in Chandrasekhar-mass single-degenerate SNe Ia by analytically\nderiving the existence of a characteristic length scale which establishes a\ntransition from central ignitions to buoyancy-driven ignitions. Using this\ncriterion, combined with data from three-dimensional simulations of convection\nand ignition, we demonstrate that the overwhelming majority of ignition events\nwithin Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs in the single-degenerate channel are\nbuoyancy-driven, and consequently lack a vigorous deflagration phase.

We establish that the rates predicted\nfrom both the population of supersoft X-ray sources and binary population\nsynthesis models of the single-degenerate channel are broadly consistent with\nthe observed rates of overluminous SNe Ia, and suggest that the population of\nsupersoft X-ray sources are the dominant stellar progenitors of SNe 1991T-like\nevents. We further demonstrate that the single-degenerate channel contribution\nto the normal and failed 2002cx-like rates is not likely to exceed 1% of the\ntotal SNe Ia rate.

In this paper, we\nstudy the growth of a 10^12 Msun halo at z=2, which is the progenitor of al\ngroup of galaxies at z=0, and of its central BH by means of a high-resolution\nzoomed cosmological simulation, the Seth simulation. We study the evolution of\nthe BH driven by the accretion of cold gas in the galaxy, and explore the\nefficiency of the feedback from supernovae (SNe). For a relatively inefficient\nenergy input from SNe, the BH grows at the Eddington rate from early times, and\nreaches self-regulation once it is massive enough. We find that at early cosmic\ntimes z>3.5, efficient feedback from SNe forbids the formation of a settled\ndisc as well as the accumulation of dense cold gas in the vicinity of the BH\nand starves the central compact object. As the galaxy and its halo accumulate\nmass, they become able to confine the nuclear inflows provided by major mergers\nand the BH grows at a sustained near-to-Eddington accretion rate. We argue that\nthis mechanism should be ubiquitous amongst low-mass galaxies, corresponding to\ngalaxies with a stellar mass below <10^9 Msun in our simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 20:00:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 17:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Further in the case of Markov processes with\nunbounded state spaces, a procedure for precisely truncating the state space\nwithin a compact set is provided, together with an error bound that depends on\nthe asymptotic properties of the transition kernel of the original process. The\noverall abstraction algorithm, which practically hinges on piecewise constant\napproximations of the density functions of the Markov process, is extended to\nhigher-order function approximations: these can lead to improved error bounds\nand associated lower computational requirements. The approach is practically\ntested to compute probabilistic invariance of the Markov process under study,\nand is compared to a known alternative approach from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 21:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 07:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Rather than\nsimulating the system at the temperature of interest, an annealing algorithm\nstarts at a temperature that is high enough to ensure ergodicity and gradually\ndecreases it until the destination temperature is reached. This idea is used in\npopular algorithms such as parallel tempering and simulated annealing. A\ngeneral problem with annealing methods is that they require a temperature\nschedule. Choosing well-balanced temperature schedules can be tedious and\ntime-consuming. Imbalanced schedules can have a negative impact on the\nconvergence, runtime and success of annealing algorithms.

Ensemble annealing simultaneously simulates a physical\nsystem and estimates its density of states. The temperatures are lowered not\naccording to a prefixed schedule but adaptively so as to maintain a constant\nrelative entropy between successive ensembles.

This has implications for\ntools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in\npower system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for\nthis uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance\nConstrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation\nto a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are\nnot immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for\ngeneration control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On\nthe other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between\nlarge and small violations, although those might carry significantly different\nrisk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle\ngeneral control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient\ncomputation. The weighted chance constraints account for the size of violations\nthrough a weighting function, which assigns a higher risk to a higher\noverloads. We prove that the problem remains convex for any convex weighting\nfunction, and for very general generation control policies. In a case study, we\ncompare the performance of the new WCC-OPF and the standard CC-OPF and\ndemonstrate that WCC-OPF effectively reduces the number of severe overloads.\nFurthermore, we compare an affine generation control policy with a more general\npolicy, and show that the additional flexibility allow for a lower cost while\nmaintaining the same level of risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 22:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-02"}

However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star. We use the\nPencil Code in polar coordinates for our models. We find that the inner and\nouter spiral wakes of massive protoplanets (M>5 M_jup) produce significant\nshock heating that can trigger buoyant instabilities. These drive sustained\nturbulence throughout the disk when they occur. The strength of this effect\ndepends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxation\ntimescale; for a 10 M_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, the\nspirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactions\nare disrupted. We find that the effect is only weakly dependent on the initial\nradial temperature profile. The spirals that form in disks heated by the\neffects we have described may fit the spiral structures observed in transition\ndisks better than the spirals predicted by linear isothermal theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 23:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

For count data, standard procedures such as the\nPoisson regression and negative binomial model provide population average\ninference for model parameters. However, occurrence of excess zero counts and\nlack of independence in empirical data have necessitated their extension to\naccommodate these phenomena. These extensions, though useful, complicates\ninterpretations of effects. For example, the zero-inflated Poisson model\naccounts for the presence of excess zeros but the parameter estimates do not\nhave a direct marginal inferential ability as its base model, the Poisson\nmodel. Marginalizations due to the presence of excess zeros are underdeveloped\nthough demand for such is interestingly high.

We\ncombine observations from the SLUGGS and Atlas3D surveys to map out the stellar\nkinematics in two-dimensions, out to a median radius for the sample of four\nhalf-light radii $R_e$ (or 10 kpc), and a maximum radius of 2.0-6.2 $R_e$ (or\n4-21 kpc). We use axisymmetric dynamical models based on the Jeans equations,\nwhich allow for a spatially varying anisotropy, and employ quite general\nprofiles for the dark halos, and in particular do not place any restriction on\nthe profile slope. This is made possible by the availability of spatially\nextended two-dimensional kinematics. We find that our relatively simple models\nprovide a remarkably good description of the observed kinematics. The resulting\ntotal density profiles are well described by a nearly-isothermal power law\n$\\rho_{\\rm tot}(r)\\propto r^{-\\gamma}$ from $R_e$/10 to at least 4$R_e$, the\nlargest average deviation being 11%. The average logarithmic slope is\n$\\langle\\gamma\\rangle=2.19\\pm0.03$ with observed rms scatter of just\n$\\sigma_\\gamma=0.11$. This scatter out to large radii, where dark matter\ndominates, is as small as previously reported by lensing studies around\n$r\\approx R_e/2$, where the stars dominate. Our bulge-halo conspiracy places\nmuch tighter constraints on galaxy formation models. It illustrates the power\nof two-dimensional stellar kinematics observations at large radii. It would now\nbe important to test the generality of our results for different galaxy types\nand larger samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 01:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

Some numerical\nmethods of 3D surface morphing by deformable modeling and conformal mapping are\nshown in this study. It is well known that there exists a unique Riemann\nconformal mapping from a simply connected surface into a unit disk by the\nRiemann mapping theorem. The dilation and relative orientations of the 3D\nsurfaces can be linked through the M\\\"obius transformation due to the conformal\ncharacteristic of the Riemann mapping. On the other hand, a 3D surface\ndeformable model can be built via various approaches such as mutual\nparameterization from direct interpolation or surface matching using landmarks.\nIn this paper, we take the advantage of the unique representation of 3D\nsurfaces by the mean curvatures and the conformal factors associated with the\nRiemann mapping. By registering the landmarks on the conformal parametric\ndomains, the correspondence of the mean curvatures and the conformal factors\nfor each surfaces can be obtained. As a result, we can construct the 3D\ndeformation field from the surface reconstruction algorithm proposed by Gu and\nYau. Furthermore, by composition of the M\\\"obius transformation and the 3D\ndeformation field, the morphing sequence can be generated from the mean\ncurvatures and the conformal factors on a unified mesh structure by using the\ncubic spline homotopy. Several numerical experiments of the face morphing are\npresented to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 03:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-02"}

In sharp contrast to the biofilm-mediated streamers, these streamers\nform over extremely small timescales (less than a second). Our experiments,\ncarried out in a microchannel with micropillars rely on fluorescence microscopy\ntechniques to illustrate that floc-mediated streamers form when a freely-moving\nfloc adheres to the micropillar wall and gets rapidly sheared by the background\nflow. We also show that at their inception the deformation of the flocs is\ndominated by recoverable large strains indicating significant elasticity.

However,\nat a systems-level it is unclear how these perturbations give rise to the\nobserved increased plasticity. Elucidating such systems-level principles is key\nfor an improved understanding of cancer. Recently, it has been shown that\nsignaling entropy, an overall measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, and\ncomputable from integrating a sample's gene expression profile with a protein\ninteraction network, correlates with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in\ncancer compared to normal tissue. Here we develop a computational framework for\nstudying the effects of network perturbations on signaling entropy.

Indeed, we show that if protein interaction\nnetworks were random graphs, described by Poisson degree distributions, that\ncancer would generally not exhibit an increased signaling entropy.

We proceed from the\nassumption that the ion cyclotron waves in solar wind are experiencing\nmodulation with a characteristic period of 5 minutes under the influence of\nAlfven waves driven by photospheric motions. The theory presented in our paper\npredicts a deep frequency modulation of the ion cyclotron waves. The frequency\nmodulation is expected mainly from variations in orientation of the IMF lines.\nIn turn, the variations in orientation are caused by the Alfven waves,\npropagating from the Sun. To test the theoretical predictions we have analyzed\nrecords of the ultra-low-frequency (ULF) geoelectromagnetic waves in order to\nfind the permanent quasi-monochromatic oscillations of natural origin in the\nPc1-2 frequency band (0.1-5 Hz), the carrier frequency of which varies with\ntime in a wide range. As a result we found the so-called \"serpentine emission\"\n(SE), which was observed in Antarctic at the Vostok station near the South\nGeomagnetic Pole. The permanency, range of frequencies, and the deep frequency\nmodulation of SE correspond to the qualitative properties of ion cyclotron\nwaves in the solar wind. Clearly expressed 5-minute modulation of the carrier\nfrequency is particularly important feature of the SE in the context of this\nwork.

The current best lower bound for the\ndeterminantal complexity of the d by d permanent polynomial is d^2/2, due to\nMignon and Ressayre in 2004. Inspired by their proof method, we introduce a\nnatural rank concept of polynomials, called the bi-polynomial rank. The\nbi-polynomial rank is related to width of an arithmetic branching program. The\nbi-polynomial rank of a homogeneous polynomial p of even degree 2k is defined\nas the minimum n such that p can be written as a summation of n products of\npolynomials of degree k. We prove that the bi-polynomial rank gives a lower\nbound of the determinantal complexity. As a consequence, the above Mignon and\nRessayre bound is improved to (d-1)^2 + 1 over the field of reals. We show that\nthe computation of the bi-polynomial rank is formulated as a rank minimization\nproblem. Applying the concave minimization technique, we reduce the problem of\nlower-bounding determinantal complexity to that of proving the positive\nsemidefiniteness of matrices, and this is a new approach for the permanent vs.\ndeterminant problem. We propose a computational approach for giving a lower\nbound of this rank minimization, via techniques of the concave minimization.\nThis also yields a new strategy to attack the permanent vs. determinant\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 09:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-02"}

Interactions are often reconstructed using pairwise\nbivariate analyses, overlooking their multivariate nature: it is neglected that\ninvestigating the effect of one source on a target necessitates to take all\nother sources as potential nuisance variables into account; also combinations\nof sources may act jointly on a given target. Bivariate analyses produce\nnetworks that may contain spurious interactions, which reduce the\ninterpretability of the network and its graph metrics. A truly multivariate\nreconstruction, however, is computationally intractable due to combinatorial\nexplosion in the number of potential interactions. Thus, we have to resort to\napproximative methods to handle the intractability of multivariate interaction\nreconstruction, and thereby enable the use of networks in neuroscience. Here,\nwe suggest such an approximative approach in the form of an algorithm that\nextends fast bivariate interaction reconstruction by identifying potentially\nspurious interactions post-hoc: the algorithm flags potentially spurious edges,\nwhich may then be pruned from the network. This produces a statistically\nconservative network approximation that is guaranteed to contain non-spurious\ninteractions only.

We discuss the algorithm in relation to\nother approximative multivariate methods and highlight suitable application\nscenarios.

Current Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) studies of cool star\nmagnetic fields chiefly employ circular polarization observations because\nlinear polarization is difficult to detect and requires a more sophisticated\nradiative transfer modeling to interpret. But it has been shown in previous\ntheoretical studies, and in the observational analyses of magnetic Ap stars,\nthat including linear polarization in the magnetic inversion process makes it\npossible to correctly recover many otherwise lost or misinterpreted magnetic\nfeatures. We have obtained phase-resolved observations in all four Stokes\nparameters of the RS CVn star II Peg at two separate epochs. Here we present\ntemperature and magnetic field maps reconstructed for this star using all four\nStokes parameters. This is the very first such ZDI study of a cool active star.\nOur magnetic inversions reveal a highly structured magnetic field topology for\nboth epochs. The strength of some surface features is doubled or even\nquadrupled when linear polarization is taken into account. The total magnetic\nenergy of the reconstructed field map also becomes about 2.1-3.5 times higher.\nThe overall complexity is also increased as the field energy is shifted towards\nhigher harmonic modes when four Stokes parameters are used. As a consequence,\nthe potential field extrapolation of the four Stokes parameter ZDI results\nindicates that magnetic field becomes weaker at a distance of several stellar\nradii due to a decrease of the large-scale field component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 10:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The time\nevolution of the quasi-periodicity in these parameters connected with the Suns\nrotation reveals that their synodic period is stable and is aprox 26-27 days.\nThis means that the changes in the solar wind speed and IMF are related to the\nSuns near equatorial regions in considering the differential rotation of the\nSun. However, the solar wind parameters observed near the Earths orbit provide\nonly the conditions in the limited local vicinity of the equatorial region in\nthe heliosphere (within in latitude). We also demonstrate that the observed\nperiod of the GCR intensity connected with the Suns rotation increased up to\naprox 33-36 days in 2009. This means that the process driving the 27-day\nvariations of the GCR intensity takes place not only in the limited local\nsurroundings of the equatorial region but in the global 3-D space of the\nheliosphere, covering also higher latitude regions. A relatively long period (\naprox 34 days) found for 2009 in the GCR intensity gives possible evidence of\nthe onset of cycle 24 due to active regions at higher latitudes and rotating\nslowly because of the Suns differential rotation. We also discuss the effect of\ndifferential rotation on the theoretical model of the 27-day variations of the\nGCR intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 11:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-02"}

Solar supergranules exhibit a preferred sense of rotation, which\ndepends on the hemisphere. This is due to the Coriolis force acting on the\ndiverging horizontal flows. We aim to spatially resolve the vertical flow\nvorticity of the average supergranule at different latitudes, both for outflow\nand inflow regions. To measure the vertical vorticity, we use two independent\ntechniques: time-distance helioseismology (TD) and local correlation tracking\nof granules in intensity images (LCT) using data from the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Both maps\nare corrected for center-to-limb systematic errors. We find that 8-h TD and LCT\nmaps of vertical vorticity are highly correlated at large spatial scales.\nAssociated with the average supergranule outflow, we find tangential (vortical)\nflows that reach about 10 m/s in the clockwise direction at 40{\\deg} latitude.\nIn average inflow regions, the tangential flow reaches the same magnitude, but\nin the anti-clockwise direction. These tangential velocities are much smaller\nthan the radial (diverging) flow component (300 m/s for the average outflow and\n200 m/s for the average inflow).

In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the\nnotion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time\ncentrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic\ncomplex networks.

One efficient\nway to form such black holes is the collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud\ninto a so-called direct collapse black hole. The main requirement for this\nscenario is the presence of large accretion rates of $\\rm \\geq\n0.1~M_{\\odot}/yr$ to form a supermassive star. It is not yet clear how and\nunder what conditions such accretion rates can be obtained. The prime aim of\nthis work is to determine the mass accretion rates under non-isothermal\ncollapse conditions.

To assess whether such large\naccretion rates can be maintained over longer time scales, we employed sink\nparticles, confirming the persistence of accretion rates of $\\rm \\sim\n0.1~M_{\\odot}/yr$.

The analysis of the configurational free\nenergies shows that different behaviour is expected for the equilibrium cation\ndistributions in these structures: FeCr$_2X_4$ and FeMn$_2$S$_4$ are fully\nnormal, FeNi$_2X_4$ and FeCo$_2$S$_4$ are intermediate, and FeCo$_2$O$_4$ and\nFeMn$_2$O$_4$ are fully inverted. We have analyzed the role played by the size\nof the ions and by the crystal field stabilization effects in determining the\nequilibrium inversion degree. We also discuss how the electronic and magnetic\nstructure of these spinels is modified by the degree of inversion, assuming\nthat this could be varied from the equilibrium value. We have obtained\nelectronic densities of states for the completely normal and completely inverse\ncation distribution of each compound. FeCr$_2X_4$, FeMn$_2X_4$, FeCo$_2$O$_4$\nand FeNi$_2$O$_4$ are half-metals in the ferrimagnetic state when Fe is in\ntetrahedral positions. When $M$ is filling the tetrahedral positions, the\nCr-containing compounds and FeMn$_2$O$_4$ are half-metallic systems, while the\nCo and Ni spinels are insulators. The Co and Ni sulfide counterparts are\nmetallic for any inversion degree together with the inverse FeMn$_2$S$_4$. Our\ncalculations suggest that the spin filtering properties of the Fe$M_2X_4$\n(thio)spinels could be modified via the control of the cation distribution\nthrough variations in the synthesis conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 15:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 15:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}
