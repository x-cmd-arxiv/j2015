This polytope has many beautiful properties -- for example it provides a\nway to visualize the weak Bruhat order: if we orient the permutohedron so that\nthe longest permutation w_0 is at the \"top\" and the identity e is at the\n\"bottom,\" then the one-skeleton of Perm is the Hasse diagram of the weak Bruhat\norder. Equivalently, the paths from e to w_0 along the edges of Perm are in\nbijection with the reduced decompositions of w_0. Moreover, the two-dimensional\nfaces of the permutohedron correspond to braid and commuting moves, which by\nthe Tits Lemma, connect any two reduced expressions of w_0.\n  In this note we introduce some polytopes Br(k,n) (which we call bridge\npolytopes) which provide a positive Grassmannian analogue of the permutohedron.\nIn this setting, BCFW bridge decompositions of reduced plabic graphs play the\nrole of reduced decompositions. We define Br(k,n) and explain how paths along\nits edges encode BCFW bridge decompositions of the longest element pi(k,n) in\nthe circular Bruhat order. We also show that two-dimensional faces of Br(k,n)\ncorrespond to certain local moves for plabic graphs, which by a result of\nPostnikov [Pos06], connect any two reduced plabic graphs associated to pi(k,n).\nAll of these results can be generalized to the positive parts of Schubert\ncells. A useful tool in our proofs is the fact that our polytopes are\nisomorphic to certain Bruhat interval polytopes. Conversely, our results on\nbridge polytopes allow us to deduce some corollaries about the structure of\nBruhat interval polytopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

In the case of diffusion MRI-based structural human\nbrain imaging, the effective vertex number of the connectomes, or brain graphs\nderived from the data is on the scale of several hundred today. That size\nfacilitates applying strict mathematical graph algorithms even for some\nhard-to-compute (or NP-hard) quantities like vertex cover or balanced minimum\ncut. In the present work we have examined brain graphs, computed from the data\nof the Human Connectome Project, recorded from male and female subjects between\nages 22 and 35. Significant differences were found between the male and female\nstructural brain graphs: we show that the average female connectome has more\nedges, is a better expander graph, has larger minimal bisection width, and has\nmore spanning trees than the average male connectome. Since the average female\nbrain weights less than the brain of males, these properties show that the\nfemale brain is more \"well-connected\" or perhaps, more \"efficient\" in a sense\nthan the brain of males.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 22:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 22:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 10:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The origin of the LSPs is currently unknown. In oxygen-rich\nstars, we found that while most broad band colours (e.g. $V-I$) get redder when\nan oxygen-rich star dims during its LSP cycle, the $J$-$K$ colour barely\nchanges and sometimes becomes bluer. We interpret the $J$-$K$ colour changes as\nbeing due to increasing water vapour absorption during declining light caused\nby the development a layer of dense cool gas above the photosphere. This result\nand previous observations which indicate the development of a chromosphere\nbetween minimum to maximum light suggest that the LSP phenomenon is associated\nwith the ejection of matter from the stellar photosphere near the beginning of\nlight decline. We explore the possibility that broadband light variations from\nthe optical to the near-IR regions can be explained by either dust absorption\nby ejected matter or large spots on a rotating stellar surface. However,\nneither model is capable of explaining the observed light variations in a\nvariety of colour-magnitude diagrams.

The\nburst rate is comparable to the NS formation rate in a Hubble volume, requiring\nonly one per NS if they are bright enough. However, radiation physics causes us\nto favor a closer population. More bursts per NS are then required but repeats\nin 10 to 100 yr could still be negligible.

A Weyl semimetal is an unusual crystal where electrons also behave as\nmassless quasi-particles but interestingly they are not Dirac fermions. These\nmassless particles, Weyl fermions, were originally considered in massless\nquantum electrodynamics but have not been observed as a fundamental particle in\nnature. A Weyl semimetal provides a condensed matter realization of Weyl\nfermions, leading to unique transport properties with novel device\napplications. Here, we THEORETICALLY identify the first Weyl semimetal in a\nclass of stoichiometric materials (TaAs, NbAs, NbP, TaP), which break\ncrystalline inversion symmetry, including TaAs, TaP, NbAs and NbP. Our\nfirst-principles calculation-based predictions on TaAs reveal the\nspin-polarized Weyl cones and Fermi arc surface states in this compound. We\nalso observe pairs of Weyl points with the same chiral charge which project\nonto the same point in the surface Brillouin zone, giving rise to multiple\nFermi arcs connecting to a given Weyl point.

We discuss several scenarios and conclude that while more\ncomplex explanations can not formally be excluded, our result strongly suggests\nthat the QPO is produced by azimuthal motion at the inner edge of the accretion\ndisk, most likely orbital motion. Depending on whether this azimuthal motion is\nfaster or slower than the spin, the plasma then interacts differently with the\nneutron-star magnetic field.

Malicious entities exploit this spur in user-engagement\nlevels to spread malicious content that compromises system reputation and\ndegrades user experience. It also generates revenue from advertisements,\nclicks, etc. for the malicious entities. Facebook, the world's biggest social\nnetwork, is no exception and has recently been reported to face much abuse\nthrough scams and other type of malicious content, especially during news\nmaking events. Recent studies have reported that spammers earn $200 million\njust by posting malicious links on Facebook. In this paper, we characterize\nmalicious content posted on Facebook during 17 events, and discover that\nexisting efforts to counter malicious content by Facebook are not able to stop\nall malicious content from entering the social graph. Our findings revealed\nthat malicious entities tend to post content through web and third party\napplications while legitimate entities prefer mobile platforms to post content.\nIn addition, we discovered a substantial amount of malicious content generated\nby Facebook pages. Through our observations, we propose an extensive feature\nset based on entity profile, textual content, metadata, and URL features to\nidentify malicious content on Facebook in real time and at zero-hour. This\nfeature set was used to train multiple machine learning models and achieved an\naccuracy of 86.9%. The intent is to catch malicious content that is currently\nevading Facebook's detection techniques. Our machine learning model was able to\ndetect more than double the number of malicious posts as compared to existing\nmalicious content detection techniques. Finally, we built a real world solution\nin the form of a REST based API and a browser plug-in to identify malicious\nFacebook posts in real time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 09:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

While clusters form,\ntheir surface density increases. It likely decreases again at the end of the\nstar formation process when the system expands as a consequence of gas\nexpulsion. Therefore the surface density of a single cluster can change\nconsiderably in young clusters/associations during the first 20 Myr of their\ndevelopment. We investigate the effect of the gas expulsion on the\ndetectability of clusters/associations typical for the solar neighborhood,\nwhere the star formation efficiency is <35%. The main focus will be laid on the\ndependence on the initial cluster mass. Nbody methods are used to determine the\ncluster/association dynamics after gas expulsion. We find that, even for low\nbackground densities, only clusters/associations with initial central surface\ndensities exceeding a few 5000 M(sun)/pc2 will be detected as clusters at ages\n~5 Myr. Even the Orion Nebula cluster, one of the most massive nearby clusters,\nwould only be categorized as a small co-moving group with current methods after\n5 Myr of development. This means that cluster expansion leads to a selection\neffect - at ages of <1-2 Myr the full range of clusters/associations is\nobserved whereas at ages > 4 Myr only the most massive clusters are identified,\nwhile systems with initially M_c < 3 000 M(sun) are missing. The temporal\ndevelopment of stellar properties is usually determined by observing clusters\nof different ages.

This memoir proposes a regimen to verify such algorithms at\nprescribed levels of statistical confidence. The United States Department of\nDefense standard for system safety engineering (MIL-STD-882E) defines\ndevelopment procedures for safety-critical systems. However, a problem exists:\nthe Standard fails to distinguish quantitative product assurance technique from\ncategorical process assurance method for software development. Resulting is\nconflict in the technical definition of the term risk. The primary goal here is\nto show that a quantitative risk-based product assurance method exists and is\nconsistent with hardware practice. Discussion appears in two major parts:\ntheory, which shows the relationship between automata and software; and\napplication, which covers demonstration and indemnification. Demonstration is a\ntechnique for generating random tests; indemnification converts pass/fail test\nresults to compound Poisson parameters (severity and intensity). Together,\ndemonstration and indemnification yield statistical confidence that\nsafety-critical code meets design intent. Statistical confidence is the\nkeystone of quantitative product assurance. A secondary goal is resolving the\nconflict over the term risk. The first meaning is an accident model known in\nmathematics as the compound Poisson stochastic process, and so is called\nstatistical risk. Various of its versions underlie the theories of safety and\nreliability. The second is called developmental risk. It considers software\nautonomy, which considers time until manual recovery of control. Once these\nmeanings are separated, MIL-STD-882 can properly support either formal\nquantitative safety assurance or empirical process robustness, which differ in\nimpact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 11:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 21:52:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 20:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 2019 01:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

Simple chemicals such as methanol and formic acid are\nknown to be present in cold protostellar regions alongside the dominant water\nice; they are also likely to be incorporated into planets which form in\nprotoplanetary disks, and planetary ring systems. However, the effect of the\nchemical composition of the ice on its collisional properties has not yet been\nstudied. Aims: Collisions of 1.5 cm ice spheres composed of pure crystalline\nwater ice, water with 5% methanol, and water with 5% formic acid were\ninvestigated to determine the effect of the ice composition on the collisional\noutcomes. Methods: The collisions were conducted in a dedicated experimental\ninstrument, operated under microgravity conditions, at relative particle impact\nvelocities between 0.01 and 0.19 m s^-1, temperatures between 131 and 160 K and\na pressure of around 10^-5 mbar. Results: A range of coefficients of\nrestitution were found, with no correlation between this and the chemical\ncomposition, relative impact velocity, or temperature. Conclusions: We conclude\nthat the chemical composition of the ice (at the level of 95% water ice and 5%\nmethanol or formic acid) does not affect the collisional properties at these\ntemperatures and pressures due to the inability of surface wetting to take\nplace. At a level of 5% methanol or formic acid, the structure is likely to be\ndominated by crystalline water ice, leading to no change in collisional\nproperties. The surface roughness of the particles is the dominant factor in\nexplaining the range of coefficients of restitution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 12:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

In\nparticular closure constraints at every node of the graph ensure their\ninterpretation as twisted geometries. Dual to each node, one has a polyhedron\nembedded in flat space R^3.

We want to check whether the far-infrared and\nsubmillimeter high-resolution data from Herschel SPIRE and PACS cameras\ncombined with ground-based telescope bolometers allow us to retrieve the whole\ndust content of cold dark clouds. Methods. We compare far-infrared and\nsubmillimeter emission across L183 to the 8 $\\mu$m absorption map from Spitzer\ndata and fit modified blackbody functions towards three different positions.\nResults. We find that none of the Herschel SPIRE channels follow the cold dust\nprofile seen in absorption.

The difference in dust opacity can reach up to a\nfactor of 3 in prestellar cores of high extinction. Conclusions. In dark\nclouds, the amount of very cold dust cannot be measured from its emission\nalone.
