Due to the poor EO properties of\nregular materials, a conventional EO modulator has a very large footprint.\nBased on high-Q resonators, recent efforts have advanced EO modulators into\nmicroscale footprints, which have nearly reached their physical limits\nrestricted by the materials. On-chip optical interconnects require ultrafast EO\nmodulators at the nanoscale. The technical barrier may not be well overcome\nbased on conventional approaches and well-known materials.

The\nreconnection sites are too small to be resolved with images but these\nreconnection mechanisms, Petschek and the plasmoid instability, have\nreconnection sites with very different density and velocity structures and so\ncan be distinguished by high-resolution line-profiles observations. Using IRIS\nspectroscopic observations we obtain a survey of typical line profiles produced\nby small-scale events thought to be reconnection sites on the Sun.

To elucidate the physics\ngoverning the disruption of the imposed laminar motion and the energy transfer\nto small scales, we propose a simplified model where the large-scale motion of\nmagnetic field lines is prescribed not at the footpoints but rather imposed\nvolumetrically.

This operator has two unstable and\ntwo stable eigenvalues complemented by a continuous spectrum of\nneutrally-stable eigenvalues. By considering a family of suitably regularized\n(smoothed) eigenvalue problems solved with a range of numerical resolutions we\ndemonstrate that the corresponding eigenfunctions are in fact singular objects\nin the form of infinitely sharp peaks localized at the front and rear\nstagnation points. These findings thus refine the results of the classical\nanalysis by Moffatt & Moore (1978).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 19:39:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 15:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Kleiber's observation that animals' basal metabolic rate scales to the\n3/4-power of body mass (Kleiber's rule) has been the prevailing hypothesis in\nthe last eight decades. Increasingly, more evidences are supporting the\nalternative 2/3-power scaling rule, especially for smaller animals. The\n2/3-rule dates back to before Kleiber's time and was thought to originate from\nthe surface to volume relationship in Euclidean geometry. In this study, we\nshow that both the 3/4- and 2/3-scaling rules have in fact one common origin.\nThey are governed by animals' nutrient supply networks-their vascular systems\nthat obey Murray's law. Murray's law describes the branching pattern of energy\noptimized vascular network under laminar flow. It is generally regarded as\nbeing closely followed by blood vessels. Our analysis agrees with experimental\nobservations and recent numerical analyses that showed a curvature in metabolic\nscaling. When applied to metabolic data, our model accurately produces the\nobserved 2/3-scaling rule for small animals of ~10 kg or less and the 3/4-rule\nfor all animals excluding the smallest ones (~15 g). The model has broad\nimplications to the ongoing debate.

Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted\nand injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the\nblack hole, with the fastest material moving at $\\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,\nwe present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams\n(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding\ngas.

As UDSs\ntravel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with\ndistance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the\nambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This\nsudden injection of $\\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a\nSedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic\nrays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the\nmolecular clouds surrounding a black hole.

Our method mitigates this degeneracy,\nincludes a penalty for large-radius planets, uses terrestrial mass-radius\nrelationships, and, when available, constraints on eccentricity to compute a\nnumber we call the \"habitability index for transiting exoplanets\" that\nrepresents the relative probability that an exoplanet could support liquid\nsurface water. We calculate it for Kepler Objects of Interest and find that\nplanets that receive between 60-90% of the Earth's incident radiation, assuming\ncircular orbits, are most likely to be habitable. Finally, we make predictions\nfor the upcoming TESS and JWST missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 20:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

By driving the model\nusing solar and modified solar surface magnetograms, we show that the topology\nof the field arising from the net interaction of both small-scale and\nlarge-scale field is important for spin-down rates and that angular momentum\nloss is not a simple function of large scale magnetic field strength. We find\nthat changing the latitude of magnetic spots can modify mass and angular\nmomentum loss rates by a factor of two. The general effect that causes these\ndifferences is the closing down of large-scale open field at mid- and\nhigh-latitudes by the addition of the small-scale field. These effects might\ngive rise to modulation of mass and angular momentum loss through stellar\ncycles, and present a problem for ab initio attempts to predict stellar\nspin-down based on wind models. For all the magnetogram cases considered here,\nfrom dipoles to various spotted distributions, we find that angular momentum\nloss is dominated by the mass loss at mid-latitudes.

First, we\nneed to determine the preferable objects based on the categorical preferences\nfor each user, and second we need to reconcile possible conflicts among users'\npreferences. A naive solution would first assign degrees of match between each\nuser and each object, by taking into account all categorical attributes, and\nthen for each object combine these matching degrees across users to compute the\ntotal score of an object. Such an approach, however, performs two series of\naggregation, among categorical attributes and then across users, which\ncompletely obscure and blur individual preferences. Our solution, instead of\ncombining individual matching degrees, is to directly operate on categorical\nattributes, and define an objective Pareto-based aggregation for group\npreferences. Building on our interpretation, we tackle two distinct but\nrelevant problems: finding the Pareto-optimal objects, and objectively ranking\nobjects with respect to the group preferences.

Here we\nreport on the discovery of VFTS 352, an O-type binary in the 30 Doradus region,\nas the most massive and earliest spectral type overcontact system known to\ndate. We derived the 3D geometry of the system, its orbital period $P_{\\rm\norb}=1.1241452(4)$ d, components' effective temperatures -- $T_1=42\\,540\\pm280$\nK and $T_2=41\\,120\\pm290$ K -- and dynamical masses -- $M_1=28.63\\pm0.30\nM_{\\odot}$ and $M_2 = 28.85\\pm0.30 M_{\\odot}$. Compared to single-star\nevolutionary models, the VFTS 352 components are too hot for their dynamical\nmasses by about 2700 and 1100 K, respectively. These results can be explained\nnaturally as a result of enhanced mixing, theoretically predicted to occur in\nvery short-period tidally-locked systems. The VFTS 352 components are two of\nthe best candidates identified so far to undergo this so-called chemically\nhomogeneous evolution. The future of VFTS 352 is uncertain. If the two stars\nmerge, a very rapidly rotating star will be produced. Instead, if the stars\ncontinue to evolve homogeneously and keep shrinking within their Roche Lobes,\ncoalescence can be avoided. In this case, tides may counteract the spin down by\nwinds such that the VFTS 352 components may, at the end of their life, fulfill\nthe requirements for long gamma-ray burst (GRB) progenitors in the collapsar\nscenario. Independently of whether the VFTS 352 components become GRB\nprogenitors, this scenario makes VFTS 352 interesting as a progenitor of a\nblack hole binary, hence as a potential gravitational wave source through black\nhole-black hole merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 20:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Being able to find temporal interaction\npatterns, visualize the evolution of graph properties, or even simply compare\nthem across time, adds significant value in reasoning over graphs.

Photometric\nredshifts are more easily available for large numbers of galaxies, but at the\nprice of larger uncertainties than spectroscopic ones. In this work we study\nhow photometric redshifts affect the measurement of galaxy environment and how\nthis may limit an analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) in\ndifferent environments. Using mock galaxy catalogues, we measured the\nenvironment with a fixed aperture method, using each galaxy's true and\nphotometric redshifts. We varied the fixed aperture volume parameters and the\nphotometric redshift uncertainties. We then computed GSMF as a function of\nredshift and environment. We found that only when using high-precision\nphotometric redshifts with $\\sigma_{\\Delta z/(1+z)} \\le 0.01$, the most extreme\nenvironments can be reconstructed in a fairly accurate way, with a fraction\n$\\ge 60\\div 80\\%$ of galaxies placed in the correct density quartile and a\ncontamination of $\\le 10\\%$ by opposite quartile interlopers. A volume height\ncomparable to the $\\pm 1.5\\sigma$ error of photometric redshifts grants a\nbetter reconstruction than other volume configurations.

However, the\ncomputational and energy requirements associated with such deep nets can be\nquite high, and hence their energy-efficient implementation is of great\ninterest. Although traditionally the entire network is utilized for the\nrecognition of all inputs, we observe that the classification difficulty varies\nwidely across inputs in real-world datasets; only a small fraction of inputs\nrequire the full computational effort of a network, while a large majority can\nbe classified correctly with very low effort. In this paper, we propose\nConditional Deep Learning (CDL) where the convolutional layer features are used\nto identify the variability in the difficulty of input instances and\nconditionally activate the deeper layers of the network. We achieve this by\ncascading a linear network of output neurons for each convolutional layer and\nmonitoring the output of the linear network to decide whether classification\ncan be terminated at the current stage or not. The proposed methodology thus\nenables the network to dynamically adjust the computational effort depending\nupon the difficulty of the input data while maintaining competitive\nclassification accuracy. We evaluate our approach on the MNIST dataset. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed CDL yields 1.91x reduction in average\nnumber of operations per input, which translates to 1.84x improvement in\nenergy.

In this contribution\nwe briefly review the processes describing the journey of BHs during mergers,\nfrom the cosmic context all the way to when BHs coalesce. If two galaxies each\nhosting a central BH merge, the BHs would be dragged towards the center of the\nnewly formed galaxy. If/when the holes get sufficiently close, they coalesce\nvia the emission of gravitational waves. How often two BHs are involved in\ngalaxy mergers depends crucially on how many galaxies host BHs and on the\ngalaxy merger history. It is therefore necessary to start with full\ncosmological models including BH physics and a careful dynamical treatment.\nAfter galaxies have merged, however, the BHs still have a long journey until\nthey touch and coalesce. Their dynamical evolution is radically different in\ngas-rich and gas-poor galaxies, leading to a sort of \"dichotomy\" between\nhigh-redshift and low-redshift galaxies, and late-type and early-type,\ntypically more massive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 06:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

While\nmost works have focused on the effects from isolated free edges, we present a\nnovel knotting phenomenon induced by the interactions between a pair of free\nedges in graphene, and investigate its effect on the buckling of monolayer\ngraphene. Upon compression, the buckling of graphene starts gradually in the\nform of two buckling waves from the warped edges. The collision of these two\nbuckling waves results in the creation of a knot structure in graphene. The\nknot structure enables the buckled graphene to exhibit two unique post-buckling\ncharacteristics. First, it induces a five-fold increase in graphene's\nmechanical stiffness during the buckling process. Second, the knotted structure\nenables graphene to exhibit a mechanically stable post-buckling regime over a\nlarge (3%) compressive strain regime, which is significantly larger than the\ncritical buckling strain of about 0.5%. The combination of these two effects\nenables graphene to exhibit an unexpected post-buckling stability that has\npreviously not been reported. We predict that numerical simulations or\nexperiments should observe two distinct stress strain relations for the\nbuckling of identical graphene samples, due to the characteristic randomness in\nthe formation process of the knot structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 07:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

In this paper, we introduce Seit, an inter-tenant framework that\nmanages the interactions between cloud services. Seit is a software-defined\nreputation-based framework. It consists of two primary components: (1) a set of\nintegration and query interfaces that can be easily integrated into cloud and\nservice providers' management stacks, and (2) a controller that maintains\nreputation information using a mechanism that is adaptive to the highly dynamic\nenvironment of the cloud. We have fully implemented Seit, and integrated it\ninto an SDN controller, a load balancer, a cloud service broker, an intrusion\ndetection system, and a monitoring framework. We evaluate the efficacy of Seit\nusing both an analytical model and a Mininet-based emulated environment. Our\nanalytical model validate the isolation and stability properties of Seit. Using\nour emulated environment, we show that Seit can provide improved security by\nisolating malicious tenants, reduced costs by adapting the infrastructure\nwithout compromising security, and increased revenues for high quality service\nproviders by enabling reputation to impact discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 08:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

Previous approaches for ac\ndriven circuits need to be extended to account for the driven bath modes.

The proposed\nprocedure aims to address the following considerations, arisen from the\nanalysis of seismic phenomena, which cannot be taken in account using standard\nprobabilistic seismic input (PSHA): a) any structure at a given location,\nregardless of its importance, is subject to the same shaking as a result of a\ngiven earthquake, b) it is impossible to determine when a future earthquake of\na given intensity/magnitude will occur, c) insufficient data are available to\ndevelop reliable statistics with regards to earthquakes.

The first one\n(RSA) provides the Maximum Deterministic Seismic Input as a response spectra at\nthe bedrock (MDSIBD), similarly to what is proposed by the codes.

Reviewing the standard PBD procedure, MDSISS is always associated\nwith the worst structural performance acceptable for a building, called Target\nPerformance Level (TPL). In this way, the importance of the structure (risk\ncategory) is taken into account by changing the structural performance level to\ncheck rather than to change the seismic input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 10:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

However, contrary to the standard model, empirical studies suggest that\na bidder's valuation often does not depend solely on the goods assigned to him.\nFor instance, in adwords auctions an advertiser might not want his ads to be\ndisplayed next to his competitors' ads. In this paper, we propose and analyze\nseveral natural graph-theoretic models that incorporate such negative\nexternalities, in which bidders form a directed conflict graph with maximum\nout-degree $\\Delta$. We design algorithms and truthful mechanisms for social\nwelfare maximization that attain approximation ratios depending on $\\Delta$.\n  For CA, our results are twofold: (1) A lottery that eliminates conflicts by\ndiscarding bidders/items independent of the bids. It allows to apply any\ntruthful $\\alpha$-approximation mechanism for conflict-free valuations and\nyields an $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha\\Delta)$-approximation mechanism. (2) For\nfractionally sub-additive valuations, we design a rounding algorithm via a\nnovel combination of a semi-definite program and a linear program, resulting in\na cone program; the approximation ratio is $\\mathcal{O}((\\Delta \\log \\log\n\\Delta)/\\log \\Delta)$. The ratios are almost optimal given existing hardness\nresults.\n  For the prominent application of adwords auctions, we present several\nalgorithms for the most relevant scenario when the number of items is small.

These events are marked by a divergence in the curvature invariants\nand the breakdown of the geodesic evolution. Recent progress on implementing\ntechniques of loop quantum gravity to cosmological models reveals that such\nsingularities may be generically resolved because of the quantum gravitational\neffects. Due to the quantum geometry, which replaces the classical differential\ngeometry at the Planck scale, the big bang is replaced by a big bounce without\nany assumptions on the matter content or any fine tuning. In this manuscript,\nwe discuss some of the main features of this approach and the results on the\ngeneric resolution of singularities for the isotropic as well as anisotropic\nmodels. Using effective spacetime description of the quantum theory, we show\nthe way quantum gravitational effects lead to the universal bounds on the\nenergy density, the Hubble rate and the anisotropic shear. We discuss the\ngeodesic completeness in the effective spacetime and the resolution of all of\nthe strong singularities. It turns out that despite the bounds on energy\ndensity and the Hubble rate, there can be divergences in the curvature\ninvariants. However such events are geodesically extendible, with tidal forces\nnot strong enough to cause inevitable destruction of the in-falling objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 14:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse\nregulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent\nfeedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an\nupstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein\nY. Thus, any random increase in X's copy numbers would increase both production\nand degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics,\nwe formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master\nEquation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Y's\nproduction and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Y's\ncopy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y\npropagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is\nintroduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases\nwith noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is\ninvariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the\ntime-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream\nprocesses. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from\nnoise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes\nin the time-scale of fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 14:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

The proposed method is\nsingle-stage, single-step, maintains a discrete divergence-free condition on\nthe magnetic field, and has the capacity to preserve the positivity of the\ndensity and pressure. To accomplish this, we use a Taylor discretization of the\nPicard integral formulation (PIF) of the finite difference WENO method proposed\nin [SINUM, 53 (2015), pp. 1833--1856], where the focus is on a high-order\ndiscretization of the fluxes (as opposed to the conserved variables). We use\nthe version where fluxes are expanded to third-order accuracy in time, and for\nthe fluid variables space is discretized using the classical fifth-order finite\ndifference WENO discretization. We use constrained transport in order to obtain\ndivergence-free magnetic fields, which means that we simultaneously evolve the\nmagnetohydrodynamic and magnetic potential equations, and set the magnetic\nfield to be the (discrete) curl of the magnetic potential after each time step.\nIn this work, we compute these curls to fourth-order accuracy. In order to\nretain a single-stage, single-step method, we develop a novel Lax-Wendroff\ndiscretization for the evolution of the magnetic potential, where we start with\ntechnology used for Hamilton-Jacobi equations in order to construct a\nnon-oscillatory magnetic field. Positivity preservation is realized by\nintroducing a parameterized flux limiter that considers a linear combination of\nhigh and low-order numerical fluxes. This positivity limiter lacks energy\nconservation. However, this limiter can be dropped for problems where the\npressure does not become negative. We present two and three dimensional\nnumerical results for several standard test problems.

The large size of the databases requires fast methods\nfor such initial screening, for example based on feature vectors constructed to\nfulfill the requirement that similar molecules should correspond to close\nvectors. Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) is a popular approach of this type.\nIt uses vectors of 12 real number as 3 first moments of distances from 4\nemphasized points. These coordinates might contain unnecessary correlations and\ndoes not allow to reconstruct the approximated shape. In contrast, spherical\nharmonic (SH) decomposition uses orthogonal coordinates, suggesting their\nindependence and so lager informational content of the feature vector. There is\nusually considered rotationally invariant SH descriptors, what means discarding\nof some essential information.\n  This article discusses framework for descriptors with normalized rotation,\nfor example by using principal component analysis (PCA-SH). As one of the most\ninteresting are ligands which have to slide into a protein, we will introduce\ndescriptors optimized for such flat elongated shapes. Bent deformed cylinder\n(BDC) describes the molecule as a cylinder which was first bent, then deformed\nsuch that its cross-sections became ellipses of evolving shape. Legendre\npolynomials are used to describe the central axis of such bent cylinder.\nAdditional polynomials are used to define evolution of such elliptic\ncross-section along the main axis. There will be also discussed bent\ncylindrical harmonics (BCH), which uses cross-sections described by cylindrical\nharmonics instead of ellipses. All these normalized rotation descriptors allow\nto reconstruct (decode) the approximated representation of the shape, hence can\nbe also used for lossy compression purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 15:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

The underlying\nnetwork architecture is a key aspect that can affect the elastic properties of\nthese systems, which include rich linear and nonlinear elasticity. Existing\ncomputational approaches have focused on both lattice-based and off-lattice\nnetworks obtained from the random placement of rods. It is not obvious, a\npriori, whether the two architectures have fundamentally similar or different\nmechanics. If they are different, it is not clear which of these represents a\nbetter model for biological networks. Here, we show that both approaches are\nessentially equivalent for the same network connectivity, provided the networks\nare sub-isostatic with respect to central force interactions. Moreover, for a\ngiven sub-isostatic connectivity, we even find that lattice-based networks in\nboth 2D and 3D exhibit nearly identical nonlinear elastic response. We provide\na description of the linear mechanics for both architectures in terms of a\nscaling function. We also show that the nonlinear regime is dominated by fiber\nbending and that stiffening originates from the stabilization of sub-isostatic\nnetworks by stress. We propose a generalized relation for this regime in terms\nof the self-generated normal stresses that develop under deformation.

We shed light on the network\nperformance in terms of a) the outage probability and b) the error probability\nof a victim receiver in the downlink of this wireless network. We derive\nanalytical expressions for both these metrics and discuss in detail how the\njammer network must adapt to the various wireless network parameters in order\nto effectively attack the victim receivers. For instance, we will show that\nwith only 1 jammer per BS/AP a) the outage probability of the wireless network\ncan be increased from 1% (as seen in the non-jamming case) to 80% and b) when\nretransmissions are used, the jammers cause the effective network activity\nfactor (and hence the interference among the BSs) to be doubled. Furthermore,\nwe show that the behavior of the jammer network as a function of the BS/AP\ndensity is not obvious. In particular, an interesting concave-type behavior is\nseen which indicates that the number of jammers required to attack the wireless\nnetwork must scale with the BS density only until a certain value beyond which\nit decreases. In the context of error probability of the victim receiver, we\nstudy whether or not some recent results related to jamming in the\npoint-to-point link scenario can be extended to the case of jamming against\nwireless networks.

The self-organisation had been shown, in some sputtering\nexperiments, to be influenced by unexpected contaminants (ions) from vacuum\nwalls. Existing inter-atomic-interaction potentials of Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nsimulations for studying this are unsuitable because they assume two-particle\ncollisions at a time instead of many (including contaminants)-particle\ncollisions (Wider-area Perturbations, (WP)). We designed this study to develop\na suitable potential that incorporates WP of the MD. We developed the general\npotential to account for the possibility of WP due to contaminants (both\nforeign and local to the material) consequently shifting the eqiulibrium points\nof the MD the material. For instance, dynamics of Au and Fe were studied with O\nbombardments/contamination (oxygenated environments), and those of CSiGe were\nstudied with W, Ti, and O. It was found that the phase-shift, of the\neqiulibrium points of the MD simulations, for Au stabilised for just five atoms\nof oxygen while that of Fe did not, when interacting in separate oxygenated\nenvironments. A different phase shift was recorded for CSiGe which reflected\nthe usage of different contaminants, under subsequent bombardments with W, Ti\nand O, in transformations to CSiGeW, CSiGeWTi, and CSiGeWTiO. These results and\nthose for the sampled superconducting materials, such as SrNdCuO and LiFeAs,\nshowed a sensitivity of the general potential, and insensitivity of the\nexisting potentials, to the type and environment of the atoms of these\nmaterials.

In\nparticular we study such a device in the context of the backpropagation\nalgorithm, which is commonly used for training neural networks. Here, the\nweights of the connections between neurons are trained by multiplying a\n`forward' signal with a backwards propagating `error' signal. We show that this\nconcept can be extended to trainable media, where the gradient for the local\nwave number is given by multiplying signal waves and error waves. We provide a\nnumerical example of such a system with waves traveling freely in a trainable\nmedium, and we discuss a potential way to build such a device in an integrated\nphotonics chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 14:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}
