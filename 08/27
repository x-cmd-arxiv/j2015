Here we present and\nanalyze a scheme for synchronizing chaotic dynamical systems by transiently\nuncoupling them. Specifically, systems coupled only in a fraction of their\nstate space may synchronize even if fully coupled they do not. Although, for\nmany standard systems, coupling strengths need to be bounded to ensure\nsynchrony, transient uncoupling removes this bound and thus enables\nsynchronization in an infinite range of effective coupling strengths. The\npresented coupling scheme thus opens up the possibility to induce synchrony in\n(biological or technical) systems whose parameters are fixed and cannot be\nmodified continuously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 16:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

We use computer simulation approach to the study of CAF\nactivity by searching for its possible complexes with biopolymer fragments. The\nprincipal CAF target at physiologically important concentrations refers to\nadenosine receptors. It is a common opinion that CAF is a competitive\nantagonist of adenosine. At the first step to molecular level elucidation of\nCAF action, we have found a set of the minima of the interaction energy between\nCAF and the fragments of human A1 adenosine receptor. Molecular mechanics is\nthe main method for the calculations of the energy of interactions between CAF\nand the biopolymer fragments. We use the Monte Carlo simulation to follow\nvarious mutual arrangements of CAF molecule near the receptor. It appears that\nthe deepest energy minima refer to hydrogen-bond formation of CAF with amino\nacid residues involved in interactions with adenosine, its agonists and\nantagonists. The results suggest that the formation of such CAF-receptor\ncomplexes enforced by a close packing of CAF and the receptor fragments is the\nreason of CAF actions on nervous system. CAF can block the atomic groups of the\nadenosine repressors responsible for the interactions with adenosine, not\nnecessary by the formation of H bonds with them, but simply hide these groups\nfrom the interactions with adenosine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 16:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

To overcome this limitation, this work considers an\narchitecture based on the separation of control and data planes, in which\nretransmission control decisions are made at the edge of the network, that is,\nby the RRHs or User Equipments (UEs), while data decoding is carried out\nremotely at the BBUs.

For this system, the control-data separation\nleverages low-latency local feedback from an RRH to drive the HARQ process of a\ngiven UE.

Our results of numerical simulations for periodic arrays\nof spherical nanoparticles on top of amorphous silicon show that both silicon\nand silver nanoparticle coatings demonstrate strong anti-reflective properties\nin the visible spectral range. In this work, we show for the first time that\nblooming effect, that is zero reflection from the structure, with silicon\ncoatings originates from the interference of electric- and magnetic-dipole\nresponses of nanoparticles with the wave reflected from the substrate, and we\nrefer to it as substrate-mediated Kerker effect. For the silver coating, our\nresults agree with previously observed substrate-induced bi-anisotropy and\nblooming, caused by substrate-induced magnetic response. Finally, we\nnumerically show high effectiveness of silicon and silver coatings for the\napplication in thin-film photovoltaic elements, which is related to the\nsuppression of reflection from the high-index substrate and increased light\nabsorbance in the active layer with coating. Depending on the nanoparticle\nsize, either silicon or silver coating is more efficient, and overall increase\nof absorption up to 30% can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 17:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-04"}

A non-linear stress-strain response of fibrin consists of three\nregimes: 1) an initial linear regime, in which most fibers are straight, 2) a\nplateau regime, in which more and more fibers buckle and collapse, and 3) a\nmarkedly non-linear regime, in which network densification occurs {{by bending\nof buckled fibers}} and inter-fiber contacts. Importantly, the spatially\nnon-uniform network deformation included formation of a moving \"compression\nfront\" along the axis of strain, which segregated the fibrin network into\ncompartments with different fiber densities and structure. The Young's modulus\nof the linear phase depends quadratically on the fibrin volume fraction while\nthat in the densified phase depends cubically on it. The viscoelastic plateau\nregime corresponds to a mixture of these two phases in which the fractions of\nthe two phases change during compression. We model this regime using a\ncontinuum theory of phase transitions and analytically predict the storage and\nloss moduli which are in good agreement with the experimental data. Our work\nshows that fibrin networks are a member of a broad class of natural cellular\nmaterials which includes cancellous bone, wood and cork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 17:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

If all processors have the same input value, then they\nmust all decide this value. We study the task of consensus in a Multiple Access\nChannel (MAC) prone to faults, under a very weak communication model called the\n$\\mathit{beeping\\ model}$. Communication proceeds in synchronous rounds. Some\nprocessors wake up spontaneously, in possibly different rounds decided by an\nadversary. In each round, an awake processor can either listen, i.e., stay\nsilent, or beep, i.e., emit a signal. In each round, a fault can occur in the\nchannel independently with constant probability $0<p<1$. In a fault-free round,\nan awake processor hears a beep if it listens in this round and if one or more\nother processors beep in this round. A processor still dormant in a fault-free\nround in which some other processor beeps is woken up by this beep and hears\nit. In a faulty round nothing is heard, regardless of the behaviour of the\nprocessors.\n  An algorithm working with error probability at most $\\epsilon$, for a given\n$\\epsilon>0$, is called $\\epsilon$-$\\mathit{safe}$.

In the present investigation, the previously developed\nmodel is applied to the planets and important satellites of the Sun. A key\ncomponent of the model involves resonance associated with SRMA. Through this\nresonance, thermal energy is extracted from the protosun's protoplanetary disk\nat specific distances from the protosun wherever there is a match between the\nlocal thermal energy of the disk and the energy of photons impinging on the\ndisk.

To achieve fields strong enough to seed the\ngalactic dynamo, most of the mechanisms operate outside conventional\nelectromagnetic theory. The latter is typically restored after the end of the\nde Sitter phase. Breaking away from standard electromagnetism can lead to\nsubstantially stronger magnetic fields by the end of inflation, thus\ncompensating for the their subsequent adiabatic depletion. We argue that the\ndrastic magnetic enhancement during the de Sitter era may no longer be\nnecessary because, contrary to the widespread perception, superhorizon-sized\nmagnetic fields decay at a slower pace after inflation. The principle behind\nthis claim is causality, which confines the post-inflationary electric currents\ninside the horizon. Without the currents there can be no magnetic-flux freezing\non super-Hubble lengths. There, the magnetic decay-rate slows down, thus making\nit much easier to produce primordial fields of astrophysical interest. To\nquantify this qualitative statement, one can start from the current\ngalactic-dynamo requirements and `reverse engineer' the magnetic strengths\nneeded at the end of inflation, in order to produce astrophysically relevant\nresidual seeds today. Our results suggest that, depending on the magnetic\nscale, mechanisms of inflationary magnetogenesis generating fields stronger\nthan $10^{17}$ G by the end of the de Sitter phase, could successfully seed the\ngalactic dynamo at present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 18:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 19:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Unfortunately, known algorithms\nfor an expressive logic like MTL (Metric Temporal Logic) do not scale with\nrespect to two crucial dimensions: the length of the trace and the size of the\ntime interval for which logged events must be buffered to check satisfaction of\nthe specification. The former issue can be addressed by distributed and\nparallel trace checking algorithms that can take advantage of modern cloud\ncomputing and programming frameworks like MapReduce. Still, the latter issue\nremains open with current state-of-the-art approaches.\n  In this paper we address this memory scalability issue by proposing a new\nsemantics for MTL, called lazy semantics. This semantics can evaluate temporal\nformulae and boolean combinations of temporal-only formulae at any arbitrary\ntime instant. We prove that lazy semantics is more expressive than standard\npoint-based semantics and that it can be used as a basis for a correct\nparametric decomposition of any MTL formula into an equivalent one with\nsmaller, bounded time intervals.

Ascertaining the identity\nof the devices is a key technical challenge that must be overcome to thwart the\nthreat of PUE attacks. Typically, detection of PUE attacks is done by\ninspecting the signals coming from all the devices in the system, and then\nusing these signals to form unique fingerprints for each device. Current\ndetection and fingerprinting approaches require certain conditions to hold in\norder to effectively detect attackers. Such conditions include the need for a\nsufficient amount of fingerprint data for users or the existence of both the\nattacker and the victim PU within the same time frame. These conditions are\nnecessary because current methods lack the ability to learn the behavior of\nboth SUs and PUs with time. In this paper, a novel transfer learning (TL)\napproach is proposed, in which abstract knowledge about PUs and SUs is\ntransferred from past time frames to improve the detection process at future\ntime frames. The proposed approach extracts a high level representation for the\nenvironment at every time frame. This high level information is accumulated to\nform an abstract knowledge database. The CR system then utilizes this database\nto accurately detect PUE attacks even if an insufficient amount of fingerprint\ndata is available at the current time frame. The dynamic structure of the\nproposed approach uses the final detection decisions to update the abstract\nknowledge database for future runs.

However, the availability and quality of the data vary\nwidely, which leads to biased and unreliable estimates for areas with very few\ndata. We propose to overcome this issue by introducing the dependence of the\nparameters across areas in a mixture model. The joint distribution of the\nparameters in multiple areas can be approximated directly from the results of\nindependent fits without needing to refit the data or unpack the software. As a\nresult, the mixture model has better predictive ability than the independent\nmodel as shown in examples of multiple countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 19:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

To avoid these conflicts, we introduce a novel IDNC graph\nthat represents all feasible coding and transmission conflict-free decisions in\none unified framework. Moreover, a real-time video sequence has a hard deadline\nand unequal importance of video packets. Using these video characteristics and\nthe new IDNC graph, we formulate the problem of minimizing the mean video\ndistortion before the deadline as a finite horizon Markov decision process\n(MDP) problem. However, the backward induction algorithm that finds the optimal\npolicy of the MDP formulation has high modelling and computational\ncomplexities.

One of the most fundamental issues is to\nwhich extent these properties can be described by the superexchange (SE) model,\nformulated in the limit of the large Coulomb repulsion. In the present work we\naddress this issue by deriving the relevant models and extracting parameters of\nthese models from the first-principles calculations. First, we construct the\neffective Hubbard-type model for the t2g bands, by recasting the problem in the\nlanguage of Wannier orbitals. Then, we map the obtained electron model onto the\npseudospin model by applying the theory of SE interactions. We discuss the\nmicroscopic origin of anisotropic SE interactions, inherent to the compass\nHeisenberg model, and the appearance of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nterm, associated with the additional rotation of the IrO6 octahedra in Sr2IrO4.\nIn order to evaluate the Neel temperature (TN), we employ the non-linear sigma\nmodel. While for Sr2IrO4 our value of TN agrees with the experimental one, for\nBa2IrO4 it is overestimated by a factor two. We argue that this discrepancy is\nrelated to limitations of the SE model: while for more localized t2g states in\nSr2IrO4 it works reasonably well, the higher-order terms, beyond the SE model,\nplay a more important role in the more \"itinerant\" Ba2IrO4, giving rise to the\nnew type of isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions. This conclusion is\nsupported by unrestricted Hartree-Fock calculations for the same electron\nmodel, where in the case of Ba2IrO4, already on the mean-field level, we were\nable to reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic ground state, while for\nSr2IrO4 the main results are essentially the same as in the SE model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 07:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The conventional wisdom is to write down an\nuncorrelated state as if the system and the bath were prepared in the absence\nof each other; yet, such a factorized state cannot be the exact description in\nthe presence of system-bath interactions. Here, we show how to go beyond the\nsimplistic factorized-state prescription using ideas from quantum tomography:\nWe employ the maximum-entropy principle to deduce an initial system- bath state\nconsistent with the available information. For the generic case of weak\ninteractions, we obtain an explicit formula for the correction to the\nfactorized state.

Here, we present a\nprobabilistic framework for diffusion in networks and propose to classify agent\ninteractions according to two protocols where the total network quantity is\nconserved or variable. For both protocols, our focus is on asymmetric\ninteractions between agents involving directed graphs. Specifically, we define\nhow the dynamics of conservative and non-conservative networks relate to the\nweighted in-degree Laplacian and the weighted out-degree Laplacian. Our\nframework allows the addition and subtraction of the considered quantity to and\nfrom a set of nodes. This enables the modeling of stubborn agents with\ntime-invariant quantities, and the process of dynamic learning. We highlight\nseveral stability and convergence characteristics of our framework, and define\nthe conditions under which asymptotic convergence is guaranteed when the\nnetwork topology is variable. In addition, we indicate how our framework\naccommodates external network control and targeted network design. We show how\nnetwork diffusion can be externally manipulated by applying time-varying input\nfunctions at individual nodes. Desirable network structures can also be\nconstructed by adjusting the dominant diffusion modes. To this purpose, we\npropose a Markov decision process that learns these network adjustments through\na reinforcement learning algorithm, suitable for large networks.

Ideally, the discharge\nparameters of the scaled plasmas are predictable and the fundamental physical\nprocesses are unaltered. Naturally, there are limitations and ranges of\nvalidity. Scaling laws for direct current glow discharges are well known. If a\nwell diagnosed discharge is scaled, the field strength in the positive column,\nthe gas amplification and the normal current density can easily be estimated.\nFor non-stationary high power discharges like high power impulse magnetron\nsputtering (HiPIMS) plasmas, scaling is not as straight forward. Here, one\ndeals with a non-stationary complex system with strong changes in plasma\nchemistry and symmetry breaks during the pulses. Because of the huge parameter\nspace no good parameters are available to define these kind of discharges\nunambiguous at the moment.

Our method is to compare the 14-C variation around AD\n775 with other periods of strong variability. Our results are: (a) We see three\nperiods, where 14-C varied over 200 yr in a special way showing a certain\npattern of strong secular variation: after a Grand Minimum with strongly\nincreasing 14-C, there is a series of strong short-term drop(s), rise(s), and\nagain drop(s) within 60 yr, ending up to 200 yr after the start of the Grand\nMinimum. These three periods include the strong rises around BC 671, AD 775,\nand AD 1795. (b) We show with several solar activity proxies (radioisotopes,\nsunspots, and aurorae) for the AD 770s and 1790s that such intense rapid 14-C\nincreases can be explained by strong rapid decreases in solar activity and,\nhence, wind, so that the decrease in solar modulation potential leads to an\nincrease in radioisotope production. (c) The strong rises around AD 775 and\n1795 are due to three effects, (i) very strong activity in the previous cycles\n(i.e. very low 14-C level), (ii) the declining phase of a very strong Schwabe\ncycle, and (iii) a phase of very weak activity after the strong 14-C rise --\nvery short and/or weak cycle(s) like the suddenly starting Dalton minimum. (d)\nFurthermore, we can show that the strong change at AD 1795 happened after a\npair of two packages of four Schwabe cycles with certain hemispheric leadership\n(each package consists of two Gnevyshev-Ohl pairs, respectively two\nHale-Babcock pairs).

Under this model, the EE problem is non-convex in general due to the\ncoupled interference and its fractional form, and thus it is difficult to solve\nthe problem. Conventional algorithms which address this problem have adopted an\niterative method for each channel realization, which requires high\ncomputational complexity. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we\nparameterize the beamforming vector by scalar parameters related to beam\ndirection and power. Then, by employing asymptotic results of random matrix\ntheory with this parametrization, we identify the optimal parameters to\nmaximize the EE in the large system limit assuming that the number of transmit\nantennas and users are large with a fixed ratio. In the asymptotic regime, our\nsolutions depend only on the second order channel statistics, which yields\nsignificantly reduced computational complexity and system overhead compared to\nthe conventional approaches. Hence, the beamforming vector to maximize the EE\nperformance can be determined with local channel state information and the\noptimized parameters. Based on the asymptotic results, the proposed scheme can\nprovide insights on the average EE performance, and a simple yet efficient\nbeamforming strategy is introduced for the finite system case. Numerical\nresults confirm that the proposed scheme shows a negligible performance loss\ncompared to the best result achieved by the conventional approaches even with\nsmall system dimensions, with much reduced system complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 08:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

Each project k is characterized by a valuation\nfunction; v_k(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project\nk. We study the following classic problem in this setting: \"how should the\nagents divide the value that they collectively create?\". One traditional\napproach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the\nimplicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents\ncan partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we\nconsider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes\ncomputing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial.\n  The main contribution of this paper is a black-box mechanism that reduces the\nproblem of computing a near-optimal core stable solution to the purely\nalgorithmic problem of welfare maximization; we apply this to compute an\napproximately core stable solution that extracts one-fourth of the optimal\nsocial welfare for the class of subadditive valuations.

Currently, significant engineering efforts are undertaken in order to\nenable existing programming languages to perform heterogeneous execution mainly\non GPUs. In this paper we describe Jacc, an experimental framework which allows\ndevelopers to program GPGPUs directly from Java. By using the Jacc framework,\ndevelopers have the ability to add GPGPU support into their applications with\nminimal code refactoring.\n  To simplify the development of GPGPU applications we allow developers to\nmodel heterogeneous code using two key abstractions: \\textit{tasks}, which\nencapsulate all the information needed to execute code on a GPGPU; and\n\\textit{task graphs}, which capture the inter-task control-flow of the\napplication. Using this information the Jacc runtime is able to automatically\nhandle data movement and synchronization between the host and the GPGPU;\neliminating the need for explicitly managing disparate memory spaces.\n  In order to generate highly parallel GPGPU code, Jacc provides developers\nwith the ability to decorate key aspects of their code using annotations. The\ncompiler, in turn, exploits this information in order to automatically generate\ncode without requiring additional code refactoring.\n  Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of Jacc, both in terms of\nprogrammability and performance, by evaluating it against existing Java\nframeworks.

On an abstract, algorithmic\nlevel, nonlinear Bayesian filtering, i.e. the estimation of temporally changing\nsignals based on the history of observations, provides a mathematical framework\nfor dynamic perception in real time. Since the general, nonlinear filtering\nproblem is analytically intractable, particle filters are considered among the\nmost powerful approaches to approximating the solution numerically. Yet, these\nalgorithms prevalently rely on importance weights, and thus it remains an\nunresolved question how the brain could implement such an inference strategy\nwith a neuronal population. Here, we propose the Neural Particle Filter (NPF),\na weight-less particle filter that can be interpreted as the neuronal dynamics\nof a recurrently connected neural network that receives feed-forward input from\nsensory neurons and represents the posterior probability distribution in terms\nof samples. Specifically, this algorithm bridges the gap between the\ncomputational task of online state estimation and an implementation that allows\nnetworks of neurons in the brain to perform nonlinear Bayesian filtering. The\nmodel captures not only the properties of temporal and multisensory integration\naccording to Bayesian statistics, but also allows online learning with a\nmaximum likelihood approach. With an example from multisensory integration, we\ndemonstrate that the numerical performance of the model is adequate to account\nfor both filtering and identification problems.

When the compiler detects a type\nerror, it typically reports the program location where the type checking failed\nas the source of the error. Since other error sources are not even considered,\nthe actual root cause is often missed. A more adequate approach is to consider\nall possible error sources and report the most useful one subject to some\nusefulness criterion. In our previous work, we showed that this approach can be\nformulated as an optimization problem related to satisfiability modulo theories\n(SMT). This formulation cleanly separates the heuristic nature of usefulness\ncriteria from the underlying search problem. Unfortunately, algorithms that\nsearch for an optimal error source cannot directly use principal types which\nare crucial for dealing with the exponential-time complexity of the decision\nproblem of polymorphic type checking. In this paper, we present a new algorithm\nthat efficiently finds an optimal error source in a given ill-typed program.\nOur algorithm uses an improved SMT encoding to cope with the high complexity of\npolymorphic typing by iteratively expanding the typing constraints from which\nprincipal types are derived. The algorithm preserves the clean separation\nbetween the heuristics and the actual search. We have implemented our algorithm\nfor OCaml.

Recent work showed that when selective\nenvironments vary in a systematic manner, it is possible that development can\nconstrain the phenotypic space in regions that are evolutionarily more\nadvantageous. Yet, the underlying mechanism that enables the spontaneous\nemergence of such adaptive developmental constraints is poorly understood. How\ncan natural selection, given its myopic and conservative nature, favour\ndevelopmental organisations that facilitate adaptive evolution in future\npreviously unseen environments? Such capacity suggests a form of\n\\textit{foresight} facilitated by the ability of evolution to accumulate and\nexploit information not only about the particular phenotypes selected in the\npast, but regularities in the environment that are also relevant to future\nenvironments. Here we argue that the ability of evolution to discover such\nregularities is analogous to the ability of learning systems to generalise from\npast experience. Conversely, the canalisation of evolved developmental\nprocesses to past selective environments and failure of natural selection to\nenhance evolvability in future selective environments is directly analogous to\nthe problem of over-fitting and failure to generalise in machine learning. We\nshow that this analogy arises from an underlying mechanistic equivalence by\nshowing that conditions corresponding to those that alleviate over-fitting in\nmachine learning enhance the evolution of generalised developmental\norganisations under natural selection. This equivalence provides access to a\nwell-developed theoretical framework that enables us to characterise the\nconditions where natural selection will find general rather than particular\nsolutions to environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 13:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

On the other hand, it is well-known that dynamical systems with\nmany degrees of freedom are irregular in all but special cases. The best\ndeveloped framework for studying the breakdown of regularity and the onset is\nthe Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. Here, we use a numerical version of\nthe KAM procedure to construct regular orbits (tori) and locate irregular\norbits (broken tori). Irregular orbits are most often classified in\nastronomical dynamics by their exponential divergence using Lyapunov exponents.\nAlthough their computation is numerically challenging, the procedure is\nstraightforward and they are often used to estimate the measure of regularity.\nThe numerical KAM approach has several advantages: 1) it provides the\nmorphology of perturbed orbits; 2) its constructive nature allows the tori to\nbe used as basis for studying secular evolution; 3) for broken tori, clues to\nthe cause of the irregularity may be found by studying the largest, diverging\nFourier terms; and 4) it is more likely to detect weak chaos and orbits close\nto bifurcation.

Strongly enhanced electric fields trigger electron field\nemission and atom evaporation from the apexes of the nanotips. Combined\ntogether, these processes may explain electric discharges in form of small\nlocal arcs observed near metal surfaces in the presence of electric fields even\nin ultra high vacuum conditions. In the present work we investigate the\nstability of nanoscale tips by means of computer simulations of surface\ndiffusion processes on copper (Cu), the main material of high voltage\nelectronics. We study the stability and life-time of thin Cu surface nanotips\nat different temperatures in terms of diffusion processes. For this purpose, we\nhave developed a surface Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model where the jump\nprocesses are described by tabulated precalculated energy barriers. We show\nthat tall surface features with high aspect ratios can be fairly stable at room\ntemperature. However, the stability was found to depend strongly on the\ntemperature: 13 nm nanotips with the major axes in the <110> crystallographic\ndirections were found to flatten down to half of the original height in less\nthan 100 ns at temperatures close to the melting point, whereas no significant\nchange in the height of these nanotips was observed after 10 $\\mu$s at room\ntemperature. Moreover, the nanotips built up along the <110> crystallographic\ndirections were found significantly more stable than those oriented in the\n<100> or <111> crystallographic directions. The proposed KMC model has been\nfound well suited for simulating atomic surfaces processes and was validated\nagainst Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation results via the comparison of the\nflattening times obtained by both methods. We also note that the KMC\nsimulations were two orders of magnitude computationally faster than the\ncorresponding MD calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 14:23:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 09:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 13:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

While the latter event took place early in AD 774 (dated AD\n773 in Usoskin et al. 2013), the two other sightings have to be dated AD 776,\ni.e. anyway too late for being in connection with a 14-C rise that started\nbefore AD 775. We also sketch the ideological background of those sightings and\nthere were many similar reports throughout that time. In addition, we present a\nsmall drawing of a lunar halo display with horizontal arc and vertical pillar\nforming a cross for shortly later, namely AD 806 June 4, the night of full\nmoon, also from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; we also show historic drawings of\nsolar and lunar halo crosses from G.
