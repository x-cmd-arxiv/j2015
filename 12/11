For generic values of the couplings, the model reproduces the\nminimal Standard Model, with a massless axion and all the other degrees of\nfreedom at a very high scale. However, in some scenarios, the extra Higgses\ncould be relatively light. We use the oblique corrections, in particular\n$\\Delta\\rho$, to constrain the mass spectrum in this case.

In this paper, we\nconsider two dark matter models---Late Forming Dark Matter (LFDM) and\nUltra-Light Axion (ULA) models---where the matter power spectra show novel\neffects on small scales. The high redshift universe offers a powerful probe of\ntheir parameters. In particular, we study two cosmological observables: the\nneutral hydrogen (HI) redshifted 21-cm signal from the epoch of reionization,\nand the evolution of the collapsed fraction of HI in the redshift range $2 < z\n< 5$. We model the theoretical predictions of the models using CDM-like N-body\nsimulations with modified initial conditions, and generate reionization fields\nusing an excursion-set model. The N-body approximation is valid on the length\nand halo mass scales studied.\n  We show that LFDM and ULA models predict an increase in the HI power spectrum\nfrom the epoch of reionization by a factor between 2--10 for a range of scales\n$0.1<k<4 \\, \\rm Mpc^{-1}$.

A lensing phenomenology is\nalso presented for some samples of galaxies, which previously were known to\nprovide tension for modified gravity (TeVeS) models. The current model is found\nin agreement with these lensing data. Then we discuss a cosmic evolution for\nthe D-material universe by analysing the conditions under which the late eras\nof this universe associated with large-scale structure are connected to early\nepochs, where inflation takes place. It is shown that inflation is induced by\ndense populations of D-particles in the early universe, with the role of the\ninflaton field played by the condensate of the D-particle recoil-velocity\nfields under their interaction with relativistic stringy matter, only for\nsufficiently large brane tensions and low string mass scales compared to the\nHubble scale. On the other hand, for large string scales, where the\nrecoil-velocity condensate fields are weak, inflation cannot be driven by the\nD-particle defects alone. In such cases inflation may be driven by dilaton (or\nother moduli) fields in the underlying string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 17:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 14:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is\nensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the\nlatter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional\nscalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology. The particles\nunder discussion share many features with the well-known candidates wino,\nHiggsino, inert doublet scalar, sneutrino, and Minimal Dark Matter. In\nparticular, they all predict a large gamma-ray flux from dark matter\nannihilations, which can be searched for with Cherenkov telescopes. We\nfurthermore discuss models with unequal left-right gauge couplings, $g_R \\neq\ng_L$, taking the recent experimental hints for a charged gauge boson with 2 TeV\nmass as a benchmark point. In this case, the dark matter mass is determined by\nthe observed relic density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 17:28:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 13:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

Near the extensional stagnation point the flow\nstretches and aligns polymers along the outgoing streamlines of the stagnation\npoint resulting in a stress-island, or birefringent strand. The polymer stress\ndiffusion coefficient is used, both, as an asymptotic parameter and a\nregularization parameter. The structure of the singular part of polymer stress\ntensor is a Gaussian aligned with the incoming streamline of the stagnation\npoint; a smoothed $\\delta$-distribution whose width is proportional to the\nsquare-root of the diffusion coefficient. The amplitude of the stress island\nscales with the Wiessenberg number and, although singular in the limit of\nvanishing diffusion, it is integrable in the cross stream direction due to its\nvanishing width; this yields a convergent secondary flow. The leading order\nvelocity response to this stress island is constructed and shown to be {\\em\nindependent} of the diffusion coefficient in the limit. The secondary\ncirculation counteracts the forced flow and has a vorticity jump at the\nlocation of the stress islands, essentially expelling the background vorticity\nfrom the location of the birefringent strands.

It\nremains unclear whether this reflects observational uncertainties or intrinsic\nastrophysical scatter arising from physical conditions in the ISM at early\ntimes. Aims: Measure differential chemical abundance ratios in extremely\nmetal-poor stars to investigate the limits of precision and to understand\nwhether cosmic scatter or observational errors are dominant. Methods: We used\nhigh resolution (R $\\sim 95,000$) and high S/N (S/N $= 700$ at 5000$\\AA$)\nHIRES/Keck spectra, to determine high precision differential abundances between\ntwo extremely metal-poor stars through a line-by-line differential approach. We\ndetermined stellar parameters for the star G64-37 with respect to the standard\nstar G64-12. We performed EW measurements for the two stars for the lines\nrecognized in both stars and performed spectral synthesis to study the carbon\nabundances. Results: The differential approach allowed us to obtain errors of\n$\\sigma$(T$_{eff}$ ) $=$ 27 K, $\\sigma$(log $g$) $=$ 0.06 dex, $\\sigma$([Fe/H])\n$=$ 0.02 dex and $\\sigma$(v$_{t}$ ) $=$ 0.06 kms$^{-1}$. We estimated relative\nchemical abundances with a precision as low as $\\sigma$([X/Fe]) $\\approx$ 0.01\ndex. The small uncertainties demonstrate that there are genuine abundance\ndifferences larger than the measurement errors. The observed Li difference can\nnot be explained by the difference in mass, because the less massive star has\nmore Li. Conclusions: It is possible to achieve an abundance precision around\n$\\approx$ 0.01-0.05 dex for extremely metal-poor stars, opening new windows on\nthe study of the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 18:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Then we study the effect over the quantum correlations of a\nmass imbalance between the impurity and the bosons. In the strongly interacting\ncase, we discover that when the impurity is much heavier than the bosons, then\nwe have the least possible correlation. However, the entropy tops its maximum\nwhen the mass ratio is between 3 and 4 in the case where there are four bosonic\nparticles and then falls off to its minimum for higher mass imbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 19:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 17:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

For superconformal theories, this partition function coincides (up to a\nCasimir energy factor) with the 4d superconformal index.\n  The partition function can be computed exactly using supersymmetric\nlocalization of the gauge theory path-integral.

Distance measures have been used as natural\nmeasures of (dis)similarity and served as the foundation of various learning\nmethods. The efficiency of distance-based learning methods heavily depends on\nthe chosen distance metric. With increasing dimensionality and complexity of\ndata, however, traditional metric learning methods suffer from poor scalability\nand the limitation due to linearity as the true signals are usually embedded\nwithin a low-dimensional nonlinear subspace. In this paper, we propose a\nnonlinear sparse metric learning algorithm via boosting. We restructure a\nglobal optimization problem into a forward stage-wise learning of weak learners\nbased on a rank-one decomposition of the weight matrix in the Mahalanobis\ndistance metric. A gradient boosting algorithm is devised to obtain a sparse\nrank-one update of the weight matrix at each step. Nonlinear features are\nlearned by a hierarchical expansion of interactions incorporated within the\nboosting algorithm. Meanwhile, an early stopping rule is imposed to control the\noverall complexity of the learned metric. As a result, our approach guarantees\nthree desirable properties of the final metric: positive semi-definiteness, low\nrank and element-wise sparsity. Numerical experiments show that our learning\nmodel compares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods in the current\nliterature of metric learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 20:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-11"}

We then apply our method to the 2MASS survey and present a\npublicly available full-sky map of the projected tidal forces in the local\nUniverse. As an example of an application of these data we further study the\ndistribution of galaxy luminosities across the different elements of the cosmic\nweb, finding that, while more luminous objects are found preferentially in the\nmost dense environments, there is no further segregation by tidal environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 20:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

However, a fundamental flaw in the partitioning (or splitting)\nrule of commonly used tree building methods precludes them from treating\ndifferent types of variables equally. This most clearly manifests in these\nmethods' inability to properly utilize categorical variables with a large\nnumber of categories, which are ubiquitous in the new age of big data. Such\nvariables can often be very informative, but current tree methods essentially\nleave us a choice of either not using them, or exposing our models to severe\noverfitting. We propose a conceptual framework to splitting using leave-one-out\n(LOO) cross validation for selecting the splitting variable, then performing a\nregular split (in our case, following CART's approach) for the selected\nvariable. The most important consequence of our approach is that categorical\nvariables with many categories can be safely used in tree building and are only\nchosen if they contribute to predictive power. We demonstrate in extensive\nsimulation and real data analysis that our novel splitting approach\nsignificantly improves the performance of both single tree models and ensemble\nmethods that utilize trees. Importantly, we design an algorithm for LOO\nsplitting variable selection which under reasonable assumptions does not\nincrease the overall computational complexity compared to CART for two-class\nclassification.

Most bar orbits arising from the x1 orbit have little\nnet angular momentum in the bar frame making them equivalent to box orbits in\nrotating triaxial potentials. A small fraction of bar orbits (~7%) are long\naxis tubes that behave exactly like those in triaxial ellipsoids:they are\ntipped about the intermediate-axis due to the Coriolis force, with the sense of\ntipping determined by the sign of their angular momentum about the long axis.\nNo orbits parented by prograde periodic x2 orbits are found in the pure bar\nmodel, but a tiny population (~2%) of short axis tube orbits parented by\nretrograde x4 orbits are found.

In this context, the Fisher matrix of the exponential family and\na lower bound for arbitrary probabilistic models are discussed.

Moreover: (i) the peak rail capacity of Port Botany is 1.78\nmillion TEU per annum; over six times higher than 2011/12 rail volumes; (ii)\nthere are no infrastructural impediments to the achievement of peak rail\ncapacity; (iii) operational changes, not infrastructural investment, are the\nkey to unlocking the potential of the port; (iv) Port Botany is well positioned\nto handle projected increases in container volumes over the next decade and\nbeyond, including the 28% rail mode share target established by the New South\nWales State Government.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 22:52:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 01:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

It is nonobtuse if none its dihedral angles is obtuse, and\nacute if additionally none of them is right. Acute 0/1-simplices in I^n can be\nrepresented by 0/1-matrices P of size n x n whose Gramians have an inverse that\nis strictly diagonally dominant, with negative off-diagonal entries.\n  In this paper, we will prove that the positive part D of the transposed\ninverse of P is doubly stochastic and has the same support as P. The negated\nnegative part C of P^-T is strictly row-substochastic and its support is\ncomplementary to that of D, showing that P^-T=D-C has no zero entries and has\npositive row sums. As a consequence, for each facet F of an acute 0/1-facet S\nthere exists at most one other acute 0/1-simplex T in I^n having F as a facet.\nWe call T the acute neighbor of S at F.\n  If P represents a 0/1-simplex that is merely nonobtuse, P^-T can have entries\nequal to zero. Its positive part D is still doubly stochastic, but its support\nmay be strictly contained in the support of P. This allows P to be partly\ndecomposable. In theory, this might cause a nonobtuse 0/1-simplex S to have\nseveral nonobtuse neighbors at each of its facets.\n  Next, we study nonobtuse 0/1-simplices S having a partly decomposable matrix\nrepresentation P. We prove that such a simplex also has a block diagonal matrix\nrepresentation with at least two diagonal blocks, and show that a nonobtuse\nsimplex with partly decomposable matrix representation can be split in mutually\northogonal fully indecomposable simplicial facets whose dimensions add up to n.\nUsing this insight, we are able to extend the one neighbor theorem for acute\nsimplices to a larger class of nonobtuse simplices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 23:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-14"}

However, most existing schemes use the\nassumption that a buyer pays the same price per unit of energy to all suppliers\nat any particular time when energy is bought. By contrast, here a discriminate\npricing technique using game theory is studied. A cake cutting game is\ninvestigated, in which participating EUs in a smart community decide on the\nprice per unit of energy to charge a shared facility controller (SFC) in order\nto sell surplus energy. The focus is to study fairness criteria to maximize sum\nbenefits to EUs and ensure an envy-free energy trading market. A benefit\nfunction is designed that leverages generation of discriminate pricing by each\nEU, according to the amount of surplus energy that an EU trades with the SFC\nand the EU's sensitivity to price. It is shown that the game possesses a\nsocially optimal, and hence also Pareto optimal, solution. Further, an\nalgorithm that can be implemented by each EU in a distributed manner to reach\nthe optimal solution is proposed.

Contrastingly, modeless cavity-free\nrandom lasers provide new possibilities for high quantum efficiency lasing that\ncould potentially be widely tunable spectrally and temporally. Pulse generation\nin random lasers, however, has remained elusive since the discovery of modeless\ngain lasing. Here we report coherent pulse generation with modeless random\nlasers based on the unique polarization selectivity and broadband saturable\nabsorption of monolayer graphene. Simultaneous temporal compression of\ncavity-free pulses are observed with such a polarization modulation, along with\na broadly-tunable pulsewidth across two orders of magnitude down to 900 ps, a\nbroadly-tunable repetition rate across three orders of magnitude up to 3 MHz,\nand a singly-polarized pulse train at 41 dB extinction ratio, about an order of\nmagnitude larger than conventional pulsed fiber lasers. Moreover, our\ngraphene-based pulse formation also demonstrates robust pulse-to-pulse\nstability and wide-wavelength operation due to the cavity-less feature. Such a\ngraphene-based architecture not only provides a tunable pulsed random laser for\nfiber-optic sensing, speckle-free imaging, and laser-material processing, but\nalso a new way for the non-random CW fiber lasers to generate widely tunable\nand singly-polarized pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 04:09:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 23:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

The half-mode mass in the WDM power spectrum of our simulations\nis Mf= 2x 10^10 Msun. In the dark matter only simulations halo density profiles\nare well described by the NFW parametric fit in both cosmologies, though the\nWDM halos have concentrations lower by factors 1.5--2.0 than their CDM\ncounterparts. In the hydrodynamic simulations, the effects of baryons\nsignificantly flatten the inner density, velocity dispersion, and pseudo\nphase-space density profiles of the WDM halos but not of the CDM ones. The\ndensity slope measured at ~ 0.02xRv, alpha, becomes shallow in periods of 2 to\n5 Gyr in the WDM runs. We explore whether this flattening process correlates\nwith the global SF, Ms/Mv ratio, gas outflow, and internal specific angular\nmomentum histories. We do not find any clear trends but when alpha is shallower\nthan -0.5, Ms/Mv is always between 0.25 and 1%.

We find that under the resonant DD condition the sensor\ncoherence patterns, as functions of the two independent pulse numbers of DD\nsubsequences, can fully determine different types of correlations between\nnuclear spin transitions. This work offers a systematic approach to correlation\nspectroscopy for single-molecule NMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 08:36:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 02:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 02:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

We focus specifically on the\nphenomenon of ice ages that has characterised the slow evolution of climate\nover the Quaternary. Ice ages are a form of variability featuring interactions\nbetween different large-scale components and processes in the climate system,\nincluding ice sheet, deep-ocean and carbon cycle dynamics. This variability is\nalso at least partly controlled by changes in the seasonal and latitudinal\nincoming solar radiation associated with the combined effects of changes in\nEarth's orbit shape, precession of equinoxes, and changes in obliquity. A\nnumber of possible mechanisms are reviewed in this chapter. We stress that the\nnature of the interactions between these slow dynamics and faster modes of\nvariability, such as millennium and centennial modes of variability, are still\npoorly understood. For example, whether the time sequence of ice ages is\nrobustly determined or not by the astronomical forcing is a matter of debate.\nThese questions need to be addressed with a range of models. We propose to use\nstochastic parameterisations in the lower resolution models (focusing on\nclimate time scales) to account for weather and macro-weather dynamics\nsimulated with higher resolution models.

In this article we study one of the simplest possible systems with\npulse interaction: a phase oscillator with delayed pulsatile feedback. When the\noscillator reaches a specific state, it emits a pulse, which returns after\npropagating through a delay line. The impact of an incoming pulse is described\nby the oscillator's phase reset curve (PRC). In such a system we discover an\nunexpected phenomenon: for a sufficiently steep slope of the PRC, a periodic\nregular spiking solution bifurcates with several multipliers crossing the unit\ncircle at the same parameter value. The number of such critical multipliers\nincreases linearly with the delay and thus may be arbitrary large. This\nbifurcation is accompanied by the emergence of numerous \"jittering\" regimes\nwith non-equal interspike intervals (ISIs). Each of these regimes corresponds\nto a periodic solution of the system with a period roughly proportional to the\ndelay. The number of different \"jittering\" solutions emerging at the\nbifurcation point increases exponentially with the delay. We describe the\ncombinatorial mechanism that underlies the emergence of such a variety of\nsolutions. In particular, we show how a periodic solution exhibiting several\ndistinct ISIs can imply the existence of multiple other solutions obtained by\nrearranging of these ISIs. We show that the theoretical results for phase\noscillators accurately predict the behavior of an experimentally implemented\nelectronic oscillator with pulsatile feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 09:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-14"}

In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate three key aspects of how the regulator choice affects RG flows: (i)\nWe study flow trajectories along closed loops in the space of action\nfunctionals varying both, the regulator scale and shape function.

The largest SZ distortion in the CMB is caused\nby the hot electrons present in the intra-cluster medium (ICM). However,\nseveral other small scale astrophysical processes can also contribute to the SZ\ndistortion in the CMB.\n  Analytic studies have shown that the interstellar (ISM) electron gas of the\nhost galaxy heated by quasar feedback can also cause substantial SZ effect.

This presents a challenge for a broad range of\napplications in spintronics and spin-orbitronics that depend on materials and\nstructures with ultra-low damping. Such systems enable many experimental\ninvestigations that further our theoretical understanding of numerous magnetic\nphenomena such as damping and spin-transport mediated by chirality and the\nRashba effect.

The geomagnetic activity and interplanetary magnetic field parameters\nwere observed to be low during the period of study.

Our first notable finding is the mechanism\nof reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return on\nassets. In regular economies where the EBITA/Assets ratio is larger than the\ncost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest\nlong-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth).\nOur second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central\nbank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth. We find\nthat late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highest\nlong-term return on assets and largest asset value. But this comes at the cost\nof suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs. The\nphenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows\ntrust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust is\nhigh. These results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying our\nmodel: (a) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage; (b) economic\nagents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of\nassets. Using a Markov Switching Model for the EBITA/Assets ratio, we have\nsuccessfully calibrated our model to the empirical data of the return on equity\nof the EURO STOXX 50 for the time period 2000-2013. We find that dynamics of\nleverage and trust can be highly non-monotonous with curved trajectories, as a\nresult of the nonlinear coupling between the variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 12:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

In the\n$q=2$ case, we determine that value to be $r_c = 3.65(5)$; there is a\nsecond-order phase transition there when $r<r_c$ and a first-order one at\n$r>r_c$. We also analyse the region $1 \\leq q<2$ and show that the change from\nsecond to first order there is manifest through a new mechanism involving\n{\\emph{two}} marginal values of $r$. The $q=1$ limit gives bond percolation and\nsome intermediary values also have known physical realisations. Above the lower\nvalue $r_{c1}$, the order parameters exhibit discontinuities at temperature\n$\\tilde{t}$ below a critical value $t_c$. But, provided $r>r_{c1}$ is small\nenough, this discontinuity does not appear at the phase transition, which is\ncontinuous and takes place at $t_c$. The larger value $r_{c2}$ marks the point\nat which the phase transition at $t_c$ changes from second to first order.\nThus, for $r_{c1}< r < r_{c2}$, the transition at $t_c$ remains second order\nwhile the order parameter has a discontinuity at $\\tilde{t}$. As $r$ increases\nfurther, $\\tilde{t}$ increases, bringing the discontinuity closer to $t_c$.\nFinally, when $r$ exceeds $r_{c2}$ $\\tilde{t}$ coincides with $t_c$ and the\nphase transition becomes first order. This new mechanism indicates how the\ndiscontinuity characteristic of first order phase transitions emerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 13:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

For such filters and\nrandom processes, it has long been established that this entropy gain, Gain(G),\nequals the integral of log|G(exp(jw))|. It is also known that, if the first\nsample of the impulse response of G has unit-magnitude, then this integral\nequals the sum of the logarithm of the magnitudes of the non-minimum phase\nzeros of G, say B(G). In this note, we begin by showing that existing\ntime-domain proofs of these results, which consider finite length-n sequences\nand then let n tend to infinity, have neglected significant mathematical terms\nand, therefore, are inaccurate. We discuss some of the implications of this\noversight when considering random processes. We then present a rigorous\ntime-domain analysis of the entropy gain of LTI filters for random processes.\nIn particular, we show that the entropy gain between equal-length input and\noutput sequences is upper bounded by B(G) and arises if and only if there\nexists an output additive disturbance with finite differential entropy (no\nmatter how small) or a random initial state. Instead, when comparing the input\ndifferential entropy to that of the entire (longer) output of G, the entropy\ngain equals B(G) without the need for additional exogenous random signals.

By\nwhich means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,\nand eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions\nour understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific\ntheories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems\nto have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited\nlong ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical\nproperties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc\nproposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that\nbiology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and\nlife-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and\ndiffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to\nidentify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.\nWhile Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later\nacclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th\ncentury. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical\napproach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long\nforsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology\nincreasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the\nmechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our\nreluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 14:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 16:42:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 13:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 15:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

They concern particularly the\nso-called Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox where the momentary action at a\ndistance together with non-local entangled states is used for the\ninterpretation.\n  We assume that the quantum theory can be formulated as local and look for the\nconsequences of this assumption.

To exclude a\npresupposed correlation of participating quantum particles we consider two\nindependent particle sources and two detectors that are independent as well. We\nshow that the origin of the correlation is the feature that the occupation\nnumber of a particle (and other its measurable quantities) is formed by a pair\nof complex conjugated wave functions with in general arbitrary phases.

Also significant for physics is\nhis pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the\nearly-to-mid 1990s. Shimony focused largely on the question of the relationship\nbetween knowledge and the world, as he did not view these two philosophical\nconcerns as distinct from study of the implications of entanglement per se.\nIndeed, the most well known phrase he coined is \"experimental metaphysics.\" He\nis also known for the reapplication of the expression \"peaceful coexistence\" as\npertaining to the relationship between quantum mechanics and special\nrelativity. Shimony's less well known intellectual engagement was with the\nquestion of the relationship between mind and matter, which only a few\nphysicists of our time have engaged seriously, likely because of its more\nphilosophical and less mathematically tractable character.

Experimental\nresults validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and\nEOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators,\ni.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 21:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The ion\nsaturation current signal is dominated by the frequent occurrence of\nlarge-amplitude bursts attributed to filament structures moving through the\nscrape-off layer. The average burst shape is well described by a\ndouble-exponential wave-form with constant duration, while the waiting times\nand peak amplitudes of the bursts both have an exponential distribution.\nAssociated with bursts in the ion saturation current is a dipole shaped\nfloating potential structure and radially outwards directed electric drift\nvelocity and particle flux, with average peak values increasing with the\nsaturation current burst amplitude. The floating potential fluctuations have a\nnormal probability density function while the distributions for the ion\nsaturation current and estimated radial velocity have exponential tails for\nlarge fluctuations. These findings are discussed in the light of prevailing\ntheories for filament motion and a stochastic model for intermittent scrape-off\nlayer plasma fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 13:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-04"}

For one of these case studies on 14th century Byzantium, the\nexplanatory value of this approach is presented in greater detail. The\npresented results are integrated in a wider comparison of five late medieval\npolities across Afro-Eurasia (Byzantium, China, England, Hungary and Mamluk\nEgypt) against the background of the {\\guillemotright}Late Medieval\nCrisis{\\guillemotleft} and its political and environmental turmoil.
