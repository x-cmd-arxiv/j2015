This allows us to calculate the leptonic mixing angles observed in\nneutrino oscillations as functions of the lightest neutrino mass. We show that\nfor both normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino masses, this scenario does\nnot give rise to correct leptonic mixing angles. We then show that correct\nleptonic mixing angles can be generated with normal hierarchical neutrino\nmasses if the relation between mixing angle and mass ratio is restricted to 1-2\nand 1-3 mixing in both charged lepton and neutrino sectors leaving the 2-3\nmixing angles as free parameters.

Differently\nfrom other approaches, we provide two examples of elementary particle models\nthat do not require extremely tiny coupling constants. We find the\ncompatibility of the theoretical predictions with the IceCube results when the\nastrophysical flux has a cutoff of the order of 100 TeV (broken power law). In\nthis case the most energetic part of the spectrum (PeV neutrinos) is due to an\nextra component such as the decay of a very massive dark matter component. Due\nto the low statistics at our disposal we have considered for simplicity the\nequivalence between deposited and neutrino energy, however such approximation\ndoes not affect dramatically the qualitative results. Of course, a purely\nastrophysical origin of the neutrino flux (no cutoff in energy below the PeV\nscale - unbroken power law) is still allowed.

We apply novel\ntests to verify its accuracy and limitations, including multi-dimensional tests\nthat have not been previously applied to the drag-coupled dust problem and\nwhich are particularly relevant to self-gravitating protoplanetary discs. Our\ntests demonstrate several key requirements for accurate simulations of gas-dust\nmixtures. Firstly, in standard SPH particle jitter can degrade the dust\nsolution, even when the gas density is well reproduced. The use of integral\ngradients, a Wendland kernel and a large number of neighbours can control this,\nalbeit at a greater computational cost. Secondly, when it is necessary to limit\nthe artificial viscosity we recommend using the Cullen & Dehnen (2010) switch,\nsince the alternative, using ${\\alpha} \\sim 0.1$, can generate a large velocity\nnoise up to ${{\\sigma}_v} \\lesssim 0.3 c_s$ in the dust particles.

Further, required boundary conditions are automatically satisfied due\nto the geometry of the collision. The chiral transition is, therefore,\ncompleted by a propagating interface, exactly as for a first order transition,\neven though the transition actually is a crossover for relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions.

The DM and MOND components have a common origin, representing different\nphases of a single underlying substance. DM consists of axion-like particles\nwith mass of order eV and strong self-interactions. The condensate has a\npolytropic equation of state P~rho^3 giving rise to a superfluid core within\ngalaxies. Instead of behaving as individual collisionless particles, the DM\nsuperfluid is more aptly described as collective excitations. Superfluid\nphonons, in particular, are assumed to be governed by a MOND-like effective\naction and mediate a MONDian acceleration between baryonic matter particles.\nOur framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): due to the higher velocity\ndispersion in clusters, and correspondingly higher temperature, the DM in\nclusters is either in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase, or fully in the\nnormal phase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a\nnumber of observational signatures: array of low-density vortices in galaxies,\nmerger dynamics that depend on the infall velocity vs phonon sound speed;\ndistinct mass peaks in bullet-like cluster mergers, corresponding to superfluid\nand normal components; interference patters in super-critical mergers.\nRemarkably, the superfluid phonon effective theory is strikingly similar to\nthat of the unitary Fermi gas, which has attracted much excitement in the cold\natom community in recent years. The critical temperature for DM superfluidity\nis of order mK, comparable to known cold atom Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 20:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 19:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

More\nspecifically, novel MRI pulse sequences have been designed to characterize\nmicrostructure, enhance signal and contrast in tissue, and image functional\nprocesses. In this thesis, rat brain and red bone marrow images are acquired\nusing iMQCs (intermolecular multiple quantum coherences) between intermediate\nseparated spins. As an important application, iMQCs images in different\ndirections can be used for anisotropy mapping and tissue microstructure\nanalysis. At the same time, the simulations prove that the dipolar field from\nthe overall shape only has small contributions to the experimental iMQC signal.\nBesides magnitude of iMQCs, phase of iMQCs should be studied as well. The phase\nanisotropy maps built by our method can clearly show susceptibility information\nin rat brain. It may provide meaningful diagnostic information. To deeply study\nsusceptibility, the modified-crazed sequence is developed. Combining phase data\nof modified-crazed images and phase data of iMQCs images is very promising to\nconstruct microstructure maps.

The chart monitors the\nratio of the percentiles of a key characteristic associated with the processes.\nThe variability of such a characteristic is modeled via the Weibull\ndistribution and a practical Bayesian approach to deal with Weibull data is\nadopted. The percentiles of the two monitored processes are assumed to be\nindependent random variables. The Weibull distributions of the key\ncharacteristic of both processes are assumed to have the same and stable shape\nparameter. This is usually experienced in practice because the Weibull shape\nparameter is related to the main involved factor of variability. However, if a\nchange of the shape parameters of the processes is suspected, the involved\ndistributions can be used to monitor their stability. We first tested the\neffects of the number of the training data on the responsiveness of the chart.\nThen we tested the robustness of the chart in spite of very poor prior\ninformation. To this end, the prior values were changed to reflect a 50% shift\nin both directions from the original values of the shape parameter and the\npercentiles of the two monitored processes. Finally, various combinations of\nshifts were considered for the sampling distributions after the Phase I, with\nthe purpose of estimating the diagnostic ability of the charts to signal an\nout-of-control state.

Then\nwe introduce different approximating linear threshold and describe how to\nchoose the optimal one minimizing the distance to the curved boundary and hence\nthe error in the corresponding passage time density. Theoretical means,\nvariances and coefficients of variation given by our method are then compared\nwith empirical quantities from simulated data as well as other firing\nstatistics derived under the assumption of a small amplitude of the\ntime-dependent change in the threshold. Finally maximum likelihood and moment\nestimators of the parameters of the Wiener process are also proposed and\ncompared on simulated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 05:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 15:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

The assignment and allocation\ncomponents of this problem have been studied extensively but largely separately\nin the literature. In this paper, we introduce the assign and allocate (AA)\nproblem, which seeks to simultaneously find an assignment and allocation that\nmaximizes the total utility of the threads. Assigning and allocating the\nthreads together can result in substantially better overall utility than\nperforming the steps separately, as is traditionally done. We model each thread\nby a utility function giving its performance as a function of its assigned\nresources. We first prove that the AA problem is NP-hard. We then present a $2\n(\\sqrt{2}-1) > 0.828$ factor approximation algorithm for concave utility\nfunctions, which runs in $O(mn^2 + n (\\log mC)^2)$ time for $n$ threads and $m$\nservers with $C$ amount of resources each. We also give a faster algorithm with\nthe same approximation ratio and $O(n (\\log mC)^2)$ time complexity. We then\nextend the problem to two more general settings. First, we consider threads\nwith nonconcave utility functions, and give a 1/2 factor approximation\nalgorithm. Next, we give an algorithm for threads using multiple types of\nresources, and show the algorithm achieves good empirical performance. We\nconduct extensive experiments to test the performance of our algorithms on\nthreads with both synthetic and realistic utility functions, and find that they\nachieve over 92\\% of the optimal utility on average.

Due to the joint action of flexoelectric coupling and spontaneous\npolarization the degeneration of the transverse optic and acoustic modes\ndisappears in the soft phonon spectrum in a ferroelectric phase in comparison\nwith the spectra in a paraelectric phase. These effects have been studied\nquantitatively for ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate using realistic values\nof static and dynamic flexocouplings and cubic symmetry approximation for the\nelastic properties. Also we derived general expressions for correlation\nfunction for arbitrary symmetry, elastic and electrostrictive anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 14:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification. For some\ncases, it is difficult to distinguish between the light curves of double-waved\nACVs and the variability induced by orbital motion (ellipsoidal\nvariables/eclipsing variables), especially for objects exhibiting very small\namplitudes and/or significant scatter in their light curves. Thus, some\neclipsing or rotating ellipsoidal variables might be present. However, we are\nconfident that the given periods are the correct ones. There seems to be a\npossible weak correlation between the rotational period and colour, in the\nsense that cooler magnetic CP stars rotate more slowly.

While exploring collaborative processes within the\nOpenStack ecosystem, our research contributes to Software Engineering research\nby exploring the role of groups, sub-communities and business models within a\nhigh-networked open source ecosystem. Surprising results point out that\ncompetition for the same revenue model (i.e., operating conflicting business\nmodels) does not necessary affect collaboration within the ecosystem. Moreover,\nwhile detecting the different sub-communities of the OpenStack community, we\nfound out that the expected social tendency of developers to work with\ndevelopers from same firm (i.e., homophily) did not hold within the OpenStack\necosystem. Furthermore, while addressing a novel, complex and unexplored open\nsource case, this research also contributes to the management literature in\ncoopetition strategy and high-tech entrepreneurship with a rich description on\nhow heterogeneous actors within a high-networked ecosystem (involving\nindividuals, startups, established firms and public organizations)\njoint-develop a complex infrastructure for big-data in the open source arena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 11:14:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 11:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}
