Using the\ninferred characteristics of the processing units, we are able to determine the\nbest way to split a workflow for processing it in parallel with the lowest\nexpected completion time and least variance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 17:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

Motivated by these developments, we propose a novel\nmethodology to perform data-driven optimization of EV charging stations\nlocation. We formulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem on a\ngeographical grid, with the objective of covering the entire demand region\nwhile minimizing a measure of drivers' discomfort. Since optimally solving the\nproblem is computationally infeasible, we present computationally efficient,\nnear-optimal solutions based on greedy and genetic algorithms. We then apply\nthe proposed methodology to optimize EV charging stations location in the city\nof Boston, starting from a massive cellular phone data sets covering 1 million\nusers over 4 months. Results show that genetic algorithm based optimization\nprovides the best solutions in terms of drivers' discomfort and the number of\ncharging stations required, which are both reduced about 10 percent as compared\nto a randomized solution. We further investigate robustness of the proposed\ndata-driven methodology, showing that, building upon well-known regularity of\naggregate human mobility patterns, the near-optimal solution computed using\nsingle day movements preserves its properties also in later months. When\ncollectively considered, the results presented in this paper clearly indicate\nthe potential of data-driven approaches for optimally locating public charging\nfacilities at the urban scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 17:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

Close to this layered surface, the power spectral density\nof the electric field varies with the inverse fourth power of the distance to\nthe surface, rather than with the inverse square, as it would above a bare\nmetal surface. Furthermore, compared to a clean metal, where the noise spectrum\ndoes not vary with frequency (in the radio-wave and microwave bands), the\ndielectric layer can generate electric-field noise which scales in inverse\nproportion to the frequency.

This significant advancement provides the ability to accurately\ncapture the extensional viscosity of entangled polymer melts from low\ndeformation rates, throughout the strain hardening regime, and into the region\nof viscosity thinning To do so, the purely extensional flow field associated\nwith a four roll mill experiment is implemented in three dimensions. Periodic\nboundary conditions exist in all directions to enable a uniform deformation\nrate throughout the simulation domain. As expected, the extensional viscosity\nis four times the zero shear viscosity at low deformation rates. As the\ndeformation rate increases, the extensional viscosity increases, plateaus, and\nthen decreases. The algorithm thus correctly captures the physics of polymer\nmelts in extensional flow in a fully a priori manner while providing\nsignificant computational advantages over molecular dynamics methods.

We first\ndefined a sample of 129 giant-planet candidates that we followed up with the\nSOPHIE spectrograph (OHP, France) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign.

Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we\nthen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of\norbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days\nis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

In Graham & Fruchter (2013), we showed that LGRBs\nexhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicity\nenvironments (12+log(O/H) < 8.4 in the KK04 scale) in spite of these three\ncases with abundances of about solar and above. These exceptions however are\nconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparable\nbrightness & redshift. This is surprising: even among a preselected sample of\nhigh metallicity LGRBs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for these\nobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typical\nmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. Therefore we\ndeduce that it is possible to form an LGRB in a high metallicity environment\nalthough with greater rarity.\n  From this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for the\npresence of the LGRBs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)\nLGRBs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in high\nmetallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments that\nhave become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remain\nunenriched. (2) The LGRB formation mechanism while preferring low metallicity\nenvironments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline in\nburst formation with increasing metallicity. (3) The typical low metallicity\nLGRBs and the few high metallicity cases are the result of physically different\nburst formation pathways with only the former affected by the metallicity and\nthe later occurring much more infrequently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 20:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

However, the\nperformance and applicability of such systems have been severely plagued by\ndistortions due to the frequency dependent nature of the amplitude response of\nthe dispersive media used for processing. This frequency dependence is a\nfundamental consequence of the causality constraint, incarnated by\nKramers-Kronig relations or, equivalently, by the Bode relations. In order to\nresolve this issue, we introduce here the concept of a \\emph{perfect dispersive\nmedium}, which is a loss-gain medium characterized by a perfectly flat\nmagnitude response along with an arbitrary phase response. This unprecedented\nproperty results from equalized electric and magnetic dipole dispersion\nresponses, whence the amplitude and phase of the transmission functions of the\nisolated loss and gain contributions become the inverse and remain the same,\nrespectively, under reversal of the sign of the imaginary part of the equalized\nmagneto-dielectric polarizability. Such a perfect dispersive medium may be\nrealized in the form of a metamaterial, and the paper demonstrates a\ncorresponding stacked loss-gain metasurface structure for illustration. From a\npractical standpoint, perfect dispersive media represent a paradigm shift that\nmay propel real-time signal processing technology to a new dimension, with a\nmyriad of novel ultrafast communication, sensing, imaging and instrumentation\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 20:49:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 17:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

In such situation, existing\nclosed-set classifiers will assign a training label to these instances\nresulting in a misclassification. In this paper, we introduce Galaxy-X, a novel\nmulti-class classification approach for open-set recognition problems. For each\nclass of the training set, Galaxy-X creates a minimum bounding hyper-sphere\nthat encompasses the distribution of the class by enclosing all of its\ninstances. In such manner, our method is able to distinguish instances\nresembling previously seen classes from those that are of unknown ones.

Consumer trials are influenced by past purchases and\nthe ranking of each product. The platform owner needs to devise a ranking\npolicy to display the products to maximize the number of purchases in the long\nrun. The model proposed attempts to understand the impact of market\nsegmentation in a trial-offer market with social influence. In our model,\nconsumer choices are based on a very general choice model known as the mixed\nMNL. We analyze the long-term dynamics of this highly complex stochastic model\nand we quantify the expected benefits of market segmentation. When past\npurchases are displayed, consumer heterogeneity makes buyers try the\nsub-optimal products, reducing the overall sales rate. We show that consumer\nheterogeneity makes the ranking problem NP-hard. We then analyze the benefits\nof market segmentation. We find tight bounds to the expected benefits of\noffering a distinct ranking to each consumer segment. Finally, we show that the\nmarket segmentation strategy always benefits from social influence when the\naverage quality ranking is used. One of the managerial implications is that the\nfirm is better off using an aggregate ranking policy when the variety of\nconsumer preference is limited, but it should perform a market segmentation\npolicy when consumers are highly heterogeneous. We also show that this result\nis robust to relatively small consumer classification mistakes; when these are\nlarge, an aggregate ranking is preferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 01:08:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 17:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 16:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 04:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Our key contribution is a disparity estimation\nalgorithm that iteratively approximates the scene depth via a piece-wise planar\nmesh from stereo imagery, with a fast depth validation step for semi-dense\nreconstruction. The mesh is initially seeded with sparsely matched keypoints,\nand is recursively tessellated and refined as needed (via a resampling stage),\nto provide the desired stereo disparity accuracy. The inherent simplicity and\nspeed of our approach, with the ability to tune it to a desired reconstruction\nquality and runtime performance makes it a compelling solution for applications\nin high-speed vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 02:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 17:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

The queuing analysis and the simulations reveal that a signalized\nnetwork with fixed time control will support an increase in demand by a factor\nof (say) two or three if all saturation flows are increased by the same factor,\nwith no change in the control. Furthermore, despite the increased demand\nvehicles will experience the same delay and travel time. The same scaling\nimprovement is achieved when the fixed time control is replaced by the max\npressure adaptive control. Part of the capacity increase can alternatively be\nused to reduce queue lengths and the associated queuing delay by decreasing the\ncycle time. Impediments to the control of connected vehicles to achieve\nplatooning at intersections appear to be small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 04:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 00:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

These limitations are partially due to the technological\nlimitations from array sensors (CCD or CMOS), and also caused by separative\nmeasurement of the entries/slices of a spatial-spectral data cube. Besides,\nthey are mostly expensive and bulky. To address above issues, this paper\nproposes to image the 3D multispectral data with a single bucket detector in a\nmultiplexing way. Under the single pixel imaging scheme, we project\nspatial-spectral modulated illumination onto the target scene to encode the\nscene's 3D information into a 1D measurement sequence. Conventional spatial\nmodulation is used to resolve the scene's spatial information. To avoid\nincreasing requisite acquisition time for 2D to 3D extension of the latent\ndata, we conduct spectral modulation in a frequency-division multiplexing\nmanner in the speed gap between slow spatial light modulation and fast detector\nresponse. Then the sequential reconstruction falls into a simple Fourier\ndecomposition and standard compressive sensing problem. A proof-of-concept\nsetup is built to capture the multispectral data (64 pixels $\\times$ 64 pixels\n$\\times$ 10 wavelength bands) in the visible wavelength range (450nm-650nm)\nwith acquisition time being 1 minute. The imaging scheme is of high flexibility\nfor different spectrum ranges and resolutions. It holds great potentials for\nvarious low light and airborne applications, and can be easily manufactured\nproduction-volume portable multispectral imagers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 04:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

Using first principles quantum transport simulations, we show that\nthe voltage drop across \\emph{symmetric} junctions changes dramatically and\ncontrollably in gated systems compared to non-gated junctions. In particular,\nfor \\emph{p}-type(\\emph{n}-type) carriers the voltage drop is located close to\nthe electrode with positive(negative) polarity, i.e. the potential of the\njunction is pinned to the negative(positive) electrode. We trace this behaviour\nback to the vanishing density of states of graphene in the proximity of the\nDirac point. Due to the electrostatic gating, each electrode exposes different\ndensity of states in the bias window between the two different electrode Fermi\nenergies, thereby leading to a non-symmetry in the voltage drop across the\ndevice. This selective pinning is found to be independent of device length when\ncarriers are induced either by the gate or dopant atoms, indicating a general\neffect for electronic circuitry based on graphene electrodes. We envision this\ncould be used to control the spatial distribution of Joule heating in graphene\nnanostructures, and possibly the chemical reaction rate around high potential\ngradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 08:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions with\nmolecular clouds or tidal stripping, and their members become part of the\ngeneral field population. Star clusters are thus among the basic building\nblocks of galaxies. In turn, star cluster populations, from young associations\nand open clusters to old globulars, are powerful tracers of the formation,\nassembly, and evolutionary history of their parent galaxies. Although their\nimportance had been recognised for decades, major progress in this area has\nonly become possible in recent years, both for Galactic and extragalactic\ncluster populations. Star clusters are the observational foundation for stellar\nastrophysics and evolution, provide essential tracers of galactic structure,\nand are unique stellar dynamical environments. Star formation, stellar\nstructure, stellar evolution, and stellar nucleosynthesis continue to benefit\nand improve tremendously from the study of these systems. Additionally,\nfundamental quantities such as the initial mass function can be successfully\nderived from modelling either the H-R diagrams or the integrated velocity\nstructures of, respectively, resolved and unresolved clusters and cluster\npopulations. Star cluster studies thus span the fields of Galactic and\nextragalactic astrophysics, while heavily affecting our detailed understanding\nof the process of star formation in dense environments.This report highlights\nscience results of the last decade in the major fields covered by IAU\nCommission 37: Star clusters and associations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 09:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

We propose science cases and\nprovide quantitative estimates for each case. The largest advantage of\nground-based THz telescopes is their higher angular resolution (~ 4 arcsec for\na 10-m dish), as compared to space or airborne THz telescopes. Thus,\nhigh-resolution mapping is an important scientific argument. In particular, we\ncan isolate zones of interest for Galactic and extragalactic star-forming\nregions. The THz windows are suitable for observations of high-excitation CO\nlines and [N II] 205 um lines, which are scientifically relevant tracers of\nstar formation and stellar feedback. Those lines are the brightest lines in the\nTHz windows, so that they are suitable for the initiation of ground-based THz\nobservations. THz polarization of star-forming regions can also be explored\nsince it traces the dust population contributing to the THz spectral peak. For\nsurvey-type observations, we focus on ``sub-THz'' extragalactic surveys, whose\nuniqueness is to detect galaxies at redshifts z ~ 1--2, where the dust emission\nper comoving volume is the largest in the history of the Universe.

Hence, there is large effort to reduce this amount, mainly by using\nsome filters. The situation can be improved by additionally applying some data\ncompression techniques: removing redundancy and optimally encoding the actual\ninformation. Preferably, both filtering and data compression should fit in FPGA\nalready used for data acquisition - reducing requirements of both data storage\nand networking architecture.\n  We will briefly explain and discuss some basic techniques, for a better focus\napplied to design a dedicated data compression system basing on a sample data\nfrom a prototype of a tracking detector: 10000 events for 48 channels. We will\nfocus on the time data here, which after neglecting the headers and applying\ndata filtering, requires on average 1170 bits/event using the current coding.\nEncoding relative times (differences) and grouping data by channels, reduces\nthis number to 798 bits/channel, still using fixed length coding: a fixed\nnumber of bits used for a given value. Using variable length Huffman coding to\nencode numbers of digital pulses for a channel and the most significant bits of\nvalues (simple binning) reduces further this number to 552 bits/event. Using\nadaptive binning: denser for frequent values, and an accurate entropy coder we\nget further down to 455 bits/event - this option can easily fit unused\nresources of FPGA currently used for data acquisition. Finally, using separate\nprobability distributions for different channels, what could be done by a\nsoftware compressor, leads to 437bits/event, what is 2.67 times less than the\noriginal 1170 bits/event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 11:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

The deuteration of methanol is\na major puzzle, however, because the isotopologue ratio [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD], which\nis predicted to be equal to 3 by standard grain chemistry models, is much\nlarger (~20) in low-mass hot corinos and significantly lower (~1) in high-mass\nhot cores. This dichotomy in methanol deuteration between low-mass and massive\nprotostars is currently not understood. In this study, we report a simplified\nrate equation model of the deuterium chemistry occurring in the icy mantles of\ninterstellar grains. We apply this model to the chemistry of hot corinos and\nhot cores, with IRAS 16293-2422 and the Orion~KL Compact Ridge as prototypes,\nrespectively. The chemistry is based on a statistical initial deuteration at\nlow temperature followed by a warm-up phase during which thermal\nhydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchanges occur between water and methanol. The\nexchange kinetics is incorporated using laboratory data. The [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD]\nratio is found to scale inversely with the D/H ratio of water, owing to the H/D\nexchange equilibrium between the hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups of methanol\nand water. Our model is able to reproduce the observed [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] ratios\nprovided that the primitive fractionation of water ice [HDO]/[H2O] is ~ 2% in\nIRAS 16293-2422 and ~0.6% in Orion~KL. We conclude that the molecular D/H\nratios measured in hot cores may not be representative of the original mantles\nbecause molecules with exchangeable deuterium atoms can equilibrate with water\nice during the warm-up phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 13:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

In practice the full eigenspectrum is\nnot known, and whether a given network has any communities within detectability\nregime cannot be easily established. Based on the global clustering coefficient\nwe construct a criterion telling whether in an undirected, unweighted network\nthere is some/no detectable community structure, or if the network is in a\ntransient regime. The method is simple and faster than methods involving\nbootstrapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 13:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

The accuracy\nof each surrogate method is then tested and compared for two simulators used in\nindustry: a land-surface model (adJULES) and a launch vehicle controller\n(VEGACONTROL). We analyse surrogates built on experimental designs of various\nsize and type to investigate their performance in a range of modelling\nscenarios. Specifically, polynomial chaos and Gaussian process surrogates are\nbuilt on Sobol sequence and tensor grid designs. Their accuracy is measured by\ntheir ability to estimate the mean, standard deviation, exceedance\nprobabilities and probability density function of the simulator output, as well\nas a root mean square error metric, based on an independent validation design.\nWe find that one method does not unanimously outperform the other, but\nadvantages can be gained in some cases, such that the preferred method depends\non the modelling goals of the practitioner. Our conclusions are likely to\ndepend somewhat on the modelling choices for the surrogates as well as the\ndesign strategy. We hope that this work will spark future comparisons of the\ntwo methods in their more advanced formulations and for different sampling\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 16:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 11:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 13:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-16"}

The metallicities of the seven stars\nrange from -0.32 dex to +0.13 dex, with an average metallicity that is\nsubsolar, supporting previous suggestions that, unlike Jupiter-type giant\nplanets, small planets do not form preferentially around metal-rich stars.

In general, at order $n$ in\n$x_i$, individual terms depend on at most $n-1$ binaries. We explicitly derive\nthe Hamiltonian including all terms up and including third order in $x_i$\n(octupole order), and including the binary pairwise terms up and including\nfifth order in $x_i$. These terms are orbit averaged, and we present a new\nalgorithm for efficiently solving the equations of motion. This algorithm is\nhighly suitable for studying the secular evolution of hierarchical systems with\ncomplex hierarchies, making long-term integrations of such systems feasible. We\nshow that accurate results are obtained for multiplanet systems with semimajor\naxis ratios as large as $\\approx 0.4$, provided that high-order terms are\nincluded. In addition to multiplanet systems with a single star, we apply our\nresults to multistar systems with multiple planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 15:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 15:31:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

Blazars are among the most energetic objects in the Universe. In\n2008 August, Fermi/LAT detected the blazar PKS 1502+106 showing a rapid and\nstrong gamma-ray outburst followed by high and variable flux over the next\nmonths. This activity at high energies triggered an intensive multi-wavelength\ncampaign covering also the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray bands indicating that\nthe flare was accompanied by a simultaneous outburst at optical/UV/X-rays and a\ndelayed outburst at radio bands.\n  Aims: In the current work we explore the phenomenology and physical\nconditions within the ultra-relativistic jet of the gamma-ray blazar PKS\n1502+106. Additionally, we address the question of the spatial localization of\nthe MeV/GeV-emitting region of the source.\n  Methods: We utilize ultra-high angular resolution mm-VLBI observations at 43\nand 86 GHz complemented by VLBI observations at 15 GHz. We also employ\nsingle-dish radio data from the F-GAMMA program at frequencies matching the\nVLBI monitoring.\n  Results: PKS 1502+106 shows a compact core-jet morphology and fast\nsuperluminal motion with apparent speeds in the range 5--22 c. Estimation of\nDoppler factors along the jet yield values between ~7 up to ~50. This Doppler\nfactor gradient implies an accelerating jet. The viewing angle towards the\nsource differs between the inner and outer jet, with the former at ~3 degrees\nand the latter at ~1 degree, after the jet bends towards the observer beyond 1\nmas. The de-projected opening angle of the ultra-fast, magnetically-dominated\njet is found to be (3.8 +/- 0.5) degrees. A single jet component can be\nassociated with the pronounced flare both at high-energies and in radio bands.\nFinally, the gamma-ray emission region is localized at less than 5.9 pc away\nfrom the jet base.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 12:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The notion of frequency and filters\ntraditionally defined for signals supported on regular domains such as discrete\ntime and image grids has been recently generalized to irregular graph domains,\nand defines brain graph frequencies associated with different levels of spatial\nsmoothness across the brain regions. Brain network frequency also enables the\ndecomposition of brain signals into pieces corresponding to smooth or rapid\nvariations. We relate graph frequency with principal component analysis when\nthe networks of interest denote functional connectivity.
