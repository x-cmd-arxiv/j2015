The resulting new Lagrangian is second-order in derivatives, and\ncontains two-component spinors of only one chirality. The new second-order\nformulation simplifies the fermion Feynman rules of the theory considerably,\n$e.g.$ the propagator becomes a multiple of an identity matrix in the field\nspace. The aim of this thesis is to work out the details of this formulation\nfor theories such as Quantum Electrodynamics, and the Standard Model of\nelementary particles. After having developed the tools necessary to establish\nthe second-order formalism as an equivalent approach to spinor field theories,\nwe proceed with some important consistency checks that the new formulation is\nrequired to pass, namely the presence or absence of anomalies in their\nperturbative and non-perturbative description, and the unitarity of the\nS-Matrix derived from their Lagrangian. Another aspect which is studied is\nunification, where we seek novel gauge-groups that can be used to embed all of\nthe Standard Model content: forces and fermionic representations. Finally, we\nwill explore the possibility to unify gravity and the Standard Model when the\nformer is seen as a diffeomorphism invariant gauge-theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 16:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

To understand this behavior, we present\nexact expressions for the motion of three-dimensional linear null points. The\nmost general expression shows that linear null points move in the direction\nalong which the vector field and its time derivative are antiparallel. Null\npoint motion in resistive magnetohydrodynamics results from advection by the\nbulk plasma flow and resistive diffusion of the magnetic field, which allows\nnon-ideal flows across topological boundaries. Null point motion is described\nintrinsically by parameters evaluated locally; however, global dynamics help\nset the local conditions at the null point. During a bifurcation of a\ndegenerate null point into a null-null pair or the reverse, the instantaneous\nvelocity of separation or convergence of the null-null pair will typically be\ninfinite along the null space of the Jacobian matrix of the magnetic field, but\nwith finite components in the directions orthogonal to the null space. Not all\nbifurcating null-null pairs are connected by a separator. Furthermore, except\nunder special circumstances, there will not exist a straight line separator\nconnecting a bifurcating null-null pair. The motion of separators cannot be\ndescribed using solely local parameters, because the identification of a\nparticular field line as a separator may change as a result of non-ideal\nbehavior elsewhere along the field line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 16:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

The approach is to derive the continuity\nequation for the specific model under consideration, using generalizations of\nGreen's identities to higher-order derivatives and to discrete models of\ndifferent topological structure. A new addendum addresses two issues of more\ncurrent interest: the use of irregular meshes in discrete formulations, and the\nidentification of the Heisenberg velocity operator to evaluate current density.\nIt is demonstrated that on discrete domains the velocity operator fails to\nsatisfy a sensible continuity equation, and therefore cannot be identified with\nthe current density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 19:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

However, control of modular, multi-limbed soft robots for\nterrestrial locomotion is challenging due to the complex robot structure,\nactuator mechanics and robot-environment interaction. Traditionally, soft robot\ncontrol is performed by modeling kinematics using exact geometric equations and\nfinite element analysis. The research presents an alternative, model-free,\ndata-driven, reinforcement learning inspired approach, for controlling\nmulti-limbed soft material robots. This control approach can be summarized as a\nfour-step process of discretization, visualization, learning and optimization.\nThe first step involves identification and subsequent discretization of key\nfactors that dominate robot-environment, in turn, the robot control. Graph\ntheory is used to visualize relationships and transitions between the\ndiscretized states. The graph representation facilitates mathematical\ndefinition of periodic control patterns (simple cycles) and locomotion gaits.\nRewards corresponding to individual arcs of the graph are weighted displacement\nand orientation change for robot state-to-state transitions. These rewards are\nspecific to surface of locomotion and are learned. Finally, the control\npatterns result from optimization of reward dependent locomotion task (e.g.\ntranslation) cost function. The optimization problem is an Integer Linear\nProgramming problem which can be quickly solved using standard solvers. The\nframework is generic and independent of type of actuator, soft material\nproperties or the type of friction mechanism, as the control exists in the\nrobot's task space. Furthermore, the data-driven nature of the framework\nimparts adaptability to the framework toward different locomotion surfaces by\nre-learning rewards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 21:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

The parameters which\ncharacterize topological properties of brain networks follow one parameter\nscaling theory in all levels of network structure which reveals the\nself-similar rules governing the network structure. The calculated fractal\ndimensions of brain networks of different species are found to decrease when\none goes from lower to higher level species which implicates the more ordered\nand self-organized topography at higher level species. The sparsely distributed\nhubs in brain networks may be most influencing nodes but their absence may not\ncause network breakdown, and centrality parameters characterizing them also\nfollow one parameter scaling law indicating self-similar roles of these hubs at\ndifferent levels of organization in brain networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 09:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

Both simulation and\nexperiment results verify the effectiveness of this novel sensor system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 06:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 10:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

So to\ninduce premature buckling a lateral disturbance will have to overcome a\ndecreasing energy barrier which reaches zero at buckling. Two archetypal\nproblems that exhibit a severe form of this behaviour are the\naxially-compressed cylindrical shell and the externally pressurized spherical\nshell. Focussing on the cylinder, a non-destructive technique was recently\nproposed to estimate the 'shock sensitivity' of a laboratory specimen using a\nlateral probe to measure the nonlinear load-deflection characteristic. If a\nsymmetry-breaking bifurcation is encountered on the path, computer simulations\nshowed how this can be suppressed by a controlled secondary probe. Here, we\nextend our understanding by assessing in general terms how a single control can\ncapture remote saddle solutions: in particular how a symmetric probe could\nlocate an asymmetric solution. Then, more specifically, we analyse the\nspherical shell with point and ring probes, to test the procedure under\nchallenging conditions to assess its range of applicability. Rather than a\nbifurcation, the spherical shell offers the challenge of a de-stabilizing fold\n(limit point) under the rigid control of the probe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 11:27:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 20:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The upper subnetwork, called the logical layer,\nemploys the shortest paths protocol to determine the logical paths for packets\ntransmission, while the lower subnetwork acts as the physical layer, in which\npackets are delivered by the biased random walk mechanism characterized with a\nparameter $\\alpha$. Through simulation, we obtain the optimal $\\alpha$\ncorresponding to the maximum network lifetime and the maximum number of the\narrival packets. Assortative coupling is better than the random coupling and\nthe disassortative coupling, since it achieves much better transmission\nperformances. Generally, the more homogeneous the lower subnetwork, the better\nthe transmission performances are, which is opposite for the upper subnetwork.\nFinally, we propose an attack centrality for nodes based on the topological\ninformation of both subnetworks, and further investigate the transmission\nperformances under targeted attacks. Our work helps to understand the spreading\nand robustness issues of multiplex networks and provides some clues about the\ndesigning of more efficient and robust routing architectures in communication\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 03:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Contrary to\nprevious studies, we consider new forms of non-linear non-gravitational\ninteraction between dark matter and assumed dark energy models. We applied the\nphase space analysis allowing understanding the late time behavior of the\nmodels. It allows demonstrating that considered non-gravitational interactions\ncan solve the cosmological coincidence problem. On the other hand, we applied\nBayesian Machine Learning technique to learn the constraints on the free\nparameters. In this way, we gained a better understanding of the models\nproviding a hint which of them can be ruled out. Moreover, the learning based\non the simulated expansion rate data shows that the models cannot solve the\n$H_{0}$ tension problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 14:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 11:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}
