We show that it is\npossible to identify decoupled graphene monolayer, Bernal bilayer, and Bernal\ntrilayer on graphite surface according to their tunnelling spectra in high\nmagnetic field. The decoupled monolayer and bilayer exhibit Landau quantization\nof massless and massive Dirac fermions, respectively. The substrate generates a\nsizable band gap, ~35 meV, in the Bernal bilayer, therefore, the eightfold\ndegenerate Landau level at the charge neutrality point is split into two\nvalley-polarized quartets polarized on each layer. In the decoupled Bernal\ntrilayer, we find that both massless and massive Dirac fermions coexist and its\nlow-energy band structure can be described quite well by taking into account\nonly the nearest-neighbor intra- and interlayer hopping parameters. A strong\ncorrelation between the Fermi velocity of the massless Dirac fermions and the\neffective mass of the massive Dirac fermions is observed in the trilayer. Our\nresult demonstrates that the surface of graphite provides a natural ideal\nplatform to probe the electronic spectra of graphene layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 16:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}

We may think of individuals as beginning inactive and becoming\nactive after contact with a sufficient number of active partners. These have\nbeen studied in a number of cases, but analytic models for the dynamic spread\nof complex contagions are typically complex. Here we study the dynamics of the\nWatts Threshold Model (WTM) assuming transmission occurs in continuous time as\na Poisson process, or in discrete time where individuals transmit to all\npartners in the time step following their activation. We adapt techniques\ndeveloped for infectious disease modeling to develop and analyze analytic\nmodels for the dynamics of the WTM in Configuration Model networks and a class\nof random clustered (triangle-based) networks. The resulting model is\nrelatively simple and compact. We use it to gain insights into the contagion\ndynamics.

We derive sufficient conditions for this\nhybrid phase transition to occur. We show that in many cases, if the hybrid\nphase transition occurs, all individuals eventually become active.

The star formation\nin our cosmological simulations is characterized by two distinct populations,\nthe so-called Population III.1 stars and primordial stars formed under the\ninfluence of far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation (Population III.2D stars). In this\nwork, we determine the stellar masses by using the dependences on the physical\nproperties of star-forming cloud and/or the external photodissociating\nintensity from nearby primordial stars, which are derived from the results of\ntwo-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar feedback.\nThe characteristic mass of the Pop III stars is found to be a few hundred solar\nmasses at z ~ 25, and it gradually shifts to lower masses with decreasing\nredshift. At high redshifts z > 20, about half of the star-forming gas clouds\nare exposed to intense FUV radiation and thus give birth to massive Pop III.2D\nstars. However, the local FUV radiation by nearby Pop III stars becomes weaker\nat lower redshifts, when typical Pop III stars have smaller masses and the mean\nphysical separation between the stars becomes large owing to cosmic expansion.\nTherefore, at z < 20, a large fraction of the primordial gas clouds host Pop\nIII.1 stars. At z =< 15, the Pop III.1 stars are formed in relatively cool gas\nclouds due to efficient radiative cooling by H_2 and HD molecules; such stars\nhave masses of a few x 10 Msun.

We begin by obtaining the handoff rate for a mobile user in an\nirregular cellular network with the access point locations modeled as a\nhomogeneous Poisson point process. The received signal-to-interference-ratio\n(SIR) distribution along with a chosen SIR threshold is then used to obtain the\nprobability of coverage. To capture potential connection failures due to\nmobility, we assume that a fraction of handoffs result in such failures.\nConsidering a multi-tier network with orthogonal spectrum allocation among\ntiers and the maximum biased average received power as the tier association\nmetric, we derive the probability of coverage for two cases: 1) the user is\nstationary (i.e., handoffs do not occur, or the system is not sensitive to\nhandoffs); 2) the user is mobile, and the system is sensitive to handoffs. We\nderive the optimal bias factors to maximize the coverage. We show that when the\nuser is mobile, and the network is sensitive to handoffs, both the optimum tier\nassociation and the probability of coverage depend on the user's speed; a\nspeed-dependent bias factor can then adjust the tier association to effectively\nimprove the coverage, and hence system performance, in a fully-loaded network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 22:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-09"}

Thus a 126 GeV Higgs boson is problematic within\nthe Standard Model because of vacuum instability pointing to new physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. The problem of vacuum stability is overcome in the SUGRA\nGUT model but the 126 GeV Higgs mass implies that the average SUSY scale lies\nin the several TeV region. The largeness of the SUSY scale relieves the tension\non SUGRA models since it helps suppress flavor changing neutral currents and CP\nviolating effects and also helps in extending the proton life time arising from\nbaryon and lepton number violating dimension five operators.

When the flux is convex, the\ncombination of diffusion and dispersion are known to give rise to monotonic and\noscillatory traveling waves that approximate shock waves. The zero-diffusion\nlimits of these traveling waves are dynamically expanding dispersive shock\nwaves (DSWs). A richer set of wave solutions can be found when the flux is\nnon-convex. This review compares the structure of solutions of Riemann problems\nfor a conservation law with non-convex, cubic flux regularized by two different\nmechanisms: 1) dispersion in the modified Korteweg--de Vries (mKdV) equation;\nand 2) a combination of diffusion and dispersion in the mKdV-Burgers equation.\nIn the first case, the possible dynamics involve two qualitatively different\ntypes of DSWs, rarefaction waves (RWs) and kinks (monotonic fronts). In the\nsecond case, in addition to RWs, there are traveling wave solutions\napproximating both classical (Lax) and non-classical (undercompressive) shock\nwaves. Despite the singular nature of the zero-diffusion limit and rather\ndiffering analytical approaches employed in the descriptions of dispersive and\ndiffusive-dispersive regularization, the resulting comparison of the two cases\nreveals a number of striking parallels. In contrast to the case of convex flux,\nthe mKdVB to mKdV mapping is not one-to-one. The mKdV kink solution is\nidentified as an undercompressive DSW.

Finally, we find that when the disc plane is misaligned to\nthe black hole spin by a large angle, the disc 'tears' into discrete rings\nwhich precess effectively independently and cause rapid accretion, consistent\nwith previous findings in the diffusive regime ($\\alpha \\gtrsim H/R$). Thus\nmisalignment between the disc and the spin axis of the black hole provides a\nrobust mechanism for growing black holes quickly, regardless of whether the\ndisc is thick or thin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 23:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Computational models have become\nincreasingly sophisticated, first in one spatial dimension assuming spherical\nsymmetry, then in two spatial dimensions assuming axisymmetry, and now in three\nspatial dimensions with no imposed symmetries. The increase in the number of\nspatial dimensions has been accompanied by an increase in the physics included\nin the models, and an increase in the sophistication with which this physics\nhas been modeled. Computation has played an essential role in the development\nof CCSN theory, not simply for the obvious reason that such multidimensional,\nmulti-physics, nonlinear events cannot possibly be fully captured analytically,\nbut for its role in discovery. In particular, the discovery of the standing\naccretion shock instability (SASI) through computation about a decade ago has\nimpacted all simulations performed since then. Today, we appear to be at a\nthreshold, where neutrinos, neutrino-driven convection, and the SASI, working\ntogether over time scales significantly longer than had been anticipated in the\npast, are able to generate explosions, and in some cases, robust explosions, in\na number of axisymmetric models.

By exploiting channel reciprocity, a new two-phase channel\ntraining scheme is proposed to achieve the diversity and beamforming gains,\nrespectively. In the first phase, pilot signals are sent from the energy\nreceiver (ER) over a selected subset of the available frequency sub-bands,\nthrough which the ET determines a certain number of \"strongest\" sub-bands with\nlargest antenna sum-power gains and sends their indices to the ER. In the\nsecond phase, the selected sub-bands are further trained by the ER, so that the\nET obtains a refined estimate of the corresponding MISO channels to implement\nenergy beamforming for WET. A training design problem is formulated and\noptimally solved, which takes into account the channel training overhead by\nmaximizing the net harvested energy at the ER, defined as the average harvested\nenergy offset by that consumed in the two-phase training. Moreover, asymptotic\nanalysis is obtained for systems with a large number of antennas or a large\nnumber of sub-bands to gain useful insights on the optimal training design.\nFinally, numerical results are provided to corroborate our analysis and show\nthe effectiveness of the proposed scheme that optimally balances the diversity\nand beamforming gains achieved in MISO WET systems with limited-energy\ntraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 04:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

The steady-state dynamics of PBNs\nis of crucial importance in the study of such systems. However, for large PBNs,\nwhich often arise in systems biology, obtaining the steady-state distribution\nposes a significant challenge. In fact, statistical methods for steady-state\napproximation are the only viable means when dealing with large networks. In\nthis paper, we revive the two-state Markov chain approach presented in the\nliterature.

A routing algorithm on G has a competitive ratio of c if the\nlength of the path produced by the algorithm from any vertex s to any vertex t\nis at most c times the length of the shortest path from s to t in G. If the\nlength of the path is at most c times the Euclidean distance from s to t, we\nsay that the routing algorithm on G has a routing ratio of c.We present an\nonline routing algorithm on the Delaunay triangulation with competitive and\nrouting ratios of 5.90.

The algorithm is a generalization of the\ndeterministic 1-local routing algorithm by Chew on the L1-Delaunay\ntriangulation.

This is an\nimprovement over the currently known competitive routing algorithms on the\nDelaunay triangulation, for which the header of a message must additionally\ncontain partial sums of distances along the routing path.We also show that the\nrouting ratio of any deterministic k-local algorithm is at least 1.70 for the\nDelaunay triangulation and 2.70 for the L1-Delaunay triangulation.

In systems with strong structural and electronic anisotropies, the\ninterlayer separation, s, plays a significant role. In cuprates, the pseudogap\n(PG) correlation induces a downturn in the temperature dependent resistivity.\nAs Tc is approached from above, this downturn in the resistivity is supposed to\neither i) add to or ii) join smoothly to that due to paraconductivity caused by\nshort-lived Cooper pairs. It is important to differentiate between these two\npossibilities since they are closely linked to the origin of the PG. It would\nbe reasonable to assume that if the first scenario is correct then the PG has a\nnon-SC origin, while the second scenario, if found to hold, would relate\nprecursor pairing to the PG correlations.

This implies an ambiguity in the definition of the pion\nand pion decay constant for all Ginsparg-Wilson expressions of the Dirac\noperator, including the overlap operator on the lattice (although all these\ncurrents would have the same continuum limit).

The overlap\noperator, which contains several theoretical advantages over other formulations\nof lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, is more computationally expensive because it\nrequires the computation of the matrix sign function. The principle change made\ncompared to deflation methods for other formulations of lattice QCD is that it\nis necessary for best performance to tune or relax the accuracy of the matrix\nsign function as the computation proceeds.\n  We adapt the eigCG algorithm for two inversion algorithms for overlap\nfermions, GMRESR(relCG) and GMRESR(relSUMR). Before deflation, the rate of\nconvergence of these routines in terms of iterations is similar, but, since the\nShifted Unitary Minimal Residual (SUMR) algorithm only requires one call to the\nmatrix sign function compared to the two calls required for Conjugate Gradient\n(CG), SUMR is usually preferred for single inversions of the Dirac operator. We\nconstruct bounds for the required accuracy of the matrix sign function during\nthe eigenvalue calculation. For the SUMR algorithm, we use a Galerkin\nprojection to perform the deflation; while for the CG algorithm, we are able to\nuse a considerably superior spectral pre-conditioner. The superior performance\nof the spectral preconditioner, and its need for less accurate eigenvalues,\nalmost erodes SUMR's advantage over CG as an inversion algorithm.\n  We see factor of three gains for the inversion algorithm from the deflation\non our small test lattices. There is, however, a significant cost in the\neigenvalue calculation because we cannot relax the accuracy of the matrix sign\nfunction as aggressively when calculating the eigenvalues as we do while\nperforming the inversions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 14:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We propose a transmission strategy, denoted as Statistical\nAlternative MAT (SAMAT), which exploits both channel statistics and delayed\nCSIT. Firstly, with statistical CSIT only, we focus on statistical beamforming\n(SBF) design that maximizes a lower bound on the ergodic sum-rate. Secondly,\nrelying on both statistical and delayed CSIT, an iterative algorithm is\nproposed to compute the precoding vectors of Alternative MAT (AMAT), originally\nproposed by Yang et al., which maximizes an approximation of the ergodic\nsum-rate with equal power allocation. Finally, via proper power allocation, the\nSAMAT framework is proposed to softly bridge between SBF and AMAT for an\narbitrary number of transmit antennas and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A\nnecessary condition for the power allocation optimization is identified from\nthe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The optimum power allocation to\nmaximize an ergodic sum-rate approximation is computed using Sequential\nQuadratic Programming (SQP).

This combination of magnetic field and spiralling plasma is a\nrecipe for the generation of Alfv\\'en waves and other MHD waves.\n  This work employs numerical simulations of a self-similar magnetic flux tube\nembedded in a realistic, gravitationally stratified, solar atmosphere to study\nthe effects of a single magnetic flux tube perturbed by a logarithmic velocity\nspiral driver. The expansion factor of the logarithmic spiral driver is varied\nand multiple simulations are run for a range of values of the expansion factor\ncentred around observational constraints.\n  The simulations are analysed using `flux surfaces' constructed from the\nmagnetic field lines so that the vectors perpendicular, parallel and azimuthal\nto the local magnetic field vector can be calculated. The results of this\nanalysis show that the Alfv\\'en wave is the dominant wave for lower values of\nthe expansion factor, whereas, for the higher values the parallel component is\ndominant. This transition occurs within the range of the observational\nconstraints, meaning that spiral drivers, as observed in the solar photosphere,\nhave the potential to generate a variety of MHD wave modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 14:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 12:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

This paper aims to detect a reliable drift in\nsemi-major axis of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) from ground-based observations\nand to investigate the impact of precovery observations and the future Gaia\ncatalogue in the detection of a secular drift in semi-major axis. We have\ndeveloped a precise dynamical model of an asteroid's motion taking the\nYarkovsky acceleration into account and allowing the fitting of the drift in\nsemi-major axis. Using statistical methods, we investigate the quality and the\nrobustness of the detection. By filtering spurious detections with an estimated\nmaximum drift depending on the asteroid's size, we found 46 NEAs with a\nreliable drift in semi-major axis in good agreement with the previous studies.\nThe measure of the drift leads to a better orbit determination and constrains\nsome physical parameters of these objects. Our results are in good agreement\nwith the 1/D dependence of the drift and with the expected ratio of prograde\nand retrograde NEAs. We show that the uncertainty of the drift mainly depends\non the length of orbital arc and in this way we highlight the importance of the\nprecovery observations and data mining in the detection of consistent drift.\nFinally, we discuss the impact of Gaia catalogue in the determination of drift\nin semi-major axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 14:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

The principle is to\nbegin with a location phase for managing initial incidents and to progress\nthrough a routing phase for managing the stochastic occurrence of next\nincidents. Previous models used the frequency of independent incidents and\nignored scenarios in which two incidents occurred within proximal regions and\nintervals. The proposed analytical model relaxes the structural assumptions of\nPoisson process (independent increments) and incorporates evolution of primary\nand secondary incident probabilities over time. The proposed mathematical model\novercomes several limiting assumptions of the previous models, such as no\nwaiting-time and returning rule to original depot. Our stochastic programming\nmethod hedges well against a wide range of scenarios in which probabilities of\na sequence of incidents are assigned. The initial non-linear stochastic model\nis linearized. As a long-term strategy, the model incorporates flexibility in\nchoosing the locations. The temporal locations flexible to a future\npolicy-change are compared with current practice that locates all units in one\npermanent depot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 04:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 19:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

Emergy\nanalysis is one of the possible methods useful for such an assessment. This\nwork aims to demonstrate how the emergy approach can be used to assess the\nsustainability of wind energy resource in Europe. The Emergy Index of\nSustainability (EIS) and the Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) are used to analyze 90\nstations of European regions for three types of wind turbines. To do so, the\nsimplified Chou wind turbine model is used for different set of parameters as:\nnominal power and size of the wind turbines, and cut-in and cut-out wind\nspeeds. Based on the calculation of the emergy indices, a mapping is proposed\nto identify the most appropriate locations for an implementation of wind\nturbines in European regions. The influence of the wind turbine type on the\nsustainability is also analyzed, in link with the local wind resource. Thus, it\nis concluded that the emergy sustainability indices are sensitive to the wind\nturbine design parameters (size, cut-in and cut-out wind speed).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 21:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

A single Gaussian fit of\nthe line profile provides an adequate approximation in quiet-Sun areas, whereas\na strong shoulder on the long-wavelength side is a systematic feature in CHs.\nAlthough this has been noticed since 1999, no physical reason for the peculiar\nshape could be given. In an attempt to identify the cause of this peculiarity,\nwe address three problems that could not be conclusively resolved in a review\narticle by a study team of the International Space Science Institute (ISSI;\nWilhelm et al. 2011) : (1) The physical processes operating at the base and\ninside of plumes as well as their interaction with the solar wind (SW). (2) The\npossible contribution of plume plasma to the fast SW streams. (3) The signature\nof the first-ionization potential (FIP) effect between plumes and inter-plume\nregions (IPRs). Before the spectroscopic peculiarities in IPRs and plumes in\npolar coronal holes (PCHs) can be further investigated with the instrument\nSolar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation (SUMER) aboard the Solar\nand Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), it is mandatory to summarize the results\nof the review to place the spectroscopic observations into context. Finally, a\nplume model is proposed that satisfactorily explains the plasma flows up and\ndown the plume field lines and leads to the shape of the neon line in PCHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 08:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
