Coordinated activity of neurons can give rise to\noscillations which are captured by electroencephalograms (EEG). In this paper,\nwe examine EEGs as this is the primary data being used by our collaborators who\nare studying coordination of neuronal response during the execution of tasks\nsuch as learning, and memory formation, retention and retrieval. In this paper,\nwe develop the spectral merger clustering (SMC) method that identifies\nsynchronized brain regions during resting state in a sense that these regions\nshare similar oscillations or waveforms. The SMC method, produces clusters of\nEEGs which serve as a proxy for segmenting the brain cortical surface since the\nEEGs capture neuronal activity over a locally distributed region on the\ncortical surface. The extent of desynchronicity between a pair of EEGs is\nmeasured using the total variation distance (TVD) which gives the largest\npossible difference between the spectral densities of the pair of EEGs. We\nconsidered the spectral merger algorithm for clustering EEGs, which updates the\nspectral estimate of the cluster from a weighted average of the spectral\nestimate obtained from each EEG in the cluster. Numerical experiments suggest\nthat the SMC method performs very well in producing the correct clusters. When\napplied to resting state EEG data, the method showed how some regions, though\nnot contiguously connected on the cortical surface, are spectrally synchronized\nduring resting state. Moreover, the method demonstrates that brain\norganization, as expressed in cluster formation, evolves over resting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 16:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-20"}

In this study, we perform\nab initio molecular dynamics to calculate the elastic and seismic properties of\npure, Fe^{3+}- and Fe^{2+}-, and Al^{3+}-bearing MgSiO_3 perovskite and\npost-perovskite, over a wide range of pressures, temperatures, and Fe/Al\ncompositions. Our results show that a mineral assemblage resembling pyrolite\nfits a 1D seismological model well, down to, at least, a few hundred kilometers\nabove the core-mantle boundary, i.e. the top of the D'' region. In D'', a\nsimilar composition is still an excellent fit to the average velocities and\nfairly approximate to the density. We also implement polycrystal plasticity\nwith a geodynamic model to predict resulting seismic anisotropy, and find\npost-perovskite with predominant (001) slip across all compositions agrees best\nwith seismic observations in the D''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 16:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

This is released as a\nlocalised explosive airburst within a few scale heights H around 200 km of the\nphotosphere, depending weakly on Mo , q and X. For X = 0.01, Mo around 1E15 g,\nand a typical Kreutz Group shallow incidence angle, comet the airburst occurs\naround atmospheric density n around 3E15 per ml and this would be 1000 times\nlarger (700 km deeper) for vertical entry. Such airbursts drive flare like\nphenomena including prompt radiation, hot rising plumes and photospheric\nripples, the observability and diagnostic value of which we discuss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 18:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

The\nresulting linear system from compact FD discretization is solved by the\nconjugate gradient (CG) method with a relative residual stopping criterion. By\ncombining the Richardson extrapolation and tri-quartic Lagrange interpolation\nfor the numerical solutions from two-level of grids (current and previous\ngrids), we are able to produce an extremely accurate approximation of the\nactual numerical solution on the next finer grid, which can greatly reduce the\nnumber of relaxation sweeps needed. Additionally, a simple method based on the\nmidpoint extrapolation formula is used for the fourth-order FD solutions on\ntwo-level of grids to achieve sixth-order accuracy on the entire fine grid\ncheaply and directly. The gradient of the numerical solution can also be easily\nobtained through solving a series of tridiagonal linear systems resulting from\nthe fourth-order compact FD discretizations. Numerical results show that our\nEXCMG method is much more efficient than the classical V-cycle and W-cycle\nmultigrid methods.

Compared to\nthe LTE based 4G mobile communication system that allows for up to 8 antenna\nelements at the base station (BS), the LS-MIMO system entails an unprecedented\nnumber of antennas, say 100 or more, at the BS. The huge leap in the number of\nBS antennas opens the door to a new research field in communication theory,\npropagation and electronics, where random matrix theory begins to play a\ndominant role.\n  In this paper, we provide a recital on the historic heritages and novel\nchallenges facing LS-MIMOs from a detection perspective. Firstly, we highlight\nthe fundamentals of MIMO detection, including the nature of co-channel\ninterference, the generality of the MIMO detection problem, the received signal\nmodels of both linear memoryless MIMO channels and dispersive MIMO channels\nexhibiting memory, as well as the complex-valued versus real-valued MIMO system\nmodels. Then, an extensive review of the representative MIMO detection methods\nconceived during the past 50 years (1965-2015) is presented, and relevant\ninsights as well as lessons are inferred for designing complexity-scalable MIMO\ndetection algorithms that are potentially applicable to LS-MIMO systems.\nFurthermore, we divide the LS-MIMO systems into two types, and elaborate on the\ndistinct detection strategies suitable for each of them.

We find that voids in the velocity shear web are smaller\nthan voids in the tidal web, with a particular overabundance of very small\nvoids in the inner region of filaments/sheets. We classify voids as\nsubcompensated/overcompansated depending on the absence/presence of an\noverdense matter ridge in their density profile, finding that close to $65\\%$\nand $35\\%$ of the total population are classified into each category,\nrespectively. Finally, we find evidence for the existence of universal profiles\nfrom the radially averaged profiles for density, velocity and fractional\nanisotropy. This requires that the radial coordinate is normalized to the\neffective radius of each void. Put together, all these results show that the FA\nis a reliable tracer for voids, which can be used in complementarity to other\nexisting methods and tracers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 12:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

The Mondrian process is a guillotine-partition-valued\nstochastic process that possesses an elegant self-consistency property. The\nfirst part of the report uses simple concepts from applied probability to\ndefine the Mondrian process and explore its properties.\n  The Mondrian process has been used as the main building block of a clever\nonline random forest classification algorithm that turns out to be equivalent\nto its batch counterpart. We outline a slight adaptation of this algorithm to\nregression, as the remainder of the report uses regression as a case study of\nhow Mondrian processes can be utilized in machine learning. In particular, the\nMondrian process will be used to construct a fast approximation to the\ncomputationally expensive kernel ridge regression problem with a Laplace\nkernel.\n  The complexity of random guillotine partitions generated by a Mondrian\nprocess and hence the complexity of the resulting regression models is\ncontrolled by a lifetime hyperparameter. It turns out that these models can be\nefficiently trained and evaluated for all lifetimes in a given range at once,\nwithout needing to retrain them from scratch for each lifetime value. This\nleads to an efficient procedure for determining the right model complexity for\na dataset at hand.\n  The limitation of having a single lifetime hyperparameter will motivate the\nfinal Mondrian grid model, in which each input dimension is endowed with its\nown lifetime parameter. In this model we preserve the property that its\nhyperparameters can be tweaked without needing to retrain the modified model\nfrom scratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 12:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

For cubic-to-tetragonal transformations we show that homogeneous\nzero-energy microstructures matching a pure dilatation on a grain boundary\nnecessarily involve more than four deformation gradients. We discuss the\nrelevance of this result for observations of microstructures involving second\nand third-order laminates in various materials. Finally we consider the more\nspecialized situation of bicrystals formed from materials having two\nmartensitic energy wells (such as for orthorhombic to monoclinic\ntransformations), but without any restrictions on the possible microstructure,\nshowing how a generalization of the Hadamard jump condition can be applied at\nthe intergrain boundary to show that a pure phase in either grain is impossible\nat minimum energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 15:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2015 14:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

Theory and Methods: ESPIRiT is a new\nframework for calibration of the coil sensitivities and reconstruction in\nparallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Applying ESPIRiT to a combined set\nof physical and virtual conjugate coils (VCC-ESPIRiT) implicitly exploits\nconjugate symmetry in k-space similar to VCC-GRAPPA. Based on this method, a\nnew post-processing step is proposed for the explicit computation of coil\nsensitivities that include the absolute phase of the image. The accuracy of the\ncomputed maps is directly validated using a test based on projection onto fully\nsampled coil images and also indirectly in phase-constrained parallel-imaging\nreconstructions. Results: The proposed method can estimate accurate\nsensitivities which include low-resolution image phase. In case of\nhigh-frequency phase variations VCC-ESPIRiT yields an additional set of maps\nthat indicates the existence of a high-frequency phase component. Taking this\nadditional set of maps into account can improve the robustness of\nphase-constrained parallel imaging. Conclusion: The extended VCC-ESPIRiT is a\nuseful tool for phase-constrained imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 22:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 09:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}
