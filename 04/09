A sequence of high-resolution\nimages was acquired during the flyby mission. In combination with ground-based\nradar observations collected over the last two decades, we analyze these flyby\nimages and determine the orientation of the asteroid at the flyby epoch. The\n3-1-3 Euler angles of the conversion matrix from the J2000 ecliptic coordinate\nsystem to the body-fixed frame are evaluated to be $-20.1^\\circ\\pm1^\\circ$,\n$27.6^\\circ\\pm1^\\circ$ and $42.2^\\circ\\pm1^\\circ$, respectively. The\nleast-squares method is utilized to determine the rotational parameters and\nspin state of Toutatis. The characteristics of the spin-state parameters and\nangular momentum variations are extensively studied using numerical\nsimulations, which confirm those reported by \\citet{Takahashi2013}. The large\namplitude of Toutatis' precession is assumed to be responsible for its tumbling\nattitude as observed from Earth. Toutatis' angular momentum orientation is\ndetermined to be described by $\\lambda_{H}=180.2^{+0.2^\\circ}_{-0.3^\\circ}$ and\n$\\beta_{H}=-54.75^{+0.15^\\circ}_{-0.10^\\circ}$, implying that it has remained\nnearly unchanged for two decades. Furthermore, using Fourier analysis to\nexplore the change in the orientation of Toutatis' axes, we reveal that the two\nrotational periods are 5.38 and 7.40 days, respectively, consistent with the\nresults of the former investigation. Hence, our investigation provides a clear\nunderstanding of the state of the rotational dynamics of Toutatis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 16:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Formal demography has a long history of building simple models of\nage schedules of demographic quantities, e.g. mortality and fertility rates.\nThese are widely used in demographic methods to manipulate whole age schedules\nusing few parameters.\n  OBJECTIVE. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorizes a matrix into\nthree matrices with useful properties including the ability to reconstruct the\noriginal matrix using many fewer, simple matrices. This work demonstrates how\nthese properties can be exploited to build parsimonious models of whole age\nschedules of demographic quantities that can be further parameterized in terms\nof arbitrary covariates.\n  METHODS. The SVD is presented and explained in detail with attention to\ndeveloping an intuitive understanding. The SVD is used to construct a general,\ncomponent model of demographic age schedules, and that model is demonstrated\nwith age-specific mortality and fertility rates. Finally, the model is used (1)\nto predict age-specific mortality using HIV indicators and summary measures of\nage-specific mortality, and (2) to predict age-specific fertility using the\ntotal fertility rate (TFR).\n  RESULTS. The component model of age-specific mortality and fertility rates\nsucceeds in reproducing the data with two inputs, and acting through those two\ninputs, various covariates are able to accurately predict full age schedules.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The SVD is potentially useful as a way to summarize, smooth and\nmodel age-specific demographic quantities. The component model is a general\nmethod of relating covariates to whole age schedules.\n  COMMENTS. The focus of this work is the SVD and the component model.

The line of\nsight distance to a galaxy inferred from redshift is affected by the peculiar\nvelocity component of galaxy redshift, which is observed as an anisotropy in\nthe correlation function. This anisotropy allows us to measure the linear\ngrowth rate of matter ($f\\sigma_8$). We measure the $f\\sigma_8$ at $z=0.57$\nusing the CMASS sample from Data Release 11 of Sloan Digital Sky Survey III\n(SDSS III) Baryon Oscillations Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). The galaxy sample\nconsists of 690,826 massive galaxies in the redshift range 0.43-0.7 covering\n8498 deg$^2$. Here we report the first simultaneous measurement of $f\\sigma_8$\nand background cosmological parameters using Convolution Lagrangian\nPerturbation Theory (CLPT) with Gaussian streaming model (GSRSD). We arrive at\na constraint of $f\\sigma_8=0.462\\pm0.041$ (9\\% accuracy) at effective redshift\n($\\bar{z}=0.57$) when we include Planck CMB likelihood while marginalizing over\nall other cosmological parameters. We also measure $b\\sigma_8=1.19\\pm0.03$,\n$H(z=0.57)=89.2\\pm3.6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $D_A(z=0.57)=1401\\pm23$ Mpc.\nOur analysis also improves the constraint on $\\Omega_c h^2=0.1196\\pm0.0009$ by\na factor of 3 when compared to the Planck only measurement($\\Omega_c h^2=0.1196\n\\pm 0.0031$). Our results are consistent with Planck $\\Lambda$CDM-GR prediction\nand all other CMASS measurements, even though our theoretical models are fairly\ndifferent. This consistency suggests that measurement of $f\\sigma_8$ from\nRedshift space distortions at multiple redshifts will be a sensitive probe of\nthe theory of gravity that is largely model independent, allowing us to place\nmodel-independent constraints on alternative models of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 20:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 01:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 17:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

While scalars and tensors are\ntypically produced with a nearly scale-invariant spectrum, surprisingly the\nvector is produced with a power spectrum peaked at intermediate wavelengths.\nThus dangerous, long-wavelength, isocurvature perturbations are suppressed.\nFurther, at long wavelengths the vector inherits the usual adiabatic, nearly\nscale-invariant perturbations of the inflaton, allowing it to be a good dark\nmatter candidate. The final abundance can be calculated precisely from the mass\nand the Hubble scale of inflation, H_I. Saturating the dark matter abundance we\nfind a prediction for the mass m = 10^-5 eV (10^14 GeV/H_I)^4. High-scale\ninflation, potentially observable in the CMB, motivates an exciting mass range\nfor recently proposed direct detection experiments for hidden photon dark\nmatter. Such experiments may be able to reconstruct the distinctive, peaked\npower spectrum, verifying that the dark matter was produced by quantum\nfluctuations during inflation and providing a direct measurement of the scale\nof inflation.

This new catalog is\na significant improvement compared to previous polarimetric catalogs for the\nSMC. We used it to study the sky-projected interstellar magnetic field\nstructure of the SMC. Three trends were observed for the ordered magnetic field\ndirection at position angles of $(65 \\pm 10)$ deg, $(115 \\pm 10)$ deg, and\n$(150 \\pm 10)$ deg. Our results suggest the existence of an ordered magnetic\nfield aligned with the Magellanic Bridge direction and SMC's Bar in the NE\nregion, which have position angles roughly at $115.4$ deg and $45$ deg,\nrespectively. However, the overall magnetic field structure is fairly complex.\nThe trends at $115$ deg and $150$ deg may be correlated with the SMC's bimodal\nstructure, observed in Cepheids' distances and HI velocities.

Empirical study has shown consistently that Vandermonde\nmatrices tend to be badly ill-conditioned, with a narrow class of notable\nexceptions, such as the matrices of the discrete Fourier transform (hereafter\nreferred to as DFT). So far formal support for this empirical observation,\nhowever, has been limited to the matrices defined by the real set of knots. We\nprove that, more generally, any Vandermonde matrix of a large size is badly\nill-conditioned unless its knots are more or less equally spaced on or about\nthe circle $C(0,1)=\\{x:\\,|x|=1\\}$. The matrices of DFT are perfectly\nconditioned, being defined by a cyclic sequence of knots, equally spaced on\nthat circle, but we prove that even a slight modification of the knots into the\nso called quasi-cyclic sequence on this circle defines badly ill-conditioned\nVandermonde matrices. Likewise we prove that the half-size leading block of a\nlarge DFT matrix is badly ill-conditioned. (This result was motivated by an\napplication to pre-conditioning of an input matrix for Gaussian elimination\nwith no pivoting.) Our analysis involves the Ekkart--Young theorem, the\nVandermonde-to-Cauchy transformation of matrix structure, our new inversion\nformula for a Cauchy matrix, and low-rank approximation of its large\nsubmatrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 20:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 20:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 08:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-13"}

Density profiles are\nsteeper in WDM but become shallower at scales less than one percent of the\nvirial radius.

Understanding touch patterns during\ntext entry could be useful in designing robust error-correction algorithms for\nsoft keyboards. In this paper, we present an analysis of text input behaviors\non a soft QWERTY keyboard in three different text entry postures: index finger\nonly, one thumb, and two thumb. Our work expands on the work of [1] by\nconsidering the entire surface area of digit contact with the smartphone\nkeyboard, rather than interpreting each touch as a single point. To do this, we\ncaptured touch areas for every key in a lab study with 8 participants and\ncalculated offsets, error rates, and size measurements. We then repeated the\noriginal experiment described in [1] and showed that significant differences\nexist when basing offset calculations on touch area compared to touch points\nfor two postures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 21:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-10"}

It should be noted that \"the block\ntransposition distance of a permutation\" is the distance of the permutation\nfrom the identity permutation in the Cayley graph $\\Cay$, and \"sorting a\npermutation by block transpositions\" is equivalent to finding shortest paths in\n$\\Cay$. The original results in our thesis concern the lower and upper bounds\non the block transpositions diameter of $\\Sym_n$ with respect to $S_n$ and the\nautomorphism group $\\Aut(\\Cay)$. A significant contribution is to show how from\nthe toric equivalence can be obtained bijective maps on $\\Sym_n$ that we call\n\\emph{toric maps}.

The\ndistinctive feature of the hidden modes is that unlike ordinary ones, their\nlifetimes remain constant in a wide range of the strength of disorder. In this\nrange, the averaged ratio of the number of transmission peaks $N_{\\rm res}$ to\nthe number of QNMs $N_{\\rm mod}$, $N_{\\rm res}/N_{\\rm mod}$, is insensitive to\nthe type and degree of disorder and is close to the value $\\sqrt{2/5}$, which\nwe derive analytically in the weak-scattering approximation.

We prove that for a class of infinitely many digraphs with messages of\nany length, interlinked cycle cover provides an optimal index code.\nFurthermore, the index code is linear with linear time encoding complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 01:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

The energy release and particle acceleration during\nreconnection have been proposed as a mechanism for producing high-energy\nemissions and cosmic rays. We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows.

In this paper, quantum vacuum friction (QVF) is suggested to be a\ndirect consequence of super-strong {\\em surface} fields, therefore the magnetar\nmodel could then be tested further through the QVF braking. Pulsars' high\nsurface magnetic field interacting with the quantum vacuum result in a\nsignificantly high spindown rate ($\\dot{P}$).

This drag transfers momentum from the impurity to the background and\nincreases the effective mass. The effective mass saturates to the total mass of\nthe system for infinitely repulsive interactions. For attractive interactions,\nthe drag again increases the effective mass which quickly saturates to twice\nthe mass of a single particle as a polaron of the impurity and one fermion is\nformed.

The goal, then, is to infer the\nparameters, typically coefficients of the PDE, from partial measurements of the\nsolutions of the PDE for several right-hand-sides. Such PDE-constrained\nproblems can be solved by finding a stationary point of the Lagrangian, which\nentails simultaneously updating the paramaters and the (adjoint) state\nvariables. For large-scale problems, such an all-at-once approach is not\nfeasible as it requires storing all the state variables. In this case one\nusually resorts to a reduced approach where the constraints are explicitly\neliminated (at each iteration) by solving the PDEs. These two approaches, and\nvariations thereof, are the main workhorses for solving PDE-constrained\noptimization problems arising from inverse problems. In this paper, we present\nan alternative method that aims to combine the advantages of both approaches.\nOur method is based on a quadratic penalty formulation of the constrained\noptimization problem. By eliminating the state variable, we develop an\nefficient algorithm that has roughly the same computational complexity as the\nconventional reduced approach while exploiting a larger search space.

A direct consequence of such an effect\nis easy destruction of skyrmions at the nanotrack edges during their fast\nmotions along the nanotrack, despite their topological protection. Here we\npropose an entirely novel solution of completely inhibiting such skyrmion Hall\neffect without affecting its topological properties based on a\nantiferromagnetic-coupling bilayer system. We show that a pair of magnetic\nskyrmions can be nucleated in such a bilayer system through vertical current\ninjection or converted from a current-driven domain-wall pair. Once nucleated,\nthe skyrmion pair can be displaced through current-induced spin torque either\nfrom a vertical injected current or in-plane current. The skyrmion Hall effect\nis completely suppressed due to the cancellation of back-action forces acting\non each individual skyrmion, resulting in a straight and fast motion of\nskyrmions along the current direction. This proposal will be of fundamental\ninterests by introducing the bilayer degree of freedom into the system.\nMoreover, it provides an easy way to engineer the transport properties of the\nskyrmionic devices to achieve desired performance, making it highly promising\nfor practical applications such as ultradense memory and information-processing\ndevices based on skyrmions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 10:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-22"}

A new data reduction pipeline has been in\nplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,\nsearches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as\nwell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection\nheuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs; P < 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery\ntotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB).

However, we\nalso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used\nthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P >= 100 ms that\ngradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for P > 4 s at DM < 150 pc/cc.\nThis degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise.

Both the stratospheric temperature and composition are affected by this\nlatitudinally varying insolation along Saturn's orbital path. A new time\ndependent 2D photochemical model is presented to study the seasonal evolution\nof Saturn's stratospheric composition. This study focuses on the impact of the\nseasonally variable thermal field on the main stratospheric C2 hydrocarbon\nchemistry (C2H2 and C2H6) using a realistic radiative climate model. Meridional\nmixing and advective processes are implemented in the model but turned off in\nthe present study for the sake of simplicity. The results are compared to a\nsimple study case where a latitudinally and temporally steady thermal field is\nassumed. Our simulations suggest that, when the seasonally variable thermal\nfield is accounted for, the downward diffusion of the seasonally produced\nhydrocarbons is faster due to the seasonal compression of the atmospheric\ncolumn during winter. This effect increases with increasing latitudes which\nexperience the most important thermal changes in the course of the seasons. The\nseasonal variability of C2H2 and C2H6 therefore persists at higher-pressure\nlevels with a seasonally-variable thermal field. Cassini limb-observations of\nC2H2 and C2H6 (Guerlet et al., 2009) are reasonably well-reproduced from the\nequator to 40{\\deg} in both hemispheres\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 14:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The observed frequencies suggest\nthat spinning grains should be on the order of 1 nm in size, hinting at\npoly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. We present data from AKARI/Infrared\nCamera (IRC), due to the effective PAH/Unidentified Infrared Band (UIR)\ncoverage of its 9 micron survey to investigate their role within a few regions\nshowing strong AME in the Planck low frequency data. We include the well\nstudied Perseus and rho Ophiuchi clouds . We use the IRAS/IRIS 100 micron data\nto account for the overall dust temperature. We present our results as\nabundance maps for dust emitting around 9 micron, and 100 micron. Part of the\nAME in these regions may actually be attributed to thermal dust emission, or\nthe star forming nature of these targets is masking the vibrational modes of\nPAHs which should be present there, suggesting further investigation for\nvarious galactic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 15:12:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 14:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2018 12:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

Icy dwarf planets are key for studying the chemical and physical\nstates of ices in the outer solar system. The study of secular and rotational\nvariations gives us hints of the processes that contribute to the evolution of\ntheir surface. Aims. The aim of this work is to search for rotational\nvariability on the surface composition of the dwarf planet (136472) Makemake\nMethods. We observed Makemake in April 2008 with the medium-resolution\nspectrograph ISIS, at the William Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain) and\nobtained a set of spectra in the 0.28 - 0.52 {\\mu}m and 0.70 - 0.95 {\\mu}m\nranges, covering 82% of its rotational period. For the rotational analysis, we\norganized the spectra in four different sets corresponding to different\nrotational phases, and after discarding one with low signal to noise, we\nanalyzed three of them that cover 71% of the surface. For these spectra we\ncomputed the spectral slope and compared the observed spectral bands of methane\nice with reflectances of pure methane ice to search for shifts of the center of\nthe bands, related to the presence of CH 4 /N 2 solid solution. Results. All\nthe spectra have a red color with spectral slopes between 20%/1000 {\\AA} and\n32%/1000 {\\AA} in accordance with previously reported values. Some variation in\nthe spectral slope is detected, pointing to the possibility of a variation in\nthe surface content or the particle size of the solid organic compound. The\nabsorption bands of methane ice present a shift toward shorter wavelengths,\nindicating that methane (at least partially) is in solid solution with\nnitrogen. There is no variation within the errors of the shifts with the\nwavelength or with the depth of the bands, so there is no evidence of variation\nin the CH 4 /N 2 mixing ratio with rotation. By comparing with all the\navailable data in the literature, no secular compositional variations between\n2005 and 2008 is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 15:25:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In this work, we conduct\nan extensive evaluation of CNN-based face recognition systems (CNN-FRS) on a\ncommon ground to make our work easily reproducible.

For instance, the dimensionality of the learned features can be\nsignificantly reduced without adverse effect on face recognition accuracy. In\naddition, traditional metric learning method exploiting CNN-learned features is\nevaluated.

Metal-poor stars should contain fewer\nisotopes that form via the s-process, according to currently accepted theory.\nIt has been shown in several investigations that theory and observation do not\nagree well, raising questions on the validity of either the methodology or the\ntheory. We analyse the metal-poor star HD140283, for which we have a high\nquality spectrum. We test whether a 3D LTE stellar atmosphere and spectrum\nsynthesis code permits a more reliable analysis of the iron abundance and\nbarium isotope ratio than a 1D LTE analysis. Using 3D model atmospheres, we\nexamine 91 iron lines of varying strength and formation depth. This provides us\nwith the star's rotational speed. With this, we model the barium isotope ratio\nby exploiting the hyperfine structure of the singly ionised 4554 resonance\nline, and study the impact of the uncertainties in the stellar parameters.\nHD140283's vsini = 1.65 +/- 0.05 km/s. Barium isotopes under the 3D paradigm\nshow a dominant r-process signature as 77 +/- 6 +/- 17% of barium isotopes form\nvia the r-process, where errors represent the assigned random and systematic\nerrors, respectively. We find that 3D LTE fits reproduce iron line profiles\nbetter than those in 1D, but do not provide a unique abundance (within the\nuncertainties). However, we demonstrate that the isotopic ratio is robust\nagainst this shortcoming. Our barium isotope result agrees well with currently\naccepted theory regarding the formation of the heavy-elements during the early\nGalaxy. The improved fit to the asymmetric iron line profiles suggests that the\ncurrent state of 3D LTE modelling provides excellent simulations of fluid\nflows. However, the abundances they provide are not yet self-consistent. This\nmay improve with NLTE considerations and higher resolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 15:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

A general concept of\nlogistics network is suggested and motivated for modeling a service of any kind\nsupplied through links between the nodes of the network. The efficiency of a\nsingle link is defined to be the ratio of the volume of useful service at the\noutput node to the volume of expended service at the input node of the link\n(for a specific period of time). Similarly, the efficiency of a chain is the\nratio of the volume of service at the output to the volume of service at the\ninput of the chain. The overall efficiency of the chain is calculated as the\nproduct of the efficiencies of its links; the more efficiency of the chain, the\nless are the losses in the chain. This paper introduces the notion of\ninadequacy of service in such a way that the overall inadequacy of a chain is\nequal to the sum of the inadequacies of its links. So the efficiencies are\nbeing multiplied, whereas the inadequacies are being added. Thus, the\nantagonistic pair (efficiency, inadequacy) appears to be analogous to the pair\n(reliability, entropy) in communication theory. Various possible\ninterpretations of the proposed logistic model are presented: energy, material,\ninformation and financial networks. Four algorithms are provided for logistics\nchain search: two algorithms for finding the most effective chain from a\nspecified origin to a specified destination, and two algorithms for finding the\nguaranteed minimum level of service between any pair of unspecified nodes in a\ngiven network. An example is shown as to how one of the algorithms finds the\nmost efficient energy chain from the electrical substation to a specified user\nin a concrete energy network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 11:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

The presence of Zipf's law\ntogether with long-range memory effects was observed in several systems,\nhowever, the simultaneous emergence of these two phenomena were always studied\nseparately up to now. In this work, by making use of a variant of the\nYule-Simon preferential growth model, introduced by Cattuto et al., we provide\nan explanation for the simultaneous emergence of Zipf's law and long-range\ncorrelations memory effects in a chess database. We find that Cattuto's Model\n(CM) is able to reproduce both, Zipf's law and the long-range correlations,\nincluding size-dependent scaling of the Hurst exponent for the corresponding\ntime series. CM allows an explanation for the simultaneous emergence of these\ntwo phenomena via a preferential growth dynamics, including a memory kernel, in\nthe popularity distribution of chess game-lines. This mechanism results in an\naging process in the chess game-line choice as the database grows. Moreover, we\nfind burstiness in the activity of subsets of the most active players, although\nthe aggregated activity of the pool of players displays inter-event times\nwithout burstiness. We show that CM is not able to produce time series with\nbursty behavior providing evidence that burstiness is not required for the\nexplanation of the long-range correlation effects in the chess database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 14:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 19:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}
