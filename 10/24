The [Ne V]$\\lambda 3426$ emission is the most interesting\nfeature of the spectra and the key to breaking the degeneracy between the\nmodels: since this emission-line is more extended than HeII, it challenges the\nionization structure proposed by any photoionization model, also its intensity\nrelative to H$\\beta$ does not behave as expected with respect to the ionization\nparameter U in the same scenario. On the contrary, when it is compared to the\nintensity of [OII]$\\lambda3727$/H$\\beta$ and all these results are joined, the\nwhole scenario is plausible to be explained as emission coming from the hot,\ncompressed, shocked gas in shock-ionization models. Although the model fitting\nis strongly sensitive to the chosen line-ratios, it argues for the presence of\nexternal and strong ionizing fields, such as the precursor field created by the\nshock or/and the AGN radiation field.

For complex models encountered in\napplications, efficient computational tools robust to the number of uncertain\nparameters in the problem are required for computing the posterior statistics,\nwhich can generally be formulated as a multi-dimensional integral over the\nspace of the uncertain parameters. Subset Simulation (SuS) has been developed\nfor solving reliability problems involving complex systems and it is found to\nbe robust to the number of uncertain parameters.

In such games, multiple\nstrategic agents control the system dynamics and have different information\nabout the system over time. Because of the presence of asymmetric information,\neach agent needs to form beliefs about other agents' private information.\nTherefore, the specification of the agents' beliefs along with their strategies\nis necessary to study the dynamic game. We use Perfect Bayesian equilibrium\n(PBE) as our solution concept. A PBE consists of a pair of strategy profile and\nbelief system. In a PBE, every agent's strategy should be a best response under\nthe belief system, and the belief system depends on agents' strategy profile\nwhen there is signaling among agents. Therefore, the circular dependence\nbetween strategy profile and belief system makes it difficult to compute PBE.\nUsing the common information among agents, we introduce a subclass of PBE\ncalled common information based perfect Bayesian equilibria (CIB-PBE), and\nprovide a sequential decomposition of the dynamic game. Such decomposition\nleads to a backward induction algorithm to compute CIB-PBE. We illustrate the\nsequential decomposition with an example of a multiple access broadcast game.\nWe prove the existence of CIB-PBE for a subclass of dynamic games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 18:05:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

However, not any soft-supersymmetry-breaking Lagrangian\ncan be obtained this way since the string theory equations of motion impose\ncertain relations between the soft couplings.

Here we present results of a multiwavelength investigation\nof the morphologies of \"tadpole\" galaxies at intermediate redshift\n(0.314<z<3.175) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. These galaxies were previously\nselected from deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F775W data based on their\ndistinct asymmetric knot-plus-tail morphologies (Straughn et al. 2006). Here we\nuse deep Wide Field Camera 3 near-infrared imaging in addition to the HST\noptical data in order to study the rest-frame UV/optical morphologies of these\ngalaxies across the redshift range 0.3<z<3.2. This study reveals that the\nmajority of these galaxies do retain their general asymmetric morphology in the\nrest-frame optical over this redshift range, if not the distinct \"tadpole\"\nshape. The average stellar mass of tadpole galaxies is lower than field\ngalaxies, with the effect being slightly greater at higher redshift within the\nerrors. Estimated from SED fits, the average age of tadpole galaxies is younger\nthan field galaxies in the lower redshift bin, and the average metallicity is\nlower (whereas the specific star formation rate for tadpoles is roughly the\nsame as field galaxies across the redshift range probed here). These average\neffects combined support the conclusion that this subset of galaxies is in an\nactive phase of assembly, either late-stage merging or cold gas accretion\ncausing localized clumpy star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 20:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object\nlabels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in\nlarge-scale structure analyses. It can be applied to narrowband emission-line\nsurveys as well as upcoming large spectroscopic surveys including Euclid and\nWFIRST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 20:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 05:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

We verify\nthese trends using the redshift distributions of close pairs and extend the\nanalysis to fainter objects, where photometric redshift errors further increase\nto $\\sim0.046(1+z)$ at $H_{F160W}=26$. We demonstrate that photometric redshift\naccuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiple\nfilter combinations. We evaluate the widths of redshift probability\ndistribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by a\nfactor of $\\sim1.1-1.6$, but that uniformly broadening the distribution does\nnot adequately account for fitting outliers. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications of these data in planning for current and future surveys and\nsimulate photometric redshift performance in the LSST, DES, and combined DES\nand VHS surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 20:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

We\nalso deal with the distribution of such algebras into isomorphism classes, for\nwhich we confirm some known results and we prove that there exist $p+8$\nisomorphism classes of seven-dimensional filiform Lie algebras over the finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$ if $p\\neq 2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 21:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-11"}

Here, we present new measurements of the optical colors of\ncometary and comet-related bodies including long-period (Oort cloud) comets,\nDamocloids (probable inactive nuclei of long-period comets) and Centaurs\n(recent escapees from the Kuiper belt and precursors to the Jupiter family\ncomets). We combine the new measurements with published data on short-period\ncomets, Jovian Trojans and Kuiper belt objects to examine the color systematics\nof the comet-related populations. We find that the mean optical colors of the\ndust in short-period and long-period comets are identical within the\nuncertainties of measurement, as are the colors of the dust and of the\nunderlying nuclei. These populations show no evidence for scattering by\noptically-small particles or for compositional gradients, even at the largest\ndistances from the Sun, and no evidence for ultrared matter. Consistent with\nearlier work, ultrared surfaces are common in the Kuiper belt and on the\nCentaurs, but not in other small body populations, suggesting that this\nmaterial is hidden or destroyed upon entry to the inner solar system. The onset\nof activity in the Centaurs and the disappearance of the ultrared matter in\nthis population begin at about the same perihelion distance ($\\sim$10 AU),\nsuggesting that the two are related. Blanketing of primordial surface materials\nby the fallback of sub-orbital ejecta, for which we calculate a very short\ntimescale, is the likely mechanism. The same process should operate on any\nmass-losing body, explaining the absence of ultrared surface material in the\nentire comet population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 21:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Among those forming\nlow-mass stars, their long axes tend to be either parallel or perpendicular to\nthe large-scale (10-100 pc) magnetic field (B-field) in the surrounding inter\ncloud medium. This arises because, along the dynamically dominant B-fields, the\ncompetition between self-gravity and turbulent pressure will shape the cloud to\nbe elongated either perpendicular or parallel to the fields. Recent study also\nsuggested that, on the scales of 0.1-0.01 pc, fields are dynamically important\nwithin cloud cores forming massive stars. But whether the core field\nmorphologies are inherited from the inter cloud medium or governed by cloud\nturbulence is under vigorous debate, so is the role played by B-fields in cloud\nfragmentation at 10 - 0.1 pc scales. Here we report B-field maps covering\n100-0.01 pc scales inferred from polarimetric observations of a massive-star\nforming region, NGC 6334. First, the main filament also lies perpendicular to\nthe ambient field. NGC 6334 hosts young star-forming sites where fields are not\nseverely affected by stellar feedback, and their directions do not change\nsignificantly over the entire scale range. This means that the fields are\ndynamically important. At various scales, we find that the hourglass-shaped\nfield lines are pinched where the gas column density peaks and the field\nstrength is proportional to the 0.4-power of the density. We conclude that\nB-fields play a crucial role in the fragmentation of NGC 6334.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 00:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

The key to the combination is the use of a hybrid Yee-FFT\nsolver in the quasi-3D geometry that can be used to effectively eliminate the\nNumerical Cerenkov Instability (NCI) that inevitably arises in a Lorentz\nboosted frame due to the unphysical coupling of Langmuir modes and EM modes of\nthe relativistically drifting plasma in these simulations.

In oblivious transfer protocols a user sends\none or more messages to a receiver, while the sender remains oblivious as to\nwhich messages have been received. Protocols for oblivious transfer cannot\nexist in a classical or fully-quantum world, but can be implemented by\nrestricting the users' power.\n  The isolated qubits model is a cryptographic model in which users are\nrestricted to single-qubit operations and are not allowed to use entangling\noperations. Furthermore, all parties are allowed to store qubits for a long\ntime before measuring them.\n  In this model, a secure single-bit one-out-of-two randomised oblivious\ntransfer protocol was recently presented by Liu. Motivated by this result, we\nconstruct a protocol for secure string one-out-of-two randomised oblivious\ntransfer by simplifying and generalising the existing proof.\n  We then study for the first time interactive protocols for more complex\ntwo-party functionalities in this model based on the security of our\nconstruction.

It is then\npossible to construct secure one-out-of-two and one-out-of-k oblivious transfer\nprotocols in the isolated qubits model.\n  Moreover, we study secure password-based identification, where a user\nidentifies himself to another user by evaluating the equality function on their\ninputs, or passwords. We use the oblivious transfer constructions mentioned\nabove as sub-protocols to construct a secure identification protocol.\n  Finally, we prove that constructing a secure identification protocol\nnon-interactively is impossible, even using oblivious transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 07:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-27"}

In\neach case, it is shown that the error estimates are achievable in the sense\nthat worst case inputs can be identified which hit the error bound. The paper\nthen focuses on the special case where the operators are rational, i.e., they\nhave rational generating series. It is shown in this situation that the\niterated sum approximation can be realized by a discrete-time state space model\nwhich is a rational function of the input and state affine. In addition, this\nmodel comes from a specific discretization of the bilinear realization of the\nrational Fliess operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 12:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The central idea\nis that after reduction the twisting motion is apparent in a body frame, while\nthe somersaulting (rotation about the fixed angular momentum vector in space)\nis recovered by a combination of dynamic and geometric phase. In the simplest\n\"kick-model\" the number of somersaults $m$ and the number of twists $n$ are\nobtained through a rational rotation number $W = m/n$ of a (rigid) Euler top.\nThis rotation number is obtained by a slight modification of Montgomery's\nformula [9] for how much the rigid body has rotated. Using the full model with\nshape changes that take a realistic time we then derive the master\ntwisting-somersault formula: An exact formula that relates the airborne time of\nthe diver, the time spent in various stages of the dive, the numbers $m$ and\n$n$, the energy in the stages, and the angular momentum by extending a\ngeometric phase formula due to Cabrera [3]. Numerical simulations for various\ndives agree perfectly with this formula where realistic parameters are taken\nfrom actual observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 00:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}
