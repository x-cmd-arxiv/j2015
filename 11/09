This transform is important and appealing, as it\nis easy to compute, and becomes handy in various inverse problems with Poisson\nnoise contamination. Solution to such problems can be done by first applying\nthe Anscombe transform, then applying a Gaussian-noise-oriented restoration\nalgorithm of choice, and finally applying an inverse Anscombe transform. The\nappeal in this approach is due to the abundance of high-performance restoration\nalgorithms designed for white additive Gaussian noise (we will refer to these\nhereafter as \"Gaussian-solvers\"). This process is known to work well for high\nSNR images, where the Anscombe transform provides a rather accurate\napproximation. When the noise level is high, the above path loses much of its\neffectiveness, and the common practice is to replace it with a direct treatment\nof the Poisson distribution. Naturally, with this we lose the ability to\nleverage on vastly available Gaussian-solvers.\n  In this work we suggest a novel method for coupling Gaussian denoising\nalgorithms to Poisson noisy inverse problems, which is based on a general\napproach termed \"Plug-and-Play\". Deploying the Plug-and-Play approach to such\nproblems leads to an iterative scheme that repeats several key steps: 1) A\nconvex programming task of simple form that can be easily treated; 2) A\npowerful Gaussian denoising algorithm of choice; and 3) A simple update step.\n  Such a modular method, just like the Anscombe transform, enables other\ndevelopers to plug their own Gaussian denoising algorithms to our scheme in an\neasy way. While the proposed method bares some similarity to the Anscombe\noperation, it is in fact based on a different mathematical basis, which holds\ntrue for all SNR ranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 16:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Proper position in\nthe single-cell embryo of Caenorhabditis elegans is achieved initially by the\nmigration and rotation of the pronuclear complex (PNC) and its two associated\ncentrosomal arrays of microtubules (MTs). We present here the first systematic\ntheoretical study of how these $O(1000)$ centrosomal microtubules (MTs)\ninteract through the immersing cytoplasm, the cell periphery and PNC, and with\neach other, to achieve proper position. This study is made possible through our\ndevelopment of a highly efficient and parallelized computational framework that\naccounts explicitly for long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) between the\nMTs, while also capturing their flexibility, dynamic instability, and\ninteractions with molecular motors and boundaries. First, we show through\ndirect simulation that previous estimates of the PNC drag coefficient, based on\neither ignoring or partially including HIs, lead to misprediction of the active\nforces and time-scales of migration. We then directly study the dynamics of PNC\nmigration under various force-transduction models, including the pushing or\npulling of MTs at the cortex, and the pulling of MTs by cytoplasmically-bound\nforce generators. While achieving proper position and orientation on\nphysiologically reasonable time-scales does not uniquely choose a model, we\nfind that each model produces a different signature in its induced cytoplasmic\nflow and MT conformations. We suggest then that cytoplasmic flows and MT\nconformations can be used to differentiate between mechanisms and to determine\ntheir contribution to the migration process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 17:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

In this paper, we argue that while emoticons are strong and\ncommon signals of sentiment expression on social media the relationship between\nemoticons and sentiment polarity are not always clear. Thus, any algorithm that\ndeals with sentiment polarity should take emoticons into account but extreme\ncau- tion should be exercised in which emoticons to depend on. First, to\ndemonstrate the prevalence of emoticons on social media, we analyzed the\nfrequency of emoticons in a large re- cent Twitter data set. Then we carried\nout four analyses to examine the relationship between emoticons and sentiment\npolarity as well as the contexts in which emoticons are used. The first\nanalysis surveyed a group of participants for their perceived sentiment\npolarity of the most frequent emoticons. The second analysis examined\nclustering of words and emoti- cons to better understand the meaning conveyed\nby the emoti- cons. The third analysis compared the sentiment polarity of\nmicroblog posts before and after emoticons were removed from the text. The last\nanalysis tested the hypothesis that removing emoticons from text hurts\nsentiment classification by training two machine learning models with and\nwithout emoticons in the text respectively. The results confirms the arguments\nthat: 1) a few emoticons are strong and reliable signals of sentiment polarity\nand one should take advantage of them in any senti- ment analysis; 2) a large\ngroup of the emoticons conveys com- plicated sentiment hence they should be\ntreated with extreme caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 02:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

At the\nmicro-level, we seek to capture the way in which an individual user decides\nwhether to perform an action. At the meso-level, we study how group behavior\ndevelops and evolves over time, based on individual actions.

To model heavy-tailed distributions from partially observed\nindividual actions and to predict the formation of group behaviors, we apply\nM3D to three different genres of networks: Tencent Weibo, Citation, and Flickr.\nWe also use information-burst prediction as a particular application to\nquantitatively evaluate the predictive power of the proposed framework.

Instead of MLP, we employ maxout MLP\nto learn a variety of piecewise linear activation functions and to mediate the\nproblem of vanishing gradients that can occur when using rectifier units.\nMoreover, batch normalization is applied to reduce the saturation of maxout\nunits by pre-conditioning the model and dropout is applied to prevent\noverfitting.

We resolve the paradox by\nshowing that an oblique plane wave propagating atop a current of constant\nvorticity according to the linearized Euler equation carries with it an\nundulating perturbation of the vorticity field, hence is not prohibited by the\nConstantin theorem since vorticity is not constant. The perturbation of the\nvorticity field is readily interpreted in a Lagrangian perspective as the wave\nmotion gently shifting and twisting the vortex lines as the wave passes. In the\nspecial case of upstream or downstream propagation, the wave advection of\nvortex lines does not affect the Eulerian vorticity field, in accordance with\nthe theorem.

In distributed computation, graph\npartitioning (GP) methods assign the vertices or edges of a graph to different\nmachines in a balanced way so that some distributed algorithms can be adapted\nfor. Most of traditional GP methods are offline, which means that the whole\ngraph has been observed before partitioning. However, the offline methods often\nincur high computation cost. Hence, streaming graph partitioning (SGP) methods,\nwhich can partition graphs in an online way, have recently attracted great\nattention in distributed computation. There exist two typical GP strategies:\nedge-cut and vertex-cut. Most SGP methods adopt edge-cut, but few vertex-cut\nmethods have been proposed for SGP. However, the vertex-cut strategy would be a\nbetter choice than the edge-cut strategy because the degree of a natural graph\nin general follows a highly skewed power-law distribution. Thus, we propose a\nnovel method, called S-PowerGraph, for SGP of natural graphs by vertex-cut. Our\nS-PowerGraph method is simple but effective. Experiments on several large\nnatural graphs and synthetic graphs show that our S-PowerGraph can outperform\nthe state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 07:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Scenario-based seismic hazard\nmaps are purely based on geophysical and seismotectonic features of a region\nand take into account the occurrence frequency of earthquakes only for their\nclassification into exceptional (catastrophic), rare (disastrous), sporadic\n(very strong), occasional (strong) and frequent.

In the present paper, good agreement with\nprevious results is demonstrated. We subsequently show both analytically and\nnumerically how transient waves from a suddenly appearing steady pressure\ndistribution vanis for large times, and steady ship waves remain. The transient\ncontribution to wave resistance was derived. The results show that a shear\ncurrent has significant impact on the transient wave motions, resulting in\nasymmetry between upstream and downstream waves. The case of the suddenly\nappearing steady pressure is an intermediate case between ring waves and ship\nwaves, starting out as the former and evolving gradually into the latter. The\nship's direction of motion relative to the current is found to be crucial in\ndetermining how quickly effects of transient waves die out. Transient effects\ntake much longer to doe out for a ship going against the shear flow than for\none going downstream, when the two ships have the same velocity relative to the\nwater surface. For ship motion against the shear current, thus, wave effects of\ntransients, e.g., due to maneuvering could accumulate and be far more\nsignificant than on a uniform current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 09:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

In this work, we develop a framework of Markov\nsemigroups on matrix-valued functions and generalize the above equivalence to\nthe exponential decay of matrix $\\Phi$-entropies. This result also specializes\nto spectral gap inequalities and modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in\nthe random matrix setting. To establish the main result, we define a\nnon-commutative generalization of the carr\\'e du champ operator, and prove a de\nBruijn's identity for matrix-valued functions.\n  The proposed Markov semigroups acting on matrix-valued functions have\nimmediate applications in the characterization of the dynamical evolution of\nquantum ensembles. We consider two special cases of quantum unital channels,\nnamely, the depolarizing channel and the phase-damping channel. In the former,\nsince there exists a unique equilibrium state, we show that the matrix\n$\\Phi$-entropy of the resulting quantum ensemble decays exponentially as time\ngoes on. Consequently, we obtain a stronger notion of monotonicity of the\nHolevo quantity - the Holevo quantity of the quantum ensemble decays\nexponentially in time and the convergence rate is determined by the modified\nlog-Sobolev inequalities. However, in the latter, the matrix $\\Phi$-entropy of\nthe quantum ensemble that undergoes the phase-damping Markovian evolution\ngenerally will not decay exponentially. This is because there are multiple\nequilibrium states for such a channel.\n  Finally, we also consider examples of statistical mixing of Markov semigroups\non matrix-valued functions. We can explicitly calculate the convergence rate of\na Markovian jump process defined on Boolean hypercubes, and provide upper\nbounds of the mixing time on these types of examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 10:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

The method to increase the\nspin polarized current percentage is beyond practical consideration at the\npresent status. To target this problem, we focus on the role of oxygen\nvacancies and nano grain size on the spin polarized current, which are\ncontrolled by growing the Co-doped ZnO thin-films at room temperature in a\nreducing atmosphere [Ar + (1% ~ 30%) H2].

While the fulfillment of Gaussian criterion is sufficient to\ndetect CV steering, whether it is also necessary for Gaussian states is a\nquestion of fundamental importance in many contexts. This critically questions\nthe validity of characterizations established only under Gaussian measurements\nlike the quantification of steering and the monogamy relations.

Entanglement entropy gives quantitative understanding to the\nentanglement. We use decomposition of the Hilbert space to discuss properties\nof the entanglement. Therefore, partial trace operator becomes important to\ndefine the reduced density matrix from different centers, which commutes with\nall elements in the Hilbert space, corresponding to different entanglement\nchoices or different observations on entangling surface. Entanglement entropy\nis expected to satisfy the strong subadditivity. We discuss decomposition of\nthe Hilbert space for the strong subadditivity and other related inequalities.\nThe entanglement entropy with centers can be computed from the Hamitonian\nformulations systematically, provided that we know wavefunctional.

The goal of this work is to\ninvestigate the strategy of using gravitational wave sky-localizations for\nbinary neutron star systems, to search for electromagnetic counterparts using\nwide field of view optical telescopes. We examine various strategies of\nscanning the gravitational wave sky-localizations on the mock 2015-16\ngravitational-wave events.

Next, we\ninvestigate the performance of the tiling strategy for telescope arrays and\ncompare their performance against monolithic giant field of view telescopes.

However, FCNs use large receptive fields\nand many pooling layers, both of which cause blurring and low spatial\nresolution in the deep layers. As a result FCNs tend to produce segmentations\nthat are poorly localized around object boundaries. Prior work has attempted to\naddress this issue in post-processing steps, for example using a color-based\nCRF on top of the FCN predictions. However, these approaches require additional\nparameters and low-level features that are difficult to tune and integrate into\nthe original network architecture. Additionally, most CRFs use color-based\npixel affinities, which are not well suited for semantic segmentation and lead\nto spatially disjoint predictions.\n  To overcome these problems, we introduce a Boundary Neural Field (BNF), which\nis a global energy model integrating FCN predictions with boundary cues. The\nboundary information is used to enhance semantic segment coherence and to\nimprove object localization. Specifically, we first show that the convolutional\nfilters of semantic FCNs provide good features for boundary detection. We then\nemploy the predicted boundaries to define pairwise potentials in our energy.\nFinally, we show that our energy decomposes semantic segmentation into multiple\nbinary problems, which can be relaxed for efficient global optimization.

Recent neuroscientific\nresearch demonstrates that humans have a fixed size prior for salient objects.\nThis suggests that a salient object in 3D undergoes a consistent transformation\nsuch that people's visual system perceives it with an approximately fixed size.\nThis finding indicates that there exists a consistent egocentric object prior\nthat can be characterized by shape, size, depth, and location in the first\nperson view.\n  In this paper, we develop an EgoObject Representation, which encodes these\ncharacteristics by incorporating shape, location, size and depth features from\nan egocentric RGBD image. We empirically show that this representation can\naccurately characterize the egocentric object prior by testing it on an\negocentric RGBD dataset for three tasks: the 3D saliency detection, future\nsaliency prediction, and interaction classification. This representation is\nevaluated on our new Egocentric RGBD Saliency dataset that includes various\nactivities such as cooking, dining, and shopping. By using our EgoObject\nrepresentation, we outperform previously proposed models for saliency detection\n(relative 30% improvement for 3D saliency detection task) on our dataset.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that this representation allows us to predict\nfuture salient objects based on the gaze cue and classify people's interactions\nwith objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 14:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

When training data are obtained from internet, the labels are\nlikely to be ambiguous and inaccurate. This paper presents a Light CNN\nframework to learn a compact embedding on the large-scale face data with\nmassive noisy labels. First, we introduce a variation of maxout activation,\ncalled Max-Feature-Map (MFM), into each convolutional layer of CNN. Different\nfrom maxout activation that uses many feature maps to linearly approximate an\narbitrary convex activation function, MFM does so via a competitive\nrelationship. MFM can not only separate noisy and informative signals but also\nplay the role of feature selection between two feature maps. Second, three\nnetworks are carefully designed to obtain better performance meanwhile reducing\nthe number of parameters and computational costs. Lastly, a semantic\nbootstrapping method is proposed to make the prediction of the networks more\nconsistent with noisy labels. Experimental results show that the proposed\nframework can utilize large-scale noisy data to learn a Light model that is\nefficient in computational costs and storage spaces. The learned single network\nwith a 256-D representation achieves state-of-the-art results on various face\nbenchmarks without fine-tuning.

In the case of\nexplicit chiral symmetry breaking, in two-flavor case, the 2nd order phase\ntransition turns to crossover with any nonzero current quark mass, and in\nthree-flavor case, the 1st order phase transition turns to crossover at a\nfinite current quark mass. The correct description of chiral symmetry breaking\nand restoration makes the holographic QCD models more powerful in dealing with\nnon-perturbative QCD phenomena. This framework can be regarded as a general set\nup in application of AdS/CFT to describe conventional Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson\ntype phase transitions, e.g. in condensed matter and cosmology systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 15:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

If hidden common causes\nbetween treatment $X$ and outcome $Y$ cannot be blocked by other measurements,\none possibility is to use an instrumental variable. In principle, it is\npossible under some assumptions to discover whether a variable is structurally\ninstrumental to a target causal effect $X \\rightarrow Y$, but current\nframeworks are somewhat lacking on how general these assumptions can be. A\ninstrumental variable discovery problem is challenging, as no variable can be\ntested as an instrument in isolation but only in groups, but different\nvariables might require different conditions to be considered an instrument.\nMoreover, identification constraints might be hard to detect statistically. In\nthis paper, we give a theoretical characterization of instrumental variable\ndiscovery, highlighting identifiability problems and solutions, the need for\nnon-Gaussianity assumptions, and how they fit within existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 15:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Inspired by the matrix pencil form, we construct a D-fold\nHankel matrix from the measurements and exploit its Vandermonde decomposition\nin the noiseless case. MUSIC amounts to identifying a noise subspace,\nevaluating a noise-space correlation function, and localizing frequencies by\nsearching the $s$ smallest local minima of the noise-space correlation\nfunction.\n  In the noiseless case, $(2s)^D$ measurements guarantee an exact\nreconstruction by MUSIC as the noise-space correlation function vanishes\nexactly at true frequencies. When noise exists, we provide an explicit estimate\non the perturbation of the noise-space correlation function in terms of noise\nlevel, dimension $D$, the minimum separation among frequencies, the maximum and\nminimum amplitudes while frequencies are separated by two Rayleigh Length (RL)\nat each direction. As a by-product the maximum and minimum non-zero singular\nvalues of the multidimensional Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are on the unit\nsphere are estimated under a gap condition of the nodes. Under the 2-RL\nseparation condition, if noise is i.i.d. gaussian, we show that perturbation of\nthe noise-space correlation function decays like\n$\\sqrt{\\log(\\#(\\mathbf{N}))/\\#(\\mathbf{N})}$ as the sample size\n$\\#(\\mathbf{N})$ increases.\n  When the separation among frequencies drops below 2 RL, our numerical\nexperiments show that the noise tolerance of MUSIC obeys a power law with the\nminimum separation of frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 15:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The traditional phenomenological laws, such as Fourier's law of\nheat conduction, are challenged in the microscale regime and a hyperbolic or\ndual phase lag model should be employed. During ultrafast laser interaction\nwith metal, the electrons and lattices are not in equilibrium. Various\ntwo-temperature models that can be used to describe the nonequilibrium heat\ntransfer are presented. A semi-classical two-step heating model to investigate\nthermal transport in metals caused by ultrashort laser heating is also\npresented. The main difference between the semiclassical and the\nphenomenological two-temperature models is that the former includes the effects\nof electron drifting, which could result in significantly different electron\nand lattice temperature response from the latter for higher-intensity and\nshorter-pulse laser heating. Under higher laser fluence and/or short pulse, the\nlattice temperature can exceed the melting point and melting takes place. The\nliquid phase will be resolidified when the lattice is cooled by conducting heat\naway. Ultrafast melting and resolidification of the thin gold film and\nmicroparticles were investigated. At even shorter pulse width, femtosecond\nlaser heating on metals produces a blasting force from hot electrons in the\nsub-picosecond domain, which exerts on the metal lattices along with the\nnon-equilibrium heat flow. Our work that employs the parabolic two-step heating\nmodel to study the effect of the hot-electron blast in multi-layered thin metal\nfilms is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 16:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}
