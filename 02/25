Dust size distribution is represented by four dust types:\nconventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), very small grains (VSGs),\nbig grains (BGs) and also intermediate-sized grains (ISGs), which are larger\nthan VSGs and smaller than BGs. The dust is assumed to move at terminal\nvelocity determined locally from the balance between the radiation pressure and\ngas drag. As Coulomb drag is an important contribution to the overall gas drag,\nwe evaluate a grain charge evolution within the HII region for each dust type.\nBGs are effectively swept out of the HII region. The spatial distribution of\nISGs within the HII region has a double peak structure, with a smaller inner\npeak and a higher outer peak. PAHs and VSGs are mostly coupled to the gas. The\nmean charge of PAHs is close to zero, so they can become neutral from time to\ntime because of charge fluctuations. These periods of neutrality occur often\nenough to cause the removal of PAHs from the very interior of the HII region.\nFor VSGs, the effect of charge fluctuations is less pronounced but still\nsignificant.

A person walks along a line,\nstarting from a sink node (e.g., a base-station), and proceeds towards a source\nnode (e.g., a sensor) which is at an a priori unknown location. At equally\nspaced locations, he makes link quality measurements to the previous relay, and\ndeploys relays at some of these locations, with the aim to connect the source\nto the sink by a multihop wireless path. In this paper, we consider two\napproaches for impromptu deployment: (i) the deployment agent can only move\nforward (which we call a pure as-you-go approach), and (ii) the deployment\nagent can make measurements over several consecutive steps before selecting a\nplacement location among them (which we call an explore-forward approach). We\nconsider a light traffic regime, and formulate the problem as a Markov decision\nprocess, where the trade-off is among the power used by the nodes, the outage\nprobabilities in the links, and the number of relays placed per unit distance.\nWe obtain the structures of the optimal policies for the pure as-you-go\napproach as well as for the explore-forward approach. We also consider natural\nheuristic algorithms, for comparison. Numerical examples show that the\nexplore-forward approach significantly outperforms the pure as-you-go approach.\nNext, we propose two learning algorithms for the explore-forward approach,\nbased on Stochastic Approximation, which asymptotically converge to the set of\noptimal policies, without using any knowledge of the radio propagation model.\nWe demonstrate numerically that the learning algorithms can converge (as\ndeployment progresses) to the set of optimal policies reasonably fast and,\nhence, can be practical, model-free algorithms for deployment over large\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 17:01:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 18:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-11"}

In the limit of small particle inertia, determining the\nconditions of trapping is a challenging task, as it requires a large number of\nnumerical simulations or experiments to test various particle sizes or\ndensities. Here, we investigate this phenomenon analytically and numerically in\nthe case of heavy particles (e.g. aerosols) at low Reynolds number, to derive a\ntrapping criterion that can be used both in analytical and numerical velocity\nfields. The resulting criterion allows to predict the characteristics of\ntrapped particles as soon as single-phase simulations of the flow are\nperformed. Our analysis is valid for two-dimensional particle-laden flows in\nthe vertical plane, in the limit where the particle inertia, the free-fall\nterminal velocity, and the flow unsteadiness can be treated as perturbations.\nThe weak unsteadiness of the flow generally induces a chaotic tangle near\nheteroclinic or homoclinic cycles if any, leading to the apparent diffusion of\nfluid elements through the boundary of the cell. The critical particle Stokes\nnumber Stc below which aerosols also enter and exit the cell in a complex\nmanner has been derived analytically, in terms of the flow characteristics. It\ninvolves the non-dimensional curvature-weighted integral of the squared\nvelocity of the steady fluid flow along the dividing streamline of the\nrecirculation cell. When the flow is unsteady and St > Stc, a regular motion\ntakes place due to gravity and centrifugal effects, like in the steady case.\nParticles driven towards the interior of the cell are trapped permanently. In\ncontrast, when the flow is unsteady and St < Stc, particles wander in a chaotic\nmanner in the vicinity of the border of the cell, and can escape the cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 17:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2015 19:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 10:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

These higher frequency observations forms the\nmost reliable basis for detailed microstructure studies. Close inspection of\nindividual pulses reveals that most pulses exhibit quasiperiodicities with a\nwell-defined periodicity timescale ($P_{\\mu}$). While we find some pulses with\ndeeply modulating microstructure, most pulses show low-amplitude modulations on\ntop of broad smooth subpulses features, thereby making it difficult to infer\nperiodicities.

Analytical studies of localization\nperformance (e.g., using the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound) usually require that\none fix the BS geometry, and favorable geometries have always been the\npreferred choice in the literature. However, not only are the resulting\nanalytical results constrained to the selected geometry, this practice is\nlikely to lead to overly-optimistic expectations of typical localization\nperformance. Ideally, localization performance should be studied across all\npossible geometric setups, thereby also removing any selection bias. This,\nhowever, is known to be hard and has been carried out only in simulation. In\nthis paper, we develop a new tractable approach where we endow the BS locations\nwith a distribution by modeling them as a Poisson point process (PPP), and use\ntools from stochastic geometry to obtain easy-to-use expressions for key\nperformance metrics. In particular, we focus on the probability of detecting\nsome minimum number of BSs, which is shown to be closely coupled with a network\noperator's ability to obtain satisfactory localization performance (e.g., meet\nFCC E911 requirements). This metric is indifferent to the localization\ntechnique (e.g., TOA, TDOA, AOA, or hybrids thereof), though different\ntechniques will presumably lead to different BS hearability requirements. In\norder to mitigate excessive interference due to the presence of dominant\ninterferers in the form of other BSs, we incorporate both BS coordination and\nfrequency reuse in the proposed framework and quantify the resulting\nperformance gains analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 18:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 13:09:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 22:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

We first\nconsider an estimator defined as the minimizer of the sum of a log-likelihood\nterm and a nuclear norm penalization and prove an upper bound on the Frobenius\nprediction risk. The rate obtained improves on previous works on matrix\ncompletion for exponential family. When the sampling distribution is known, we\npropose another estimator and prove an oracle inequality w.r.t. the\nKullback-Leibler prediction risk, which translates immediatly into an upper\nbound on the Frobenius prediction risk. Finally, we show that all the rates\nobtained are minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 19:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 09:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

Due to its ability to capture long\nterm memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it\ngoes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer\nof the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In\nthis paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user\nclick-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and\nanalysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model\nis found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and detects the\nsalient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords are\nfound to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words\nbelonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic\nrepresentation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many\ndifferent applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation\nabilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document\nretrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between\nthe query and documents can be measured by the distance between their\ncorresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web\nsearch task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform\nseveral existing state of the art methods.

In the first approach,\nthe wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended\n\"catalytic state\". Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can\norganize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the\nterms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation.\nGoing to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov\napproximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture\nand to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to\ntrack different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the\nmulti-component case. In the second approach, I consider a state of $N =l\\times\nn$ bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the $n$-fold tensor product of an\narbitrary $l$-boson state. Particularly, we are interested in the pure state\ncase for $l=2$, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS). I show that PCS\nreproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also\nworks in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation\nfails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error\n(measured by the trace distance of the two-particle reduced density matrices)\nof PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making\nPCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the\nerror of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system\nevolves for longer times. I derive both time-dependent and -independent\nequations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz. The\ntime complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on $N$ and is linear in the\nnumber of orbitals in use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 19:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

The main goal, carried out in Part I, is to survey\nsome recent work by the authors in which \"forced\" grading constructions have\nplayed a significant role in the representation theory of semisimple algebraic\ngroups $G$ in positive characteristic. The constructions begin with natural\nfinite dimensional quotients of the distribution algebras Dist$(G)$, but then\n\"force\" gradings into the picture by passing to positively graded algebras\nconstructed from ideal filtrations of these quotients. This process first\nguaranteed a place for itself by proving, for large primes, that all Weyl\nmodules have $p$-Weyl filtrations. Later it led, under similar circumstances,\nto a new \"good filtration\" result for restricted Lie algebra Ext groups between\nrestricted irreducible $G$-modules. In the process of proving these results, a\nnew kind of graded algebra was invented, called a Q-Koszul algebra. Recent\nconjectures suggest these algebras arise in forced grading constructions as\nabove, from quotients of Dist$(G)$, even for small primes and even in settings\npossibly involving singular weights. Related conjectures suggest a promising\nfuture for using Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to relate quantum and algebraic group\ncohomology and Ext groups in these same small prime and possibly singular\nweight settings. A part of one of these conjectures is proved in Part II of\nthis paper.

This detection of non-standard, potentially episodic high\nmass-loss in a RSG SN progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospects\nof future wide-field UV surveys to detect shock breakout directly in these\nsystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of SN\nprogenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This holds regardless of whether the correlation observables are at\nthe same time or not, and regardless of whether multiple-streaming is present.\nThe simplicity of this statement suggests that an analytic understanding of\nlarge scale structure in the nonlinear regime may be particularly promising in\nLagrangian space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 21:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Also, planets may leave\nchemical signatures on the photospheres of their host stars by sequestering\nheavy elements, or by being accreted by the stars.

Here we identify 21\nspheroidal stellar systems within 90 Mpc that have half-light, major-axis radii\nR_e < ~2 kpc, stellar masses 0.7x10^{11} < M_*/M_Sun < 1.4x10^{11}, and Sersic\nindices typically around a value of n=2 to 3. This abundance of compact,\nmassive spheroids in our own backyard - with a number density of 6.9x10^{-6} /\nMpc^3 (or 3.5x10^{-5} / Mpc^3 per unit dex in stellar mass) - and with the same\nphysical properties as the high-redshift galaxies, had been over-looked because\nthey are encased in stellar disks which usually result in `galaxy' sizes\nnotably larger than 2 kpc. Moreover, this number density is a lower limit\nbecause it has not come from a volume-limited sample. The actual density may be\ncloser to 10^{-4} / Mpc^3, although further work is required to confirm this.\nWe therefore conclude that not all massive `spheroids' have undergone dramatic\nstructural and size evolution since z ~ 2+/-0.6. Given that the bulges of local\nearly-type disk galaxies are known to consist of predominantly old stars which\nexisted at z ~ 2, it seems likely that some of the observed high redshift\nspheroids did not increase in size by building (3D) triaxial envelopes as\ncommonly advocated, and that the growth of (2D) disks has also been important\nover the past 9-11 billion years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 01:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 03:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Existing\nstreaming algorithms with worst-case guarantees for this problem assume $f(n)$\nto be monotone; there are very large lower bounds on the space requirements for\nsummarizing a distributed non-monotonic stream, often linear in the size $n$ of\nthe stream.\n  Input streams that give rise to large space requirements are highly variable,\nmaking relatively large jumps from one timestep to the next. However, streams\noften vary slowly in practice. What has heretofore been lacking is a framework\nfor non-monotonic streams that admits algorithms whose worst-case performance\nis as good as existing algorithms for monotone streams and degrades gracefully\nfor non-monotonic streams as those streams vary more quickly.\n  In this paper we propose such a framework. We introduce a new stream\nparameter, the \"variability\" $v$, deriving its definition in a way that shows\nit to be a natural parameter to consider for non-monotonic streams. It is also\na useful parameter. From a theoretical perspective, we can adapt existing\nalgorithms for monotone streams to work for non-monotonic streams, with only\nminor modifications, in such a way that they reduce to the monotone case when\nthe stream happens to be monotone, and in such a way that we can refine the\nworst-case communication bounds from $\\Theta(n)$ to $\\tilde{O}(v)$. From a\npractical perspective, we demonstrate that $v$ can be small in practice by\nproving that $v$ is $O(\\log f(n))$ for monotone streams and $o(n)$ for streams\nthat are \"nearly\" monotone or that are generated by random walks. We expect $v$\nto be $o(n)$ for many other interesting input classes as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 01:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

If that is the case, how good is\nquantum erasure? In this work we compute the largest coherence $\\langle\n\\mathcal C\\rangle$ that we can expect to recover in a qubit, as a function of\nthe dimension of the accessible and of the inaccessible subspaces of its\nenvironment.

We\nclassify 12 galaxies observed on two P-MaNGA plates as either centrally\nquiescent (CQ) or centrally star-forming (CSF), according to whether D4000\nmeasured in the central spaxel of each datacube exceeds 1.6. For each galaxy we\ngenerate both 2D maps and radial profiles of D4000, EW(Hd_A) and EW(Ha). We\nfind that CSF galaxies generally show very weak or no radial variation in these\ndiagnostics. In contrast, CQ galaxies present significant radial gradients, in\nthe sense that D4000 decreases, while both EW(Hd_A) and EW(Ha) increase from\nthe galactic center outward. The outer regions of the galaxies show greater\nscatter on diagrams relating the three parameters than their central parts. In\nparticular, the clear separation between centrally-measured quiescent and\nstar-forming galaxies in these diagnostic planes is largely filled in by the\nouter parts of galaxies whose global colors place them in the green valley,\nsupporting the idea that the green valley represents a transition between\nblue-cloud and red-sequence phases, at least in our small sample. These results\nare consistent with a picture in which the cessation of star formation\npropagates from the center of a galaxy outwards as it moves to the red\nsequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 03:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Electron density for both components (n_Major and n_EBW,\nrespectively) was calculated by referring to the theoretical intensity ratio as\na function of electron density as per the CHIANTI database.

If the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry relating the light\nhadrons were exact, one would have an exchange symmetry between these hadrons\narising out of the exchange of the up, down and strange quarks. This aspect of\n$SU(3)$ symmetry is used extensively to relate many decay modes of heavy\nquarks. However, the nature of the effects of $SU(3)$ breaking in such decays\nis not well understood and hence, a reliable estimate of $SU(3)$ breaking\neffects is missing. In this work we propose a new method to quantitatively\nestimate the extent of flavor symmetry breaking and better understand the\nnature of such breaking using Dalitz plot. We study the three non-commuting\n$SU(2)$ symmetries (subsumed in $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry): isospin (or\n$T$-spin), $U$-spin and $V$-spin, using the Dalitz plots of some three-body\nmeson decays. We look at the Dalitz plot distributions of decays in which pairs\nof the final three particles are related by two distinct $SU(2)$ symmetries. We\nshow that such decay modes have characteristic distributions that enable the\nmeasurement of violation of each of the three $SU(2)$ symmetries via Dalitz\nplot asymmetries in a single decay mode. Experimental estimates of these easily\nmeasurable asymmetries would help in better understanding the weak decays of\nheavy mesons into both two and three light mesons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 09:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

The possibility of life is intensely studied on Solar System\nmoons such as Europa or Enceladus, where the surface ice layer covers tidally\nheated water ocean. Tidal forces may be even stronger in extrasolar systems,\ndepending on the properties of the moon and its orbit. For studying the tidally\nheated surface temperature of exomoons, we used a viscoelastic model for the\nfirst time. This model is more realistic than the widely used, so-called fixed\nQ models, because it takes into account the temperature dependency of the tidal\nheat flux, and the melting of the inner material. With the use of this model we\nintroduced the circumplanetary Tidal Temperate Zone (TTZ), that strongly\ndepends on the orbital period of the moon, and less on its radius. We compared\nthe results with the fixed Q model and investigated the statistical volume of\nthe TTZ using both models. We have found that the viscoelastic model predicts\n2.8 times more exomoons in the TTZ with orbital periods between 0.1 and 3.5\ndays than the fixed Q model for plausible distributions of physical and orbital\nparameters. The viscoelastic model gives more promising results in terms of\nhabitability, because the inner melting of the body moderates the surface\ntemperature, acting like a thermostat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 09:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

We determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity, and\nabundances of a sample of 251 stars including stars with known debris discs,\nwith debris discs and planets, and only with planets. Stars with debris discs\nand planets have the same [Fe/H] behaviour as stars hosting planets, and they\nalso show a similar <[X/Fe]>-Tc trend. Different behaviour in the <[X/Fe]>-Tc\ntrend is found between the samples of stars without planets and the samples of\nplanet hosts. In particular, when considering only refractory elements,\nnegative slopes are shown in cool giant planet hosts, whilst positive ones are\nshown in stars hosting low-mass planets. Stars hosting exclusively close-in\ngiant planets show higher metallicities and positive <[X/Fe]>-Tc slope. A\nsearch for correlations between the <[X/Fe]>-Tc slopes and the stellar\nproperties reveals a moderate but significant correlation with the stellar\nradius and as well as a weak correlation with the stellar age. The fact that\nstars with debris discs and stars with low-mass planets do not show neither\nmetal enhancement nor a different <[X/Fe]>-Tc trend might indicate a\ncorrelation between the presence of debris discs and the presence of low-mass\nplanets.

Here we present a general approach allowing\nto treat situations, when there are no small parameters. The approach is based\non optimized perturbation theory and self-similar approximation theory. It\nallows, starting with divergent perturbation series in powers of an\nasymptotically small parameter, to construct expressions extrapolating\nasymptotic series to arbitrary values of the parameter, including its infinite\nlimit. Examples of such approximants are: right root approximants, left root\napproximants, continued root approximants, exponential approximants, and factor\napproximants.

The found critical indices\nare in very good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations as well as with\ncomplicated methods of Pade-Borel summation, while our approach is much\nsimpler.

The analytical expressions of the\natomic displacements and lattice distortions are calculated directly from the\norientation relationships without any adjustment of free parameter; the unique\nassumption is that the atoms are hard-spheres that cannot interpenetrate\nthemselves. The habit planes are predicted on the simple criterion that they\nare unrotated by the distortion, and the results are compared to experimental\nobservations published in literature. It is shown that shuffle is required for\ntransformations implying the hcp phase because the hcp primitive Bravais\nlattice contains two atoms, instead of one for the fcc and bcc phases. A simple\nencoding of the lattice distortions and shuffles permits to attribute a\ngroupoid structure to the transformations in the fcc-hcp-bcc system. The\nanalytical expressions of the intermediate states are given and could be used\nto calculate activation energies. The martensitic distortion occurs in\none-step, without shearing, and its accommodation generates orientation\ngradients in the parent phase, independently of its glide modes. The concept of\nreversibility is detailed on the basis of crystallographic and morphological\narguments. The possibility to apply this approach to diffusion-limited\nmartensitic transformations is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 12:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

Using a new shooting move tailored to polymers combined with\na committor analysis, we study the transition state ensemble of an N=128 chain\nand search for possible reaction coordinates based on likelihood maximization.\nWe find that typical transition states consist of a crystalline nucleus with\none or more chain fragments attached to it. Furthermore, we show that the\nnumber of particles in the crystalline core is not well suited as a reaction\ncoordinate. We then present an improved reaction coordinate, which includes\ninformation from the potential energy and the overall crystallinity of the\npolymer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 14:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

This signal can be interpreted as resulting\nfrom WIMP annihilation, with the spectrum well-fit by dark matter annihilating\ndominantly into either bottom-quark or Higgs pairs. Supersymmetric models\nprovide a well-motivated framework to study the implications of this signal in\nthese channels. With a neutralino dark matter candidate, the gamma-ray excess\ncannot be easily accommodated in the minimal supersymmetric model, which in any\ncase requires tuning below the percent level to explain the observed Higgs\nmass. Instead we are naturally led to consider the next-to-minimal model with a\nsinglet superfield. This not only allows for the annihilation channel into\nbottom-quark pairs to be implemented, but also provides new possibilities for\nannihilation into Higgs-pseudoscalar pairs. We show that the fit to the\ngamma-ray excess for the Higgs-pseudoscalar channel can be just as good as for\nannihilation into bottom-quark pairs. Moreover, in the parameter range of\ninterest, the next-to-minimal supersymmetric model solves the mu-problem and\ncan explain the 125 GeV Higgs mass with improved naturalness. We also consider\nan extension by adding a right-handed neutrino superfield with the right-handed\nsneutrino acting as a dark matter candidate. Interestingly, this allows for the\nannihilation into pseudoscalar pairs which also provide a good fit to the\ngamma-ray excess. Furthermore, in the case of a neutralino LSP, the late decay\nof a sneutrino NLSP can non-thermally produce the observed relic abundance.\nFinally, the WIMP annihilation into scalar pairs allows for the possibility of\ndetecting the Higgs or pseudoscalar decay into two photons, providing a\nsmoking-gun signal of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 14:18:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2015 18:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

It is well known that in the\npresence of data contamination, the ordinary sample mean looses many of its\ngood properties, making it preferable to use more robust estimators. From a\ndidactical point of view, it is insightful to see to what extent an intuitive\nestimator such as the sample mean becomes less favorable in a contaminated\nsetting. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions the sample mean,\nbased on a finite number of independent observations of $F$ which are\ncontaminated according to the inflated variance model, is a valid estimator for\nthe mean of $F$.

Although extensive efforts have been devoted in\nrecent years, most existing works combined multiple video features using simple\nfusion strategies and neglected the utilization of inter-class semantic\nrelationships. This paper proposes a novel unified framework that jointly\nexploits the feature relationships and the class relationships for improved\ncategorization performance. Specifically, these two types of relationships are\nestimated and utilized by rigorously imposing regularizations in the learning\nprocess of a deep neural network (DNN). Such a regularized DNN (rDNN) can be\nefficiently realized using a GPU-based implementation with an affordable\ntraining cost. Through arming the DNN with better capability of harnessing both\nthe feature and the class relationships, the proposed rDNN is more suitable for\nmodeling video semantics. With extensive experimental evaluations, we show that\nrDNN produces superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches. On\nthe well-known Hollywood2 and Columbia Consumer Video benchmarks, we obtain\nvery competitive results: 66.9\\% and 73.5\\% respectively in terms of mean\naverage precision.

We investigate the\nsignatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the\ndelay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object\nlocations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate\ninterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including\nthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.\nThese wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes\nimpact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most\ndesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a\ndipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array\nobservations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the\nlargest impact on the HI signal arise from power received far away from the\nprimary field of view. We identify diffuse emission near the horizon as a\nsignificant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usually\nrepresent structures on small scales. For signals entering through the primary\nfield of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. These\ntwo mechanisms imprint a characteristic \"pitchfork\" signature on the\n\"foreground wedge\" in Fourier delay space.

Based on the apps that the users have installed\nwe applied k-means clustering to profile the users into one of ten classes. Due\nto the large number of apps considered we implemented dimension reduction to\nreduced the app feature space by mapping the apps to their iTunes category and\nclustered users based on the percentage of their apps that correspond to each\niTunes app category. The clustering was externally validated by investigating\ndifferences between the way the ten profiles interact with the various adverts\ngenres (lifestyle, finance and entertainment adverts). In addition association\nrule mining was performed to find whether the time of the day that the advert\nis served and the number of apps a user has installed makes certain profiles\nmore likely to interact with the advert genres. The results showed there were\nclear differences in the way the profiles interact with the different advert\ngenres and the results of this paper suggest that mobile advert targeting would\nimprove the frequency that users interact with an advert.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 17:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We included original records from\nthe Draupner platform in the North Sea as well as time series from two optical\nsystems in our analysis. One of the latter was measured in the infrared tail of\noptical fiber supercontinua, the other in the fluence profiles of\nmultifilaments. All three data sets exhibit extreme-value statistics and exceed\nthe significant wave height in the respective system by a factor larger than\ntwo. Nonlinear time series analysis indicates a different degree of determinism\nin the systems. The optical fiber scenario is found to be driven by quantum\nnoise whereas rogue waves emerge as a consequence of turbulence in the others.\nWith the large number of rogue events observed in the multifilament system, we\ncan systematically explore the predictability of such events in a turbulent\nsystem. We observe that rogue events do not necessarily appear without a\nwarning, but are often preceded by a short phase of relative order. This\nsurprising finding sheds some new light on the fascinating phenomenon of rogue\nwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 12:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

Furthermore, cores\nwith short cooling times tend to have multiphase structure, suggesting that the\nintracluster medium (ICM) becomes locally thermally unstable for cooling times\n< 1 Gyr. In this work, we use 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the\nonset of condensation in idealized galaxy-cluster cores. In particular, we look\nat how the condensation process depends on the ratio of cooling time to\nfreefall time and on the geometry of the gravitational potential. We conclude\nthat the ICM can always evolve to a state in which condensation occurs if given\nenough time, but that an initial timescale ratio tcool /tff < 10 is needed for\nthermal instability to grow quickly enough to affect realistic cluster cores\nwithin a timescale that is relevant for cosmological structure formation. We\nfind that instability leads to convection and that perturbations continue to\ngrow while the gas convects. Condensation occurs when the timescale ratio in\nthe low-entropy tail of the perturbation distribution drops below tcool /tff <\n3, even if the volume-averaged timescale ratio is substantially greater. In our\nsimulations, the geometry of the gravitational potential does not have a strong\neffect on thermal stability. Finally, we find that if condensation is powering\nfeedback, a conversion efficiency of around 10^-3 for converting the condensed\nmass into thermal energy is sufficient to maintain thermal balance in the ICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}
