We determine alpha from branching\nfraction and CP asymmetry measurements of B decays to all light\npseudoscalar-pseudoscalar, pesudoscalar-vector, vector-vector and\na1-psudoscalar mesons and determine gamma from D(*)K(*), D(*) pi and D rho\nmodes, thereby including correlations between the angles of the unitarity\ntriangle. We parametrize the individual decay amplitudes in terms of\ncolor-allowed tree, color-suppressed tree, gluonic penguin, singlet penguin,\nelectroweak penguin, as well as W-exchange and W-annihilation amplitudes.

This measure, which we call Tolerant Edit Distance (TED),\nis motivated by two observations: (1) Some errors, like small boundary shifts,\nare tolerable in practice. Which errors are tolerable is application dependent\nand should be a parameter of the measure. (2) Non-tolerable errors have to be\ncorrected manually. The time needed to do so should be reflected by the error\nmeasure. Using integer linear programming, the TED finds the minimal weighted\nsum of split and merge errors exceeding a given tolerance criterion, and thus\nprovides a time-to-fix estimate. In contrast to commonly used measures like\nRand index or variation of information, the TED (1) does not count small, but\ntolerable, differences, (2) provides intuitive numbers, (3) gives a time-to-fix\nestimate, and (4) can localize and classify the type of errors.

With vast amounts of spectrum available in the millimeter wave\n(mmWave) band, small cells at mmWave frequencies are able to provide\nmulti-gigabit access data rates, while the wireless backhaul in the mmWave band\nis emerging as a cost-effective solution to provide high backhaul capacity to\nconnect access points (APs) of the small cells. In order to operate the mobile\nnetwork optimally, it is necessary to jointly design the radio access and\nbackhaul networks. Meanwhile, direct transmissions between devices should also\nbe considered to improve system performance and enhance the user experience. In\nthis paper, we propose a joint transmission scheduling scheme for the radio\naccess and backhaul of small cells in the mmWave band, termed D2DMAC, where a\npath selection criterion is designed to enable device-to-device transmissions\nfor performance improvement. In D2DMAC, a concurrent transmission scheduling\nalgorithm is proposed to fully exploit spatial reuse in mmWave networks.\nThrough extensive simulations under various traffic patterns and user\ndeployments, we demonstrate D2DMAC achieves near-optimal performance in some\ncases, and outperforms other protocols significantly in terms of delay and\nthroughput. Furthermore, we also analyze the impact of path selection on the\nperformance improvement of D2DMAC under different selected parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2015 16:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The mask template coefficients and the\nactive shape parameters together can generate the human parsing results, and\nare thus called the structure outputs for human parsing. The deep Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) is utilized to build the end-to-end relation between the\ninput human image and the structure outputs for human parsing. More\nspecifically, the structure outputs are predicted by two separate networks. The\nfirst CNN network is with max-pooling, and designed to predict the template\ncoefficients for each label mask, while the second CNN network is without\nmax-pooling to preserve sensitivity to label mask position and accurately\npredict the active shape parameters. For a new image, the structure outputs of\nthe two networks are fused to generate the probability of each label for each\npixel, and super-pixel smoothing is finally used to refine the human parsing\nresult. Comprehensive evaluations on a large dataset well demonstrate the\nsignificant superiority of the ATR framework over other state-of-the-arts for\nhuman parsing.

In this work we derive new precise and homogeneous parameters for 37\nstars with planets.

To ensure that the catalogue is\nhomogeneous, we use our standard spectroscopic analysis procedure, ARES+MOOG,\nto derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, and metallicities.

The quantum phase transition between Mott insulator with AFM\nand superconductor can be induced by doping charge carriers in high-Tc cuprate\nsuperconductors. For the best characterized organic superconductors of\nk-(BEDT-TTF)2X (X=anion), a first order transition between AFM insulator and\nsuperconductor can be tuned by applied external pressure or chemical pressure.\nAlso, the superconducting state can be directly developed from AFM insulator by\napplication of pressure in Cs3C60. The resemblance of these phase diagrams\nhints a universal mechanism governing the unconventional superconductivity in\nclose proximity to AFM insulators. However, the superconductivity in iron-based\nhigh-Tc superconductors evolves from an AFM bad metal by doping charge\ncarriers, and no superconductor-insulator transition has been observed so far.\nHere, we report a first-order transition from superconductor to insulator with\na strong charge doping induced by ionic gating in the thin flakes of single\ncrystal (Li,Fe)OHFeSe. The Tc is continuously enhanced with electron doping by\nionic gating up to a maximum Tc of 43 K, and a striking\nsuperconductor-insulator transition occurs just at the verge of optimal doping\nwith highest Tc. A novel phase diagram of temperature-gating voltage with the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition is mapped out, indicating that the\nsuperconductor -insulator transition is a common feature for unconventional\nsuperconductivity. These results help to uncover the underlying physics of\niron-based superconductivity as well as the universal mechanism of high-Tc\nsuperconductivity. Our finding also suggests that the gate-controlled strong\ncharge doping makes it possible to explore novel states of matter in a way\nbeyond traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 12:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

However, the\napplications of FIFs in the domain of `shape preserving interpolation' are not\nfully addressed so far. Among various techniques available in the classical\nnumerical analysis, rational interpolation schemes are well suited for the\nshape preservation problems and shape modification analysis. In this paper, the\ncapability of FIFs to generalize smooth classical interpolants, and the\neffectiveness of rational function models in shape preservation are\nintertwingly exploited to provide a new solution to the shape preserving\ninterpolation problem in fractal perspective. As a common platform for these\ntwo techniques to work together, we introduce rational cubic spline FIFs\ninvolving tension parameters for the first time in literature. Suitable\nconditions on parameters of the associated IFS are developed so that the\nrational fractal interpolant inherits fundamental shape properties such as\nmonotonicity, convexity, and positivity present in the given data. With some\nsuitable hypotheses on the original function, the convergence analysis of the\n$\\mathcal{C}^1$-rational cubic spline FIF is carried out.

Differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) of the solar corona\nbased on AIA data is presented here for the first time. The main product of\nDEMT is the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the local differential\nemission measure (LDEM). While in previous studies, based on EIT or EUVI data,\nthere were 3 available EUV bands, with a sensitivity range $\\sim 0.60 - 2.70$\nMK, the present study is based on the 4 cooler AIA bands (aimed at studying the\nquiet sun), sensitive to the range $\\sim 0.55 - 3.75$ MK. The AIA filters allow\nexploration of new parametric LDEM models. Since DEMT is better suited for\nlower activity periods, we use data from Carrington Rotation 2099, when the Sun\nwas in its most quiescent state during the AIA mission. Also, we validate the\nparametric LDEM inversion technique by applying it to standard bi-dimensional\n(2D) differential emission measure (DEM) analysis on sets of simultaneous AIA\nimages, and comparing the results with DEM curves obtained using other methods.\nOur study reveals a ubiquitous bimodal LDEM distribution in the quiet diffuse\ncorona, which is stronger for denser regions. We argue that the nanoflare\nheating scenario is less likely to explain these results, and that alternative\nmechanisms, such as wave dissipation appear better supported by our results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 13:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

This is ubiquitous in all areas of\ncomputational physics and quantum chemistry. An example in Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) is given by the external potential or the pseudo-potential\ndescribing the interaction between ions and electrons. The accuracy of the\ncollocation method used is therefore very important for the reliability of\nsubsequent treatments like self-consistent field solutions of the electronic\nstructure problems. By construction, the collocation method introduces\nnumerical artifacts typical of real-space treatments, like the so-called\negg-box error, that may spoil the numerical stability of the description when\nthe real-space grid is too coarse. As the external potential is an input of the\nproblem, even a highly precise computational treatment cannot cope this\ninconvenience. We present in this paper a new quadrature scheme that is able to\nexactly preserve the moments of a given analytic function even for large grid\nspacings, while reconciling with the traditional collocation method when the\ngrid spacing is small enough. In the context of real-space electronic structure\ncalculations, we show that this method improves considerably the stability of\nthe results for large grid spacings, opening the path towards reliable\nlow-accuracy DFT calculations with reduced number of degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 13:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 13:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

A localized refractivity slope variation near\n1.2 bars was interpreted to be the result of a condensed CH4 cloud layer.\nHowever, models fit to near-IR spectra found particle concentrations in the\n1.5-3 bar range (Sromovsky et al. 2006, Icarus 182, 577-593, Sromovsky and Fry\n2008, Icarus 193, 211-229, Irwin et al. 2010, Icarus 208, 913-926), and a\nrecent analysis of STIS spectra argued that aerosol particles formed diffusely\ndistributed hazes, with no compact condensation layer (Karkoschka and Tomasko\n2009, Icarus 202, 287-309).

Yet there is currently great\ndebate (and few measurements) about the behaviour of the 1.4-GHz counts in the\nmicroJy regime. One way to push the counts to these levels is via 'stacking',\nthe covariance of a map with a catalogue at higher resolution and (often) a\ndifferent wavelength. For the first time, we cast stacking in a fully bayesian\nframework, applying it to (i) the SKADS simulation and (ii) VLA data stacked at\nthe positions of sources from the VIDEO survey. In the former case, the\nalgorithm recovers the counts correctly when applied to the catalogue, but is\nbiased high when confusion comes into play. This needs to be accounted for in\nthe analysis of data from any relatively-low-resolution SKA pathfinders. For\nthe latter case, the observed radio source counts remain flat below the 5-sigma\nlevel of 85 microJy as far as 40 microJy, then fall off earlier than the flux\nhinted at by the SKADS simulations and a recent P(D) analysis (which is the\nonly other measurement from the literature at these flux-density levels, itself\nextrapolated in frequency). Division into galaxy type via spectral-energy\ndistribution reveals that normal spiral galaxies dominate the counts at these\nfluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 14:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

In this material, the approximate energy scale of a variety\nof interactions, involving spin-orbit coupling, magnetic exchange interaction,\nand the Mott gap, allows close coupling among the corresponding physical\nexcitations, opening the possibility of cross control of the physical\nproperties.

QIB models the\ndynamics of information states of bio-systems.
