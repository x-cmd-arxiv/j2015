From those data we extract a\nwell defined sample ($M(AB)=24.8$ in the narrow band) of objects with large\nemission line equivalent widths in the narrow band. Via SED fits to published\nbroad band data we identify which of the three lines we have detected and\nassign redshifts accordingly. This results in a well defined, strong emission\nline selected sample of galaxies down to lower masses than can easily be\nobtained with only continuum flux limited selection techniques. We compare the\n(SED fitting-derived) main sequence of star-formation (MS) of our sample to\nprevious works and find that it has a steeper slope than that of samples of\nmore massive galaxies. We conclude that the MS steepens at lower (below\n$M_{\\star} = 10^{9.4} M_{\\odot}$) galaxy masses. We also show that the SFR at\nany redshift is higher in our sample. We attribute this to the targeted\nselection of galaxies with large emission line equivalent widths, and conclude\nthat our sample presumably forms the upper boundary of the MS. We briefly\ninvestigate and outline how samples with accurate redshifts down to those low\nstellar masses open a new window to study the formation of large scale\nstructure in the early universe. In particular we report on the detection of a\nyoung galaxy cluster at $z=1.85$ which features a central massive galaxy which\nis the candidate of an early stage cD galaxy, and we identify a likely filament\nmapped out by $[$OIII$]$ and $H\\beta$ emitting galaxies at $z=1.15$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 19:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

Surprisingly, despite\nits widespread use over several decades, no bounds were known on its rate of\nconvergence. In this paper we prove that, for any irreducible $n\\times n$ (real\nor complex) input matrix~$A$, a natural variant of the algorithm converges in\n$O(n^3\\log(n\\rho/\\varepsilon))$ elementary balancing operations, where $\\rho$\nmeasures the initial imbalance of~$A$ and $\\varepsilon$ is the target imbalance\nof the output matrix.

The MRI also drifts\nlow-$Y_p$ matter from the deep inside of the core to the heating region, which\nmakes the net neutrino heating rate larger by the reduction of the cooling due\nto the electron capture. These two effects enhance the efficiency of the\nneutrino heating, which is found to be the key to boost the explosion.

For a diffraction grating under incidence by a\nplane wave at a fixed frequency, by rotating the incidence angle at a given\nangular velocity, the field propagated by a nonzero diffraction order will\nrotate at increasingly fast angular velocity as the incidence angle approaches\nthe angle where Wood anomaly occurs. Such a fast rotating diffracted field has\nthe potential to generate a substantial Doppler shift. Indeed, under the\nassumption of a grating with infinite extent, the expression for the\ninstantaneous frequency shift perceived by an observer, who is looking into the\nlight radiated by the diffraction order, is derived and it is in full agreement\nwith the prediction from an interpretation based on the Doppler shift generated\nby a rotation of light sources.

Of particular interest is\nthe few terahertz (THz) frequency regime where efficient light sources and\nhighly sensitive detectors are very challenging to make. Here we present THz\nsources and detectors made with graphene field effect transistors (GFETs)\nenhanced by a double-patch antenna and an on-chip silicon lens. We report the\nfirst experimental observation of 1-3 THz radiation from graphene, as well as\nfour orders of magnitude performance improvements in a GFET thermoelectric\ndetector operating at ~2 THz. The quantitative analysis of the emitting power\nand its unusual charge density dependence indicate significant non-thermal\ncontribution from the GFET. The polarization resolved detection measurements\nwith different illumination geometries allow for detailed and quantitative\nanalysis of various factors that contribute to the overall detector\nperformance.

For a study on\nthe fast sparsely synchronized rhythms, we fix $J$ (synaptic inhibition\nstrength) at a sufficiently large value, and investigate the population states\nby increasing $D$ (noise intensity). For small $D$, full synchronization with\nthe same population-rhythm frequency $f_p$ and mean firing rate (MFR) $f_i$ of\nindividual neurons occurs, while for sufficiently large $D$ partial\nsynchronization with $f_p > {\\langle f_i \\rangle}$ ($\\langle f_i \\rangle$:\nensemble-averaged MFR) appears due to intermittent discharge of individual\nneurons; particularly, the case of $f_p > 4 {\\langle f_i \\rangle}$ is referred\nto as sparse synchronization. Only for the partial and sparse synchronization,\nMFRs and contributions of individual neuronal dynamics to population\nsynchronization change depending on their degrees, unlike the case of full\nsynchronization. Consequently, dynamics of individual neurons reveal the\ninhomogeneous network structure for the case of partial and sparse\nsynchronization, which is in contrast to the case of statistically homogeneous\nrandom graphs and small-world networks. Finally, we investigate the effect of\nnetwork architecture on sparse synchronization in the following three cases:\n(1) variation in the degree of symmetric attachment (2) asymmetric preferential\nattachment of new nodes with different in- and out-degrees (3) preferential\nattachment between pre-existing nodes (without addition of new nodes). In these\nthree cases, both relation between network topology and sparse synchronization\nand contributions of individual dynamics to the sparse synchronization are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 04:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

The Halpha, Hbeta, and\nHgamma line profiles are found to exhibit remarkable short-term variability for\n~1 month after the apastron (phase 0.6--0.7), whereas they show little\nvariation near the periastron. These emission lines show \"S-shaped\" variations\nwith timescale of ~150 days, which is about twice that reported previously. In\ncontrast to the Balmer lines, no profile variability is seen in any FeII\nemission line.

In this paper, we design scheduling\npolicies aiming at satisfying the inter-delivery requirements of such clients.\nWe formulate the problem as a risk-sensitive Markov Decision Process (MDP).\nAlthough the resulting problem involves an infinite state space, we first prove\nthat there is an equivalent MDP involving only a finite number of states. Then\nwe prove the existence of a stationary optimal policy and establish an\nalgorithm to compute it in a finite number of steps.\n  However, the bane of this and many similar problems is the resulting\ncomplexity, and, in an attempt to make fundamental progress, we further propose\na new high reliability asymptotic approach. In essence, this approach considers\nthe scenario when the channel failure probabilities for different clients are\nof the same order, and asymptotically approach zero. We thus proceed to\ndetermine the asymptotically optimal policy: in a two-client scenario, we show\nthat the asymptotically optimal policy is a \"modified least time-to-go\" policy,\nwhich is intuitively appealing and easily implementable; in the general\nmulti-client scenario, we are led to an SN policy, and we develop an algorithm\nof low computational complexity to obtain it. Simulation results show that the\nresulting policies perform well even in the pre-asymptotic regime with moderate\nfailure probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 07:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

In general, computation of\n$P$-values beyond first order requires more model specification than is\nrequired for the likelihood function. It is problematic to specify a censoring\nmechanism to be taken very seriously in detail, and it appears that\nconditioning on censoring is not a viable alternative to that. We circumvent\nthis matter by employing a reference censoring model, matching the extent and\ntiming of observed censoring. Our primary proposal is a parametric bootstrap\nmethod utilizing this reference censoring model to simulate inferential\nrepetitions of the experiment. It is shown that the most important part of\nimprovement on first-order methods - that pertaining to fitting nuisance\nparameters - is insensitive to the assumed censoring model. This is supported\nby numerical comparisons of our proposal to parametric bootstrap methods based\non usual random censoring models, which are far more unattractive to implement.\nAs an alternative to our primary proposal, we provide a second-order method\nrequiring less computing effort while providing more insight into the nature of\nimprovement on first-order methods. However, the parametric bootstrap method is\nmore transparent, and hence is our primary proposal. Indications are that\nfirst-order partial likelihood methods are usually adequate in practice, so we\nare not advocating routine use of the proposed methods.

An experimental violation of Bell's inequality demands\nsimultaneously high fidelities in the preparation, manipulation and measurement\nof multipartite quantum entangled states. For this reason the Bell signal has\nbeen tagged as a single-number benchmark for the performance of quantum\ncomputing devices. Here we demonstrate deterministic, on-demand generation of\ntwo-qubit entangled states of the electron and the nuclear spin of a single\nphosphorus atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. By sequentially\nreading the electron and the nucleus, we show that these entangled states\nviolate the Bell/CHSH inequality with a Bell signal of 2.50(10). An even higher\nvalue of 2.70(9) is obtained by mapping the parity of the two-qubit state onto\nthe nuclear spin, which allows for high-fidelity quantum non-demolition\nmeasurement (QND) of the parity. Furthermore, we complement the Bell inequality\nentanglement witness with full two-qubit state tomography exploiting QND\nmeasurement, which reveals that our prepared states match the target maximally\nentangled Bell states with $>$96\\% fidelity. These experiments demonstrate\ncomplete control of the two-qubit Hilbert space of a phosphorus atom, and show\nthat this system is able to maintain its simultaneously high initialization,\nmanipulation and measurement fidelities past the single-qubit regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 10:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

First, the recently-discovered\ntransverse spin angular momenta appear in various structured fields: evanescent\nwaves, interference fields, and focused beams. We show that there are several\nkinds of transverse spin angular momentum, which differ strongly in their\norigins and physical properties. We describe extraordinary features of the\ntransverse optical spins and overview recent experiments. In particular, the\nhelicity-independent transverse spin inherent in edge evanescent waves offers\nrobust spin-direction coupling at optical interfaces (the quantum spin Hall\neffect of light).

Integrating out the fermion degrees of\nfreedom introduces twenty-four fermion determinants. These multiply the\nGaussian functional measures of the Maxwell, $Z$, $W$ and Higgs fields to give\nan effective functional measure. Suppose the functional integral over the\nMaxwell field is attempted first. This paper is concerned with the large\namplitude behavior of the Maxwell effective measure. It is assumed that the\nlarge amplitude variation of this measure is insensitive to the presence of the\n$Z$, $W$ and $H$ fields; they are assumed to be a subdominant perturbation of\nthe large amplitude Maxwell sector. Accordingly, we need only examine the large\namplitude variation of a single QED fermion determinant. To facilitate this the\nSchwinger proper time representation of this determinant is decomposed into a\nsum of three terms. The advantage of this is that the separate terms can be\nnon-perturbatively estimated for a measurable class of large amplitude random\nfields in four dimensions. It is found that the QED fermion determinant grows\nfaster than $\\exp \\left[ce^2\\int\\mathrm d^4x\\, F_{\\mu\\nu}^2\\right]$, $c>0$, in\nthe absence of zero mode supporting random background potentials. This raises\ndoubt on whether the QED fermion determinant is integrable with any Gaussian\nmeasure whose support does not include zero mode supporting potentials.\n  Including zero mode supporting background potentials can result in a decaying\nexponential growth of the fermion determinant. This is \\textit{prima facie}\nevidence that Maxwellian zero modes are necessary for the non-perturbative\nquantization of QED and, by implication, for the non-perturbative quantization\nof the electroweak model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 10:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Despite decades of\nefforts, many aspects of the physics of relativistic jets remain elusive.

In this paper we propose two\ntechniques to determine the positions of acoustic sensors in a common\ncoordinate system, based on audio-visual correlates, i.e., events that are\nlocalized by both, microphones and cameras separately. The first approach maps\nthe output of an acoustic self-calibration algorithm by estimating rotation,\nscale and translation to the visual coordinate system, while the second solves\na joint system of equations with acoustic and visual directions of arrival as\ninput. The evaluation of the two strategies reveals that joint calibration\noutperforms the mapping approach and achieves an overall calibration error of\n0.20m even in reverberant environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 11:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

In particular, new determinations of traditional diagnostic tools such\nas the boron-to-carbon ratio (B/C) are expected to significantly reduce errors\non cosmic-ray diffusion parameters, with important implications for\nastroparticle physics, ranging from inferring primary source spectra to\nindirect dark matter searches.

We aim at assessing\nthe theoretical uncertainties affecting the outcome, with models as simple as\npossible while still retaining the key dependencies.

We test for the effect of a primary source contamination in the boron\nflux by parametrically altering its flux, as well as for nuclear cross section\nuncertainties. Our study on preliminary results from AMS-02 suggests that,\ndifferently for instance from the leptonic case, realistic modelling of the\ngeometry of the Galaxy and of the source distribution are of minor importance\nto correctly reproduce B/C data at high energies and thus, to a large extent,\nfor the extraction of diffusion parameters. The Ansatz on the lack of primary\ninjection of boron represents the most serious bias, and requires\nmulti-messenger studies to be addressed. If this uncertainty could be lifted,\nnuclear uncertainties would still represent a serious concern, which degrade\nthe systematic error on the inferred parameters to the 20% level, or three\ntimes the estimated experimental sensitivity.

This would pose another\nevolutionary problem in understanding BH binaries, with BH X-ray Novae\nformation issue being the prime example.\n  The future evolution of MWC 656 with a $\\sim 5$ M$_{\\odot}$ black hole and\nwith a $\\sim 13$ M$_{\\odot}$ main sequence companion on a $\\sim 60$ day orbit\nmay lead to the formation of a coalescing BH-NS system. The estimated Advanced\nLIGO/Virgo detection rate of such systems is up to $\\sim 0.2$ yr$^{-1}$. This\nempirical estimate is a lower limit as it is obtained with only one particular\nevolutionary scenario, the MWC 656 binary. This is only a third such estimate\navailable (after Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-3), and it lends additional support to the\nexistence of so far undetected BH--NS binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 11:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 19:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

By applying perturbation theory in a\nhorizon-penetrating coordinate system, we compute the `fine structure' of the\nenergy spectrum, and show good agreement with numerical results. We obtain data\nfor a hyperfine splitting due to black hole rotation. We evolve generic initial\ndata in the time domain, and show how Dirac bound states appear as spectral\nlines in the power spectra. In the rapidly-rotating regime, we find that the\ndecay of low-frequency co-rotating modes is suppressed in the (bosonic)\nsuperradiant regime. We conclude with a discussion of physical implications and\navenues for further work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 14:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 13:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

They both\ndepend on the investor's initial preferences and the dynamically changing\ninvestment opportunities. The leading order terms resemble their time-monotone\ncounterparts, but with the appropriate stochastic time changes resulting from\naveraging phenomena. The first-order terms compile the reaction of the investor\nto both the changes in the market input and his recent performance. Our\nanalysis is based on an expansion of the underlying ill-posed HJB equation, and\nit is justified by means of an appropriate remainder estimate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 15:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 03:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

This analysis shows that all the physical properties, in connection\nto brown dwarf stars, are valid with the observed features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 17:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2017 14:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

The aim of the paper is\nto investigate the effect of removingED stopwords on the Sentiment Analysis\n(SA) task. The stopwords lists generated before were on Modern Standard Arabic\n(MSA) which is not the common language used in OSN. We have generated a\nstopword list of Egyptian dialect to be used with the OSN corpora. We compare\nthe efficiency of text classification when using the generated list along with\npreviously generated lists of MSA and combining the Egyptian dialect list with\nthe MSA list. The text classification was performed using Na\\\"ive Bayes and\nDecision Tree classifiers and two feature selection approaches, unigram and\nbigram. The experiments show that removing ED stopwords give better performance\nthan using lists of MSA stopwords only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 15:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}
