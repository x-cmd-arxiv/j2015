The so-visualized snow voids, however, suggested\ntip vortex cores of complex shape consisting of circular cores with distinct\nelongated comet-like tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate\nthe structure and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified\nexperimentally. The LES is shown to reproduce vortex cores in good qualitative\nagreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core\npatterns observed in the field in the tip shear layer. We show that the\nvisualized vortex patterns are the result of energetic coherent dynamics in the\nrotor tip shear layer driven by interactions between the tip vortices and a\nsecond set of counter-rotating spiral vortices intertwined with the tip\nvortices. We further show that the mean flow within the region where such rich\ncoherent dynamics occur satisfies the instability criterion proposed by\nLeibovich and Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983, pp. 335--356),\nindicating that the instability uncovered by the SLPIV and the LES is of\ncentrifugal type. This study highlights the feasibility of employing snow voids\nto visualize tip vortices and demonstrates the enormous potential of\nintegrating SLPIV with LES as a powerful tool for gaining novel insights into\nthe wakes of utility scale wind turbines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 16:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Motivated by these experimental constraints we seek to\nreconcile quantum gravity with the absence of vacuum dispersion.

For planet candidates with only one visible transit, we\nestimate their orbital periods based on transit duration and host star\nproperties. The majority of the planet candidates in this work (75%) have\norbital periods that correspond to distances of 1-3 AU from their host stars.\nWe conduct follow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations to validate and\ncharacterize planet host stars.

In particular, spam has established itself over the recent\nyears as a ubiquitous, annoying, and sometimes threatening aspect of online\nsocial networks. Due to its prevalent existence, many works have tackled spam\non Twitter from different angles. Spam is, however, a moving target. The new\ngeneration of spammers on Twitter has evolved into online creatures that are\nnot easily recognizable by old detection systems. With the strong tangled\nspamming community, automatic tweeting scripts, and the ability to massively\ncreate Twitter accounts with a negligible cost, spam on Twitter is becoming\nsmarter, fuzzier and harder to detect. Our own analysis of spam content on\nArabic trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia results in an estimate of about three\nquarters of the total generated content. This alarming rate makes the\ndevelopment of adaptive spam detection techniques a very real and pressing\nneed. In this paper, we analyze the spam content of trending hashtags on Saudi\nTwitter, and assess the performance of previous spam detection systems on our\nrecently gathered dataset. Due to the escalating manipulation that\ncharacterizes newer spamming accounts, simple manual labeling currently leads\nto inaccurate results. In order to get reliable ground-truth data, we propose\nan updated manual classification algorithm that avoids the deficiencies of\nolder manual approaches. We also adapt the previously proposed features to\nrespond to spammers evading techniques, and use these features to build a new\ndata-driven detection system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 18:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 21:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable\nvariation in the choice of prior and likelihood, since this choice is made by\nthe modeler and is necessarily somewhat subjective. Despite the fundamental\nimportance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, the tools of\nrobust Bayes are not commonly used in practice. This is in large part due to\nthe difficulty of calculating robustness measures from MCMC draws. Although\nmethods for computing robustness measures from MCMC draws exist, they lack\ngenerality and often require additional coding or computation.\n  In contrast to MCMC, variational Bayes (VB) techniques are readily amenable\nto robustness analysis. The derivative of a posterior expectation with respect\nto a prior or data perturbation is a measure of local robustness to the prior\nor likelihood. Because VB casts posterior inference as an optimization problem,\nits methodology is built on the ability to calculate derivatives of posterior\nquantities with respect to model parameters, even in very complex models. In\nthe present work, we develop local prior robustness measures for mean-field\nvariational Bayes(MFVB), a VB technique which imposes a particular\nfactorization assumption on the variational posterior approximation. We start\nby outlining existing local prior measures of robustness. Next, we use these\nresults to derive closed-form measures of the sensitivity of mean-field\nvariational posterior approximation to prior specification.

We study the problem of a warm wind running into a cold ambient\ntoroid by using a tracer field that keeps track of the wind material. While an\nisothermal equation of state is adopted, the effective temperature is\ndetermined locally based on the wind mass fraction. In the unified wind model,\nthe density of the wind is cylindrically stratified and highly concentrated\ntoward the outflow axis. Our simulations show that for a sufficiently\nmagnetized wind, the jet identity can be well maintained even at high\ntemperatures. However, for a high temperature wind with low magnetization, the\nthermal pressure of the wind gas can drive material away from the axis, making\nthe jet less collimated as it propagates. We also study the role of the\npoloidal magnetic field of the toroid. It is shown that the wind-ambient\ninterface becomes more resistant to corrugation when the poloidal field is\npresent, and the poloidal field that bunches up within the toroid prevents the\nswept-up material from being compressed into a thin layer. This suggests that\nthe ambient poloidal field may play a role in producing a smoother and thicker\nswept-up shell structure in the molecular outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 20:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

These properties rely on the gapless parabolic dispersion relation\nand the chiral nature of bilayer graphene electrons. In addition, propagating\nand evanescent electron states coexist inherently in this material, giving rise\nto these exotic properties. In this sense, bilayer graphene is unique, since in\nmost material systems in which Fano resonance phenomena are manifested an\nexternal source that provides extended states is required. However, from a\nnumerical standpoint, the presence of evanescent-divergent states in the\neigenfunctions linear superposition representing the Dirac spinors, leads to a\nnumerical degradation (the so called $\\Omega$d problem) in the practical\napplications of the standard Coefficient Transfer Matrix ($K$) method used to\nstudy charge transport properties in Bilayer Graphen based multi-barrier\nsystems.

However,\nan ultraviolet completion is required below ~ 10 TeV to remove residual\nlogarithmic divergences. In non-supersymmetric completions, new exotic fermions\ncharged under both the standard model and twin gauge symmetries have to be\npresent to accompany the top quark, thus providing a high energy probe of the\nmodel. Some of them carry standard model color, and may therefore be copiously\nproduced at current or future hadron colliders.

The circumnuclear ring (CNR), a ring of molecular gas that\norbits the supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of 1.5 pc, has been\nclaimed to induce precession and Kozai-Lidov oscillations onto the orbits of\nstars in the innermost parsec. We investigate the perturbations exerted by a\ngas ring on a nearly-Keplerian stellar disk orbiting a SMBH by means of\ncombined direct N-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We\nsimulate the formation of gas rings through the infall and disruption of a\nmolecular gas cloud, adopting different inclinations between the infalling gas\ncloud and the stellar disk. We find that a CNR-like ring is not efficient in\naffecting the stellar disk on a timescale of 3 Myr. In contrast, a gas ring in\nthe innermost 0.5 pc induces precession of the longitude of the ascending node\nOmega, significantly affecting the stellar disk inclination. Furthermore, the\ncombined effect of two-body relaxation and Omega-precession drives the stellar\ndisk dismembering, displacing the stars from the disk. The impact of precession\non the star orbits is stronger when the stellar disk and the inner gas ring are\nnearly coplanar. We speculate that the warm gas in the inner cavity might have\nplayed a major role in the evolution of the clockwise disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 22:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

We ran three\nindependent transient detection pipelines on two-minute snapshot images from a\n13 hour BETA observation in order to 1) study the emission from the pulsar, 2)\nsearch for other transient emission from elsewhere in the image and 3) to\ncompare the results from the different transient detection pipelines. The\npulsar was easily detected as a transient source and, over the course of the\nobservations, it switched into the strong state three times giving a typical\ntimescale between the strong emission states of 3.7 hours. After the first\nswitch it remained in the strong state for almost 40 minutes. The other strong\nstates lasted less than 4 minutes. The second state change was confirmed using\nobservations with the Parkes radio telescope. No other transient events were\nfound and we place constraints on the surface density of such events on these\ntimescales. The high sensitivity Parkes observations enabled us to detect\nindividual bright pulses during the weak state and to study the strong state\nover a wide observing band. We conclude by showing that future transient\nsurveys with ASKAP will have the potential to probe the intermittent pulsar\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 00:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Both the\nstratospheric temperature and composition are affected by this latitudinally\nvarying insolation along the seasons. The thermal structure is controlled and\nregulated by the amount of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere, which act as\nabsorbers and coolants from the UV to the far-IR spectral range, and this\nstructure influences the amount of hydrocarbons. We study here the feedback\nbetween the chemical composition and the thermal structure by coupling a\nlatitudinal and seasonal photochemical model with a radiative seasonal model.\nOur results show that the seasonal temperature peak in the higher stratosphere,\nassociated with the seasonal increase of insolation, is shifted earlier than\nthe maximum insolation peak. This shift is increased with increasing latitudes\nand is caused by the low amount of stratospheric coolants in the spring season.\nAt 80$^{\\circ}$ in both hemispheres, the temperature peak at 1d-2mbar is seen\nto occur half a season earlier than was previously predicted by radiative\nseasonal models that assumed spatially and temporally uniform distribution of\ncoolants. This shift progressively decreases with increasing pressure, up to\naround the 0.5mbar pressure level where it vanishes. However, the thermal field\nhas a small feedback on the abundance distributions. This feedback modifies the\npredicted equator-to-pole temperature gradient. The meridional gradients of\ntemperature at the mbar pressure levels are better reproduced when this\nfeedback is accounted for. At lower pressure levels, the thermal structure\nseems to depart from pure radiative seasonal equilibrium as previously\nsuggested by Guerlet et al. (2014). Although the agreement with the absolute\nvalue of the stratospheric temperature observed by Cassini is moderate, it is a\nmandatory step toward a fully coupled GCM-photochemical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 02:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Statistical analyses indicate that\nat least 50 events at Parkes are required to distinguish between a constant\nco-moving FRB density, and a FRB density that evolves with redshift like the\ncosmological star formation rate density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 03:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 02:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The legitimate monitor can successfully eavesdrop\n(decode) the information of the suspicious link at each fading state only when\nits achievable data rate is no smaller than that at the suspicious receiver. In\npractice, such legitimate eavesdropping is particularly challenging, since the\nlegitimate monitor may be far away from the suspicious transmitter and cannot\neavesdrop efficiently. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach,\nnamely proactive eavesdropping via cognitive jamming, in which the legitimate\nmonitor purposely jams the receiver so as to change the suspicious\ncommunication (e.g., to a smaller data rate) for overhearing more efficiently.\nIn particular, we consider delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant applications for\nthe suspicious data communications, under which the legitimate monitor\nmaximizes the eavesdropping non-outage probability for event-based monitoring\nand the relative eavesdropping rate for content analysis, respectively, by\noptimizing its jamming power allocation over different fading states subject to\nan average power constraint.

At such scales, traditional devices based on geometrical optics reach\ntheir fundamental direction limits and cease to work. Nano photonics, on the\nother hand, has attracted wide attention from researchers, especially in the\nlast decade, due to its ability to manipulate light at the nanoscale. This\nreview focuses on the nano photonics systems that aim to select light based on\nits propagation direction. In the first half of this review, we survey the\nliterature and the current state of the art focused on enabling optical\nbroadband angular selectivity. The mechanisms we review can be classified into\nthree main categories: (i) microscale geometrical optics, (ii) multilayer\nbirefringent materials and (iii) Brewster modes in plasmonic systems, photonic\ncrystals and metamaterials. In the second half, we present two categories of\npotential applications for broadband angularly selective systems. The first\ncategory aims at enhancing the efficiency of solar energy harvesting, through\nphotovoltaic process or solar thermal process. The second category aims at\nenhancing light extracting efficiency and detection sensitivity. Finally, we\ndiscuss the most prominent challenges in broadband angular selectivity and some\nprospects on how to solve these challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 06:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

A key challenge for\nsingle-molecule electronics is to control the temperature of these junctions.\nControlling heating and cooling effects in individual vibrational modes, can in\nprinciple, be utilized to increase stability of single-molecule junctions under\nbias, to pump energy into particular vibrational modes to perform\ncurrent-induced reactions or to increase the resolution in inelastic electron\ntunneling spectroscopy by controlling the life-times of phonons in a molecule\nby suppressing absorption and external dissipation processes. Under bias the\ncurrent and the molecule exchange energy, which typically results in heating of\nthe molecule. However, the opposite process is also possible, where energy is\nextracted from the molecule by the tunneling current. Designing a molecular\n'heat sink' where a particular vibrational mode funnels heat out of the\nmolecule and into the leads would be very desirable.

The sensitivity of the sensor is defined based on the dependence of\nthe effective refractive index on the refractive index of the environment.\nUsing a result of waveguide perturbation theory, the geometrical\ncharacteristics of the core of the circular waveguide that maximize the\nsensitivity of the system are determined. Both single and dual core\nconfigurations are considered. It is found that, when optimally designed, the\nsensor can detect relative refractive index changes of the order of 10^-4,\nassuming that the experimental setup can detect relative wavelength shifts of\nthe order of 3x10^-5. Finally, the behavior of the system as bio-sensor is\nexamined by considering that a thin layer of bio-material is attached on the\nsurface of the waveguide core. It is found that, when optimally designed, the\nsystem can detect refractive index changes of the order of 10^-3 for a layer\nthickness of 10 nm, and changes in the layer thickness of the order of 0.24 nm,\nfor a refractive index change of 0.05.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 11:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 13:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

The\nmodel of Network Constructors is a variant of Population Protocols capable of\n(algorithmically) constructing abstract networks. Both models are characterized\nby a fundamental inability to terminate. In this work, we investigate the\nminimal strengthenings of the latter that could overcome this inability. Our\nmain conclusion is that initial connectivity of the communication topology\ncombined with the ability of the protocol to transform the communication\ntopology plus a few other local and realistic assumptions are sufficient to\nguarantee not only termination but also the maximum computational power that\none can hope for in this family of models. The technique is to transform any\ninitial connected topology to a less symmetric and detectable topology without\never breaking its connectivity during the transformation. The target topology\nof all of our transformers is the spanning line and we call Terminating Line\nTransformation the corresponding problem. We first study the case in which\nthere is a pre-elected unique leader and give a time-optimal protocol for\nTerminating Line Transformation. We then prove that dropping the leader without\nadditional assumptions leads to a strong impossibility result. In an attempt to\novercome this, we equip the nodes with the ability to tell, during their\npairwise interactions, whether they have at least one neighbor in common.\nInterestingly, it turns out that this local and realistic mechanism is\nsufficient to make the problem solvable. In particular, we give a very\nefficient protocol that solves Terminating Line Transformation when all nodes\nare initially identical. The latter implies that the model computes with\ntermination any symmetric predicate computable by a Turing Machine of space\n$\\Theta(n^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 12:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

The purpose of our study is to determine how the final assembly of\nplanets and their physical properties are affected by the total mass of the\ndisk and its radial profile. Because of the important roles of secular\nresonances in orbits and properties of the final planets, we studied the\neffects of these resonances as well. We have divided this study into two parts.\nIn Part 1, we are interested in examining the effects of secular resonances on\nthe formation of Mars and orbital stability of terrestrial planets. In Part 2,\nour goal is to determine trends that may exist between the disk surface density\nprofile and the final properties of terrestrial planets. In the context of the\ndepleted disk model, results show that the nu_5 resonance does not have a\nsignificant effect on the final orbits of terrestrial planets. However, nu_6\nand nu_16 resonances play important roles in clearing their affected areas\nensuring that no additional mass will be scattered into the accretion zone of\nMars so that it can maintain its mass and orbital stability. In Part 2, our\nresults indicate that despite some small correlations, in general, no trend\nseems to exist between the disk surface density profile and the mean number of\nthe final planets, their masses, time of formation, and distances to the\ncentral star.

Large-scale correlations inside the\ncritical region are expressed in terms of correlators in a (euclidean)\ntwo-dimensional massless Dirac field theory. It is observed that this theory is\ninhomogenous: the metric is position-dependent, so it is in fact a Dirac field\ntheory in curved space.

The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the\nneutron star by the disk and vice versa cause the observed flux to depend on\nthe inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of\nspecial importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are\npowered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star.\nBecause part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst\nflux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star\nand reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance,\nmass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.\nPrevious studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst\nflux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of\ntwo exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first\ntime for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as\nopposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the\nreflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk\ncan account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors\nfor different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy\nfactors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the\nanisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger\nthan unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in\nheight, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could\npossibly be induced by the X-ray burst, if X-ray heating causes the inner disk\nto puff up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 15:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 12:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Differential privacy is a privacy model for\nanonymization that offers more robust privacy guarantees than previous models,\nsuch as $k$-anonymity and its extensions. However, it is often disregarded that\nthe utility of differentially private outputs is quite limited, either because\nof the amount of noise that needs to be added to obtain them or because utility\nis only preserved for a restricted type and/or a limited number of queries.

In\nunmagnetized shocks, this turbulence is strong enough to dominate the\nbackground magnetic field so the shock can be treated as parallel regardless of\nthe initial magnetic field orientation, making application to gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs), pulsar winds, Type Ibc supernovae, and extra-galactic radio sources\nmore straightforward and realistic. In addition to changing the scale of the\nshock precursor, we show that, when nonlinear effects from efficient Fermi\nacceleration are taken into account, the momentum dependence of the mfp has an\nimportant influence on the efficiency of cosmic-ray production as well as the\naccelerated particle spectral shape. These effects are absent in\nnonrelativistic shocks and do not appear in relativistic shock models unless\nnonlinear effects are self-consistently described.

It shows that\nthe vast majority of models used for assessing climate policy use assumptions\nabout the financial system that sit at odds with the observed reality. In\nparticular, the models' assumptions lead to `crowding out' of capital, which\ncause them to show negative impacts from climate policy in virtually all cases.\nWe compare this approach with that of the E3ME model, which follows\nnon-equilibrium economic theory and adopts a more empirical approach. While the\nnon-equilibrium model also has limitations, its treatment of the financial\nsystem is more consistent with reality and it shows that green investment need\nnot crowd out investment in other parts of the economy -- and may therefore\noffer an economic stimulus.\n  The implication of this finding is that standard CGE models consistently\nover-estimate the costs of climate policy in terms of GDP and welfare,\npotentially by a substantial amount. These findings overly restrict the range\nof possible emission pathways accessible using climate policy from the\nviewpoint of the decision-maker, and may also lead to misleading information\nused for policy making. Improvements in both modelling approaches should be\nsought with some urgency -- both to provide a better assessment of potential\nclimate policy and to improve understanding of the dynamics of the global\nfinancial system more generally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 15:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-09"}

Here, we study the dynamics of polarization in the\nmovie ratings collected by the Internet Movie database (IMDb) website in\nrelation to films produced over the period 1915-2015.

We examine the\nresponse of our model neutron star to glitches induced in three different ways:\nby instantaneous changes of the spin frequency of the inner and outer\nboundaries, and by instantaneous recoupling of the fluid components in the\nbulk. All simulations are performed with strong and weak mutual friction. It is\nfound that the maximum size of a glitch that originates in the bulk decreases\nas the mutual friction strengthens. It is also found that mutual friction\ndetermines the fraction of the frequency jump which is later recovered, a\nquantity known as the 'healing parameter'.
