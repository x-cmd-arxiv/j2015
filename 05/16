Here we introduce a new method of modelling that can be applied to\nsuperconducting structures involving multiple Josephson junctions, high-Q\nsuperconducting cavities, external ports, and voltage sources. Our technique,\nan extension of our previous work on single-port structures [1], permits the\nderivation of system Hamiltonians that are capable of representing every\nfeature of the physical system over a wide frequency band and the computation\nof T1 times for qubits. We begin with a black box model of the linear and\npassive part of the system. Its response is given by its multiport impedance\nfunction Zsim(w), which can be obtained using a finite-element electormagnetics\nsimulator. The ports of this black box are defined by the terminal pairs of\nJosephson junctions, voltage sources, and 50 Ohm connectors to high-frequency\nlines. We fit Zsim(w) to a positive-real (PR) multiport impedance matrix Z(s),\na function of the complex Laplace variable s. We then use state-space\ntechniques to synthesize a finite electric circuit admitting exactly the same\nimpedance Z(s) across its ports; the PR property ensures the existence of this\nfinite physical circuit. We compare the performance of state-space algorithms\nto classical frequency domain methods, justifying their superiority in\nnumerical stability. The Hamiltonian of the multiport model circuit is obtained\nby using existing lumped element circuit quantization formalisms [2, 3]. Due to\nthe presence of ideal transformers in the model circuit, these quantization\nmethods must be extended, requiring the introduction of an extension of the\nKirchhoff voltage and current laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 16:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

The observed different\nredshift among broad hydrogen lines is still an amazing puzzle in the study of\nquasars.

The different redshifts among\ndifferent broad hydrogen lines could stand for an evidence to quantitatively\nsupport that the observed broad hydrogen lines should be blended by both the\nreal line emission and the Cerenkov quasi-line emission.

The junction between double\nand single strands creates a barrier to the movement of the helicase, which can\nbe manipulated in vitro by applying mechanical forces directly on the nucleic\nacid strands. Single molecule experiments have demonstrated that the unwinding\nvelocities of some helicases increase dramatically with increase in the\nexternal force, while others show little response. In contrast, the unwinding\nprocessivity always increases when the force increases. The differing responses\nof the unwinding velocity and processivity to force has lacked explanation. By\ngeneralizing a previous model of processive unwinding by helicases, we provide\na unified framework for understanding the dependence of velocity and\nprocessivity on force and the nucleic acid sequence. We predict that the\nsensitivity of unwinding processivity to external force is a universal feature\nthat should be observed in all helicases. Our prediction is illustrated using\nT7 and NS3 helicases as case studies.

At query time, the system presents the user\nwith a set of exemplar images, and the user relates them to his/her target\nimage with comparative statements. Using a series of such constraints in the\nmulti-dimensional attribute space, our method iteratively updates its relevance\nfunction and re-ranks the database of images. To determine which exemplar\nimages receive feedback from the user, we present two variants of the approach:\none where the feedback is user-initiated and another where the feedback is\nactively system-initiated. In either case, our approach allows a user to\nefficiently \"whittle away\" irrelevant portions of the visual feature space,\nusing semantic language to precisely communicate her preferences to the system.\nWe demonstrate our technique for refining image search for people, products,\nand scenes, and we show that it outperforms traditional binary relevance\nfeedback in terms of search speed and accuracy. In addition, the ordinal nature\nof relative attributes helps make our active approach efficient -- both\ncomputationally for the machine when selecting the reference images, and for\nthe user by requiring less user interaction than conventional passive and\nactive methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 18:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 13:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The agents try to maximise their information about their\nenvironment by acquiring information from the outputs of other agents in the\npopulation. A naive use of information-theoretic methods would assume that\nevery agent knows how to \"interpret\" the information offered by other agents.\nHowever, this assumes that one \"knows\" which other agents one observes, and\nthus which code they use. In our model, however, we wish to preclude that: it\nis not clear which other agents an agent is observing, and the resulting usable\ninformation is therefore influenced by the universality of the code used and by\nwhich agents an agent is \"listening\" to. We further investigate whether an\nagent who does not directly perceive the environment can distinguish states by\nobserving other agents' outputs. For this purpose, we consider a population of\ndifferent types of agents \"talking\" about different concepts, and try to\nextract new ones by considering their outputs only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 18:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

The\ntechnique, which we call HIEMICA (HI Expectation-Maximization Independent\nComponent Analysis), is an extension of the Independent Component Analysis\n(ICA) technique developed for two-dimensional (2D) CMB maps to\nthree-dimensional (3D) 21-cm cosmological signals measured by interferometers.\nThis technique provides a fully Bayesian inference of power spectra and maps\nand separates the foregrounds from signal based on the diversity of their power\nspectra. Only relying on the statistical independence of the components, this\napproach can jointly estimate the 3D power spectrum of the 21-cm signal and,\nthe 2D angular power spectrum and the frequency dependence of each foreground\ncomponent, without any prior assumptions about foregrounds. This approach has\nbeen tested extensively by applying it to mock data from interferometric 21-cm\nintensity mapping observations under idealized assumptions of instrumental\neffects. We also discuss the impact when the noise properties are not known\ncompletely. As a first step toward solving the 21 cm power spectrum analysis\nproblem we compare the semi-blind HIEMICA technique with the commonly used\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). Under the same idealized circumstances the\nproposed technique provides significantly improved recovery of the power\nspectrum. This technique can be applied straightforwardly to all 21-cm\ninterferometric observations, including epoch of reionization measurements, and\ncan be extended to single-dish observations as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 18:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 08:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space. Within a five-orbital $t-J_{1}-J_{2}$\nmodel with orbital-selective exchange couplings, we show that the proposed\npairing state is energetically competitive over a finite range of control\nparameters. We calculate the dynamical spin susceptibility in the\norbital-selective $s \\times \\tau_3$ superconducting state and show that a spin\nresonance arises and has the characteristics of observed by inelastic neutron\nexperiments in the alkaline iron selenides. More generally, the formation of\nthe orbital-selective $s \\times \\tau_3$ state represents a novel means of\nrelieving the quasi-degeneracy between $s-$ and $d-$wave pairing states, which\nis a hitherto unsuspected alternative to the conventional route of linearly\nsuperposing the two into a time-reversal symmetry breaking $s+id$ state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 19:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

Metallic\nphases occur when the number of SrTiO$_3$ layers is large or the interaction\n$U$ is small. In metallic phases, the mobile electrons are found in the\nSrTiO$_3$ layers, with near-interface electrons occupying $xy$-derived bands,\nwhile away from the interface the majority of electrons reside in $xz/yz$\nbands. As the thickness of the SrTiO$_3$ layers decreases or the on-site\ninteraction U increases a metal-insulator transition occurs. Two different\ninsulating states are found. When the number of SrTiO$_{3}$ layers is larger\nthan one, we find an insulating state with two sublattice charge and orbital\nordering and associated Ti-O bond length disproportionations. When the number\nof SrTiO$_{3}$ units per layer is one, a different insulating phase occurs\ndriven by orbital ordering within the quasi one-dimensional $xz/yz$ bonding\nbands connecting Ti atoms across the SrO layer. In this phase there is no\nsublattice charge ordering or bond disproportionation.

Instead, the abundance is set by\nannihilation to light hidden sector states that carry no charges under the SM\ngauge interactions. In such a scenario the constraints from direct and indirect\ndetection, and from collider searches for dark matter, can easily be satisfied.\nThe masses of such light hidden states can be protected by symmetry if they are\nNambu-Goldstone bosons, fermions, or gauge bosons. These states can then\ncontribute to the cosmic energy density as dark radiation, leading to\nobservable signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Furthermore,\ndepending on whether or not the light hidden sector states self-interact, the\nfraction of the total energy density that free-streams is either decreased or\nincreased, leading to characteristic effects on both the scalar and tensor\ncomponents of the CMB anisotropy that allows these two cases to be\ndistinguished.

The overhead rate necessary to enable the controller to\nreproduce the users' local state can be prohibitively high. An approach to\nreduce this overhead is interactive communication wherein rate savings are\nachieved by tolerating an increase in delay. In this paper, we consider the\ndesign of a simple achievable scheme based on successive refinements of scalar\nquantization at each user. The optimal quantization policy is computed via a\ndynamic program and we demonstrate that tolerating a small increase in delay\ncan yield significant rate savings. We then consider two simpler quantization\npolicies to investigate the scaling properties of the rate-delay trade-offs.\nUsing a combination of these simpler policies, the performance of the optimal\npolicy can be closely approximated with lower computational costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 20:58:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 16:06:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 15:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

At least 492 central stars of Galactic planetary nebulae (CSPNs)\nhave been assigned spectral types. Since many CSPNs are faint, these\nclassification efforts are frequently made at low spectral resolution. However,\nthe stellar Balmer absorption lines are contaminated with nebular emission;\ntherefore in many cases a low-resolution spectrum does not enable the\ndetermination of the H abundance in the CSPN photosphere. Whether or not the\nphotosphere is H deficient is arguably the most important fact we should expect\nto extract from the CSPN spectrum, and should be the basis for an adequate\nspectral classification system.\n  Aims. Our purpose is to provide accurate spectral classifications and\ncontribute to the knowledge of central stars of planetary nebulae and stellar\nevolution.\n  Methods. We have obtained and studied higher quality spectra of CSPNs\ndescribed in the literature as weak emission-line star (WELS). We provide\ndescriptions of 19 CSPN spectra. These stars had been previously classified at\nlow spectral resolution. We used medium-resolution spectra taken with the\nGemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS). We provide spectral types in the\nMorgan-Keenan (MK) system whenever possible.\n  Results. Twelve stars in our sample appear to have normal H rich photospheric\nabundances, and five stars remain unclassified. The rest (two) are most\nprobably H deficient. Of all central stars described by other authors as WELS,\nwe find that at least 26% of them are, in fact, H rich O stars, and at least 3%\nare H deficient. This supports the suggestion that the denomination WELS should\nnot be taken as a spectral type, because, as a WELS based on low-resolution\nspectra, it cannot provide enough information about the photospheric H\nabundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 22:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

Furthermore, we provide predictions of the\ncumulative distribution of E(B-V) values of quasars from extinction by the wind\nand the shape of the wind as imaged in the mid-infrared. Within the framework\nof this model, we predict that the strength of the near-infrared bump from hot\ndust emission will be correlated primarily with L/L_Edd rather than luminosity\nalone, with scatter induced by the distribution of magnetic field strengths.\nThe empirical successes and shortcomings of these models warrant further\ninvestigations into the composition and behaviour of dust and the nature of\nmagnetic fields in the vicinity of actively accreting supermassive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 23:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The proposed approach allows to jointly exploit both\nthe wireless and social context of wireless users for optimizing the overall\nallocation of resources and improving traffic offload in SCNs. This\ncontext-aware resource allocation problem is formulated as a matching game in\nwhich user equipments (UEs) and resource blocks (RBs) rank one another, based\non utility functions that capture both wireless and social metrics. Due to\nsocial interrelations, this game is shown to belong to a class of matching\ngames with peer effects. To solve this game, a novel, selforganizing algorithm\nis proposed, using which UEs and RBs can interact to decide on their desired\nallocation. The proposed algorithm is then proven to converge to a two-sided\nstable matching between UEs and RBs. The properties of the resulting stable\noutcome are then studied and assessed. Simulation results using real social\ndata show that clustering of socially connected users allows to offload a\nsubstantially larger amount of traffic than the conventional context-unaware\napproach. These results show that exploiting social context has high practical\nrelevance in saving resources on the wireless links and on the backhaul.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 23:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

In contrast, indirect methods, such as\nobservations of gamma-ray emission from CR interactions with interstellar gas,\nhave been employed to directly probe the CR densities in distant locations\nthroughout the Galactic plane. In this article we use 73 months of data from\nthe Fermi Large Area Telescope in the energy range between 300 MeV and 10 GeV\nto search for gamma-ray emission produced by CR interactions in several high-\nand intermediate-velocity clouds located at up to ~ 7 kpc above the Galactic\nplane.

We find\nthat the gamma-ray emissivity per H atom decreases with increasing distance\nfrom the plane at 97.5% confidence level. This corroborates the notion that CRs\nat the relevant energies originate in the Galactic disk.

While the\nproblem is known to be NP-hard, certain algorithms such as the A* search and\nheuristics perform reasonably well on many instances of the problem. In this\npaper, we first focus on the A* search algorithm, and analyze lower and upper\nbounds that are easy to compute and can be used to prune nodes. Our analysis\nsheds light on which bounds result in fast computation within a given\napproximation gap. We present extensive simulation results that improve upon\nour theoretical analysis, and further show that our method finds the optimum\nsolution on most instances of medium-size bays. On \"hard\" instances, our method\nfinds an approximate solution with a small gap and within a time frame that is\nfast for practical applications.

Thus, the unique\nphotonic and electronic properties of individual graphene sheets are manifested\nin the response of the bulk state. These results offer an exciting opportunity\nto bring about bulk scale light manipulation with the potential to realize\nlong-sought proposals in areas such as the solar sail and space transportation\ndriven directly by sunlight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2015 08:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

A time-series of high-resolution spectra, UBV photometry as well as a\nvery accurate light curve obtained by the Kepler satellite, allowed us to study\nthe object in unprecedented detail. We discovered it to be a binary with a\nperiod of 127 days. The primary has a low surface gravity and an atmosphere\ndepleted in refractory elements. This combination of properties unambiguously\nplaces IRAS 19135+3937 in the subclass of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars\nwith dusty discs.\n  We show that the light variations in this object can not be due to\npulsations, but are likely caused by the obscuration of the primary by the\ncircumbinary disc during orbital motion. Furthermore, we argue that the\ndouble-peaked Fe emission lines provide evidence for the existence of a gaseous\ncircumbinary Keplerian disc inside the dusty disc. A secondary set of\nabsorption lines has been detected near light minimum, which we attribute to\nthe reflected spectrum of the primary on the disc wall, which segregates due to\nthe different Doppler shift. This corroborates the recent finding that\nreflection in the optical by this type of discs is very efficient.

The interplay of the various\nexposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer\nnetwork.

It has been observed that the\nSchr$\\ddot{\\rm{o}}$dinger equation can be reduced to an one dimensional\nhydrogen atom problem. Whereas, the quantized energy levels are exactly\nidentical with that of an one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Hence\nconsidering transitions, we have predicted the existence of a new kind of\nquanta, which will either be emitted or absorbed if the particles get excited\nor de-excited respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2015 11:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 07:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Exact nonlinear and time-dependent solutions are\nobtained, which exhibit a variety of transient phenomena such as a density\ncollapse in finite space-time or the appearance and, for the first time, a\nsuccessive dissolution of wavelet structures during the same event. The latter\nare superimposed on the gross density pattern in the course of the\nuni-directional expansion of an initially localized density hump. Whereas\nself-gravitating fluids will always experience collapse, neutral fluids and\nfluids with repulsive forces, such as a non-neutral, pure electron fluid, can\nexhibit an evolution of the second type, being determined by the initial\nconditions. For an electron fluid, being embedded in a neutralizing ion\nbackground, these nonlinearities are, however, strongly diminished due to the\nomnipresent plasma oscillations, which weaken and alternatively change the sign\nof the collective force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2015 09:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}
