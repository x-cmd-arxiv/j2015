Traditional metal\nheaters used for thermal tuning in silicon micro-cavities usually need a thick\nSiO2 upper-cladding layer, which will introduce some disadvantages including\nlow response speed, low heating efficiency, low achievable temperature and\ncomplicated fabrication processes. In this paper, we propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate thermally-tuning silicon micro-disk resonators by introducing\ngraphene transparent nano-heaters, which contacts the silicon core directly\nwithout any isolator layer. This makes the graphene transparent nano-heater\npotentially to have excellent performances in terms of the heating efficiency,\nthe temporal response and the achievable temperature. It is also shown that the\ngraphene nano-heater is convenient to be used in ultrasmall photonic integrated\ndevices due to the single-atom thickness and excellent flexibility of graphene.\nBoth experiments and simulations imply that the present graphene transparent\nnano-heater is promising for thermally-tuning nanophotonic integrated devices\nfor e.g. optical modulating, optical filtering/switching, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 16:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For continuous data which\nwe consider here in the context of regression and cluster analysis, MoE usually\nuse normal experts, that is, expert components following the Gaussian\ndistribution. However, for a set of data containing a group or groups of\nobservations with asymmetric behavior, heavy tails or atypical observations,\nthe use of normal experts may be unsuitable and can unduly affect the fit of\nthe MoE model. In this paper, we introduce new non-normal mixture of experts\n(NNMoE) which can deal with these issues regarding possibly skewed,\nheavy-tailed data and with outliers. The proposed models are the skew-normal\nMoE and the robust $t$ MoE and skew $t$ MoE, respectively named SNMoE, TMoE and\nSTMoE. We develop dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) and expectation\nconditional maximization (ECM) algorithms to estimate the parameters of the\nproposed models by monotonically maximizing the observed data log-likelihood.\nWe describe how the presented models can be used in prediction and in\nmodel-based clustering of regression data.

However, for coverage and submodular maximization\nproblems, impossibility bounds are known for this technique \\cite{IMMM14}.

Here we address the origin of amino\nacids in the warm interiors of their parent bodies (planetesimals) within a few\nmillion years of their formation, and connect this with the astrochemistry of\ntheir natal protostellar disks. We compute both the total amino acid abundance\npattern as well as the relative frequencies of amino acids within the CM2 (e.g.\nMurchison) and CR2 chondrite subclasses based on Strecker reactions within\nthese bodies. We match the relative frequencies to well within an order of\nmagnitude among both CM2 and CR2 meteorites for parent body temperatures $<$\n200$^{\\circ}$C. These temperatures agree with 3D models of young planetesimal\ninteriors. We find theoretical abundances of approximately 7x10$^5$\nparts-per-billion (ppb), which is in agreement with the average observed\nabundance in CR2 meteorites of 4$\\pm$7x10$^5$, but an order of magnitude higher\nthan the average observed abundance in CM2 meteorites of 2$\\pm$2x10$^4$. We\nfind that the production of hydroxy acids could be favoured over the production\nof amino acids within certain meteorite parent bodies (e.g. CI1, CM2) but not\nothers (e.g. CR2). This could be due to the relatively lower NH$_3$ abundances\nwithin CI1 and CM2 meteorite parent bodies, which leads to less amino acid\nsynthesis. We also find that the water content in planetesimals is likely to be\nthe main cause of variance between carbonaceous chondrites of the same\nsubclass. We propose that amino acid abundances are primarily dependent on the\nammonia and water content of planetesimals that are formed in chemically\ndistinct regions within their natal protostellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 19:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

However, browsing large graphs remains a challenge. Rendering\nthousands of graphical elements at once often results in a cluttered image, and\nnavigating these elements naively can cause disorientation. To address this\nchallenge we propose a method called GraphMaps, mimicking the browsing\nexperience of online geographic maps.\n  GraphMaps creates a sequence of layers, where each layer refines the previous\none. During graph browsing, GraphMaps chooses the layer corresponding to the\nzoom level, and renders only those entities of the layer that intersect the\ncurrent viewport. The result is that, regardless of the graph size, the number\nof entities rendered at each view does not exceed a predefined threshold, yet\nall graph elements can be explored by the standard zoom and pan operations.\n  GraphMaps preprocesses a graph in such a way that during browsing, the\ngeometry of the entities is stable, and the viewer is responsive. Our case\nstudies indicate that GraphMaps is useful in gaining an overview of a large\ngraph, and also in exploring a graph on a finer level of detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 17:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Gas escaping from several hot, hydrogen-rich\nplanets has been detected using UV and X-ray transmission spectroscopy. Because\nthese planets are tidally locked, and thus asymmetrically irradiated, escaping\ngas is unlikely to be spherically symmetric. In this paper, we focus on the\neffects of asymmetric heating on local outflow structure. We use the Athena\ncode for hydrodynamics to produce 3D simulations of hot Jupiter mass loss that\njointly model wind launching and stellar heating via photoionization. Our\nfiducial planet is an inflated, hot Jupiter with radius $R_p=2.14 R_{\\rm Jup}$\nand mass $M_p = 0.53 M_{\\rm Jup}$. We irradiate the initially neutral, atomic\nhydrogen atmosphere with 13.6 eV photons and compute the outflow's ionization\nstructure. There are clear asymmetries in the atmospheric outflow, including a\nneutral shadow on the planet's nightside. Given an incident ionizing UV flux\ncomparable to that of the Sun, we find a steady-state mass loss rate of\n~$2\\times10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$. The total mass loss rate and the outflow\nsubstructure along the substellar ray show good agreement with earlier 1D\nmodels, for two different fluxes. Our 3D data cube can be used to generate the\noutflow's extinction spectrum during transit. As a proof of concept, we find\nabsorption of stellar Lyman-alpha at Doppler-shifted velocities of up to $\\pm\n50$ km s$^{-1}$. Our work provides a starting point for further 3D models that\ncan be used to predict observable signatures of hot Jupiter mass loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 20:00:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 21:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

The radio\nemission is optically thick synchrotron, presumably from a compact jet. We take\nadvantage of the low extinction and model the near-IR to UV emission with a\nmulti-temperature disk model. Assuming a BH mass of M_BH=5 Msun and a system\ninclination of 40 deg, the fits imply an inner radius for the disk of\nRin/Rg>212 d_3 (5Msun/M_BH). The outer radius is R_out/R_g=90,000 d_3\n(5Msun/M_BH), which corresponds to 6.6e10 d_3 cm, consistent with the expected\nsize of the disk. The 0.5-240 keV spectrum measured by Swift/XRT, Suzaku, and\nNuSTAR is relatively well characterized by a power-law with a photon index of\nGamma=1.722+/-0.003, but a significant improvement is seen when a second\ncontinuum component is added. Reflection is a possibility, but no iron line is\ndetected, implying a low iron abundance. We are able to fit the entire SED with\na multi-temperature disk component, a Comptonization component, and a broken\npower-law, representing the emission from the compact jet. The broken power-law\ncannot significantly contribute to the soft X-ray emission, and this may be\nrelated to why Swift J1753.5-0127 is an outlier in the radio/X-ray correlation.\nThe broken power-law might dominate above 20 keV, which would constrain the\nbreak frequency to be between 2.4e10 Hz and 3.6e12 Hz. Although the fits to the\nfull SED do not include significant thermal emission in the X-ray band,\nprevious observations have consistently seen such a component, and we find that\nthere is evidence at the 3.1-sigma level for a disk-blackbody component with a\ntemperature of 150(+30)(-20) eV and an inner radius of 5-14 R_g.

In order to do this, we formulate shared control as a random\nprocess and describe the joint distribution that governs its behavior. For\ntractability, we model the relationships between the operator, autonomy, and\ncrowd as an undirected graphical model. Further, we introduce an interaction\nfunction between the operator and the robot, that we call \"agreeability\"; in\ncombination with the methods developed in~\\cite{trautman-ijrr-2015}, we extend\na cooperative collision avoidance autonomy to shared control. We therefore\nquantify the notion of simultaneously optimizing over agreeability (between the\noperator and autonomy), and safety and efficiency in crowded environments. We\nshow that for a particular form of interaction function between the autonomy\nand the operator, linear blending is recovered exactly. Additionally, to\nrecover linear blending, unimodal restrictions must be placed on the models\ndescribing the operator and the autonomy. In turn, these restrictions raise\nquestions about the flexibility and applicability of the linear blending\nframework. Additionally, we present an extension of linear blending called\n\"operator biased linear trajectory blending\" (which formalizes some recent\napproaches in linear blending such as~\\cite{dragan-ijrr-2013}) and show that\nnot only is this also a restrictive special case of our probabilistic approach,\nbut more importantly, is statistically unsound, and thus, mathematically,\nunsuitable for implementation. Instead, we suggest a statistically principled\napproach that guarantees data is used in a consistent manner, and show how this\nalternative approach converges to the full probabilistic framework.

Our spatial discretization scheme is based on the three-field\nformulation (u-w-p) and the coupling of a lowest order Raviart-Thomas mixed\nelement [Raviart,Thomas;1977] for fluid variable fields (w, p ) and a nodal\nGalerkin finite element for skeleton variable field (u). These mixed spaces are\nconstructed based on the natural topology of the variables; hence, are\nphysically compatible and able to exactly model the kind of continuity which is\nexpected. The method automatically satisfies the well known LBB (inf-sup)\nstability condition and avoids locking that usually occurs in the numerical\ncomputations in the incompressible limit and very low hydraulic conductivity.\nIn contrast to the majority of approaches, our three-field formulation can\nfully capture dynamic behavior of porous media even in high frequency loading\nphenomena with considerable fluid acceleration such as liquefaction and\nbiomechanics of porous tissues under rapid external loading.

A\nrecent paper \\cite{FIKPPST13} relaxes this definition --- an \\itbf{enhanced\ncover} $u$ of $x$ is a border of $x$ (that is, a proper prefix that is also a\nsuffix) that covers a {\\it maximum} number of positions in $x$ (not necessarily\nall) --- and proposes efficient algorithms for the computation of enhanced\ncovers. These algorithms depend on the prior computation of the \\itbf{border\narray} $\\beta[1..n]$, where $\\beta[i]$ is the length of the longest border of\n$x[1..i]$, $1 \\le i \\le n$. In this paper, we first show how to compute\nenhanced covers using instead the \\itbf{prefix table}: an array $\\pi[1..n]$\nsuch that $\\pi[i]$ is the length of the longest substring of $x$ beginning at\nposition $i$ that matches a prefix of $x$. Unlike the border array, the prefix\ntable is robust: its properties hold also for \\itbf{indeterminate strings} ---\nthat is, strings defined on {\\it subsets} of the alphabet $\\Sigma$ rather than\nindividual elements of $\\Sigma$. Thus, our algorithms, in addition to being\nfaster in practice and more space-efficient than those of \\cite{FIKPPST13},\nallow us to easily extend the computation of enhanced covers to indeterminate\nstrings. Both for regular and indeterminate strings, our algorithms execute in\nexpected linear time. Along the way we establish an important theoretical\nresult: that the expected maximum length of any border of any prefix of a\nregular string $x$ is approximately 1.64 for binary alphabets, less for larger\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 21:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We show how to realise the universal physics of\nthe Neel-VBS transition in a 3D classical loop model (this includes the\ninterference effect that suppresses N\\'eel hedgehogs). We use this model to\nsimulate unprecedentedly large systems (of size $L\\leq 512$). Our results are\ncompatible with a direct continuous transition at which both order parameters\nare critical, and we do not see conventional signs of first-order behaviour.\nHowever, we find that the scaling violations are stronger than previously\nrealised and are incompatible with conventional finite-size scaling over the\nsize range studied, even if allowance is made for a weakly/marginally\nirrelevant scaling variable. In particular, different determinations of the\nanomalous dimensions $\\eta_\\text{VBS}$ and $\\eta_\\text{N\\'eel}$ yield very\ndifferent results. The assumption of conventional finite-size scaling gives\nestimates which drift to negative values at large $L$, in violation of\nunitarity bounds. In contrast, the behaviour of correlators on scales much\nsmaller than $L$ is consistent with large positive anomalous dimensions.\nBarring an unexpected reversal in behaviour at still larger sizes, this implies\nthat the transition, if continuous, must show unconventional finite-size\nscaling, e.g. from a dangerously irrelevant scaling variable. Another\npossibility is an anomalously weak first-order transition. By analysing the\nrenormalisation group flows for the non-compact $CP^{n-1}$ model ($n$-component\nAbelian Higgs model) between two and four dimensions, we give the simplest\nscenario by which an anomalously weak first-order transition can arise without\nfine-tuning of the Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 21:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-30"}

The soft extended emission\nand the simultaneous late re-brightening in both the X-ray and optical\nafterglow lightcurves raise interesting questions regarding its physical\norigin. We show that the broad-band data of GRB 080503 can be well explained\nwithin the framework of the double neutron star merger model, provided that the\nmerger remnant is a rapidly-rotating massive neutron star with an extremely\nhigh magnetic field (i.e. a millisecond magnetar). We show that the late\noptical re-brightening is consistent with the emission from a magnetar-powered\n\"merger-nova\". This adds one more case to the growing sample of merger-novae\nassociated with short GRBs. The soft extended emission and the late X-ray\nexcess emission are well connected through a magnetar dipole spin-down\nluminosity evolution function, suggesting that direct magnetic dissipation is\nthe mechanism to produce these X-rays. The X-ray emission initially leaks from\na hole in the merger ejecta pierced by the short GRB jet. The hole subsequently\ncloses after the magnetar spins down and the magnetic pressure drops below ram\npressure. The X-ray photons are then trapped behind the mergernova ejecta until\nthe ejecta becomes optically thin at a later time. This explains the\nessentially simultaneous re-brightening in both the optical and X-ray\nlightcurves. Within this model, future gravitational wave sources could be\nassociated with a bright X-ray counterpart along with the mergernova, even if\nthe short GRB jet beams away from Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 23:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Assuming\nthat GCs follow galaxy mass-metallicity relations that evolve with redshift,\none can estimate the mean formation epochs of the two GC subpopulations by\nknowing their mean metallicities and the growth in host galaxy mass with\nredshift.

The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the\nnetwork which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The\nbenefits of our approach include generality (we only require posed image sets\nand can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results\non traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end\nnature of our system which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to\ncolor, depth, and texture priors learnt automatically from the training data.\nTo verify our method we show that it can convincingly reproduce known test\nviews from nearby imagery. Additionally we show images rendered from novel\nviewpoints. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep learning to\nthe problem of new view synthesis from sets of real-world, natural imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 23:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Despite its conceptual simplicity it\nentails a wide range of intriguing phenomena, such as the Mollow-triplet\nemission spectrum and coherent photon emission. One fundamental aspect of\nresonance fluorescence, reduced quantum fluctuations in the single photon\nstream from an atom in free space, was predicted more than 30 years ago.\nHowever, the requirement to operate in the weak excitation regime, together\nwith the combination of modest oscillator strength of atoms and low collection\nefficiencies, has continued to cast stringent experimental conditions for the\nobservation of squeezing with atoms. Attempts to circumvent these issues had to\nsacrifice antibunching due to either stimulated forward scattering from atomic\nensembles or multiphoton transitions inside optical cavities. Here, we use an\nartificial atom with a large optical dipole enabling 100-fold improvement of\nthe photon detection rate over the natural atom counterpart and reach the\nnecessary conditions for the observation of quadrature squeezing in single\nresonance-fluorescence photons. Implementing phase-dependent homodyne\nintensity-correlation detection, we demonstrate that the electric field\nquadrature variance of resonance fluorescence is 3\\% below the fundamental\nlimit set by vacuum fluctuations, while the photon statistics remain\nantibunched. The presence of squeezing and antibunching simultaneously is a\nfully nonclassical outcome of the wave-particle duality of photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 00:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Then, we consider the case that the direct link between the source\nand destination is available, and the transmission mode adaptation (TMA)\nprotocol is proposed, where the transmission can be completed by cooperative\nmode and direct mode simultaneously (over different subcarriers). In direct\nmode, when the source transmits signal to the destination, the destination\nreceives the signal as information and the relay node concurrently receives the\nsignal for energy harvesting.

Statistically distinct variability properties are observed for\naccreting and non-accreting cluster members. The accretors exhibit a\nsignificantly higher level of variability than the non-accretors, especially in\nthe UV. The amount of u-band variability correlates statistically with UV\nexcess in disk-bearing objects, which suggests that accretion and star-disk\ninteraction are the main sources of variability. Cool magnetic spots, several\nhundred degrees colder than the photosphere and covering from 5 to 30% of the\nstellar surface, appear to be the leading factor of variability for the\nnon-accreting stars. In contrast, accretion spots, a few thousand degrees\nhotter than the photosphere and covering a few percent of the stellar surface,\nbest reproduce the variability of accreting objects. The color behavior is also\nfound to be different between accreting and non-accreting stars. Typical\nvariability amplitudes for accreting members rapidly increase from r to u,\nwhich indicates a much stronger contrast at short wavelengths; a lower color\ndependence in the amplitudes is instead measured for diskless stars. We find\nthat u-band variability on hour timescales is typically about 10% of the\npeak-to-peak variability on day timescales, while longer term (years)\nvariability is consistent with amplitudes measured over weeks. We conclude that\nfor both accreting and non-accreting stars, the mid-term rotational modulation\nby spots is the leading timescale for a variability of up to several years.

Lower\nsurface densities spawn smaller planetary embryos; to assemble a core of given\nmass, smaller embryos require more mergers between bodies farther apart and\ntherefore exponentially longer formation times.

In\ndisks of low solid surface density, cores of such mass appear only after the\ngas disk has dissipated, and so remain purely rocky.

This may cause the ignorance of subtle but critical network\nchanges that are of investigation values across populations. In this paper, we\npropose to improve the discriminative power of BN models for continuous\nvariables from two different perspectives. This brings two general\ndiscriminative learning frameworks for Gaussian Bayesian networks (GBN). In the\nfirst framework, we employ Fisher kernel to bridge the generative models of GBN\nand the discriminative classifiers of SVMs, and convert the GBN parameter\nlearning to Fisher kernel learning via minimizing a generalization error bound\nof SVMs. In the second framework, we employ the max-margin criterion and build\nit directly upon GBN models to explicitly optimize the classification\nperformance of the GBNs. The advantages and disadvantages of the two frameworks\nare discussed and experimentally compared. Both of them demonstrate strong\npower in learning discriminative parameters of GBNs for neuroimaging based\nbrain network analysis, as well as maintaining reasonable representation\ncapacity.

The fluctuation regime, i.e. the way\nthe ordered phase disappears, is a characteristics of a transition, and\ndetermines the universality class it belongs to. This is valid for thermal\ntransitions, but also for zero temperature Quantum Phase Transitions (QPT).\n  In the case of superconductivity, the order parameter has an amplitude and a\nphase, which can both fluctuate according to well identified scenarios. The\nGinzburg-Landau theory and its extensions describe the fluctuating regime of\nregular metallic superconductors, and the associated dynamics of the pair\namplitude and the phase. When the system is two-dimensional and/or very\ndisordered, phase fluctuations dominate.\n  Here, we address the possibility that a new type of fluctuations occurs in\nsuperconductors with an anomalous dynamics. In particular we show that the\nsuperconducting to metal QPT that occurs upon changing the gate voltage in\ntwo-dimensional electron gases at LAO/STO and LTO/STO interfaces displays\nanomalous scaling properties, which can be explained by density driven\nsuperconducting critical fluctuations.\n  A Finite Size Scaling (FSS) analysis reveals that the product z.nu (nu is the\ncorrelation length exponent and z the dynamical critical one) is z.nu = 3/2. We\nargue that critical superconducting fluctuations acquire an anomalous dynamics\nwith z=3, since they couple to density ones in the vicinity of a spontaneous\nelectronic phase separation, and that nu=1/2 corresponds to the mean-field\nvalue. This approach strongly departs from the conventional z=1 scenario in\ndisordered 2D systems based on long-range Coulomb interactions with dominant\nphase fluctuations. This scenario can explain recent data in LSCO ultra-thin\nfilms, and apply to a whole class of two-dimensional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 06:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Extracting the compound nucleus formation\nprobability is crucial to predict superheavy-element formation cross-sections.\nIt requires a good knowledge of the fragment angular distribution which itself\ndepends on quantities such as moments of inertia and excitation energies which\nhave so far been somewhat arbitrary for the quasifission contribution.\n  Methods: We investigate the evolution of the nuclear density in\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations leading to quasifission.

Our tests for entanglement fully utilise the\nsymmetrisation principle and super-selection rules for bosonic massive\nparticles. These papers provides detailed arguments necessary for the\nconclusions of a recent paper which presented results for rigorously\ndemonstrating the entanglement of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).\n  In the first paper (I), we discuss the meaning of entanglement for systems of\nidentical particles. For such systems, the relevant quantum density operators\nmust satisfy the symmetrisation principle and global and local super-selection\nrules prohibiting states in which there are coherences between differing\nparticle numbers.

This\nbrain-wide, genome-wide data set has triggered a renaissance in neuroanatomy.\nIts voxelized version (with cubic voxels of side 200 microns) can be analyzed\non a desktop computer using MATLAB. On the other hand, brain cells exhibit a\ngreat phenotypic diversity (in terms of size, shape and electrophysiological\nactivity), which has inspired the names of some well-studied cell types, such\nas granule cells and medium spiny neurons. However, no exhaustive taxonomy of\nbrain cells is available. A genetic classification of brain cells is under way,\nand some cell types have been characterized by their transcriptome profiles.\nHowever, given a cell type characterized by its transcriptome, it is not clear\nwhere else in the brain similar cells can be found. The ABA can been used to\nsolve this region-specificity problem in a data-driven way: rewriting the\nbrain-wide expression profiles of all genes in the atlas as a sum of\ncell-type-specific transcriptome profiles is equivalent to solving a quadratic\noptimization problem at each voxel in the brain. However, the estimated\nbrain-wide densities of 64 cell types published recently were based on one\nseries of co-registered coronal in situ hybridization (ISH) images per gene,\nwhereas the online ABA contains several image series per gene, including\nsagittal ones. In the presented work, we simulate the variability of cell-type\ndensities in a Monte Carlo way by repeatedly drawing a random image series for\neach gene and solving optimization problems. This yields error bars on the\nregion-specificity of cell types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 10:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Because they are based on a straightforward formalism, they are used\nin many scientific fields from computer science to historical sciences. In this\npaper, we give an introduction to some methods relying on graphs for learning.\nThis includes both unsupervised and supervised methods. Unsupervised learning\nalgorithms usually aim at visualising graphs in latent spaces and/or clustering\nthe nodes. Both focus on extracting knowledge from graph topologies. While most\nexisting techniques are only applicable to static graphs, where edges do not\nevolve through time, recent developments have shown that they could be extended\nto deal with evolving networks. In a supervised context, one generally aims at\ninferring labels or numerical values attached to nodes using both the graph\nand, when they are available, node characteristics. Balancing the two sources\nof information can be challenging, especially as they can disagree locally or\nglobally. In both contexts, supervised and un-supervised, data can be\nrelational (augmented with one or several global graphs) as described above, or\ngraph valued. In this latter case, each object of interest is given as a full\ngraph (possibly completed by other characteristics). In this context, natural\ntasks include graph clustering (as in producing clusters of graphs rather than\nclusters of nodes in a single graph), graph classification, etc. 1 Real\nnetworks One of the first practical studies on graphs can be dated back to the\noriginal work of Moreno [51] in the 30s. Since then, there has been a growing\ninterest in graph analysis associated with strong developments in the modelling\nand the processing of these data. Graphs are now used in many scientific\nfields. In Biology [54, 2, 7], for instance, metabolic networks can describe\npathways of biochemical reactions [41], while in social sciences networks are\nused to represent relation ties between actors [66, 56, 36, 34]. Other examples\ninclude powergrids [71] and the web [75]. Recently, networks have also been\nconsidered in other areas such as geography [22] and history [59, 39]. In\nmachine learning, networks are seen as powerful tools to model problems in\norder to extract information from data and for prediction purposes. This is the\nobject of this paper. For more complete surveys, we refer to [28, 62, 49, 45].\nIn this section, we introduce notations and highlight properties shared by most\nreal networks. In Section 2, we then consider methods aiming at extracting\ninformation from a unique network. We will particularly focus on clustering\nmethods where the goal is to find clusters of vertices.

This allows reaching much higher cooling efficiencies\nthan with single quantum wells. From band-diagram calculations along with an\nexperimentally realistic level scheme we calculate the cooling efficiency and\ncooling yield of different devices with coupled quantum wells embedded in a\nsuspended nanomembrane. The dimension and composition of the quantum wells\nallow optimizing either of these quantities, which cannot, however, be\nmaximized simultaneously. Quantum-well structures with electrical control allow\ntunability of carrier lifetimes and energy levels so that the cooling\nefficiency can be optimized over time as the thermal population decreases due\nto the cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 12:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 10:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

If a community of\ninteracting species is at a stable equilibrium point then it is able to\nwithstand small perturbations to component species' abundances without\nsuffering adverse effects. In ecology, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at an\nequilibrium point is known as the community matrix, which describes the\npopulation dynamics of interacting species. A system's asymptotic short- and\nlong-term behaviour can be determined from eigenvalues derived from the\ncommunity matrix. Here we use results from the theory of pseudospectra to\ndescribe intermediate, transient dynamics. We first recover the established\nresult that the transition from stable to unstable dynamics includes a region\nof `transient instability', where the effect of a small perturbation to\nspecies' abundances---to the population vector---is amplified before ultimately\ndecaying. Then we show that the shift from stability to transient instability\ncan be affected by uncertainty in, or small changes to, entries in the\ncommunity matrix, and determine lower and upper bounds to the maximum amplitude\nof perturbations to the population vector. Of five different types of community\nmatrix, we find that amplification is least severe when predator-prey\ninteractions dominate. This analysis is relevant to other systems whose\ndynamics can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian matrix. Our results will\nlead to improved understanding of how multiple perturbations to a complex\nsystem may irrecoverably break stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 12:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 13:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 14:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Communication services include Internet services like\nvoice services, chat service, and web 2.0 technologies (wikis, blogs, etc), but\nother usage areas like home energy management and eMobility are will be\nincreasingly tackled. Such communication services typically authenticate\nparticipants. For this identities of some kind are used to identify the\ncommunication peer to the user of a service or to the service itself. Calling\nline identification used in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) used for\nVoice over IP (VoIP) is just one example. Authentication and identification of\neCar users for accounting during charging of the eCar is another example. Also,\nfurther mechanisms rely on identities, e.g., whitelists defining allowed\ncommunication peers. Trusted identities prevent identity spoofing, hence are a\nbasic building block for the protection of communication. However, providing\ntrusted identities in a practical way is still a difficult problem and too\noften application specific identities are used, making identity handling a\nhassle. Nowadays, many countries introduced electronic identity cards, e.g.,\nthe German \"Elektronischer Personalausweis\" (ePA). As many German citizens will\npossess an ePA soon, it can be used as security token to provide trusted\nidentities. Especially new usage areas (like eMobility) should from the start\nbe based on the ubiquitous availability of trusted identities. This paper\ndescribes how identity cards can be integrated within three domains: home\nenergy management, vehicle-2-grid communication, and SIP-based voice over IP\ntelephony. In all three domains, identity cards are used to reliably identify\nusers and authenticate participants.

Motivated by this problem and by recent advances in diagrammatic\nMonte Carlo methods, we find a new exact representation of the partition\nfunction of pure lattice gauge theory that contains no link variables. This\napproach can be easily extended to include staggered fermions, and results in a\ndiagrammatic representation of fermionic states as arrangements of monomers,\ndimers, and fermionic loops saturating the spacetime lattice. Our\nrepresentations are exact for any value of the lattice coupling, and extend\nprevious representations that are only valid in the strong coupling limit and\nat $O(\\beta)$. As a concrete example, we construct a monomer-dimer-loop\nrepresentation of compact lattice QED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 14:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We use our results to constrain the variability of\nthe optical properties of big grains in the diffuse ISM, as published by the\nPlanck collaboration.\n  We use two different techniques to compare the predictions of dust models to\ndata from the Planck HFI, IRAS and SDSS surveys. First, we fit the far-infrared\nemission spectrum to recover the dust extinction and the intensity of the\ninterstellar radiation field (ISRF). Second, we infer the ISRF intensity from\nthe total power emitted by dust per unit extinction, and then predict the\nemission spectrum. In both cases, we test the ability of the models to\nreproduce dust emission and extinction at the same time.\n  We identify two issues. Not all models can reproduce the average dust\nemission per unit extinction: there are differences of up to a factor $\\sim2$\nbetween models, and the best accord between model and observation is obtained\nwith the more emissive grains derived from recent laboratory data on silicates\nand amorphous carbons. All models fail to reproduce the variations in the\nemission per unit extinction if the only variable parameter is the ISRF\nintensity: this confirms that the optical properties of dust are indeed\nvariable in the diffuse ISM.\n  Diffuse ISM observations are consistent with a scenario where both ISRF\nintensity and dust optical properties vary. The ratio of the far-infrared\nopacity to the $V$ band extinction cross-section presents variations of the\norder of $\\sim20\\%$ ($40-50\\%$ in extreme cases), while ISRF intensity varies\nby $\\sim30\\%$ ($\\sim60\\%$ in extreme cases). This must be accounted for in\nfuture modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 14:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Recent\ndiscoveries of circumbinary planets by the Kepler space telescope has shown\nthat some of these planets reside close to the dynamical stability limit where\nit is very difficult to form planets in situ. For binary systems with nearly\ncircular orbits, such as Kepler-38, the observed proximity of planetary orbits\nto the stability limit can be understood by an evolutionary process in which\nplanets form farther out in the disk and migrate inward to their observed\nposition. The Kepler-34 system has a high orbital eccentricity of 0.52. Here,\nwe analyse evolutionary scenarios for the planet observed around this system\nusing two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations.\n  The highly eccentric binary opens a wide inner hole in the disk which is also\neccentric, and displays a slow prograde precession. As a result of the large,\neccentric inner gap, an embedded planet settles in a final equilibrium position\nthat lies beyond the observed location of Kepler-34 b, but has the correct\neccentricity. In this configuration the planetary orbit is aligned with the\ndisk in a state of apsidal corotation.To account for the closer orbit of\nKepler-34 b to the central binary, we considered a two-planet scenario and\nexamined the evolution of the system through joint inward migration and capture\ninto mean-motion resonances. When the inner planet orbits inside the gap of the\ndisk, planet-planet scattering ensues. While often one object is thrown into a\nlarge, highly eccentric orbit, at times the system is left with a planet close\nto the observed orbit, suggesting that Kepler 34 might have had two\ncircumbinary planets where one might have been scattered out of the system or\ninto an orbit where it did not transit the central binary during the operation\nof Kepler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 14:27:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The system's energy levels\nare grouped into doublets which consist of scattering states and Schrodinger\nCats with even ( e ) and odd ( o ) parities in the $ U(1) $ and quantum\ntunneling (QT) regime respectively. In the QT regime, by the WKB method, we\nfind the emergencies of bound states one by one as the interaction strength\nincreases, then investigate a new class of quantum tunneling processes through\nthe instantons between the two bound states in the compact photon phase.

Internships are decided upon by a\nlottery, which is known as \"The Internship Lottery\". In 2014 we redesigned the\nlottery, replacing it with a more efficient one. The new method is based on\ncalculating a tentative lottery, in which each student has some probability of\ngetting to each hospital. Then a computer program \"trades\" between the\nstudents, where trade is performed only if it is beneficial to both sides. This\ntrade creates surplus, which translates to more students getting one of their\ntop choices. The average student improved his place by $0.91$ seats. The new\nmethod can improve the welfare of medical graduates, by giving them more\nprobability to get to one of their top choices. It can be applied in internship\nmarkets in other countries as well.\n  This thesis presents the market, the redesign process and the new mechanism\nwhich is now in use. There are two main lessons that we have learned from this\nmarket. The first is the \"Do No Harm\" principle, which states that (almost) all\nparticipants should prefer the new mechanism to the old one. The second is that\nnew approaches need to be used when dealing with two-body problems in object\nassignment. We focus on the second lesson, and study two-body problems in the\ncontext of the assignment problem. We show that decomposing stochastic\nassignment matrices to deterministic allocations is NP-hard in the presence of\ncouples, and present a polynomial time algorithm with the optimal worst case\nguarantee. We also study the performance of our algorithm on real-world and on\nsimulated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 11:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-09"}

Both\nmethods are based on the same PDE framework, defined in the coupled space of\npositions and orientations, associated with a stochastic process describing the\nenhancement of elongated structures while preserving crossing structures. In\nthe first method we use the enhancement PDE for contextual regularization of a\nfiber orientation distribution (FOD) that is obtained on individual voxels from\nhigh angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data via constrained\nspherical deconvolution (CSD). Thereby we improve the FOD as input for\nsubsequent tractography. Secondly, we introduce the fiber to bundle coherence\n(FBC), a measure for quantification of fiber alignment. The FBC is computed\nfrom a tractography result using the same PDE framework and provides a\ncriterion for removing the spurious fibers. We validate the proposed\ncombination of CSD and enhancement on phantom data and on human data, acquired\nwith different scanning protocols. On the phantom data we find that PDE\nenhancements improve both local metrics and global metrics of tractography\nresults, compared to CSD without enhancements. On the human data we show that\nthe enhancements allow for a better reconstruction of crossing fiber bundles\nand they reduce the variability of the tractography output with respect to the\nacquisition parameters. Finally, we show that both the enhancement of the FODs\nand the use of the FBC measure on the tractography improve the stability with\nrespect to different stochastic realizations of probabilistic tractography.\nThis is shown in a clinical application: the reconstruction of the optic\nradiation for epilepsy surgery planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Consequently, the dissertation is\nstructured in two sections. In the first one, a novel proposal is suggested\nregarding to using Cherenkov telescopes as ground-station receivers. A\nfeasibility study addresses the posibility of using the technology developed\nfor the gamma-ray telescopes that will make up the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA) in the implementation of a new kind of ground station. Among the main\nadvantages that these telescopes provide are the much larger apertures needed\nto overcome the power limitation that ground-based gamma-ray astronomy and\ndeep-space optical communication both have. Also, the large number of big\ntelescopes that will be built for CTA will make it possible to reduce unitary\ncosts by economy-scale production. The second section of the thesis is framed\nin the field of free-space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which has become a\nnew paradigm in the discipline of information security. This technique offers a\ntheoretically-secure way to communicate over an insecure channel since the\npresence of an eventual eavesdropper can be detected. The main challenge of\nFree-space QKD is the need to operate both under strong atmospheric turbulence\nand daylight background noise. To mitigate these effects, a trade-off is\nusually required when designing the receiver's optics, since a narrow\nfield-of-view improves background noise rejection, but increases\nturbulence-related losses and a wide field-of-view produces the opposite\neffect. A correction system for atmospheric turbulence is proposed to overcome\nboth limitations at the same time, and different strategies are analyzed and\nexperimented to carry out the implementation and integration within the QKD\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 21:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 04:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

This special fluid, endowed with\nviscosity allows to describe emergence of the flat orbital speeds of spiral\ngalaxies. The viscosity averaged on time vanishes, but its variance is\ndifferent from zero. It is a function fluctuating about zero. Therefore the\nflattening is the result of the energy exchange of the torque with zero-point\nfluctuations of the physical vacuum on the ultra-low frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 10:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

Of the many\nmaximization techniques that have been used in this context, some of the most\nconceptually attractive are the spectral methods, which are based on the\neigenvectors of the modularity matrix. Spectral algorithms have, however, been\nlimited by and large to the division of networks into only two or three\ncommunities, with divisions into more than three being achieved by repeated\ntwo-way division. Here we present a spectral algorithm that can directly divide\na network into any number of communities. The algorithm makes use of a mapping\nfrom modularity maximization to a vector partitioning problem, combined with a\nfast heuristic for vector partitioning. We compare the performance of this\nspectral algorithm with previous approaches and find it to give superior\nresults, particularly in cases where community sizes are unbalanced. We also\ngive demonstrative applications of the algorithm to two real-world networks and\nfind that it produces results in good agreement with expectations for the\nnetworks studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 20:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}
