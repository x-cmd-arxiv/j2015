This problem is that of allocating the data from a\nset of source spatial units to a set of target spatial units. A particular case\nof that problem is the re-allocation to a single target partition which is a\nregular grid. At the European level for example, the EU directive 'INSPIRE', or\nINfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation, encourages the states to provide\nsocio-economic data on a common grid to facilitate economic studies across\nstates. In the literature, there are three main types of such techniques:\nproportional weighting schemes, smoothing techniques and regression based\ninterpolation. We propose a stochastic model based on Poisson point patterns to\nstudy the statistical accuracy of these techniques for regular grid targets in\nthe case of count data. The error depends on the nature of the target variable\nand its correlation with the auxiliary variable.

This method estimates the black hole mass using\nthe width of the narrow core of the neutral FeKa emission line in X-rays and\nthe distance of its emitting region from the black hole based on the isotropic\nluminosity indicator via the luminosity scaling relation. We collect the line\nwidth data of the neutral FeKa line core for seven type-1 AGNs and seven type-2\nAGNs obtained by the Chandra HETGS. Assuming the virial relation between the\nlocations and the velocity widths of the neutral FeKa line core and the broad\nHb emission line, the luminosity scaling relation of the neutral FeKa line core\nemitting region is estimated. We find that the FWHM of the neutral FeKa line\ncore falls between that of the broad Balmer emission lines and the\ncorresponding value at the dust reverberation radius for most of the type-1\nAGNs and for all of the type-2 AGNs. This suggests that significant fraction of\nphotons of the neutral FeKa line core originates between the outer BLR and the\ninner dust torus in most cases. The black hole mass M_FeKa estimated with this\nmethod is then compared with other black hole mass estimates, such as the broad\nemission-line reverberation mass M_rev for the type-1 AGNs, the mass M_H2O\nbased on the H2O maser and the single-epoch mass estimate M_pol based on the\npolarized broad Balmer lines for the type-2 AGNs. We find that M_FeKa is\nconsistent with M_rev for the most of the type-1 AGNs and with M_pol for all of\nthe type-2 AGNs. We also find that M_FeKa is correlated well with M_H2O for the\ntype-2 AGNs. These results suggest that M_FeKa is a potential indicator of the\nblack hole mass especially for obscured AGNs. In contrast, M_FeKa for which the\nsame virial factor as for M_rev and M_pol is adopted is systematically larger\nthan M_H2O by about a factor of about 5.

Building upon one-time pad, secrecy coding, and broadcasting\nschemes, achievable rate regions are investigated, and the capacity region for\nspecial cases of either a weak or strong eavesdropper (compared to both\nlegitimate receivers) are characterized. Interestingly, the capacity region for\nthe former corresponds to a line and the latter corresponds to a square with\nmissing corners; a phenomenon occurring due to the coupling between user's\nrates. Moreover, the individual secrecy capacity region is also fully\ncharacterized for the case where the eavesdropper's channel is deterministic.\nIn addition to discrete memoryless setup, Gaussian scenarios are studied.

If both\ncomponents of G-S additionally have at least 3 vertices and $k\\ge 4$, then the\ngraph has independence number 2. On the other hand, since every 2-connected odd\ngraph with independence number 2 is equimatchable, we get the following result.\nFor any $k\\ge 4$ let G be a k-connected odd graph with at least 2k+3 vertices\nand a k-cut S such that G-S has two components with at least 3 vertices. Then G\nhas independence number 2 if and only if it is equimatchable and\nfactor-critical. Furthermore, we show that a 2-connected odd graph G with at\nleast 4 vertices has independence number at most 2 if and only if G is\nequimatchable and factor-critical and G+e is equimatchable for every edge of\nthe complement of G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 19:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-30"}

The winds are often found to be structured and variable, but can\nalso display periodic or quasi-periodic behavior in a variety of wind\ndiagnostics. The regular variations observed in putatively single stars,\nespecially in UV wind lines, have often been attributed to corotating\ninteraction regions (CIRs) like those seen in the solar wind. We present light\ncurves for variable polarization from winds with CIR structures. We develop a\nmodel for a time-independent CIR based on a kinematical description. Assuming\noptically thin electron scattering, we explore the range of polarimetric light\ncurves that result as the curvature, latitude, and number of CIRs are varied.\nWe find that a diverse array of variable polarizations result from an\nexploration of cases. The net polarization from an unresolved source is\nweighted more toward the inner radii of the wind. Given that most massive stars\nhave relatively fast winds compared to their rotation speeds, CIRs tend to be\nconical at inner radii, transitioning to a spiral shape at a few to several\nstellar radii in the wind. Winds with a single CIR structure lead to easily\nidentifiable polarization signatures. By contrast allowing for multiple CIRs,\nall emerging from a range of azimuth and latitude positions at the star, can\nyield complex polarimetric behavior. Although our model is based on some\nsimplifying assumptions, it produces qualitative behavior that we expect to be\nrobust, and this has allowed us to explore a wide range of CIR configurations\nthat will prove useful for interpreting polarimetric data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 19:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In these\nstrategies, periodic adjustments are made in the airspeed and/or heading angle\ncommand, in level flights, for the UAV to minimize a projected power\nrequirement. In this study, UAV dynamics are described by a three-dimensional\ndynamic point-mass model. A stochastic wind field model has been used to\nanalyze the effect of the wind in the process. Onboard closed-loop trajectory\ntracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the\nmethod of feedback linearization. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies\nin enhancing UAV flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which\nthe UAV would follow the optimal airspeed command in a steady level flight\nunder zero wind conditions. A performance measure is defined as the average\npower consumption with respect to no wind case. Different scenarios have been\nevaluated both over a specified time interval and over different initial\nheading angles of the UAV. A relative benefit criterion is then defined as the\npercentage improvement in the performance measure of a proposed strategy over\nthat of the reference strategy.

Specifically, SNe with small projected offsets\nhave large line-of-sight velocity shifts as determined by nebular lines, while\nthose with large projected offsets have no significant velocity shifts.\nTherefore, the velocity shifts must not be primarily the result of the SN\nexplosion. There is an excess of SNe with blueshifted velocity shifts within\ntwo isophotal radii (5/6 SNe), indicating that the SNe are moving away from\ntheir host galaxies and redshifted SNe on the far sides of their galaxies are\nselectively missed in SN surveys. Additionally, nearly every Ca-rich SN is\nhosted by a galaxy with indications of a recent merger and/or is in a dense\nenvironment.

Their existence likely\nrequires more exotic evolutionary channels, including stellar mergers and\ncommon-envelope binary interactions. I carried out a snapshot imaging search\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for PNe in bright Local Group GCs outside\nthe Milky Way. I used a filter covering the 5007 A nebular emission line of [O\nIII], and another one in the nearby continuum, to image 66 GCs. Inclusion of\narchival HST frames brought the total number of extragalactic GCs imaged at\n5007 A to 75, whose total luminosity slightly exceeds that of the entire\nGalactic GC system. I found no convincing PNe in these clusters, aside from one\nPN in a young M31 cluster misclassified as a GC, and two PNe at such large\nangular separations from an M31 GC that membership is doubtful. In a\nground-based spectroscopic survey of 274 old GCs in M31, Jacoby et al. (2013)\nfound three candidate PNe. My HST images of one of them suggest that the [O\nIII] emission actually arises from ambient interstellar medium rather than a\nPN; for the other two candidates, there are broad-band archival UV HST images\nthat show bright, blue point sources that are probably the PNe. In a literature\nsearch, I also identified five further PN candidates lying near old GCs in M31,\nfor which follow-up observations are necessary to confirm their membership.

Up-to-date work summon several other\npossibilities that together seem to better explain this component of our\nGalaxy. All these processes must affect differently in distinct types of\ngalaxies, but the contribution of each one has not been straightforward to\nquantify. In this work, we present a first comprehensive study of the effect of\nthe spiral arms in the formation of thick disks, as going from early to late\ntype disk galaxies, in an attempt to characterize and quantify this specific\nmechanism in galactic potentials. To this purpose, we perform numerical\nsimulations of test particles in a three-dimensional spiral galaxy potential of\nnormal spiral galaxies (from early to late types). By varying the parameters of\nthe spiral arms we found that the vertical heating of the stellar disk becomes\nvery important in some cases, and strongly depends on the galaxy morphology,\npitch angle, arms mass and its pattern speed. The later the galaxy type, the\nlarger is the effect on the disk heating. This study shows that the physical\nmechanism causing the vertical heating is different from simple resonant\nexcitation. The spiral pattern induce chaotic behavior not linked necessarily\nto resonances but to direct scattering of disk stars, which leads to an\nincrease of the velocity dispersion. We applied this study to the specific\nexample of the Milky Way Galaxy, for which we have also added an experiment\nthat includes the Galactic bar. From this study we deduce that the effect of\nspiral arms of a Milky-Way-like potential, on the dynamical vertical heating of\nthe disk is negligible, unlike later galactic potentials for disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 02:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-06"}

The cosmic verification of the Galileo\nEquivalence Principle for photons/electromagnetic wave packets (Universality of\nPropagation in spacetime independent of photon energy and polarization, i.e.\nnonbirefringence) constrains the spacetime constitutive tensor to high\nprecision to a core metric form with an axion degree and a dilaton degree of\nfreedom. Hughes-Drever-type experiments then constrain this core metric to\nagree with the matter metric. Thus comes the metric with axion and dilation.

This model belongs to the class of gradient type systems for which the\nfree energy can only decrease in time. It reveals a behavior typical for\nsubcritical bifurcations: below the mirror instability threshold, all localized\nstationary structures are unstable, while above threshold, the system displays\na blow-up behavior. It is shown that taking the electrons into account\n(non-zero temperature) does not change the structure of the asymptotic model.\nFor bi-Maxwellian distribution functions for both electrons and ions, the model\npredicts the formation of magnetic holes. The second part contains original\nresults concerning two-dimensional steady mirror structures which can form in\nthe saturated regime. Based on Grad-Shafranov-like equations, a gyrotropic\nplasma, where the pressures in the static regime are only functions of the\namplitude of the local magnetic field, is shown to be amenable to a variational\nprinciple with a free energy density given by the parallel tension. This\napproach is used to demonstrate that small-amplitude static holes constructed\nslightly below the mirror instability threshold identify with lump solitons of\nKPII equation and turn out to be unstable. It is also shown that regularizing\neffects such as finite Larmor radius corrections cannot be ignored in the\ndescription of large-amplitude mirror structures. Using the gradient method,\nwhich is based on a variational principle for anisotropic MHD taking into\naccount ion finite Larmor radius effects, we found both one-dimensional\nmagnetic structures in the form of stripes and two-dimensional bubbles when the\nmagnetic field component transverse to the plane is increased.

A resonant orbit is defined as a geodesic for which the longitudinal\nand radial orbital frequencies are commensurate. Our analysis is based on\nexpressing the resonance condition in its most symmetric form using Carlson's\nintegrals. We provide a number of concise formulae for the dependence of\nresonances on the system parameters. Resonant effects may be observable during\nthe in-spiral of a compact object into a super-massive black hole. When the\nslowly evolving orbital frequencies pass through a series of low-order\nresonances, rapid changes in the orbital parameters could produce measurable\nphase shifts in the emitted gravitational radiation (GW). Resonant orbits may\nalso capture dust leading to electromagnetic emission. The KAM theorem\nindicates that, low order resonant orbits demarcate the regions where the onset\nof chaos could occur around a perturbed black-hole. We find that the 1/2 and\n2/3 resonances occur at ~4 and 5.4 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) from the event\nhorizon. For compact object in-spirals around super-massive black holes, this\nregion lies within the sensitivity band of space-based GW detectors. For Sgr\nA*, length scales of ~41 and 55 microarcseconds and timescales of 50 and 79 min\nrespectively should be associated with resonant effects, if Sgr A* is\nnon-spinning. Spin decreases these values by up to ~32% and ~28%. These\nlength-scales are potentially resolvable with VLBI measurements. We find that\nall low-order resonances are localized to the strong field region r < 50 Rs.\nThis fact guarantees the validity of using approximations based on averaging to\nmodel the frequency evolution of a test object in region 50 Rs <r <1000 Rs. The\nsystematic determination of the multipole moments of the central object by\nobserving the orbit of a pulsar, free of chaotic effects, is thus possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 11:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

Filament-like condensations at\nthe edge of the cloud can be traced via the emission of the main cooling lines,\noffering a great opportunity to study the link between the morphology and\nenergetics of these regions. Aims: We study the spatial variation of the\nfar-infrared fine-structure lines of [C II] (158 um) and [O I] (63 and 145 um).\nThese lines trace the local gas conditions across the PDR. Methods: We used\nobservations from the Herschel/PACS instrument to map the spatial distribution\nof these fine-structure lines. The observed region covers a square area of\nabout 110\" x 110\" with an angular resolution that varies from 4\" to 11\". We\ncompared this emission with ground-based and Spitzer observations of H2 lines,\nHerschel/SPIRE observations of CO lines, and Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 um images that\ntrace the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Results: The [C II]\n(158 um) and [O I] (63 and 145 um) lines arise from the warm cloud surface\nwhere the PDR is located and the gas is warm, cooling the region. We find that\nalthough the relative contribution to the cooling budget over the observed\nregion is dominated by [O I]63 um (>30%), H2 contributes significantly in the\nPDR (35%), as does [C II]158 um outside the PDR (30%). Other species contribute\nlittle to the cooling ([O I]145 um 9%, and CO 4%). The [O I] maps resolve these\ncondensations into two structures and show that the peak of [O I] is slightly\ndisplaced from the molecular H2 emission. The size of these structures is about\n8\" (0.015 pc) and in surface cover about 9% of the PDR emission. Finally, we\ndid not detect emission from [N II]122 um, suggesting that the cavity is mostly\nfilled with non-ionised gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 12:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

Old\nmetal-poor stars carry the signature of the astrophysical source(s). Among the\nelements dominantly made by the r-process, europium (Eu) is relatively easy to\nobserve. In this work we simulate the evolution of europium in our galaxy with\nthe inhomogeneous chemical evolution model 'ICE', and compare our results with\nspectroscopic observations. We test the most important parameters affecting the\nchemical evolution of Eu: (a) for neutron star mergers the coalescence time\nscale of the merger ($t_{\\mathrm{coal}}$) and the probability to experience a\nneutron star merger event after two supernova explosions occurred and formed a\ndouble neutron star system ($P_{\\mathrm{NSM}}$) and (b) for the sub-class of\nmagneto-rotationally driven supernovae (\"Jet-SNe\"), their occurrence rate\ncompared to standard supernovae ($P_{\\mathrm{Jet-SN}}$).

While neutron star mergers alone seem to set in at too high\nmetallicities, Jet-SNe provide a cure for this deficiency at low metallicities.\nFurthermore, we confirm that local inhomogeneities can explain the observed\nlarge spread in the europium abundances at low metallicities.

The opposite effect of polar\nregions rotating faster than equatorial ones (termed as antisolar DR) has only\nbeen observed in a few stars, although there is evidence from theoretical\ndynamo models. We present a new method to detect the sign of DR (i.e.\nsolar-like or antisolar DR) by analyzing long-term high-precision light curves\nwith the Lomb-Scargle periodogram.We compute the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and\nidentify a set of significant periods $P_k$, which we associate with active\nregions located at different latitudes on the the stellar surface. If\ndetectable, the first harmonics ($P_k'$) of these periods were identified to\ncompute their peak-height-ratios $r_k:=h(P_k')/h(P_k)$. Spots rotating at lower\nlatitudes generate less sine-shaped light curves, which requires additional\npower in the harmonics, and results in larger ratios $r_k$. Comparing different\nratios $r_k$ and the associated periods $P_k$ yields information about the spot\nlatitudes, and reveals the sign of DR. We tested our method on different sets\nof synthetic light curves all exhibiting solar-like DR. The number of cases\nwhere our method detects antisolar DR is the false-positive rate of our method.\nDepending on the set of light curves, the noise level, the required minimum\npeak separation, and the presence or absence of spot evolution, our method\nfails to detect the correct sign in at most 20%.

Following our previous\npaper (Efthymiopoulos, Contopoulos, Katsanikas $2014$) we introduce new\nvariables $(\\xi, \\eta)$ in which the product $\\xi\\eta=c$ (constant) gives\nhyperbolic invariant curves. These hyperbolae are mapped by a canonical\ntransformation $\\Phi$ to the plane $(x,y)$, giving \"Moser invariant curves\". We\nfind that the series $\\Phi$ are convergent up to a maximum value of\n$c=c_{max}$. We give estimates of the errors due to the finite truncation of\nthe series and discuss how these errors affect the applicability of analytical\ncomputations. For values of the basic parameter $\\kappa$ of the H\\'{e}non map\nsmaller than a critical value, there is an island of stability, around a stable\nperiodic orbit $S$, containing KAM invariant curves. The Moser curves for $c\n\\leq 0.32$ are completely outside the last KAM curve around $S$, the curves\nwith $0.32<c<0.41$ intersect the last KAM curve and the curves with $0.41\\leq\nc< c_{max} \\simeq 0.49$ are completely inside the last KAM curve. All orbits in\nthe chaotic region around the periodic orbit $(x=y=0)$, although they seem\nrandom, belong to Moser invariant curves, which, therefore define a \"structure\nof chaos\". Orbits starting close and outside the last KAM curve remain close to\nit for a stickiness time that is estimated analytically using the series\n$\\Phi$. We finally calculate the periodic orbits that accumulate close to the\nhomoclinic points, i.e. the points of intersection of the asymptotic curves\nfrom $x=y=0$, exploiting a method based on the self-intersections of the\ninvariant Moser curves. We find that all the computed periodic orbits are\ngenerated from the stable orbit $S$ for smaller values of the H\\'{e}non\nparameter $\\kappa$, i.e. they are all regular periodic orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 10:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The surface tension of the cavity prevents the\nelectron from flying apart due to Coulomb repulsion. A similar model was\nintroduced by Dirac in 1962, though without reference to Higgs condensate. In\nhis model, the equilibrium radius of the electron equals the classical electron\nradius, $R^{c}_{e} \\simeq 2.8 \\times 10^{-13}$ cm, that is about $10^{5}$ times\nthe radius consistent with experimental data. To address this problem, we\nreplace the Coulomb term in the total energy of the electron by fermion\nself-energy involving screening by electrons occupying the negative energies of\nthe vacuum. The tension of the cavity is obtained using the approximation\n$\\xi_{0} \\ll R_{0}$ where $\\xi_{0}$ is the coherence length.

Starting instead from a\nsymmetric-antisymmetric reformulation we first show SSIM to be a contrast or\nvisibility function in the classic sense. Furthermore, the previously enigmatic\nstructural covariance is revealed to be the difference of variances. The second\nstep, eliminating the intrinsic quadratic nature of SSIM, allows a near linear\ncorrelation with human observer scores, and without invoking the usual, but\narbitrary, sigmoid model fitting. We conclude that SSIM can be re-interpreted\nin terms of perceptual masking: it is essentially equivalent to a normalised\nerror or noise visibility function (NVF), and, furthermore, the NVF alone\nexplains it success in modelling perceptual image quality. We use the term\nDissimilarity Quotient (DQ) for the specifically anti/symmetric SSIM derived\nNVF. It seems that IQA researchers may now have two choices: 1) Continue to use\nthe complex SSIM formula, but noting that SSIM only works coincidentally since\nthe covariance term is actually the mean square error (MSE) in disguise. 2) Use\nthe simplest of all perceptually-masked image quality metrics, namely NVF or\nDQ.
