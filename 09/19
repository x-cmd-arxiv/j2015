The electrical\nresistance is set by geometrical factors and the resistivity, which is a\nmicroscopic property of the solid. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in\ncontrast, is determined by geometrical factors, boundary scattering and the\nviscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal\ncollisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids, brought into\nfocus by the advent of new calculational techniques, has been whether the\nviscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable role in determining the\nresistance. At first sight this seems unlikely, because in almost all known\nmaterials the rate of momentum-relaxing collisions dominates that of the\nmomentum-conserving ones that give the viscous term. Here, we show this is not\nalways the case. We report experimental evidence that the resistance of\nrestricted channels of the ultra-pure two-dimensional metal PdCoO$_2$ has a\nlarge viscous contribution.

In these\ngraphs, the vertices correspond to the small areas of the gray matter, and two\nvertices are connected by an edge, if a diffusion-MRI based workflow finds\nconnections between those areas. One main question of the field is discovering\nthe directions of the edges. In a previous work we have reported the\nconstruction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server\nhttp://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome\nProject of the NIH. After the server had been published, we recognized a\nsurprising and unforeseen property of it: The server can generate the\nbraingraph of connections that are present in at least $k$ graphs out of the\n418, for any value of $k=1,2,...,418$. When the value of $k$ is changed from\n$k=418$ through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more\nand more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is\nthat the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing\ntree. We hypothesize that this movement of the slider in the webserver may copy\nthe development of the connections in the human brain in the following sense:\nthe connections that are present in all subjects are the oldest ones, and those\nthat are present in a decreasing fraction of subjects are gradually the newer\nconnections in the individual brain development. An animation on the phenomenon\nis available at https://youtu.be/EnWwIf_HNjw. Based on this hypothesis, we can\nassign directions to the edges of the connectome as follows: Let $G_i$ denote\nthe consensus connectome where each edge is present in at least $i$ graphs.\nSuppose that vertex $v$ is isolated in $G_{k+1}$, and becomes connected to a\nvertex $u$ in $G_k$, where $u$ was connected to other vertices already in\n$G_{k+1}$. Then we direct this $(v,u)$ edge from $v$ to $u$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 17:03:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 15:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2016 11:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

The ground state in the\nstrong coupling limit in both cases has a nontrivial topology associated with a\nfinite Z2 flux at the impurity site. For the antiferromagnetic case, this\nresult can be obtained straightforwardly owing to the integrability of the\nKitaev model with a vacancy. The strong-coupling limit of the ferromagnetic\ncase is however nonintegrable, and we address this problem through\nexact-diagonalization calculations with finite Kitaev fragments. Our exact\ndiagonalization calculations indicate that that the weak to strong coupling\ntransition and the topological phase transition occur rather close to each\nother and are possibly coincident. We also find an intriguing similarity\nbetween the magnetic response of the defect and the impurity susceptibility in\nthe two-channel Kondo problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 17:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The elements\nof such frames can in turn be used to build high-performance spherical codes,\nquantum measurement operators, and compressive sensing measurement matrices, to\nname a few applications.\n  In this work, we allude to the group-frame construction first described by\nSlepian and further explored in the works of Vale and Waldron.

Our technique produces a tight frame with a\nsmall number of distinct inner product values between the frame elements, in a\nsense approximating a Grassmanian frame. We identify special cases in which our\nconstruction yields some previously-known frames with optimal coherence meeting\nthe Welch lower bound, and other cases in which the entries of our frame\nvectors come from small alphabets. In particular, we apply our technique to the\nproblem choosing a subset of rows of a Hadamard matrix so that the resulting\ncolumns form a low-coherence frame.

However, there is no data set for\ntraining or evaluation purposes, where all the instances are accurately\nlabeled. Instead, what is available are instances of positive class (with\npossibly noisy labels) and no instances of negative class. The non-availability\nof negative class data is typically handled with the observation that randomly\nchosen protein-pairs have a nearly 100% chance of being negative class, as only\n1 in 1,500 protein pairs expected is expected to be an interacting pair. In\nthis paper, we focused on the problem that non-availability of accurately\nlabeled testing data sets in the domain of protein-protein interaction (PPI)\nprediction may lead to biased evaluation results. We first showed that not\nacknowledging the inherent skew in the interactome (i.e. rare occurrence of\npositive instances) leads to an over-estimated accuracy of the predictor. Then\nwe show that, with the belief that positive interactions are a rare category,\nsampling random pairs of proteins excluding known interacting proteins set as\nthe negative testing data set could lead to an under-estimated evaluation\nresult. We formalized those two problems to validate the above claim, and based\non the formalization, we proposed a balancing method to cancel out the\nover-estimation with under-estimation.

We demonstrate that RESCU can compute the\nelectronic structure properties of systems comprising many thousands of atoms\nusing modest computer resources, e.g. 16 to 256 cores. Its computational\nefficiency is achieved from exploiting four routes. First, we use numerical\natomic orbital (NAO) techniques to efficiently generate a good quality initial\nsubspace which is crucially required by Chebyshev filtering methods. Second, we\nexploit the fact that only a subspace spanning the occupied Kohn-Sham states is\nrequired, and solving accurately the KS equation using eigensolvers can\ngenerally be avoided. Third, by judiciously analyzing and optimizing various\nparts of the procedure in RESCU, we delay the $O(N^3)$ scaling to large $N$,\nand our tests show that RESCU scales consistently as $O(N^{2.3})$ from a few\nhundred atoms to more than 5,000 atoms when using a real space grid\ndiscretization. The scaling is better or comparable in a NAO basis up to the\n14,000 atoms level. Fourth, we exploit various numerical algorithms and, in\nparticular, we introduce a partial Rayleigh-Ritz algorithm to achieve\nefficiency gains for systems comprising more than 10,000 electrons.

Evolution proceeds as\na Moran process, and payoffs from the underlying cooperator-defector game are\ntranslated to positive fitnesses by an exponential transformation. These\nevolutionary dynamics can arise, for example, in a nest-structured population\nwith rare migration. The use of the exponential transformation, rather than the\nusual linear one, is appropriate when interactions have multiplicative fitness\neffects, and allows for a tractable characterization of the effect of\nassortment on the evolution of cooperation. We define two senses in which a\ngreater degree of assortment can favour the evolution of cooperation, the first\nstronger than the second: (i) greater assortment increases, at all population\nstates, the probability that the number of cooperators increases, relative to\nthe probability that the number of defectors increases; and (ii) greater\nassortment increases the fixation probability of cooperation, relative to that\nof defection. We show that, by the stronger definition, greater assortment\nfavours the evolution of cooperation for a subset of cooperative dilemmas:\nprisoners' dilemmas, snowdrift games, stag-hunt games, and some prisoners'\ndelight games.

Several post-formation\nprocesses have been proposed for explaining the origin of the compositional\ndiversity: the mass loss via stellar XUV irradiation, degassing of accreted\nmaterial, and in-situ accumulation of the disk gas. Close-in planets are also\nlikely to experience giant impacts during the advanced stage of planet\nformation. This study examines the possibility of transforming volatile-rich\nsuper-Earths / mini-Neptunes into volatile-depleted super-Earths through giant\nimpacts. We present the results of three-dimensional giant impact simulations\nin the accretionary and disruptive regimes. Target planets are modeled with a\nthree-layered structure composed of an iron core, silicate mantle and\nhydrogen/helium envelope. In the disruptive case, the giant impact can remove\nmost of the H/He atmosphere immediately and homogenize the refractory material\nin the planetary interior. In the accretionary case, the planet can retain more\nthan half of the gaseous envelope, while a compositional gradient suppresses\nefficient heat transfer as its interior undergoes double-diffusive convection.\nAfter the giant impact, a hot and inflated planet cools and contracts slowly.\nThe extended atmosphere enhances the mass loss via both a Parker wind induced\nby thermal pressure and hydrodynamic escape driven by the stellar XUV\nirradiation. As a result, the entire gaseous envelope is expected to be lost\ndue to the combination of those processes in both cases. We propose that\nKepler-36b may have been significantly devolatilized by giant impacts, while a\nsubstantial fraction of Kepler-36c's atmosphere may remain intact. Furthermore,\nthe stochastic nature of giant impacts may account for the large dispersion in\nthe mass--radius relationship of close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 20:03:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 10:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

I found that the AMS experiment can provide tight\nconstraints on the transport parameters allowing to resolutely break the\ndegeneracy, while nuclear uncertainties in the models are found to be a major\nlimiting factor. Once these uncertainties are accounted, the degeneracy remains\npoorly resolved. In particular, the Be/B ratio at ~1 - 10 GeV/n is found not to\nbring valuable information for the parameter extraction. On the other hand,\nprecise Be/B data at higher energy may be useful to test the nuclear physics\ninputs of the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 20:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 13:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 09:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

We use data on 14,699 red-clump stars from the\nAPOGEE survey, covering 4 kpc <~ R <~ 15 kpc, to determine the structure of\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs)---stars in narrow bins in [a/Fe] and\n[Fe/H]---accounting for the complex effects of the APOGEE selection function\nand the spatially-variable dust obscuration. We determine that all MAPs with\nenhanced [a/Fe] are centrally concentrated and are well-described as\nexponentials with a scale length of 2.2+/-0.2 kpc over the whole radial range\nof the disk. We discover that the surface-density profiles of low-[a/Fe] MAPs\nare complex: they do not monotonically decrease outwards, but rather display a\npeak radius ranging from ~5 kpc to ~13 kpc at low [Fe/H]. The extensive radial\ncoverage of the data allows us to measure radial trends in the thickness of\neach MAP. While high-[a/Fe] MAPs have constant scale heights, low-[a/Fe] MAPs\nflare. We confirm, now with high-precision abundances, previous results that\neach MAP contains only a single vertical scale height and that low-[Fe/H],\nlow-[a/Fe] and high-[Fe/H], high-[a/Fe] MAPs have intermediate (h_Z~300 to 600\npc) scale heights that smoothly bridge the traditional thin- and thick-disk\ndivide. That the high-[a/Fe], thick disk components do not flare is strong\nevidence against their thickness being caused by radial migration.

We show that if a minimum of the effective Lagrangian in $\\theta\n\\!=\\! - F_{\\, \\, \\mu \\nu}^a \\, F^{a \\mu \\nu}/2$ exists, a YMC forms that drives\nthe Universe toward an accelerated de Sitter phase.

The non-perturbative model\nhas properties similar to the ones of the perturbative model. In the early\nstage of the universe, the YMC equation of state has an evolution that\nresembles the radiation component, i.e. $w_y \\rightarrow 1/3$.

Our data set for the well-studied Seyfert galaxy NGC 5548\nconsists of five epochs of quasi-simultaneous optical and near-infrared\nspectroscopy spanning a period of about five years and three epochs of X-ray\nspectroscopy overlapping in time with it. Whereas the broad emission lines and\nhot dust emission varied only moderately, the coronal lines varied strongly.\nHowever, the observed high variability is mainly due to a flux decrease. Using\nthe optical [FeVII] and X-ray OVII emission lines we estimate that the coronal\nline gas has a relatively low density of n~10^3/cm^3 and a relatively high\nionisation parameter of log U~1. The resultant distance of the coronal line gas\nfrom the ionising source of about eight light years places this region well\nbeyond the hot inner face of the dusty torus. These results imply that the\ncoronal line region is an independent entity. We find again support for the\nX-ray heated wind scenario of Pier & Voit; the increased ionising radiation\nthat heats the dusty torus also increases the cooling efficiency of the coronal\nline gas, most likely due to a stronger adiabatic expansion. The much stronger\ncoronal line variability of NGC 5548 relative to that of NGC 4151 can also be\nexplained within this picture. NGC 5548 has much stronger coronal lines\nrelative to the low ionisation lines than NGC 4151 indicating a stronger wind,\nin which case a stronger adiabatic expansion of the gas and so fading of the\nline emission is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 06:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

It has been suggested that a virtual\npartner able to play the game with human subjects can be an effective tool to\naffect the underlying neural processes needed to establish the necessary\nconnections between the players, and also to provide new clinical interventions\nfor the rehabilitation of patients suffering from social disorders. Inspired by\nthe motor processes of the central nervous system (CNS) and the musculoskeletal\nsystem in the human body, in this paper we develop a novel interactive\ncognitive architecture based on nonlinear control theory to drive a virtual\nplayer (VP) to play the mirror game with a human player (HP) in different\nconfigurations. Specifically, we consider two cases: the former where the VP\nacts as leader and the latter where it acts as follower. The crucial problem is\nto design a feedback control architecture capable of imitating and following or\nleading a human player (HP) in a joint action task. Movement of the\nend-effector of the VP is modeled by means of a feedback controlled\nHaken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) oscillator, which is coupled with the observed motion of\nthe HP measured in real time. To this aim, two types of control algorithms\n(adaptive control and optimal control) are used and implemented on the HKB\nmodel so that the VP can generate human-like motion while satisfying certain\nkinematic constraints. A proof of convergence of the control algorithms is\npresented in the paper together with an extensive numerical and experimental\nvalidation of their effectiveness. A comparison with other existing designs is\nalso discussed, showing the flexibility and the advantages of our control-based\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 12:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

At sufficiently large currents,\nsimultaneous measurements of voltage drop and flow field reveal several\ndistinct dynamic regimes.

The first\nclamp is constrained to slide without friction along a curved profile, while\nthe second clamp moves in a straight line transmitting its motion through the\nelastic rod to the first clamp.

Our model is built on the\nassumption that the transient behaviour of the star in Cas A is due to a phase\ntransition within the dense QCD matter in the core of the star. Specifically,\nthe fast cooling is attributed to an enhancement in the neutrino emission\ntriggered by a transition from a fully gapped, two-flavor, red-green\ncolor-superconducting quark condensate to a superconducting crystalline or an\nalternative gapless, color-superconducting phase. The blue colored condensate\nis modeled as a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-type color superconductor with\nspin-one pairing order parameter.
