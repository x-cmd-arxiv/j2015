In early\n2015, one large Content Distribution Network handles 50 billion IPv6 requests\nper day from hundreds of millions of IPv6 client addresses; billions of unique\nclient addresses are observed per month. Address counts, however, obscure the\nnumber of hosts with IPv6 connectivity to the global Internet. There are\nnumerous address assignment and subnetting options in use; privacy addresses\nand dynamic subnet pools significantly inflate the number of active IPv6\naddresses. As the IPv6 address space is vast, it is infeasible to\ncomprehensively probe every possible unicast IPv6 address. Thus, to survey the\ncharacteristics of IPv6 addressing, we perform a year-long passive measurement\nstudy, analyzing the IPv6 addresses gleaned from activity logs for all clients\naccessing a global CDN.\n  The goal of our work is to develop flexible classification and measurement\nmethods for IPv6, motivated by the fact that its addresses are not merely more\nnumerous; they are different in kind. We introduce the notion of classifying\naddresses and prefixes in two ways: (1) temporally, according to their\ninstances of activity to discern which addresses can be considered stable; (2)\nspatially, according to the density or sparsity of aggregates in which active\naddresses reside. We present measurement and classification results numerically\nand visually that: provide details on IPv6 address use and structure in global\noperation across the past year; establish the efficacy of our classification\nmethods; and demonstrate that such classification can clarify dimensions of the\nInternet that otherwise appear quite blurred by current IPv6 addressing\npractices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 16:07:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 21:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

If the variables are corrupted by noise then\nthis approach maximises the likelihood that the solution found is correct. An\nalternative approach is to make use of prior statistical information about the\nnoise in conjunction with Bayes's theorem. The maximum entropy solution to the\nproblem then takes the form of a Boltzmann distribution over the ground and\nexcited states of the cost function. Here we use a programmable Josephson\njunction array for the information decoding problem which we simulate as a\nrandom Ising model in a field. We show experimentally that maximum entropy\ndecoding at finite temperature can in certain cases give competitive and even\nslightly better bit-error-rates than the maximum likelihood approach at zero\ntemperature, confirming that useful information can be extracted from the\nexcited states of the annealing device. Furthermore we introduce a microscopic\nbit-by-bit analytical method which is agnostic to the specific application and\nuse it to show that the annealing device samples from a highly Boltzmann-like\ndistribution. Machines of this kind are therefore candidates for use in a wide\nvariety of machine learning applications which exploit maximum entropy\ninference, including natural language processing and image recognition. We\nfurther show that the limiting factor for performance in our experiments is\nlikely to be control errors rather than failure to reach equilibrium. Our work\nalso provides a method for determining if a system is in equilibrium which can\nbe easily generalized.

The possibility of implementing it in nonlinear optical resonators\nwas the main motivation for introducing such model in the eighties, which\nrapidly became a paradigm for the study of dissipative phase transitions whose\ncorresponding spontaneously broken symmetry is discrete. However, it was found\nthat the intrinsic multimode nature of optical cavities makes it impossible to\nexperimentally study the model all the way through its phase transition.

We\nfocus on membranes as the mechanical element, showing that the main signatures\nof the degenerate parametric oscillation model can be studied in\nstate-of-the-art setups, thus opening the possibility of studying spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and enhanced metrology in one of the cleanest dissipative\nphase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 16:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

We aim at deriving the physical properties of the molecular gas and\ndust associated with the nebula, and investigating its correlation with the\nstar formation in the region, that was probably triggered by the expansion of\nthe ionization front. We use 870 micron data obtained with LABOCA to map the\ndust emission. The obtained LABOCA image was compared to archival IR,radio\ncontinuum, and optical images. The 870 micron emission follows the 8 micron\n(Spitzer), 250 micron, and 500 micron (Herschel) emission distributions showing\nthe classical morphology of a spherical shell. We use the 870 micron and 250\nmicron images to identify 60 dust clumps in the collected layers of molecular\ngas using the Gaussclumps algorithm. The clumps have effective deconvolved\nradii between 0.16 pc and 1.35 pc, masses between 70 Mo and 2800 Mo, and volume\ndensities between 1.1x10^3 cm^-3 and 2.04x10^5 cm^-3. The total mass of the\nclumps is 37600 Mo. The dust temperature of the clumps is in the range from 21\nK to 32 K, while inside the HII region reaches ~ 40 K. The clump mass\ndistribution is well-fitted by a power law dN/dlog(M/Mo) proportional to\nM^(-alpha), with alpha=0.93+/-0.28. The slope differs from those obtained for\nthe stellar IMF in the solar neighborhood, suggesting that the clumps are not\ndirect progenitors of single stars/protostars. The mass-radius relationship for\nthe 41 clumps detected in the 870 microns emission shows that only 37% of them\nlie in or above the high-mass star formation threshold, most of them having\ncandidate YSOs projected inside.

In this paper, we tackle\nthe problem of large scale CCA, where classical algorithms, usually requiring\ncomputing the product of two huge matrices and huge matrix decomposition, are\ncomputationally and storage expensive. We recast CCA from a novel perspective\nand propose a scalable and memory efficient Augmented Approximate Gradient\n(AppGrad) scheme for finding top $k$ dimensional canonical subspace which only\ninvolves large matrix multiplying a thin matrix of width $k$ and small matrix\ndecomposition of dimension $k\\times k$. Further, AppGrad achieves optimal\nstorage complexity $O(k(p_1+p_2))$, compared with classical algorithms which\nusually require $O(p_1^2+p_2^2)$ space to store two dense whitening matrices.\nThe proposed scheme naturally generalizes to stochastic optimization regime,\nespecially efficient for huge datasets where batch algorithms are prohibitive.\nThe online property of stochastic AppGrad is also well suited to the streaming\nscenario, where data comes sequentially. To the best of our knowledge, it is\nthe first stochastic algorithm for CCA. Experiments on four real data sets are\nprovided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 17:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

As the nature of superconductivity in these materials has still not\nbeen explained, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast, the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a guide for achieving high Tc and\ndoes not put bounds on Tc, all that is needed is a favorable combination of\nhigh frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of\nstates.

The stability of the clouds determines whether they will\nbe turned into stars or can be delivered to the central supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) to turn on an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The conventional criteria\nto assess the stability of these clouds, such as the Jeans criterion and Roche\n(or tidal) limit, are insufficient here, because they assume the dominance of\nself-gravity in binding a cloud, and neglect external agents, such as pressure\nand tidal forces, which are common in galactic nuclei. We formulate a new\nscheme for judging this stability. We first revisit the conventional Virial\ntheorem, taking into account an external pressure, to identify the correct\nrange of masses that lead to stable clouds. We then extend the theorem to\ninclude an external tidal field, crucial for the stability in the region of\ninterest -- in dense star clusters, around SMBHs.

Here we explore this possibility\nand follow the long term evolution of stellar disks embedded in GCs, and study\ntheir effects on the evolution of the clusters. We study disks with different\nmasses by means of detailed N-body simulations and explore their morphological\nand kinematic signatures on the GC structures. We find that as a second\ngeneration disk relaxes, the old, first generation, stellar population flattens\nand becomes more radially anisotropic, making the GC structure become more\nelliptical. The second generation stellar population is characterized by a\nlower velocity dispersion, and a higher rotational velocity, compared with the\nprimordial older population. The strength of these kinematic signatures depends\nboth on the relaxation time of the system and on the fractional mass of the\nsecond generation disk. We therefore conclude that SG populations formed in\nflattened configurations will give rise to two systematic trends: (1) Positive\ncorrelation between GC ellipticity and fraction of SG population (2) Positive\ncorrelation between GC relaxation time and ellipticity. Thereby GC\nellipticities and rotation could be related to the formation of SG stars and\ntheir initial configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 10:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

The median value of the\nmass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of the\nline-of-sight value. This is larger than the 50% usually cited for spherical\nclouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weighted\nfield, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field.

In this paper, we formalize a\nsemantics for robust online monitoring of partial traces, i.e., traces for\nwhich there might not be enough data to decide the Boolean satisfaction (and to\ncompute its quantitative counterpart). We propose an efficient algorithm to\ncompute it and demonstrate its usage on two large scale real-world case studies\ncoming from the automotive domain and from CPS education in a Massively Open\nOnline Course (MOOC) setting. We show that savings in computationally expensive\nsimulations far outweigh any overheads incurred by an online approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 23:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

The number of non-overlapping seeds a mapper selects determines the\nsensitivity of the mapper while the total frequency of all selected seeds\ndetermines the speed of the mapper. Modern seed-and-extend mappers usually\nselect seeds with either an equal and fixed-length scheme or with an inflexible\nplacement scheme, both of which limit the potential of the mapper to select\nless frequent seeds to speed up the mapping process. Therefore, it is crucial\nto develop a new algorithm that can adjust both the individual seed length and\nthe seed placement, as well as derive less frequent seeds.\n  Results: We present the Optimal Seed Solver (OSS), a dynamic programming\nalgorithm that discovers the least frequently-occurring set of x seeds in an\nL-bp read in $O(x \\times L)$ operations on average and in $O(x \\times L^{2})$\noperations in the worst case.

A simple\nscaling law is derived theoretically, which demonstrates that the critical size\nof the droplet is determined by the space of the micropillars. For this reason,\nhighly efficient removal of water benefits greatly from smaller micropillar\nspace.

A simple and efficient way to\nestimate a UE's velocity is by counting the number of handovers made by the UE\nduring a predefined time window. Indeed, handover-count based mobility state\ndetection has been standardized since Long Term Evolution (LTE) Release-8\nspecifications. The increasing density of small cells in wireless networks can\nhelp in accurate estimation of velocity and mobility state of a UE. In this\npaper, we model densely deployed small cells using stochastic geometry, and\nthen analyze the statistics of the number of handovers as a function of UE\nvelocity, small-cell density, and handover count measurement time window. Using\nthese statistics, we derive approximations to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)\nfor the velocity estimate of a UE.

Subsequently, we derive the probability of correctly detecting\nthe mobility state of a UE. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the velocity\nestimator under more realistic scenarios such as clustered deployment of small\ncells, random way point (RWP) mobility model for UEs, and variable UE velocity.\nOur analysis shows that the accuracy of velocity estimation and mobility state\ndetection increases with increasing small cell density and with increasing\nhandover count measurement time window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 01:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 02:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 23:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

A modified dark\nsector can also change the phenomenology greatly. The addition of the QCD axion\nto the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) solves the strong CP\nproblem and also modifies the dark sector with new dark matter candidates.\nWhile SUSY axion phenomenology is usually restricted to searches for the axion\nitself or searches for the ordinary SUSY particles, this work focuses on\nscenarios where the axion's superpartner, the axino may be detectable at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) in the decays of neutralinos displaced from the\nprimary vertex. In particular this work focuses on the KSVZ axino. The decay\nlength of neutralinos in this scenario easily fits the ATLAS detector for SUSY\nspectra expected to be testable at the 14 TeV LHC. This signature of displaced\ndecays to axinos is compared to other well motivated scenarios containing a\nlong lived neutralino which decays inside the detector. These alternative\nscenarios can in some cases very closely mimic the expected axino signature,\nand the degree to which they are distinguishable is discussed. The cosmological\nviability of such a scenario is also considered briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 04:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Consider for example, the\nfrequency of data storage. Critical phases of the simulation should be captured\nwith high frequency and with high fidelity for post-analysis, however we cannot\nafford to retain the same frequency for the full simulation due to the high\ncost of data movement. We can instead look for triggers, indicators that the\nsimulation will be entering a critical phase and adapt the workflow\naccordingly.\n  We present a method for detecting triggers and demonstrate its use in direct\nnumerical simulations of turbulent combustion using S3D. We show that chemical\nexplosive mode analysis (CEMA) can be used to devise a noise-tolerant indicator\nfor rapid increase in heat release. However, exhaustive computation of CEMA\nvalues dominates the total simulation, thus is prohibitively expensive. To\novercome this bottleneck, we propose a quantile-sampling approach.

Most importantly, the number of samples is independent of\nthe problem size, thus our proposed algorithm offers perfect scalability.

In this\ndefinition, compatibilities between the group and quandle operations are\nimposed which are motivated by considerations on colorings of handlebody-links.\nA homology theory defined here for MCQs take into consideration both group and\nquandle operations, as well as their compatibility. The first homology group is\ncharacterized, and the notion of extensions by $2$-cocycles is provided.\nDegenerate subcomplexes are defined in relation to simplicial decompositions of\nprismatic (products of simplices) complexes and group inverses. Cocycle\ninvariants are also defined for handlebody-links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 08:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 08:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

In this paper we propose a physical mechanism for\nlocomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid. It is based\non the fact that micro-structured fluids will generically phase-separate near\nsurfaces, leading to the presence of low-viscosity layers which promote slip\nand decrease viscous friction near the surface of the swimmer. We use two\nmodels to address the consequence of this phase separation: a nonzero apparent\nslip length for the fluid and then an explicit modeling of the change of\nviscosity in a thin layer near the swimmer. Considering two canonical setups\nfor low-Reynolds number locomotion, namely the waving locomotion of a\ntwo-dimensional sheet and that of a three-dimensional filament, we show that\nphase-separation systematically increases the locomotion speeds, possibly by\norders of magnitude.

Moreover, the nuclear modification\nfactor and azimuthal anisotropy measurements of mesonic resonances, which\nmeasure parton energy loss in medium and reflect partonic collectivity, can\nalso probe particle-species and mass ordering.\n  The K*0(892) and phi(1020) resonance production at mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5),\nmeasured in high energy (Au+Au, Cu+Cu, d+Au and p+p) collisions at RHIC with\nSTAR experiment, reconstructed by their hadronic decay in Kpi and KK,\nrespectively, are discussed. Mesons' spectra, yields, mean transverse momentum,\nnuclear modification factor, and azimuthal anisotropy are discussed as a\nfunction of centrality and collision energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 12:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Transmit\nantennas in multi-antenna systems and subcarriers in multi-carrier systems are\nexamples of such transmit entities that can be used to convey additional\ninformation bits through indexing. In this paper, we introduce {\\em generalized\nspace and frequency index modulation}, where the indices of active transmit\nantennas and subcarriers convey information bits. We first introduce index\nmodulation in the spatial domain, referred to as generalized spatial index\nmodulation (GSIM). For GSIM, where bits are indexed only in the spatial domain,\nwe derive the expression for achievable rate as well as easy-to-compute upper\nand lower bounds on this rate. We show that the achievable rate in GSIM can be\nmore than that in spatial multiplexing, and analytically establish the\ncondition under which this can happen. It is noted that GSIM achieves this\nhigher rate using fewer transmit radio frequency (RF) chains compared to\nspatial multiplexing. We also propose a Gibbs sampling based detection\nalgorithm for GSIM and show that GSIM can achieve better bit error rate (BER)\nperformance than spatial multiplexing. For generalized space-frequency index\nmodulation (GSFIM), where bits are encoded through indexing in both active\nantennas as well as subcarriers, we derive the achievable rate expression.\nNumerical results show that GSFIM can achieve higher rates compared to\nconventional MIMO-OFDM.

In order to improve the\nstability, generalization and interpretations of the discovered potential\nbiomarker and enhance the robustness of the resultant classifier, the redundant\nbut informative features need to be also selected.

We show how to steer\nsuch a random walk by applying a random sequence of intensities and phases of\nthe kicking lattice chosen according to a probability distribution. This\ndistribution converts on average into the final momentum distribution of the\nkicked atoms. In particular, it is shown that a power-law distribution for the\nkicking strengths results in a L\\'evy walk in momentum space and in a power-law\nwith the same exponent in the averaged momentum distribution. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the stability of our predictions in the context of a realistic\nexperiment with Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 15:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

It is constructed on\nthe method, proposed earlier by the author, of symbolic CTQ-analysis of\nmultidimensional discrete sequences and mappings.

The\ncorresponding FLRW cosmological dynamics with possible nonholonomic\ndeformations and the reconstruction procedure of certain actions closely\nrelated with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM universe are studied. Off-diagonal\ngeneralizations of de Sitter universes are constructed which are generated\nthrough nonlinear gravitational polarization of fundamental physical constants\nand which model interactions with non-constant exotic fluids and effective\nmatter. The problem of possible matter instability for such off-diagonal\ndeformations in (modified) gravity theories is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 17:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The paper examines the methodology used to develop speech synthesis TTS\nsystem for the Punjabi content, which is written in Gurmukhi script. For the\ndevelopment of this system, we use concatenative speech synthesis method with\nphonemes as the basic units of concatenation.
