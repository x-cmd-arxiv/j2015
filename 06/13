We investigate the evolution of three\ndifferent initial disk models with a range of initial black hole spin\nmagnitudes and tilt angles. For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios\nconsidered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and\nnutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios,\nneglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background\nblack hole spacetime is not justified. We find that the two more massive models\nare unstable against the Papaloizou-Pringle (PP) instability and that those\nPP-unstable models remain unstable for all initial spins and tilt angles\nconsidered, showing that the development of the instability is a very robust\nfeature of such PP-unstable disks. Our lightest model, which is the most\nastrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is\nstable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated\nduring the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment\nof black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with\nconstant specific angular momentum l. For the model with non-constant l-profile\nwe observe a long-lived m=1 non-axisymmetric structure which shows strong\noscillations of the tilt angle in the inner regions of the disk. This effect\nmight be connected to the development of Kozai-Lidov oscillations. Our\nsimulations also confirm earlier findings that the development of the PP\ninstability causes the long-term emission of large amplitude gravitational\nwaves, predominantly for the l=m=2 multipole mode. The imprint of the BH\nprecession on the gravitational waves from tilted BH-torus systems remains an\ninteresting open issue that would require significantly longer simulations than\nthose presented in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 16:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 11:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

The results are compared with our earlier ones from\nbefore a quarter of a century (Grabowski et al. 1987, hereafter ApJ'87; Madej\nand Grabowski 1990). In these earlier papers, as a dominant constituent of the\nBalmer-line-profiles, the standard, symmetrical Stark line profiles, shifted as\nthe whole by PS-effect, were applied to all spectrally active layers of the WD\natmosphere. At present, in each of the WD layers, the Stark-line-profiles\n(especially of $H_\\beta$) are immanently asymmetrical and shifted due to the\neffects of strong inhomogeneity of the perturbing fields in plasma.

In the case of the $H_\\alpha$ line, the present value of Stark-induced\nshift of the synthetic $H_\\alpha$ line-profile is about twice smaller than the\nprevious one (ApJ'87) and it is negligible in comparison with the gravitational\nred shift.

Cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropy observations have set unprecedented bounds on the\nnon-gaussianity parameter f_NL but the interesting regime f_NL <~ 1 is beyond\ntheir reach. Brightness-temperature fluctuations in the 21-cm line during the\ndark ages (z ~ 30-100) are a promising successor to CMB studies, giving access\nto a much larger number of modes. They are, however, intrinsically non-linear,\nwhich results in secondary non-gaussianities orders of magnitude larger than\nthe sought-after primordial signal.

We use\nthe flat-sky formalism, which greatly simplifies the analysis, while still\nbeing very accurate on small angular scales. We show that the secondary\nbispectrum is highly degenerate with the primordial one, and argue that even\npercent-level uncertainties in the amplitude of the former lead to a bias of\norder Delta f_NL ~ 10. To tackle this problem we carry out a detailed Fisher\nanalysis, marginalizing over the amplitudes of a few smooth redshift-dependent\ncoefficients characterizing the secondary bispectrum.

The sample covers a wide range of Hubble types, and galaxy\nstellar mass. We apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellar\nmass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, and\nmass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our target\ngalaxies. To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual\nradial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. We confirm that\nmore massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less\nreddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved\nspatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these\nrelations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact,\nolder, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching is\nrelated to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of ages are\nconsistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest ages\ngradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and\nbulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late type\nspirals hosting younger disks. The gradients in stellar mass surface density\ndepend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more\ncentrally concentrated. There is a secondary correlation in the sense that at\nthe same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. We find mildly\nnegative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxy\nevolution in isolation. The largest gradients occur in Sb galaxies. Overall we\nconclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass,\nwhile metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependent\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 20:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 07:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

Because the\noutflow emission scales with mass, the effective contrast between low-mass\nprotostars and their high-mass cousins is greatly lowered. In particular, maps\nof methanol emission at 338.4 GHz (J=7_0 - 6_0 A+) in low-mass clusters\nillustrate that this transition is an excellent probe of the low-mass\npopulation.

We first study general\nbirth and death processes and we give non-explosion and extinction criteria,\nmoment computations and a pathwise representation. We then show how different\nscales may lead to different qualitative approximations, either ODEs or SDEs.\nThe prototypes of these equations are the logistic (deterministic) equation and\nthe logistic Feller diffusion process. The convergence in law of the sequence\nof processes is proved by tightness-uniqueness argument. In these large\npopulation approximations, the competition between individuals leads to\nnonlinear drift terms. We then focus on models without interaction but\nincluding exceptional events due either to demographic stochasticity or to\nenvironmental stochasticity. In the first case, an individual may have a large\nnumber of offspring and we introduce the class of continuous state branching\nprocesses. In the second case, catastrophes may occur and kill a random\nfraction of the population and the process enjoys a quenched branching\nproperty. We emphasize on the study of the Laplace transform, which allows us\nto classify the long time behavior of these processes. In the second chapter,\nwe model structured populations by measure-valued stochastic differential\nequations. Our approach is based on the individual dynamics. The individuals\nare characterized by parameters which have an influence on their survival or\nreproduction ability. Some of these parameters can be genetic and are\ninheritable except when mutations occur, but they can also be a space location\nor a quantity of parasites. The individuals compete for resources or other\nenvironmental constraints. We describe the population by a point measure-valued\nMarkov process. We study macroscopic approximations of this process depending\non the interplay between different scalings and obtain in the limit either\nintegro-differential equations or reaction-diffusion equations or nonlinear\nsuper-processes. In each case, we insist on the specific techniques for the\nproof of convergence and for the study of the limiting model. The limiting\nprocesses offer different models of mutation-selection dynamics. Then, we study\ntwo-level models motivated by cell division dynamics, where the cell population\nis discrete and characterized by a trait, which may be continuous. In 1\nparticular, we finely study a process for parasite infection and the trait is\nthe parasite load. The latter grows following a Feller diffusion and is\nrandomly shared in the two daughter cells when the cell divides. Finally, we\nfocus on the neutral case when the rate of division of cells is constant but\nthe trait evolves following a general Markov process and may split in a random\nnumber of cells. The long time behavior of the structured population is then\nlinked and derived from the behavior a well chosen SDE (monotype population).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 20:16:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2017 10:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

The shocklet and shock wave are\ncaused by the solenoidal and compressive modes of driven forces, respectively.\nHereafter, the related two flows are called as SFT and CFT, respectively. It\nshows that in SFT the temperature spectrum follows the k^-5/3 power law, and\nthe temperature field has \"ramp-cliff\" structures. By contrast, in CFT the\ntemperature spectrum obeys the k^-2 power law, and the temperature field is\ndominated by large-scale rarefaction and compression. The power-law exponents\nfor the p.d.f. of large negative dilatation are -2.5 in SFT and -3.5 in CFT,\nclose to theoretical values. For the isentropic assumption of thermodynamic\nvariables, the derivation in SFT grows with the turbulent Mach number (Mt), and\nfor same Mt, the variables in CFT are more anisentropic. The angle statistics\nshows that the temperature gradient in CFT is preferentially perpendicular to\nthe anisotropic strain rate tensor. It tends to be parallel with the first\neigenvector and be orthogonal with the other two eigenvectors. For the cascade\nof temperature, the temperature variance is increased by the viscous\ndissipation and the pressure-dilatation, but is decreased by the SGS\ntemperature flux. The statistics of pressure-dilatation proves that the\nnegligible contribution of pressure-dilatation at small scales is due to the\ncancelations of high values between rarefaction and compression regions. The\nstrongly positive skewness of the p.d.f.s of pressure-dilatation implies that\nthe conversion from kinetic to internal energy through compression is more\nintense than the opposite process through rarefaction. Furthermore, in SFT the\nfluctuations of pressure-dilatation approximately follow the Zeman model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 20:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The inferred field in such a magnetic loop is B_loop\n~ 2 x 10^{14} G, a factor of ~7 higher than the surface dipolar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 00:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Such models are sufficient for describing state\ntransitions in a reaction where coherences between different states do not\narise, or in other words, a reaction which contain only incoherent transitions.\nA prominent example reaction containing coherent transitions is the\nradical-pair model. The kinetics of such reactions is defined by the so-called\nreaction operator which determines the radical-pair state as a function of\nintermediate transition rates. We argue that the well-known concept of quantum\nwalks from quantum information theory is a natural and apt framework for\ndescribing multisite chemical reactions. By composing Kraus maps that act only\non two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied\nto derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction.

Strong convexity of\nlocal functions and Lipschitz continuity of local gradients is shown to\nguarantee linear convergence of the sequence generated by DSA in expectation.\nLocal iterates are further shown to approach the optimal argument for almost\nall realizations. The expected linear convergence of DSA is in contrast to the\nsublinear rate characteristic of existing methods for decentralized stochastic\noptimization.

When looking for the K-edge signal\nof a specific contrast, by taking measurements either side of the K-edge, it is\nfound that the K-edge is not always observable for low concentrations. We have\nalso observed that the ability to see the K-edge is unit dependent - a K-edge\nthat is not observable in computed tomography (CT) reconstructed linear\nattenuation units can often be made visible by converting to Hounsfield units.\n  This paper presents an investigation of this K-edge hiding phenomenon. We\nconclude that if a multi-energy x-ray measurement of any K-edge material\ncontains a signal of any other material, then there will be a positive\nconcentration of that K-edge material below which its K-edge cannot be observed\nwithout extracting the K-edge signal through means of basis decomposition.\nMathematical descriptions of this limiting minimum concentration is provided in\nthree cases - multi-energy radiographic projection images; and reconstructed\nmulti-energy CT images for both linear attenuation and Hounsfield units. Two\nimportant properties of this limiting concentration are provided: the minimum\nconcentration for Hounsfield units is always strictly less than the minimum\nconcentration for linear attenuation; and the minimum concentration for\nradiographic projections will typically be much larger than the minimum\nconcentration for reconstructed linear attenuation. Finally experimental\nobservation of this phenomenon is presented using data collected by the MARS\nspectral CT scanner equipped with a CdTe Medipix-3RX camera operating in\ncharge-summing mode, where it is also shown that the K-edge can be recovered\nthrough basis decomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 04:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In particular, it provides\nnatural options for interpolation of distributions (displacement interpolation)\nand for modeling flows. As such it has been the cornerstone of recent\ndevelopments in physics, probability theory, image processing, time-series\nanalysis, and several other fields. In spite of extensive work and theoretical\ndevelopments, the computation of OMT for large scale problems has remained a\nchallenging task. An alternative framework for interpolating distributions,\nrooted in statistical mechanics and large deviations, is that of Schroedinger\nbridges (entropic interpolation). This may be seen as a stochastic\nregularization of OMT and can be cast as the stochastic control problem of\nsteering the probability density of the state-vector of a dynamical system\nbetween two marginals. In this approach, however, the actual computation of\nflows had hardly received any attention. In recent work on Schroedinger bridges\nfor Markov chains and quantum evolutions, we noted that the solution can be\nefficiently obtained from the fixed-point of a map which is contractive in the\nHilbert metric. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to show that a similar\napproach can be taken in the context of diffusion processes which i) leads to a\nnew proof of a classical result on Schroedinger bridges and ii) provides an\nefficient computational scheme for both, Schroedinger bridges and OMT. We\nillustrate this new computational approach by obtaining interpolation of\ndensities in representative examples such as interpolation of images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 11:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Impaction criteria that allow for different\nangles of the leaf surface and the droplet impact trajectory are presented;\ntheir predictions are based on whether combinations of droplet size and\nvelocity lie above or below bounce and shatter boundaries. In the experimental\ncomponent, real leaves are used, with all their inherent natural variability.\nFurther, commercial agricultural spray nozzles are employed, resulting in a\nrange of droplet characteristics. Given this natural variability, there is\nbroad agreement between the data and predictions.

The\nunstable boxed quasinormal modes have been calculated by using both analytical\nand numerical method. In this paper, we further provide a time domain analysis\nby performing a long time evolution of charged scalar field configuration in\nthe background of the charged stringy black hole with the mirror-like boundary\ncondition imposed. We have used the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates\nto derive the evolution equation, and adopted Pseudo-spectral method and the\nforth-order Runge-Kutta method to evolve the scalar field with the initial\nGaussian wave packet. It is shown by our numerical scheme that Fourier\ntransforming the evolution data coincides well with the unstable modes computed\nfrom frequency domain analysis.

The\nresult is a gigapixel-scale image having both wide FOV and high resolution,\ni.e. large space-bandwidth product (SBP).

Further, we obtain the fixed points of the dynamical system in phase\nspace analysis of $f(R)$ models, both with and without the effects of\nradiation. Stability of these points is studied against perturbations in a\nsmooth spatial background by applying the conditions on the eigenvalues of the\nmatrix obtained in the linearized first-order differential equations. Following\nthis, these fixed points are used for analysing the dynamics of the system\nduring the radiation, matter and acceleration dominated phases of the universe.\nCertain linear and quadratic forms of $f(R)$ are determined from the\ngeometrical and physical considerations and the behaviour of the scale factor\nis found for those forms. Further, we also determine the Hubble parameter\n$H(t)$, Ricci scalar $R$ for these cosmic phases. We show the emergence of an\nasymmetry of time from the dynamics of the scalar field exclusively owing to\nthe $f(R)$ gravity in the Einstein frame that may lead to an arrow of time at a\nclassical level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 10:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 2017 11:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

Our representations are\nbased on the unit square grid whose cells we call pixels in 2D and voxels in\n3D. Two pixels are adjacent if they share an edge, two voxels if they share a\nface. We call a connected set of pixels or voxels a blob. Given a graph, we\nrepresent its vertices by disjoint blobs such that two blobs contain adjacent\npixels or voxels if and only if the corresponding vertices are adjacent. We are\ninterested in the size of a representation, which is the number of pixels or\nvoxels it consists of.\n  We first show that finding minimum-size representations is NP-complete. Then,\nwe bound representation sizes needed for certain graph classes. In 2D, we show\nthat, for $k$-outerplanar graphs with $n$ vertices, $\\Theta(kn)$ pixels are\nalways sufficient and sometimes necessary. In particular, outerplanar graphs\ncan be represented with a linear number of pixels, whereas general planar\ngraphs sometimes need a quadratic number. In 3D, $\\Theta(n^2)$ voxels are\nalways sufficient and sometimes necessary for any $n$-vertex graph. We improve\nthis bound to $\\Theta(n\\cdot \\tau)$ for graphs of treewidth $\\tau$ and to\n$O((g+1)^2n\\log^2n)$ for graphs of genus $g$. In particular, planar graphs\nadmit representations with $O(n\\log^2n)$ voxels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 18:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}
