Assuming optically thin\ndust emission at 345 GHz, a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, and a grain temperature\nof 20 K, the disk gas-mass is estimated to be 3.1 +/- 0.6 Jupiter masses. If\nmost solids and ices have have been incorporated into large grains, however,\nthis value is a lower limit. The disk is not detected in dense-gas tracers such\nas HCO+ J=4-3, HCN J=4-3, or CS =7-6. These results may indicate that the\n114-426 disk is evolved and depleted in some light organic compounds found in\nmolecular clouds. The CO J=3-2 line is seen in absorption against the bright 50\nto 80 K background of the Orion A molecular cloud over the full spatial extent\nand a little beyond the dust continuum emission. The CO absorption reaches a\ndepth of 27 K below the background CO emission at VLSR ~6.7 km/s about 0.52\narcseconds (210 AU) northeast and 12 K below the background CO emission at VLSR\n~ 9.7 km/s about 0.34 arcseconds (140 AU) southwest of the suspected location\nof the central star, implying that the embedded star has a mass less than 1\nSolar mass .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 16:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Our model predicts poverty index at any spatial\nresolution. Thus, we generate Poverty Maps for Senegal at an unprecedented\nfiner resolution. Such maps are essential for understanding what characterizes\npoverty in a certain region, and how it differentiates from other regions, for\ntargeted responses for the demographic of the population that is most needy. An\ninteresting fact, that is empirically proved by our methodology, is that a\nlarge portion of all communication, and economic activity in Senegal is\nconcentrated in Dakar, leaving many other regions marginalized.\n  Second, we study how user behavioral statistics, gathered from\ncellular-communications, correlate with the poverty indicators. Can this\nrelationship be learnt as a model to generate poverty maps at a finer\nresolution?

Its ubiquity in nature poses a conundrum. Whenever two\nentities cooperate, one must willingly relinquish something of value to the\nother. Why is this apparent altruism favored in evolution? Classical solutions\nassume a net fitness gain in a cooperative transaction which, through\nreciprocity or relatedness, finds its way back from recipient to donor. We seek\nthe source of this fitness gain. Our analysis rests on the insight that\nevolutionary processes are typically multiplicative and noisy. Fluctuations\nhave a net negative effect on the long-time growth rate of resources but no\neffect on the growth rate of their expectation value. This is an example of\nnon-ergodicity. By reducing the amplitude of fluctuations, pooling and sharing\nincreases the long-time growth rate for cooperating entities, meaning that\ncooperators outgrow similar non-cooperators. We identify this increase in\ngrowth rate as the net fitness gain, consistent with the concept of geometric\nmean fitness in the biological literature. This constitutes a fundamental\nmechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Its minimal assumptions make it a\ncandidate explanation of cooperation in settings too simple for other fitness\ngains, such as emergent function and specialization, to be probable. One such\nexample is the transition from single cells to early multicellular life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 18:04:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 15:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-24"}

Ionizing nebular radiation heats the inner edge of\nthe ejecta to temperatures of T > few 1e4 K, converting the emission to\noptical/near-UV wavelengths where photons more readily escape due to the lower\nopacity. This can explain the unexpectedly low and temporally constant\neffective temperatures of optically-discovered TDE flares. For BHs with\nrelatively high masses M_BH > 1e7 M_sun the ejecta can become ionized at an\nearlier stage, or for a wider range of viewing angles, producing a TDE flare\nwhich is instead dominated by thermal X-ray emission. We predict total radiated\nenergies consistent with those of observed TDE flares, and ejecta velocities\nthat agree with the measured emission line widths. The peak optical luminosity\nfor M_BH < 1e6 M_sun is suppressed due to adiabatic losses in the inner disk\nwind, possibly contributing to the unexpected dearth of optical TDEs in\ngalaxies with low mass BHs.

We then project quasiparticle states onto the Fermi surface and obtain\nan effectively spinless, projected Landau theory with a single projected Landau\nparameter per angular momentum channel that captures the spin-momentum locking\nor nontrivial Berry phase of the Fermi surface. As a result of this nontrivial\nBerry phase, projection to the Fermi surface can increase or lower the angular\nmomentum of the quasiparticle interactions.

Consequently, much research has gone into formulating distance\nmeasures for how test cases, their inputs and/or their outputs differ. However,\ncommon to these proposals is that they are data type specific and/or calculate\nthe diversity only between pairs of test inputs, traces or outputs.\n  We propose a new metric to measure the diversity of sets of tests: the test\nset diameter (TSDm). It extends our earlier, pairwise test diversity metrics\nbased on recent advances in information theory regarding the calculation of the\nnormalized compression distance (NCD) for multisets. An advantage is that TSDm\ncan be applied regardless of data type and on any test-related information, not\nonly the test inputs. A downside is the increased computational time compared\nto competing approaches.\n  Our experiments on four different systems show that the test set diameter can\nhelp select test sets with higher structural and fault coverage than random\nselection even when only applied to test inputs. This can enable early test\ndesign and selection, prior to even having a software system to test, and\ncomplement other types of test automation and analysis. We argue that this\nquantification of test set diversity creates a number of opportunities to\nbetter understand software quality and provides practical ways to increase it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 21:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-15"}

The structures with the\nvarying width allow for modulation of the electron drift velocity while keeping\nthe plasma velocity constant. We predict that in such structures biased by a\nconstant current, a periodic modulation of the electron drift velocity due the\nvarying width results in the instability of the plasma waves if the electron\ndrift velocity to plasma wave velocity ratio changes from below to above unity.\nThe physics of such instability is similar to that of the sonic boom, but, in\nthe periodically modulated structures, this analog of the sonic boom is\nrepeated many times leading to a larger increment of the instability. The\nconstant plasma velocity in the sections of different width leads to the\nresonant excitation of the unstable plasma modes with the varying bias current.\nThis effect (that we refer to as the super plasmonic boom condition) results in\na strong enhancement of the instability.

We show that this apparent conflict can be resolved\nif the elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen are reduced in the upper\nlayers of the outer disk but are normal elsewhere (except for a possible\nenhancement of their abundances in the inner disk). The implication is that in\nthe outer disk, the main reservoir of the volatiles (CO, water, ...) resides\nclose to the midplane, locked up inside solid bodies that are too heavy to be\ntransported back to the atmosphere by turbulence. An enhancement in the carbon\nand oxygen abundances in the inner disk can be caused by inward migration of\nthese solid bodies.

Indirect measurements of the disk gas mass and disk\nstructure from species such as CO will thus be intertwined with the evolution\nof dust grains, and possibly also with the formation of planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 23:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

However, this could be easily\ncontaminated by several foreground issues, such as the thermal dust emission.\nIn this paper we study another mechanism, the cosmic birefringence, which can\nbe introduced by a CPT-violating interaction between CMB photons and an\nexternal scalar field. Such kind of interaction could give rise to the rotation\nof the linear polarization state of CMB photons, and consequently induce the\nCMB BB power spectrum, which could mimic the signal of primordial gravitational\nwaves at large scales. With the recent polarization data of BICEP2 and the\njoint analysis data of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck, we perform a global\nfitting analysis on constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by considering\nthe polarization rotation angle which can be separated into a background\nisotropic part and a small anisotropic part. Since the data of BICEP2 and Keck\nArray experiments have already been corrected by using the \"self-calibration\"\nmethod, here we mainly focus on the effects from the anisotropies of CMB\npolarization rotation angle. We find that including the anisotropies in the\nanalysis could slightly weaken the constraints on $r$, when using current CMB\npolarization measurements. We also simulate the mock CMB data with the\nBICEP3-like sensitivity. Very interestingly, we find that if the effects of the\nanisotropic polarization rotation angle can not be taken into account properly\nin the analysis, the constraints on $r$ will be dramatically biased. This\nimplies that we need to break the degeneracy between the anisotropies of the\nCMB polarization rotation angle and the CMB primordial tensor perturbations, in\norder to measure the signal of primordial gravitational waves accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 01:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Like measurement noise, this noise is only reduced as the\nsquare root of observing time, posing a major challenge to future pulsar timing\ncampaigns with large aperture telescopes, e.g. the Five-hundred-metre Aperture\nSpherical Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array.\n  We propose a new method of pulsar timing that attempts to approximate the\npulse-to-pulse variability with a small family of 'basis' pulses. If pulsar\ndata are integrated over many rotations, this basis can be used to measure\nsub-pulse structure. Or, if high-time resolution data are available, the basis\ncan be used to 'tag' single pulses and produce an optimal timing template. With\nrealistic simulations, we show that these applications can dramatically reduce\nthe effect of pulse-to-pulse variability on TOAs.

A natural question is whether\ndeletions can take many rotations not only in the worst case but in the\namortized case as well. A sequence of $n$ successive deletions in an $n$-node\ntree takes $O(n)$ rotations, but what happens when insertions are intermixed\nwith deletions? Heaupler, Sen, and Tarjan conjectured that alternating\ninsertions and deletions in an $n$-node AVL tree can cause each deletion to do\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ rotations, but they provided no construction to justify their\nclaim.

The difficulty in obtaining such a construction is that in general the\ntree produced by an expensive deletion-insertion pair is not the original tree.\nIndeed, if the trees in $E$ have even height $k$, $2^{k/2}$ deletion-insertion\npairs are required to reproduce the original tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 01:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The activation enthalpy\nfor the cross slip is calculated using a line tension model based on the\ndensity functional theory to be $1.4$ to $1.7$ eV, which is in reasonable\nagreement with experiments. On the basis of the results, the effect of\ntemperature on the cross-slip process of the dissociated screw $<$a$>$\ndislocation on the basal plane is studied in detail using the molecular\ndynamics method with the embedded-atom-method (EAM) interatomic potential, in\nwhich the critical resolved shear stress for the cross slip is evaluated. It is\nconfirmed that the bowed-out dislocation line on the prismatic plane consists\nof slightly dissociated rectilinear segments with connecting jogs at low\ntemperatures and, as the temperature rises, the curved dislocation line becomes\nsmooth with many segments. The motion of an $<$a$>$ dislocation on the\nprismatic plane is jerky in the low temperature region, while it is retarded by\nthe formation of the largely dissociated plateau segment above the room\ntemperature. A large reduction of the critical shear stress for the cross slip\nis obtained when the $<$a$>$ screw dislocation interacts with a hard-sphere\nparticle placed on the basal plane in the low temperature region\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 03:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

In addition, an underlying assumption was that the quantum\ntransverse-field Ising Hamiltonian, whose ground states are already highly\nentangled, is an appropriate model of the device, and not some other (possibly\nclassical) model. This begs the question of whether alternative, classical or\nsemiclassical models would be equally effective at predicting the observed\nspectrum and thermal state populations. To check this, we consider a recently\nproposed classical rotor model with classical Monte Carlo updates, which has\nbeen successfully employed in describing features of earlier experiments\ninvolving the device. We also consider simulated quantum annealing with quantum\nMonte Carlo updates, an algorithm that samples from the instantaneous Gibbs\nstate of the device Hamiltonian.

By stealth\nconfiguration, we mean a nontrivial scalar field nonminimally coupled to\ngravity whose energy-momentum tensor evaluated on the anisotropic background\nvanishes identically. In the case of a Lifshitz spacetime with a nontrivial\ndynamical exponent z, we spotlight the role played by the anisotropy to\nestablish the holographic character of the stealth configurations, i.e. the\nscalar field is shown to only depend on the radial holographic direction. This\nconfiguration which turns out to be massless and without integration constants\nis possible for a unique value of the nonminimal coupling parameter. Then,\nusing a simple conformal argument, we map this configuration into a stealth\nsolution defined on the so-called hyperscaling violation metric which is\nconformally related to the Lifshitz spacetime. This holographic configuration\nobtained through a conformal mapping constitutes only a particular class within\nthe stealth solutions defined on the hyperscaling violation as it is shown by\nderiving the most general stealth configurations. The case of the Schrodinger\nbackground is also exhaustively analyzed and we establish that the presence of\nthe null direction makes their stealth configurations not necessarily\nholographic in general and characterized by a self-interacting behavior.\nFinally, for completeness we also study the stealth configurations on the\nSchrodinger inspired hyperscaling violation spacetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 04:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

Thanks to the availability of recent high data rate millimeter-wave\nfrequency spectrum such as 60GHz and due to the favorable attributes of this\ntechnology, wireless DC (WDC) exhibits the potentials of being a promising\nsolution especially for small to medium scale DCs. This paper investigates the\nproblem of throughput scalability of WDCs using the established theory of the\nasymptotic throughput of wireless multi-hop networks that are primarily\nproposed for homogeneous traffic conditions. The rate-heterogeneous traffic\ndistribution of a data center however, requires the asymptotic heterogeneous\nthroughput knowledge of a wireless network in order to study the performance\nand feasibility of WDCs for practical purposes. To answer these questions this\npaper presents a lower bound for the throughput scalability of a multi-hop\nrate-heterogeneous network when traffic generation rates of all nodes are\nsimilar, except one node. We demonstrate that the throughput scalability of\nconventional multi-hopping and the spatial reuse of the above bi-rate network\nis inefficient and henceforth develop a speculative 2-partitioning scheme that\nimproves the network throughput scaling potentials. A better lower bound of the\nthroughput is then obtained. Finally, we obtain the throughput scaling of an\ni.i.d. rate-heterogeneous network and obtain its lower bound. Again we propose\na speculative 2-partitioning scheme to achieve a network with higher throughput\nin terms of improved lower bound.

Cut Set Analysis (CSA) is applied to critical systems to\nidentify and rank system vulnerabilities at design time. Model checking tools\nhave been used to automate the generation of minimal cut sets but are generally\nbased on checking reachability of system failure states. This paper describes a\nnew approach to CSA using a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) model checker called BT\nAnalyser that supports the generation of multiple counterexamples. The approach\nenables a broader class of system failures to be analysed, by generalising from\nfailure state formulae to failure behaviours expressed in LTL. The traditional\napproach to CSA using model checking requires the model or system failure to be\nmodified, usually by hand, to eliminate already-discovered cut sets, and the\nmodel checker to be rerun, at each step. By contrast, the new approach works\nincrementally and fully automatically, thereby removing the tedious and\nerror-prone manual process and resulting in significantly reduced computation\ntime. This in turn enables larger models to be checked. Two different\nstrategies for using BT Analyser for CSA are presented. There is generally no\nsingle best strategy for model checking: their relative efficiency depends on\nthe model and property being analysed. Comparative results are given for the\nA320 hydraulics case study in the Behavior Tree modelling language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 06:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Such\ntechniques are valuable since they allow to handle even more complex systems.\nOne key point is the ability to decompose a large system into subsystems,\nanalyze those subsystems and deduce properties of the larger system. As\ncyber-physical systems tend to become more and more complex, such techniques\nbecome more appealing.\n  In 2009, Oehlerking and Theel presented a (de-)composition technique for\nhybrid systems. This technique is graph-based and constructs a Lyapunov\nfunction for hybrid systems having a complex discrete state space. The\ntechnique consists of (1) decomposing the underlying graph of the hybrid system\ninto subgraphs, (2) computing multiple local Lyapunov functions for the\nsubgraphs, and finally (3) composing the local Lyapunov functions into a\npiecewise Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function can serve multiple purposes,\ne.g., it certifies stability or termination of a system or allows to construct\ninvariant sets, which in turn may be used to certify safety and security.\n  In this paper, we propose an improvement to the decomposing technique, which\nrelaxes the graph structure before applying the decomposition technique. Our\nrelaxation significantly reduces the connectivity of the graph by exploiting\nsuper-dense switching. The relaxation makes the decomposition technique more\nefficient on one hand and on the other allows to decompose a wider range of\ngraph structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 06:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Performing a comprehensive theoretical study\nof the phase diagram as a function of filling, we find that the superconducting\ngap exhibits transitions from p-wave at very low electron fillings to\nd_{x^2-y^2}-wave symmetry close to half filling in agreement with previous\nreports. At intermediate filling levels, different gap symmetries appear as a\nconsequence of the changes in the Fermi surface topology and the associated\nstructure of the spin susceptibility. In particular, the vicinity of a van Hove\nsingularity in the electronic structure close to the Fermi level has important\nconsequences for the gap structure in favoring the otherwise sub-dominant\ntriplet solution over the singlet d-wave solution. By solving the full gap\nequation, we find that the energetically favorable triplet solutions are chiral\nand break time reversal symmetry. Finally, we also calculate the detailed\nangular gap structure of the quasi-particle spectrum, and show how\nspin-fluctuation-mediated pairing leads to significant deviations from the\nfirst harmonics both in the singlet d_{x^2-y^2} gap as well as the chiral\ntriplet gap solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 09:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

The locomotive\nbehaviors can consist of a variety of walking patterns along with adaptation\nthat allow the animals to deal with changes in environmental conditions, like\nuneven terrains, gaps, obstacles etc. Biological study has revealed that such\ncomplex behaviors are a result of a combination of biome- chanics and neural\nmechanism thus representing the true nature of embodied interactions. While the\nbiomechanics helps maintain flexibility and sustain a variety of movements, the\nneural mechanisms generate movements while making appropriate predictions\ncrucial for achieving adaptation. Such predictions or planning ahead can be\nachieved by way of in- ternal models that are grounded in the overall behavior\nof the animal. Inspired by these findings, we present here, an artificial\nbio-inspired walking system which effectively com- bines biomechanics (in terms\nof the body and leg structures) with the underlying neural mechanisms. The\nneural mechanisms consist of 1) central pattern generator based control for\ngenerating basic rhythmic patterns and coordinated movements, 2) distributed\n(at each leg) recurrent neural network based adaptive forward models with\nefference copies as internal models for sensory predictions and instantaneous\nstate estimations, and 3) searching and elevation control for adapting the\nmovement of an individual leg to deal with different environmental conditions.\nUsing simulations we show that this bio-inspired approach with adaptive\ninternal models allows the walking robot to perform complex loco- motive\nbehaviors as observed in insects, including walking on undulated terrains,\ncrossing large gaps as well as climbing over high obstacles...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 09:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

For the monolithic approach to succeed (and this is not\nalways possible), a complex feature representation is often necessary since the\npolicy is a complex object that has to prescribe what actions to take all over\nthe state space. This is especially true in large domains with complicated\ndynamics. It is also computationally inefficient to both learn and plan in MDPs\nusing a complex monolithic approach. We present a different approach where we\nrestrict the policy space to policies that can be represented as combinations\nof simpler, parameterized skills---a type of temporally extended action, with a\nsimple policy representation. We introduce Learning Skills via Bootstrapping\n(LSB) that can use a broad family of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms as\na \"black box\" to iteratively learn parametrized skills. Initially, the learned\nskills are short-sighted but each iteration of the algorithm allows the skills\nto bootstrap off one another, improving each skill in the process. We prove\nthat this bootstrapping process returns a near-optimal policy.

Aim: To study all\nmultiwavelength data available during MJD 56392 to 56403, with special emphasis\non X-ray data, and understand the underlying particle energy distribution.\nMethods: We study the correlations between the UV and gamma bands with the\nX-ray band using the z-transformed discrete correlation function. We model the\nunderlying particle spectrum with a single population of electrons emitting\nsynchrotron radiation, and do a statistical fitting of the simultaneous,\ntime-resolved data from the Swift-XRT and the NuSTAR. Results: There was rapid\nflux variability in the X-ray band, with a minimum doubling timescale of $1.69\n\\pm 0.13$ hrs. There were no corresponding flares in UV and gamma bands. The\nvariability in UV and gamma rays are relatively modest with $ \\sim 8 \\% $ and\n$\\sim 16 \\% $ respectively, and no significant correlation was found with the\nX-ray light curve. The observed X-ray spectrum shows clear curvature which can\nbe fit by a log parabolic spectral form. This is best explained to originate\nfrom a log parabolic electron spectrum. However, a broken power law or a power\nlaw with an exponentially falling electron distribution cannot be ruled out\neither. Moreover, the excellent broadband spectrum from $0.3-79$ keV allows us\nto make predictions of the UV flux. We find that this prediction is compatible\nwith the observed flux during the low state in X-rays. However, during the\nX-ray flares, the predicted flux is a factor of $2-50$ smaller than the\nobserved one. This suggests that the X-ray flares are plausibly caused by a\nseparate population which does not contribute significantly to the radiation at\nlower energies. Alternatively, the underlying particle spectrum can be much\nmore complex than the ones explored in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

As\nsurveys targeting friendship relations might suffer less from memory biases\nthan contact diaries, it is also interesting to explore how daily contact\npatterns compare with friendship relations and with online social links. Here\nwe make progresses in these directions by leveraging data from a French high\nschool: face-to-face contacts measured by two concurrent methods, sensors and\ndiaries; self-reported friendship surveys; Facebook links. We compare the data\nsets and find that most short contacts are not reported in diaries while long\ncontacts have larger reporting probability, with a general tendency to\noverestimate durations. Measured contacts corresponding to reported friendship\ncan have durations of any length but all long contacts correspond to reported\nfriendships. Online links not associated to reported friendships correspond to\nshort face-to-face contacts, highlighting the different nature of reported\nfriendships and online links.

Comparisons\nat equal overall loudness revealed no benefit from presenting ITD information\nat two electrode pairs for any tonotopic spacing.

In the\nconstruction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly\nused to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic\ngates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and\nFredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be\nexpensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla\nbits a practical topic.\n  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single\nbase gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of\nthe 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three\nmain results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can\ngenerate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated\nToffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations\nusing no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative\nreversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known\nresult for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known\nresult for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is\ntrivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove\ntheir optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible\ngates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We\nalso explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new\nconcept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate\nall n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an\nunlimited number of borrowed bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 19:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

The mechanism giving rise to this kind of\nphenomenon is uncertain, although a large data set has been built. In the\nframework of star-quake model, based on~\\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the\nrelative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$\ndepend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies\ncorresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter\ncandidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)\nwhich are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to\nhave more small size glitches, whose values of $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ are\nsmaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released\nenergy). Based on the assumption that in our Galaxy the distribution of SNs is\nsimilar to that of dark matter, as well as on the glitch data in ATNF Pulsar\nCatalogue and Jodrell Bank glitch table, we find that in our Galaxy the\nincidences of small size glitches exhibit tendencies consistent with the\ncollision rates of pulsars and strange nuggets.

The continued fraction expansion of the binomial series is\ngeneralized and algebraic approximation functions are given instead of rational\napproximation functions. In doing so I proceed exactly as in my work on the\nexponential function(8). Integrals are set up for the approximation functions;\nthus the estimates become much easier and you can prove Thue's theorem with\nSiegel's Exponents for the binomial algebraic equations without difficulty and\nwithout use of the pigeonhole principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}
