Here we report on VLT/GIRAFFE spectra of candidate\nmember stars in two recently discovered ultra-faint satellites Reticulum 2 and\nHorologium 1, obtained as part of the ongoing Gaia-ESO Survey. We identify 18\nmembers in Reticulum 2 and 5 in Horologium 1. We find Reticulum 2 to have a\nvelocity dispersion of ~3.22 km/s, implying a M/L ratio of ~ 500. We have\ninferred stellar parameters for all candidates and we find Reticulum 2 to have\na mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.46+/-0.1, with an intrinsic dispersion of ~\n0.29, and is alpha-enhanced to the level of [alpha/Fe]~0.4.

The line-of-sight velocity of Reticulum 2 is offset by\nsome 100 km/s from the prediction of the orbital velocity of the LMC, thus\nmaking its association with the Cloud uncertain. However, at the location of\nHorologium 1, both the backward integrated LMC's orbit and the LMC's halo are\npredicted to have radial velocities similar to that of the dwarf.

However, to recognize cancer subtypes\nautomatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images\n(WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer\nsubtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch\nscale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level\nclassifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an\nimage-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine\npatch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will\nbe discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate\npatch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our\nknowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates\ndiscriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of\npatches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell\nlung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method\nis similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists.

In particular, *relative expressiveness\nanalysis* techniques have used formal mappings called *simulations* to explore\nwhether one access control system is capable of emulating another, thereby\ncomparing the expressive power of these systems. Unfortunately, the notions of\nexpressiveness simulation that have been explored vary widely, which makes it\ndifficult to compare results in the literature, and even leads to apparent\ncontradictions between results. Furthermore, some notions of expressiveness\nsimulation make use of non-determinism, and thus cannot be used to define\nmappings between access control systems that are useful in practical scenarios.\nIn this work, we define the minimum set of properties for an *implementable*\naccess control simulation; i.e., a deterministic \"recipe\" for using one system\nin place of another. We then define a wide range of properties spread across\nseveral dimensions that can be enforced on top of this minimum definition.\nThese properties define a taxonomy that can be used to separate and compare\nexisting notions of access control simulation, many of which were previously\nincomparable. We position existing notions of simulation within our properties\nlattice by formally proving each simulation's equivalence to a corresponding\nset of properties. Lastly, we take steps towards bridging the gap between\ntheory and practice by exploring the systems implications of points within our\nproperties lattice. This shows that relative expressive analysis is more than\njust a theoretical tool, and can also guide the choice of the most suitable\naccess control system for a specific application or scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 18:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 22:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

The temporal graph exploration problem TEXP is the problem of\ncomputing a foremost exploration schedule for a temporal graph, i.e., a\ntemporal walk that starts at a given start node, visits all nodes of the graph,\nand has the smallest arrival time. In the first part of the paper, we consider\nonly undirected temporal graphs that are connected at each time step. For such\ntemporal graphs with $n$ nodes, we show that it is \\NP-hard to approximate TEXP\nwith ratio $O(n^{1-\\varepsilon})$ for every $\\varepsilon>0$. We also provide an\nexplicit construction of temporal graphs that require $\\Theta(n^2)$ time steps\nto be explored.

In the\nthird part of the paper, we consider settings where the graphs in future time\nsteps are not known and the exploration schedule is constructed online. We\nreplace the connectedness assumption by a weaker assumption and show that\n$m$-edge temporal graphs with regularly present edges and with\nprobabilistically present edges can be explored online in $O(m)$ time steps and\n$O(m \\log n)$ time steps with high probability, respectively.

Due to\nthis additional term, quantum electromagnetic and phase fluctuations lead to a\nrobust topologically non-trivial state that holds also in the presence of\ninteractions. In this sense, we show that the renormalization flow of the\ntopologically nontrivial phase cannot be continuously deformed into a\ntopologically non-trivial one.

The instability - christened `boundary\ninflow instability' here - is of critical layer type where this layer is either\nat the inflow wall and the growth rate is $O(\\sqrt{\\eta})$ (as found by Ilin \\&\nMorgulis 2013), or in the interior of the flow and the growth rate is $O(\\eta\n\\log 1/\\eta)$ where $\\eta$ measures the (small) inflow-to-tangential-flow\nratio.

This thesis investigates\na systematic method of creating abstract interpreters from traditional\ninterpreters, called Abstracting Abstract Machines.\n  Abstract interpreters are difficult to develop due to technical, theoretical,\nand pragmatic problems. Technical problems include engineering data structures\nand algorithms. I show that modest and simple changes to the mathematical\npresentation of abstract machines result in 1000 times better running time -\njust seconds for moderately sized programs.\n  In the theoretical realm, abstraction can make correctness difficult to\nascertain.

Even if we don't\ntrust the proof, we can run models concretely against test suites to better\ntrust them.\n  In the pragmatic realm, I show that the systematic process of abstracting\nabstract machines is automatable. I develop a meta-language for expressing\nabstract machines similar to other semantics engineering languages. The\nlanguage's special feature is that it provides an interface to abstract\nallocation.

Such QSLs,\nhowever, have proven difficult to identify experimentally. The most promising\napproach is to study their exotic nature via the wave-vector and intensity\ndependence of their dynamical response in neutron scattering. A major search\nhas centered on iridate materials which are proposed to realize the celebrated\nKitaev model on a honeycomb lattice - a prototypical topological QSL system in\ntwo dimensions (2D). The difficulties of iridium for neutron measurements have,\nhowever, impeded progress significantly. Here we provide experimental evidence\nthat a material based on ruthenium, {\\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ realizes the same Kitaev\nphysics but is highly amenable to neutron investigation. Our measurements\nconfirm the requisite strong spin-orbit coupling, and a low temperature\nmagnetic order that matches the predicted phase proximate to the QSL.

Thus, to\nestablish basic types, the analysis must reason precisely about values, but in\nthe presence of higher-order functions and polymorphism, this reasoning itself\ncan require basic types. In this paper we address this chicken-and-egg problem\nby introducing the framework of two-phased typing. The first \"trust\" phase\nperforms classical, i.e. flow-, path- and value-insensitive type checking to\nassign basic types to various program expressions. When the check inevitably\nruns into \"errors\" due to value-insensitivity, it wraps problematic expressions\nwith DEAD-casts, which explicate the trust obligations that must be discharged\nby the second phase. The second phase uses refinement typing, a flow- and\npath-sensitive analysis, that decorates the first phase's types with logical\npredicates to track value relationships and thereby verify the casts and\nestablish other correctness properties for dynamically typed languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 22:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-01"}

However, the use of the radio lobe luminosity in the denominator\n(essentially to try and factor out the intrinsic power of the central engine)\nhas been criticized and other proxies for the intrinsic engine power have been\nproposed. These include the optical continuum luminosity, and the luminosity of\nthe narrow-line region. Each is plausible, but so far none has been shown to be\nclearly better than the others.

The largest values of E|| are observed\nwithin double layers. The existence of double layers in the Earth's\nmagnetosphere is well documented. In our simulation their formation is\ntriggered by large parallel streaming of electrons into the reconnection\nregion. These parallel electron fluxes are required for maintaining\nquasi-neutrality of the reconnection region and increase with decreasing values\nof the normalized electron pressure upstream of the reconnection region. A\nthreshold normalized pressure is derived for strong double layers to develop.\nWe also document how the electron confinement, provided in part by the\nstructure in E||, allows sustained energization by perpendicular electric\nfields. The energization is a consequence of the confined electrons' chaotic\norbital motion that includes drifts aligned with the reconnection electric\nfield. The level of energization is proportional to the initial particle energy\nand therefore is enhanced by the initial energy boost of the acceleration\npotential, acquired by electrons entering the region.

The radial\ndistribution of the rotation frequency in the bulge region is not monotonic in\ngeneral. The amplification of the magnetic field is enhanced in regions with\nstronger differential rotation, because magnetorotational instability and\nfield-line stretching are more effective. The strength of the amplified\nmagnetic field reaches >~ 0.5 mG, and radial flows of the gas are excited by\nthe inhomogeneous transport of angular momentum through turbulent magnetic\nfield that is amplified in a spatially dependent manner. In addition, the\nmagnetic pressure-gradient force also drives radial flows in a similar manner.\nAs a result, the simulated position-velocity diagram exhibits a time-dependent\nasymmetric parallelogram-shape owing to the intermittency of the magnetic\nturbulence; the present model provides a viable alternative to the\nbar-potential-driven model for the parallelogram-shape of the central molecular\nzone. This is a natural extension into the central few 100 pc of the magnetic\nactivity, which is observed as molecular loops at radii from a few 100 pc to 1\nkpc.

Complex field geometries have been inferred in the high field MCVs\n(the polars) whilst magnetic field strength and structure in the lower field\ngroup (intermediate polars, IPs) are much harder to establish.\n  The origin of fields in MWDs is still being debated.

The model enables us to form cool dense plasma clouds\ninside a flux rope by radiative condensation, which is regarded as an\ninverse-polarity prominence. Radiative condensation is triggered by changes in\nthe magnetic topology, i.e., formation of the flux rope from the sheared arcade\nfield, and by thermal imbalance due to the dense plasma trapped inside the flux\nrope. The flux rope is created by imposing converging and shearing motion on\nthe arcade field. Either when the footpoint motion is in the anti-shearing\ndirection or when heating is proportional to local density, the thermal state\ninside the flux rope becomes cooling-dominant, leading to radiative\ncondensation. By controlling the temperature of condensation, we investigate\nthe relationship between the temperature and density of prominence and derive a\nscaling formula for this relationship. This formula suggests that the proposed\nmodel reproduce the observed density of prominence, which is 10-100 times\nlarger than the coronal density.

In this work, which is, in a sense continuation of [7], we\nwill primarily study polynomials on S-parabolic Stein manifolds. In Section 2,\nwe review different notions of paraboliticity for Stein manifolds, look at some\nexamples and go over the connections between parabolicity of a Stein manifold X\nand certain linear topological properties of the Fr\\'echet space of global\nanalytic functions on X. In Section 4 we construct an example of a S-parabolic\nmanifold, with no nontrivial polynomials. This example leads us to divide\nS-parabolic manifolds into two groups as the ones whose class of polynomials is\ndense in the corresponding space of analytic functions and the ones whose class\nof polynomials is not so rich.

Starting from a\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation, we have computed the\nevolution of the dust in a quasi-static gas density structure typical of\nself-gravitating disc. For different grain size distributions we have\ninvestigated the capability of spiral arms to trap particles. We have run 3D\nradiative transfer simulations in order to construct maps of the expected\nemission at (sub-)millimetre and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, we have\nsimulated realistic observations of our disc models at (sub-)millimetre and\nnear-infrared wavelengths as they may appear with the Atacama Large\nMillimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) and the High-Contrast Coronographic\nImager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) in order to investigate whether there are\nobservational signatures of the spiral structure. We find that the pressure\ninhomogeites induced by gravitational instabilities produce a non-negligible\ndynamical effect on centimetre sized particles leading to significant\noverdensities in spiral arms. We also find that the spiral structure is readily\ndetectable by ALMA over a wide range of (sub-)millimetre wavelengths and by\nHiCIAO in near-infrared scattered light for non-face-on discs located in the\nOphiucus star-forming region. In addition, we find clear spatial spectral index\nvariations across the disc, revealing that the dust trapping produces a\nmigration of large grains that can be potentially investigated through\nmulti-wavelenghts observations in the (sub-)millimetric. Therefore, the spiral\narms observed to date in protoplanetary disc might be interpreted as density\nwaves induced by the development of gravitational instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 07:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The library relies on JavaScript\nproxies to guarantee full interposition for contracts. It further exploits\nJavaScript's reflective features to run contracts in a sandbox environment,\nwhich guarantees that the execution of contract code does not modify the\napplication state.

Moreover, the effects of noise and\nnonlinearities can lead to \"counter-intuitive\" behavior, as demonstrated for a\nbasic enzymatic reaction scheme that can display stochastic focusing (SF).\nUnder the assumption of rapid signal fluctuations, SF has been shown to convert\na graded response into a threshold mechanism, thus attenuating the detrimental\neffects of signal noise.

We\nthen show that the inclusion of a plausible negative feedback mechanism turns\nthe system from a noisy signal detector to a strong homeostatic mechanism by\nexchanging high gain with strong attenuation in output noise and robustness to\nparameter variations. Moreover, we observe that the discrepancy between\ndeterministic and stochastic descriptions of stochastically focused systems in\nthe evolution of the means almost completely disappears, despite very low\nmolecule counts and the additional nonlinearity due to feedback.\n  The reaction mechanism considered here can provide a possible resolution to\nthe apparent conflict between intrinsic noise and high precision in critical\nintracellular processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 08:32:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 16:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

However, it is often discarded to be involved in the heating of\nwarm loops as the models do not reproduce observations. Recent simulations have\nshown that these inconsistencies with observations may be due to\noversimplifications of the geometries of the models. In addition, our recent\nobservations reveal that long-period intensity pulsations (several hours) are\ncommon in solar coronal loops. These periods are consistent with those expected\nfrom TNE. The aim of this paper is to derive characteristic physical properties\nof the plasma for some of these events to test the potential role of TNE in\nloop heating. We analyzed three events in detail using the six EUV coronal\nchannels of SDO/AIA. We performed both a Differential Emission Measure (DEM)\nand a time-lag analysis, including a new method to isolate the relevant signal\nfrom the foreground and background emission. For the three events, the DEM\nundergoes long-period pulsations, which is a signature of periodic heating even\nthough the loops are captured in their cooling phase, as is the bulk of the\nactive regions. We link long-period intensity pulsations to new signatures of\nloop heating with strong evidence for evaporation and condensation cycles. We\nthus witness simultaneously widespread cooling and TNE.

To this aim, we theoretically evaluate the evolution of the\nemission from both the lobe and the shell, which are composed of shocked jet\nmatter and a shocked ambient medium, respectively. Based on a simple dynamical\nmodel of expanding lobe and shell, we clarify how the broadband spectrum of\neach component evolves before and after the cessation of the jet activity. It\nis shown that the spectrum is strongly dominated by the lobe emission while the\njet is active ($t \\leq t_j$). On the other hand, once the jet activity has\nceased ($t > t_j$), the lobe emission fades out rapidly, since fresh electrons\nare no longer supplied from the jet. Meanwhile, shell emission only shows a\ngradual decrease, since accelerated electrons are continuously supplied from\nthe bow shock that is propagating into the ambient medium. As a result, overall\nemission from the shell overwhelms that from the lobe at wide range of\nfrequencies from radio up to gamma-ray soon after the jet activity has ceased.\nOur result predicts a new class of dead radio sources that are dominated by\nshell emission. We suggest that the emission from the shell can be probed in\nparticular at a radio wavelengths with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) phase\n1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 10:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 03:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

The conventional theory of magnetic neutron\nscattering, which dates back to Schwinger (1937) and Trammell (1953), yields an\napproximation for the scattering amplitude in terms of magnetic dipoles formed\nwith the spin (S) and orbital angular momentum (L) of valence electrons. The\nso-called dipole-approximation has been widely adopted by researchers during\nthe past few decades that has seen neutron scattering develop to its present\nstatus as the method of choice for investigations of magnetic structure and\nexcitations.

We verify that the diffeological tensor\nproduct enjoys the typical properties of the usual tensor product, after which\nwe focus on the so-called smooth direct sum decompositions, a phenomenon\nexclusive to the diffeological setting. We then consider the so-called\npseudo-metrics (diffeological analogues of scalar products), and discuss the\nconsequent decompositions of vector spaces into a smooth direct sum of the\nmaximal isotropic subspace and a characteristic subspace; we show that such a\ndecomposition actually depends only on the choice of the coordinate system.\nFurthermore, we show that, contrary to what was erroneously claimed (by me)\nelsewhere, a characteristic subspace is not unique and is not invariant under\nthe diffeomorphisms of the space on itself. The maximal isotropic subspace is\non the other hand an invariant of the space itself, and this fact allows to\nassign to each its well-defined characteristic quotient, obtaining another\nfunctor, this time a contravariant one, to the category of standard vector\nspaces.

Classical asperity theories predict, in agreement\nwith experimental observations, that adhesion is always destroyed by roughness\nexcept if the amplitude of the same is extremely small, and the materials are\nparticularly soft. This happens for all fractal dimensions. However, these\ntheories are limited due to the geometrical simplification, which may be\nparticularly strong in conditions near full contact. We introduce therefore a\nsimple model for adhesion, which aims at being rigorous near full contact,\nwhere we postulate there are only small isolated gaps between the two bodies.\nThe gaps can be considered as \"pressurized cracks\" by using Ken Johnson's idea\nof searching a corrective solution to the full contact solution. The solution\nis an extension of the adhesive-less solution proposed recently by Xu, Jackson,\nand Marghitu (XJM model) (2014). This process seems to confirm recent theories\nusing the JKR theory, namely that the effect of adhesion depends critically on\nthe fractal dimension. For D<2.5, the case which includes the vast majority of\nnatural surfaces, there is an expected strong effect of adhesion. Only for\nlarge fractal dimensions, D>2.5, seems for large enough magnifications that a\nfull fractal roughness completely destroys adhesion. These results are partly\nparadoxical since strong adhesion is not observed in nature except in special\ncases. A possible way out of the paradox may be that the conclusion is relevant\nfor the near full contact regime, where the strong role of flaws at the\ninterfaces, and of gaps full of contaminant, trapped air or liquid in pressure,\nneeds to be further explored. If conditions near full contact are not achieved\non loading, probably the conclusions of classical asperity theories may be\nconfirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 14:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 07:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

Initially, sensors obtain inaccurate estimations of an external time\nreference and subsequently collaborate in order to synchronize their internal\nclocks with the external time. For simplicity, we adopt the drift-free\nassumption, where internal clocks are assumed to tick at the same pace. Hence,\nthe problem is reduced to an estimation problem, in which the sensors need to\nestimate the initial external time. This work is further relevant to the\nproblem of collective approximation of environmental values by biological\ngroups.\n  Unlike most works on clock synchronization that assume static networks, this\npaper focuses on an extreme case of highly dynamic networks. Specifically, we\nassume a non-adaptive scheduler adversary that dictates in advance an\narbitrary, yet independent, meeting pattern. Such meeting patterns fit, for\nexample, with short-time scenarios in highly dynamic settings, where each\nsensor interacts with only few other arbitrary sensors.\n  We propose an extremely simple clock synchronization algorithm that is based\non weighted averages, and prove that its performance on any given independent\nmeeting pattern is highly competitive with that of the best possible algorithm,\nwhich operates without any resource or computational restrictions, and knows\nthe meeting pattern in advance. In particular, when all distributions involved\nare Gaussian, the performances of our scheme coincide with the optimal\nperformances. Our proofs rely on an extensive use of the concept of Fisher\ninformation. We use the Cramer-Rao bound and our definition of a Fisher Channel\nCapacity to quantify information flows and to obtain lower bounds on collective\nperformance. This opens the door for further rigorous quantifications of\ninformation flows within collaborative sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 14:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 12:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

Motivated by\nthis, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent\ncomputational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to\ncapture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber\nis frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a\ncertain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the\ngoal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only\nvulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes\nhave prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by\nchanging only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber.\nWe further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem\nnamely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery\nwhere the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or\ndifferent.\n  We study the computational complexity of the above problems for unweighted\nand weighted elections for several commonly used voting rules.

However, there have\nbeen reports of fast variations in obscured Seyfert galaxies in X-rays, which\nrises the question whether microvariations can also be detected in obscured\nAGNs in the optical regime.

However, it is also known that the driver\ntilts his or her head toward the curve center when negotiating a curve, whereas\nthe passenger's head moves in the opposite direction. Therefore, we\nhypothesized that the head-tilt strategy has the effect of reducing the\nseverity of carsickness. Method: A passenger car was driven on a quasi-oval\ntrack with a pylon slalom while the participant sat in the navigator seat. The\nexperiment was terminated when either the participant felt the initial symptoms\nof motion sickness or the car finished 20 laps. In the natural head-tilt\ncondition, the participants were instructed to sit naturally, to relax, and not\nto oppose the lateral acceleration intentionally. In the active head-tilt\ncondition, the participants were asked to tilt their heads against the\ncentrifugal acceleration, thus imitating the driver's head tilt.

A promising approach is to\ntake advantage of the technological maturity of nano-electromechanical systems\n(NEMS) and to combine it with on-chip optics. However, in scaling down the\ndimensions of such integrated devices, the coupling of a NEMS to optical fields\nbecomes challenging. Despite recent progress in nano-optomechanical coupling,\nactive control of optical fields at the nanoscale has not been achieved with an\non-chip NEMS thus far. Here, we show a new type of hybrid system, which\nconsists of an on-chip graphene NEMS suspended a few tens of nanometers above\nnitrogen-vacancy centres (NVC), which are stable single photon emitters\nembedded in nano-diamonds. Electromechanical control of the photons emitted by\nthe NVC is provided by electrostatic tuning of the graphene NEMS position,\nwhich is transduced to a modulation of NVC emission intensity. The\noptomechanical coupling between the graphene displacement and the NVC emission\nis based on near-field dipole-dipole interaction. This class of optomechanical\ncoupling increases strongly for smaller distances, making it suitable for\ndevices with nanoscale dimensions. These achievements hold promise for the\nselective control of single-emitter arrays on chip, optical spectroscopy of\nindividual nano-objects, integrated optomechanical information processing and\nquantum optomechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 15:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-01"}

It is\nthought that a large portion of H2 forms by association of hydrogen atoms to\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We model the influence of PAHs on\ntotal H2 formation rates in photodissociation regions (PDRs) and assess the\neffect of these formation rates on the total cloud structure. We set up a\nchemical kinetic model at steady state in a PDR environment and included\nadiative transfer to calculate the chemistry at different depths in the PDR.\nThis model includes known dust grain chemistry for the formation of H2 and a H2\nformation mechanism on PAHs. Since H2 formation on PAHs is impeded by thermal\nbarriers, this pathway is only efficient at higher temperatures (T > 200 K). At\nthese temperatures the conventional route of H2 formation via H atoms\nphysisorbed on dust grains is no longer feasible, so the PAH mechanism enlarges\nthe region where H2 formation is possible. We find that PAHs have a significant\ninfluence on the structure of PDRs. The extinction at which the transition from\natomic to molecular hydrogen occurs strongly depends on the presence of PAHs,\nespecially for PDRs with a strong external radiation field. A sharp spatial\ntransition between fully dehydrogenated PAHs on the outside of the cloud and\nnormally hydrogenated PAHs on the inside is found. As a proof of concept, we\nuse coronene to show that H2 forms very efficiently on PAHs, and that this\nprocess can reproduce the high H2 formation rates derived in several PDRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 15:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

At low pressure the molecules are\ndelocalized between the two minima of a given molecular potential while at\nhigher pressure they become localized in one minimum due to the intermolecular\ndipole-dipole interactions. Evidence for such a phase transition is provided by\nmeasurements of the inversion spectrum of ammonia and deuterated ammonia at\ndifferent pressures. In particular, at pressure greater than a critical value\nno inversion line is observed. These data are well accounted for by a model\npreviously developed and recently extended to mixtures. In the present paper,\nwe discuss the variation of the critical pressure in binary mixtures as a\nfunction of the fractions of the constituents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 20:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 12:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

In other words, we will look at evolutionary competition of\npayoff transformations in \"meta-games\", obtained from averaging over payoffs of\nsingle games.
