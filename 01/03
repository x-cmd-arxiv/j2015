Bipartite networks are a special type of complex networks in which\nnodes are decomposed into two disjoint sets, and only nodes between the two\nsets can be connected. Bipartite networks represent diverse interaction\npatterns in many real-world systems, such as predator-prey networks,\nplant-pollinator networks, and drug-target networks. While community detection\nin unipartite networks has been extensively studied in the past decade,\nidentification of modules or communities in bipartite networks is still in its\nearly stage. Several quantitative functions proposed for evaluating the quality\nof bipartite network divisions are based on null models and have distinct\nresolution limits. In this paper, we propose a new quantitative function for\ncommunity detection in bipartite networks, and demonstrate that this\nquantitative function is superior to the widely used Barber's bipartite\nmodularity and other functions. Based on the new quantitative function, the\nbipartite network community detection problem is formulated into an integer\nprogramming model.

The recently proposed stochastic gradient\nLangevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it\ngenerates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the\nMetropolis-Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing\nstep sizes. In \\cite{TehThierryVollmerSGLD2014}, we provided the mathematical\nfoundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a\ncentral limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively\nsmall number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The\npresent article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In\nparticular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its\ndependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On\nthat basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the\nvariance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is\nderived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias,\nvariance and mean squared error (MSE).

It has long been known that kiloparsec-scale jets in\nradio galaxies can be divided into two flavours: strong (found in powerful\nsources, narrow and terminating in compact hot-spots) and weak (found in\nlow-luminosity sources, geometrically flaring, unable to form hot-spots and\nterminating in diffuse lobes or tails). We have developed methods to model AGN\njets as intrinsically symmetrical, relativistic flows by fitting to deep,\nwell-resolved radio images in Stokes I, Q and U. This has yielded a wealth of\ninformation about the brightest few weak-flavour jets. Our first key objective\nis to observe large samples of weak and transition jets at 0.1 - 0.5 arcsec\nresolution with SKA1-MID. This would allow us to see how jet propagation\ndepends on power and environment and to quantify the energy and momentum input\ninto the IGM.

In earlier work of Grimmett and Li, a locality theorem was proved for\nconnective constants, namely, that the connective constants of two graphs are\nclose in value whenever the graphs agree on a large ball around the origin. A\ncondition of the theorem was that the graphs support so-called 'unimodular\ngraph height functions'. When the graphs are Cayley graphs of infinite,\nfinitely generated groups, there is a special type of unimodular graph height\nfunction termed here a 'group height function'. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the existence of a group height function is presented, and may be\napplied in the context of the bridge constant, and of the locality of\nconnective constants for Cayley graphs. Locality may thereby be established for\na variety of infinite groups including those with strictly positive deficiency.\n  It is proved that a large class of Cayley graphs support unimodular graph\nheight functions, that are in addition harmonic on the graph. This implies, for\nexample, the existence of unimodular graph height functions for the Cayley\ngraphs of finitely generated solvable groups. It turns out that graphs with\nnon-unimodular automorphism subgroups also possess graph height functions, but\nthe resulting graph height functions need not be harmonic.\n  Group height functions, as well as the graph height functions of the previous\nparagraph, are non-constant harmonic functions with linear growth and an\nadditional property of having periodic differences. The existence of such\nfunctions on Cayley graphs is a topic of interest beyond their applications in\nthe theory of self-avoiding walks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 20:34:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 18:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 11:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 15:04:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 18:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

We\nfind that such models, in contrast to MBL systems with quenched disorder,\ntypically exhibit much more severe finite-size effects due to the presence of\ntwo or more vastly different energy scales. In a finite system, this can easily\ncreate an artificial splitting of the density of states (DOS) into bands\nseparated by large energy gaps. We argue that in order for such models to\nfaithfully represent the physics of the thermodynamic limit, the ratio of the\nrelevant coupling parameters must be larger than a certain cutoff that depends\non system size, and should be chosen in such a way that various bands in the\nDOS of a given model overlap with one another. By setting the parameters in\nthis way to minimize the finite-size effects, we then perform exact\ndiagonalization studies of several translation-invariant MBL candidate models.\nBased on the variety of diagnostics, including entanglement properties and the\nbehaviour of local observables, we find the systems exhibit thermal (ergodic),\nrather than MBL-like behaviour.

We also find\nthat including thermal conduction, which would tend to increase the surface\nbrightnesses of interfaces between hot and cold gas, would not overcome the\nsurface brightness shortfall. However, charge exchange emission from such\ninterfaces, not included in the current model, may be significant. The\nfaintness of the model may also be due to the lack of cosmic ray driving,\nmeaning that the model may underestimate the amount of material transported\nfrom the disk to halo. In addition, an extended hot halo of accreted material\nmay be important, by supplying hot electrons that could boost the emission of\nthe material driven out from the disk. Additional model predictions are needed\nto test the relative importance of these processes in explaining the observed\nhalo emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 21:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

One of the few way to test this idea is to\nlook for evidence of the relic inhomogeneities left by the collisions between\nother bubbles and our own. Such relic inhomogeneities induces a coherent bulk\nflow over gigaparsec scales. Therefore, bubble collisions leave unique imprints\nin the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich\n(kSZ) effect, temperature anisotropies induced by the scattering of photons\nfrom coherently moving free electrons in the diffuse intergalactic medium. The\nkSZ signature produced by bubble collisions has a unique directional dependence\nand is tightly correlated with the galaxy distribution; it can therefore be\ndistinguished from other contributions to the CMB anisotropies. An important\nadvantage of the kSZ signature is that it peaks on arcminute angular scales,\nwhere the limiting factors in making a detection are instrumental noise and\nforeground subtraction.

In\nthis article, we review theoretical studies of the Fermi liquid theory and\nCooper pairing instabilities of both electric and magnetic dipolar fermionic\nsystems from the perspective of unconventional symmetries. When the electric\ndipole moments are aligned by the external electric field, their interactions\nexhibit the explicit $d_{r^2-3z^2}$ anisotropy. The Fermi liquid properties,\nincluding the single-particle spectra, thermodynamic susceptibilities, and\ncollective excitations, are all affected by this anisotropy. The electric\ndipolar interaction provides a mechanism for the unconventional spin triplet\nCooper pairing, which is different from the usual spin-fluctuation mechanism in\nsolids and the superfluid $^3$He. Furthermore, the competition between pairing\ninstabilities in the singlet and triplet channels gives rise to a novel\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking superfluid state. Unlike electric dipole\nmoments which are induced by electric fields and unquantized, magnetic dipole\nmoments are intrinsic proportional to the hyperfine-spin operators with a Lande\nfactor. Its effects even manifest in unpolarized systems exhibiting an\nisotropic but spin-orbit coupled nature. The resultant spin-orbit coupled Fermi\nliquid theory supports a collective sound mode exhibiting a topologically\nnon-trivial spin distribution over the Fermi surface. It also leads to a novel\n$p$-wave spin triplet Cooper pairing state whose spin and orbital angular\nmomentum are entangled to the total angular momentum $J=1$ dubbed the\n$J$-triplet pairing. This $J$-triplet pairing phase is different from both the\nspin-orbit coupled $^3$He-$B$ phase with $J=0$ and the spin-orbit decoupled\n$^3$He-$A$ phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 2015 07:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

Our main findings\nare: 1) at the epoch of the formation of the Solar System, our reference model\nproduces super-solar abundances for the whole s-only distribution, even in the\nrange 90<A<130; 2) within errors, the s-only distribution relative to 150Sm is\nflat; 3) the s-process contribution of the less massive AGB stars (M<1.5 M_SUN)\nas well as of the more massive ones (M>4.0 M_SUN) are negligible; 4) the\ninclusion of rotation implies a downward shift of the whole distribution with\nan higher efficiency for the heavy s-only isotopes, leading to a flatter s-only\ndistribution; 5) different prescriptions on convection or mass-loss produce\nnearly rigid shifts of the whole distribution. In summary, a variation of the\nstandard paradigm of AGB nucleosynthesis would allow to reconcile models\npredictions with Solar System s-only abundances.

The parameters of the systems and forcing\nare chosen to guarantee autoresonance (AR) with gradually increasing energy in\nthe nonlinear actuator. As this paper demonstrates, forcing with constant\nfrequency generates oscillations with growing energy in the linear chain but in\nthe system excited by forcing with slowly time-dependent frequency energy\nremains localized on the nonlinear actuator whilst the response of the linear\nchain is bounded. This means that the systems that seem to be almost identical\nexhibit different dynamical behavior caused by their different resonance\nproperties.

These\nproblems are considered as means to obtain a deep understanding of the class C.\n  It is usual for such classes to be defined by logical formalisms. Logics are\noften built on top of each other, by adding new predicates. A natural\nconstruction is to enrich a logic with the successor relation. In this paper,\nwe obtain simple self-contained proofs of two transfer results: we show that\nfor suitable logically defined classes, the membership, resp. the separation\nproblem for a class enriched with the successor relation reduces to the same\nproblem for the original class.\n  Our reductions work both for languages of finite words and infinite words.\nThe proofs are mostly self-contained, and only require a basic background on\nregular languages. This paper therefore gives new, simple proofs of results\nthat were considered as difficult, such as the decid- ability of the membership\nproblem for the levels 1, 3/2, 2 and 5/2 of the dot-depth hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 2015 15:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

Special attention is paid to the regime where\nacquisition of qubit information and backaction upon the measured system\nexhibit nontrivial correlation. The intrinsic dynamics of the qubit gives rise\nto dynamical blockade of tunneling events through the detector, resulting in a\nsuper-Poissonian noise.

In contrast,\nan inhibition of dephasing is entailed by the reduction of information\nacquisition in the dynamically blockaded regimes.

One, from the average view a linear\nlaw exists between the individual's travel distance with his original distance\nto city center. The mechanism underlying is a travel pattern we called \"ring\naggregation\", i.e., the daily movement of city passengers is just aggregating\nto a ring with roughly equal distance to city center.Interestingly, for the\nround trips the daily travel pattern can be regarded as a switching between the\nhome ring at outer area with the office ring at the inner area. Second, this\nlinear law and ring aggregation pattern seems to be an exclusive characteristic\nof the metro system.
