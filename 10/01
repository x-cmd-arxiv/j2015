Very important clues, however, can be inferred by studying the\nafterglows of these events. We present optical and X-ray observations of GRB\n130831A obtained by Swift, Chandra, Skynet, RATIR, Maidanak, ISON, NOT, LT and\nGTC. This burst shows a steep drop in the X-ray light-curve at $\\simeq 10^5$ s\nafter the trigger, with a power-law decay index of $\\alpha \\sim 6$. Such a rare\nbehaviour cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (FS) model and\nindicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at $10^5$ s, must be of\n\"internal origin\", produced by a dissipation process within an\nultrarelativistic outflow. We propose that the source of such an outflow, which\nmust produce the X-ray flux for $\\simeq 1$ day in the cosmological rest frame,\nis a newly born magnetar or black hole. After the drop, the faint X-ray\nafterglow continues with a much shallower decay. The optical emission, on the\nother hand, shows no break across the X-ray steep decrease, and the late-time\ndecays of both the X-ray and optical are consistent. Using both the X-ray and\noptical data, we show that the emission after $\\simeq 10^5$ s can be explained\nwell by the FS model. We model our data to derive the kinetic energy of the\nejecta and thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a GRB with\nemission of internal origin visible for a long time. Furthermore, we break down\nthe energy budget of this GRB into the prompt emission, the late internal\ndissipation, the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it with\nthe energy of the associated supernova, SN 2013fu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 16:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-07"}

In this paper, we investigate how the mobile users (MUs) can\neffectively offload traffic by taking advantage of the capability of\ndual-connectivity, which enables an MU to simultaneously communicate with a\nmacro base station (BS) and a small-cell access point (AP) via two\nradio-interfaces. Offloading traffic to the AP usually reduces the MUs' mobile\ndata cost, but often at the expense of suffering increased interferences from\nother MUs at the same AP. We thus formulate an optimization problem that\njointly determines each MU's traffic schedule (between the BS and AP) and power\ncontrol (between two radio-interfaces). The system objective is to minimize all\nMUs' total cost, while satisfying each MU's transmit-power constraints through\nproper interference control. In spite of the non-convexity of the problem, we\ndesign both a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm to solve the\njoint optimization problem. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms\ncan achieve the close-to-optimum results comparing with the ones achieved by\nthe LINGO (a commercial optimization software), but with significantly less\ncomputational complexity.

As suggested by our\ntheoretical analysis of the algorithms for a variety of special cases, an\nextensive set of numerical experiments clearly indicate that all of the\nBDF-based ADI algorithms proposed in this paper are \"quasi-unconditionally\nstable\" in the following sense: each algorithm is stable for all couples\n$(h,\\Delta t)$ of spatial and temporal mesh sizes in a problem-dependent\nrectangular neighborhood of the form $(0,M_h)\\times (0,M_t)$.

In a seminal paper by Son and Stephanov in the year 2001, it\nwas conjectured that the low energy dynamics of QCD with two light flavors at\nasymptotically high isospin density was described by that of a pure Yang-Mills\neffective Lagrangian. Since the existence of a first order deconfinement phase\ntransition with increasing temperature is a feature of every pure SU(N)\nYang-Mills theory with N greater than or equal to 3, the regime considered in\nthis paper is also expected to exhibit a first order deconfinement phase\ntransition with increasing temperature. However, the low energy constants(LEC)\nof this pure Yang-Mills theory have not been calculated till date. We calculate\nthe LEC s for this effective theory which in turn enables us to calculate the\ncritical temperature of the deconfinement transition as a function of the\nisospin chemical potential $\\mu_I$.The scaling of the critical temperature as a\nfunction of the isospin chemical potential that we find in this paper can be\ncompared with future lattice calculations at finite isospin density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 18:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

In fact, for $D\\ge 3$, the\nprobability increases towards unity as the mass grows above the relevant\n$D$-dimensional Planck scale $m_D$. At fixed mass, however, $P_{\\rm BH}$\ndecreases with increasing $D$, so that a particle with mass $m\\simeq m_D$ has\njust about $10\\%$ probability to be a black hole in $D=5$, and smaller for\nlarger $D$. This result has a potentially strong impact on estimates of black\nhole production in colliders. In contrast, for $D=1$, we find the probability\nis comparably larger for smaller masses, but $P_{\\rm BH} < 0.5$, suggesting\nthat such lower dimensional black holes are purely quantum and not classical\nobjects. This result is consistent with recent observations that sub-Planckian\nblack holes are governed by an effective two-dimensional gravitation theory.\nLastly, we derive Generalised Uncertainty Principle relations for the black\nholes under consideration, and find a minimum length corresponding to a\ncharacteristic energy scale of the order of the fundamental gravitational mass\n$m_D$ in $D>3$. For $D=1$ we instead find the uncertainty due to the horizon\nfluctuations has the same form as the usual Heisenberg contribution, and\ntherefore no fundamental scale exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 19:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 20:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 20:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

Mathematically,\nthese channels correspond to completely positive trace-preserving maps defined\nby the Hadamard product of the initial density matrix with a time-dependent\nmatrix which carries the knowledge about the evolution. Physically, there is a\nstrong motivation for considering this kind of evolution because such channels\nappear naturally in the theory of open quantum systems. The main idea behind a\ndynamic approach to quantum tomography claims that by performing the same kind\nof measurement at some time instants one can obtain new data for state\nreconstruction. Thus, this approach leads to a decrease in the number of\ndistinct observables which are required for quantum tomography; however, the\nexact benefit for employing the dynamic approach depends strictly on how the\nquantum system evolves in time. Algebraic analysis of phase-damping channels\nallows one to determine optimal criteria for quantum tomography of systems in\nquestion. General theorems and observations presented in the paper are\naccompanied by a specific example, which shows step by step how the theory\nworks. The results introduced in this article can potentially be applied in\nexperiments where there is a tendency a look at quantum tomography from the\npoint of view of economy of measurements, because each distinct kind of\nmeasurement requires, in general, preparing a separate setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 19:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 14:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 19:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The power flow equations are a\nsystem of multivariate nonlinear equations which relate the power injections\nand voltages in a power system. A plethora of methods have been devised to\nsolve these equations, starting from Newton-based methods to homotopy\ncontinuation and other optimization-based methods. While many of these methods\noften efficiently find a high-voltage, stable solution due to its large basin\nof attraction, most of the methods struggle to find low-voltage solutions which\nplay significant role in certain stability-related computations. While we do\nnot claim to have exhausted the existing literature on all related methods,\nthis tutorial paper introduces some of the recent advances in methods for\nsolving power flow equations to the wider power systems community as well as\nbringing attention from the computational mathematics and optimization\ncommunities to the power systems problems. After briefly reviewing some of the\ntraditional computational methods used to solve the power flow equations, we\nfocus on three emerging methods: the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation\nmethod, Groebner basis techniques, and moment/sum-of-squares relaxations using\nsemidefinite programming. In passing, we also emphasize the importance of an\nupper bound on the number of solutions of the power flow equations and review\nthe current status of research in this direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 23:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Trade between agents employs a double oral auction (DOA) in which\nboth buyers and sellers call out bids or offers which an auctioneer recognizes.\nTransactions resulting from accepted bids and offers are recorded. This\ncontinues until there are no more acceptable bids or offers. Remarkably, the\nexperiment consistently terminates in a Walrasian price. The main result of\nthis paper is a mechanism in the spirit of the DOA that converges to a\nWalrasian equilibrium in a polynomial number of steps, thus providing a\ntheoretical basis for the above-described empirical phenomenon.

Observations indicate that the\nmajority of stars are found in binary systems, while most stars with masses\ngreater than $0.5 M_\\odot$ are formed in star clusters. In addition, since\nbinaries are on average more massive than single stars, in resolved star\nclusters these systems are thought to be good tracers of (dynamical) mass\nsegregation. Over time, dynamical evolution through two-body relaxation will\ncause the most massive objects to migrate to the cluster center, while the\nrelatively lower-mass objects remain in or migrate to orbits at greater radii.\nThis process will globally dominate a cluster's stellar distribution. However,\nclose encounters involving binary systems may disrupt `soft' binaries. This\nprocess will occur more frequently in a cluster's central, dense region than in\nits periphery, which may mask the effects of mass segregation. Using high\nresolution Hubble Space Telescope observations, combined with sophisticated\n$N$-body simulations, we investigate the radial distributions of the\nmain-sequence binary fractions in massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star\nclusters. We show that binary disruption may play an important role on very\nshort timescales, depending on the environmental conditions in the cluster\ncores. This may lead to radial binary fractions that initially decline in the\ncluster centers, which is contrary to the effects expected from dynamical mass\nsegregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 03:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering.

In addition to the\ntraditional first-order gradient methods, recent techniques investigate\nsplitting-based methods dividing the SR problem into up-sampling and\ndeconvolution steps that can be easily solved. Instead of following this\nsplitting strategy, we propose to deal with the decimation and blurring\noperators simultaneously by taking advantage of their particular properties in\nthe frequency domain, leading to a new fast SR approach. Specifically, an\nanalytical solution can be obtained and implemented efficiently for the\nGaussian prior or any other regularization that can be formulated into an\n$\\ell_2$-regularized quadratic model, i.e., an $\\ell_2$-$\\ell_2$ optimization\nproblem. Furthermore, the flexibility of the proposed SR scheme is shown\nthrough the use of various priors/regularizations, ranging from generic image\npriors to learning-based approaches. In the case of non-Gaussian priors, we\nshow how the analytical solution derived from the Gaussian case can be embedded\nintotraditional splitting frameworks, allowing the computation cost of existing\nalgorithms to be decreased significantly. Simulation results conducted on\nseveral images with different priors illustrate the effectiveness of our fast\nSR approach compared with the existing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 08:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 09:51:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 13:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

Energetic radiation transfers energy to\nthe ISM: from the UV photons, emitted by the massive stars, to X- and\n$\\gamma$-ray ones. Cosmic rays are another source of energy. Finally,\nmechanical energy is injected through shocks or turbulence. Shocks are\nubiquitous in the interstellar medium of galaxies. They are associated to star\nformation (through jets and bipolar outflows), life (via stellar winds), and\ndeath (in AGB stellar winds or supernovae explosion). The dynamical processes\nleading to the formation of molecular clouds also generate shocks where flows\nof interstellar matter collide. Because of their ubiquity, the study of\ninterstellar shocks is also a useful probe to the other mechanisms of energy\ninjection in the ISM. This study must be conducted in order to understand the\nevolution of the ISM as a whole, and to address various questions: what is the\npeculiar chemistry associated to shocks, and what is their contribution to the\ncycle of matter in galaxies ? What is the energetic impact of shocks on their\nsurroundings on various scales, and hence what is the feedback of stars on the\ngalaxies ? What are the scenarios of star formation, whether this star\nformation leads to the propagation of shocks, or whether it is triggered by\nshock propagation ? What is the role of shocks in the acceleration of cosmic\nrays ? Can they shed light on their composition and diffusion processes ? In\norder to progress on these questions, it is paramount to interpret the most\nprecise observations with the most precise models of shocks. From the\nobservational point of view, the James Webb Space Telescope represents a\npowerful tool to better address the above questions, as it will allow to\nobserve numerous shock tracers in the infrared range at an unprecedented\nspatial and spectral resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 08:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three\nstage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work\ntogether to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x\nwithout affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by\nlearning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to\nenforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two\nsteps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the\nquantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x;\nQuantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection\nfrom 32 to 5.

In LAOStrain we find banding at\nlow frequencies and sufficiently high strain rate amplitudes in fluids for\nwhich the underlying constitutive curve of shear stress as a function of shear\nrate is non-monotonic. This is the direct analogue of quasi steady state\nbanding seen in slow strain rate sweeps along the flow curve. At higher\nfrequencies and sufficiently high strain amplitudes we report a different but\nrelated phenomenon, which we call `elastic' shear banding. This is associated\nwith an overshoot in the elastic (Lissajous-Bowditch) curve of stress as a\nfunction of strain. We suggest that this may arise widely even in fluids that\nhave a monotonic underlying constitutive curve, and so do not show steady state\nbanding under a steadily applied shear flow. In LAOStress we report banding in\nfluids that shear thin strongly enough to have either a negatively, or weakly\npositively, sloping region in the underlying constitutive curve, noting again\nthat fluids in the latter category do not display steady state banding in a\nsteadily applied flow. This banding is triggered in each half cycle as the\nstress magnitude transits the region of weak slope in an upward direction, such\nthat the fluid effectively yields. Our numerics are performed in the Rolie-poly\nmodel of polymeric fluids, but we also provide arguments suggesting that our\nresults should apply more widely. Besides banding in the shear rate profile,\nwhich can be measured by velocimetry, we also predict banding in the shear and\nnormal stress components, measurable by birefringence.

We present FPT approximation schemes for the minimization and\nmaximization variants of the problem, for several parameters that depend on\ncharacteristics of the optimized set function, such as $p$ and $K$. We confirm\nthat our algorithms are applicable to a broad class of problems, in particular\nto problems from computational social choice, such as item selection or winner\ndetermination under several multiwinner election systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 13:12:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 05:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

However, the two core, non-functional\nrequirements were negated from the project due to lack of experience and strict\ntime constraints. This project aimed to investigate whether the application\nwould be more suited to a non-relational solution.\n  Method: The application was re-written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB,\nExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), an open source, fully JavaScript stack and then\nperformance tests were carried out to compare the two applications. A\nscalability review was also conducted to assess the benefits and drawbacks of\neach technology in this aspect.\n  Results: The investigation proved that the non-relational solution was much\nmore efficient and performed faster. However, the choice of database was only a\nsmall part of the increase in efficiency and it was an all-round better design\nthat gave the new application its performance upper hand.\n  Conclusion: A proposal for a new application design is given that follows the\nmicroservice architecture used by companies such as Amazon and Netflix. The\napplication is to be split up into four parts; database, client application,\nserver application and content delivery network. These four, independently\nscalable and manageable services offer the greatest flexibility for future\ndevelopment at the low costs necessary for a start-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 13:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

Along this line, we introduce a novel\nnotion of $\\sqcap'$-tractability in this paper.

The first asymmetry is introduced via\nan interface layer of low thermal conductivity and high negative Seebeck\ncoefficient, such as, polycrystalline SiGe, between the bottom electrode\ncontact and the active region comprising the phase change material.

These\nlimitations cause fundamental problems in numerical modelling of flaring loops,\nsuch as selection of a structure and a number of threads, and an implementation\nof a proper model of the energy deposition process. A set of 1D hydrodynamic\nand 2D magnetohydrodynamic models of a flaring loop are developed to compare\nenergy redistribution and plasma dynamics in the course of a prototypical solar\nflare. Basic parameters of the modeled loop are set according to the progenitor\nM1.8 flare recorded in the AR10126 on September 20, 2002 between 09:21 UT and\n09:50 UT. The non-ideal 1D models include thermal conduction and radiative\nlosses of the optically thin plasma as energy loss mechanisms, while the\nnon-ideal 2D models take into account viscosity and thermal conduction as\nenergy loss mechanisms only. The 2D models have a continuous distribution of\nthe parameters of the plasma across the loop, and are powered by varying in\ntime and space along and across the loop heating flux. We show that such 2D\nmodels are a borderline case of a multi-thread internal structure of the\nflaring loop, with a filling factor equal to one. Despite the assumptions used\nin applied 2D models, their overall success in replicating the observations\nsuggests that they can be adopted as a correct approximation of the observed\nflaring structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 14:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

In numerous modern applications, ranging from\nDNA over music to texts, the distribution of symbol frequencies is\ncharacterized by heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., Zipf's law). The large\nnumber of low-frequency symbols in these distributions poses major difficulties\nto the estimation of the similarity between sequences, e.g., they hinder an\naccurate finite-size estimation of entropies.

We use an iteration method generated by an\nelliptic operator, associated with a certain simplified (e.g., homogenized)\nproblem. On each step of this procedure it is required to solve an auxiliary\nelliptic boundary value problem with non--oscillating coefficients $A_0$. All\nthe information related to complicated coefficients of the original\ndifferential problem is encompasses in the linear functional, which forms the\nright hand side of the auxiliary problem. Therefore, explicit inversion of the\noriginal operator associated with oscillating coefficients is avoided. The only\noperation used instead is multiplication of the operator by a vector (vector\nfunction), which can be efficiently performed due to the low-rank QTT tensor\noperations with the rank parameter controlled by the given precision $\\delta\n>0$ independent on the parameter $\\epsilon$.

Furthermore the system of models for complex system simulation\n(especially in case of hiring ensemble-based approach) can be considered as a\ncomplex system. As a result, the identification of the complex model's\nstructure and parameters provide additional sources of uncertainty to be\nmanaged. Within the presented work we are developing a conceptual and\ntechnological approach to manage the ensemble-based simulation taking into\naccount changing states of both simulated system and system of models within\nthe ensemble-based approach. The states of these systems are considered as a\nsubject of classification with consequent inference of better strategies for\nensemble evolution over the simulation time and ensemble aggregation. Here the\nensemble evolution enables implementation of dynamic reactive solutions which\ncan automatically conform to the changing states of both systems. The ensemble\naggregation can be considered within a scope of averaging (regression way) or\nselection (classification way, which complement the classification mentioned\nearlier) approach. The technological basis for such approach includes\nensemble-based simulation techniques using domain-specific software combined\nwithin a composite application; data science approaches for analysis of\navailable datasets (simulation data, observations, situation assessment etc.);\nand machine learning algorithms for classes identification, ensemble management\nand knowledge acquisition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 15:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 14:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

We obtain the regular black hole solution that at $r\\rightarrow\n\\infty$ gives corrections to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution. The corrections\nto Coulomb's law at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$ are found. We evaluate the mass of the\nblack hole that is a function of the dimensional parameter $\\beta$ introduced\nin the model. The magnetically charged black hole was investigated and we have\nobtained the magnetic mass of the black hole and the metric function at\n$r\\rightarrow \\infty$. The regular black hole solution is obtained at\n$r\\rightarrow 0$ with the de Sitter core. We show that there is no singularity\nof the Ricci scalar for electrically and magnetically charged black holes.\nRestrictions on the electric and magnetic fields are found that follow from the\nrequirement of the absence of superluminal sound speed and the requirement of a\nclassical stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 23:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 20:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 13:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 14:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}
