Each vertex chosen\nmust strictly increase the number of vertices totally dominated, where a vertex\ntotally dominates another vertex if they are neighbors. This process eventually\nproduces a total dominating set $S$ of $G$ in which every vertex is totally\ndominated by a vertex in $S$. Dominator wishes to minimize the number of\nvertices chosen, while Staller wishes to maximize it. The game total domination\nnumber, $\\gamma_{\\rm tg}(G)$, of $G$ is the number of vertices chosen when\nDominator starts the game and both players play optimally.

To overcome this problem, we propose a\nstructured compressive sensing (SCS)-based spatio-temporal joint channel\nestimation scheme to reduce the required pilot overhead, whereby the\nspatio-temporal common sparsity of delay-domain MIMO channels is leveraged.\nParticularly, we first propose the non-orthogonal pilots at the BS under the\nframework of CS theory to reduce the required pilot overhead.

In cosmology,\ngravitational-wave distortions are produced by most of the inflationary\nscenarios and their anticipated detection should open a new window to the early\nuniverse. Motivated by the relative lack of studies on the potential\nimplications of gravitational radiation for the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse, we consider its coupling to density perturbations during the\npost-recombination era. We do so by assuming an Einstein-de Sitter background\ncosmology and by employing a second-order perturbation study. At this\nperturbative level and on superhorizon scales, we find that gravitational\nradiation adds a distinct and faster growing mode to the standard linear\nsolution for the density contrast. Given the expected weakness of cosmological\ngravitational waves, however, the effect of the new mode is currently\nsubdominant and it could start becoming noticeable only in the far future.\nNevertheless, this still raises the intriguing possibility that the late-time\nevolution of large-scale density perturbations may be dictated by the\nlong-range (the Weyl), rather than the local (the Ricci) component of the\ngravitational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 16:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 20:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 19:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

A remarkable example\nare the high-pressure phases of H$_2$O, where quantum proton fluctuations favor\nthe symmetrization of the H bond and lower by 30 GPa the boundary between the\nasymmetric structure and the symmetric one. Here we show that an analogous\nquantum symmetrization occurs in the recently discovered sulfur hydride\nsuperconductor with the record superconducting critical temperature $T_c=203$ K\nat 155 GPa. In this system, according to classical theory, superconductivity\noccurs via formation of a structure of stoichiometry H$_3$S with S atoms\narranged on a body-centered-cubic (bcc) lattice. For $P \\gtrsim 175$ GPa, the H\natoms are predicted to sit midway between two S atoms, in a structure with\n$Im\\bar3m$ symmetry. At lower pressures the H atoms move to an off-center\nposition forming a short H$-$S covalent bond and a longer H$\\cdots$S hydrogen\nbond, in a structure with $R3m$ symmetry. X-ray diffraction experiments\nconfirmed the H$_3$S stoichiometry and the S lattice sites, but were unable to\ndiscriminate between the two phases. Our present ab initio density-functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations show that the quantum nuclear motion lowers the\nsymmetrization pressure by 72 GPa. Consequently, we predict that the $Im\\bar3m$\nphase is stable over the whole pressure range within which a high $T_c$ was\nmeasured. The observed pressure-dependence of $T_c$ is closely reproduced in\nour calculations for the $Im\\bar3m$ phase, but not for the $R3m$ phase. Thus,\nthe quantum nature of the proton completely rules the superconducting phase\ndiagram of H$_3$S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 16:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

The central question in this geometric context is, which\nconditions on the k-dimensional facets of an n-simplex S guarantee that S has\nno obtuse dihedral angles. First we study the properties of an n-simplex S\nwhose k-facets are all nonobtuse, and generalize some classical results by\nFiedler. We prove that if all (n-1)-facets of an n-simplex S are nonobtuse,\neach makes at most one obtuse dihedral angle with another facet. This helps to\nidentify a special type of tetrahedron, which we will call sub-orthocentric,\nwith the property that if all tetrahedral facets of S are sub-orthocentric,\nthen S is nonobtuse. Rephrased in the language of linear algebra, this\nconstitutes a purely geometric proof of the fact that each symmetric\nultrametric matrix is the inverse of a weakly diagonally dominant M-matrix.\n  Review papers support our belief that the linear algebraic perspective on the\ninverse M-matrix problem dominates the literature. The geometric perspective\nhowever connects sign properties of entries of inverses of a symmetric positive\ndefinite matrix to the dihedral angle properties of an underlying simplex, and\nenables an explicit visualization of how these angles and signs can be\nmanipulated. This will serve to formulate purely geometric conditions on the\nk-facets of an n-simplex S that may render S nonobtuse also for k>3. For this,\nwe generalize the class of sub-orthocentric tetrahedra that gives rise to the\nclass of ultrametric matrices, to sub-orthocentric simplices that define\nsymmetric positive definite matrices A with special types of k x k principal\nsubmatrices for k>3. Each sub-orthocentric simplices is nonobtuse, and we\nconjecture that any simplex with sub-orthocentric facets only, is\nsub-orthocentric itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 16:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

We evaluate the framework using data\nfrom the social media platform Twitter on protests during the recent Nigerian\nelections and demonstrate that it can effectively predict whether the next post\nof a user is a declaration of protest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 17:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

The kinematic properties of the dense\ngas traced by the N2H+ and N2D+ (1-0) lines are also discussed.\n  Methods. RD has been measured via observations of the J=1-0 transition of\nN2H+ and N2D+ toward 33 dense cores in different regions of L1688. fd estimates\nhave been done using C17O(1-0) and 850 micron dust continuum emission from the\nSCUBA survey.

The dense cores show large (2-40%) deuterium fractions, with\nsignificant variations between the sub-regions of L1688. The CO-depletion\nfactor also varies from one region to another (1-7). Two different correlations\nare found between deuterium fraction and CO-depletion factor: cores in regions\nA, B2 and I show increasing RD with increasing fd, similar to previous studies\nof deuterium fraction in pre-stellar cores; cores in regions B1, B1B2, C, E, F\nand H show a steeper RD-fd correlation, with large deuterium fractions\noccurring in fairly quiescent gas with relatively low CO freeze-out factors.\nThese are probably recently formed, centrally concentrated starless cores which\nhave not yet started the contraction phase toward protostellar formation.

Key features of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations are revealed to follow from general\ncategorical constructions and universal properties. Rather than beginning with\nan equation inside a given Hopf algebra and referring to given Hochschild\n$1$-cocycles, our starting point is an abstract fixpoint equation in groupoids,\nshown canonically to generate all the algebraic structure. Precisely, for any\nfinitary polynomial endofunctor $P$ defined over groupoids, the system of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations $X=1+P(X)$ has a universal solution,\nnamely the groupoid of $P$-trees. The isoclasses of $P$-trees generate\nnaturally a Connes-Kreimer-like bialgebra, in which the abstract\nDyson-Schwinger equation can be internalised in terms of canonical\n$B_+$-operators. The solution to this equation is a series (the Green function)\nwhich always enjoys a Fa\\`a di Bruno formula, and hence generates a\nsub-bialgebra isomorphic to the Fa\\`a di Bruno bialgebra. Varying $P$ yields\ndifferent bialgebras, and cartesian natural transformations between various $P$\nyield bialgebra homomorphisms and sub-bialgebras, corresponding for example to\ntruncation of Dyson-Schwinger equations. Finally, all constructions can be\npushed inside the classical Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of trees by the\noperation of taking core of $P$-trees. A byproduct of the theory is an\ninterpretation of combinatorial Green functions as inductive data types in the\nsense of Martin-L\\\"of Type Theory (expounded elsewhere).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 20:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 10:25:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 19:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 20:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

One\nsignificant limitation for use of the millimeter-wave bands for cellular\ncommunication is that the communication suffers from much higher path-loss\ncompared to the microwave bands. Millimeter-wave links have also been shown to\nchange rapidly, causing links between devices and access points to switch among\nline-of-sight, non-line-of-sight and outage states. We propose using Random\nLinear Network Coding to overcome the unreliability of individual communication\nlinks in such millimeter-wave systems. Our system consists of devices\ntransmitting and receiving network-coded packets through several access points.\nFor downlink communication, network-coded packets are transmitted to a device\nvia multiple access points. For uplink communication, the access points perform\nnetwork coding of packets of several devices, and then send the network-coded\npackets to the core network. We compare our approach against a naive approach\nin which non-network coded packets are transmitted via multiple access points\n(\"Forwarding\" approach).

This is motivated by the possible reduction in the\nnumber of RF chains and analog-to-digital converters. In these architectures,\nthe analog processing network is usually based on variable phase shifters. In\nthis paper, we propose hybrid architectures based on switching networks to\nreduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on\nphase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the\nenergy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we\npropose an open loop compressive channel estimation technique which is\nindependent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage. We analyze the\nperformance of the new estimation algorithm for hybrid architectures based on\nphase shifters and switches. Using the estimated, we develop two algorithms for\nthe design of the hybrid combiner based on switches and analyze the achieved\nspectral efficiency. Finally, we study the trade-offs between power\nconsumption, hardware complexity, and spectral efficiency for hybrid\narchitectures based on phase shifting networks and switching networks.\nNumerical results show that architectures based on switches obtain equal or\nbetter channel estimation performance to that obtained using phase shifters,\nwhile reducing hardware complexity and power consumption.

Parametric models, such as the Arrhenius model, are used for\nmodeling the relationship between the degradation and accelerating variable,\nallowing for extrapolation to the use conditions.

In terms of linear algebra,\nacute 0/1-simplices in Cn can be described by nonsingular 0/1-matrices P of\nsize n x n whose Gramians have an inverse that is strictly diagonally dominant,\nwith negative off-diagonal entries.\n  The first part of this paper deals with giving a detailed description of how\nto efficiently compute, by means of a computer program, a representative from\neach orbit of an acute 0/1-simplex under the action of the hyperoctahedral\ngroup Bn of symmetries of Cn. A side product of the investigations is a simple\ncode that computes the cycle index of Bn, which can in explicit form only be\nfound in the literature for n < 7. Using the computed cycle indices in\ncombination with Polya's theory of enumeration shows that acute 0/1-simplices\nare extremely rare among all 0/1-simplices.\n  In the second part of the paper, we study the 0/1-matrices that represent the\nacute 0/1-simplices that were generated by our code from a mathematical\nperspective.

Another key ingredient in the proofs is the fact that the\nGramians of the unreduced upper Hessenberg matrices involved are strictly\nultrametric matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 20:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

We estimate\nthe physical properties of the galaxy by fitting the flux densities to model\nSEDs leading to a magnification-corrected star formation rate of $390 \\pm 60$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a stellar mass of $1.1 \\pm 0.4\\times 10^{11}$\nM$_{\\odot}$.

Therefore, the theories of reconnection intended for\ndescribing astrophysical reconnection should not ignore the effects of\nturbulence on magnetic reconnection. Turbulence is known to change the nature\nof many physical processes dramatically and in this review we claim that\nmagnetic reconnection is not an exception. We stress that not only\nastrophysical turbulence is ubiquitous, but also magnetic reconnection itself\ninduces turbulence. Thus turbulence must be accounted for in any realistic\nastrophysical reconnection setup. We argue that due to the similarities of MHD\nturbulence in relativistic and non-relativistic cases the theory of magnetic\nreconnection developed for the non-relativistic case can be extended to the\nrelativistic case and we provide numerical simulations that support this\nconjecture. We also provide quantitative comparisons of the theoretical\npredictions and results of numerical experiments, including the situations when\nturbulent reconnection is self-driven, i.e. the turbulence in the system is\ngenerated by the reconnection process itself. We show how turbulent\nreconnection entails the violation of magnetic flux freezing, the conclusion\nthat has really far reaching consequences for many realistically turbulent\nastrophysical environments. In addition, we consider observational testing of\nturbulent reconnection as well as numerous implications of the theory. The\nformer includes the Sun and solar wind reconnection, while the latter include\nthe process of reconnection diffusion induced by turbulent reconnection, the\nacceleration of energetic particles, bursts of turbulent reconnection related\nto black hole sources as well as gamma ray bursts.

This chapter is\nfocused on reviewing the decade-long studies that attempt to computationally\nreproduce the well-observed nearby VYMCs, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster,\nR136 and NGC 3603 young cluster, thereby shedding light on birth conditions of\nmassive star clusters, in general. On this regard, focus is given on direct\nN-body modeling of real-sized massive star clusters, with a monolithic\nstructure and undergoing residual gas expulsion, which have consistently\nreproduced the observed characteristics of several VYMCs and also of young star\nclusters, in general. The connection of these relatively simplified model\ncalculations with the structural richness of dense molecular clouds and the\ncomplexity of hydrodynamic calculations of star cluster formation is presented\nin detail. Furthermore, the connections of such VYMCs with globular clusters,\nwhich are nearly as old as our Universe, is discussed. The chapter is concluded\nby addressing long-term deeply gas-embedded (at least apparently) and\nsubstructured systems like W3 Main. While most of the results are quoted from\nexisting and up-to-date literature, in an integrated fashion, several new\ninsights and discussions are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 21:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

From that, and in the context of symplectic and Poisson\nmanifolds, a deep connection between the HJE and the (non)commutative\nintegrability notion, and consequently the integrability by quadratures, is\nstablished. Moreover, in the same context, we find conditions on the complete\nsolutions of the HJE that also ensures integrability by quadratures, but they\nare weaker than those related to the (non)commutative integrability. Examples\nare developed along all the paper in order to illustrate the theoretical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 01:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

This kind\nof data comes with several challenges: infinite-dimensionality of function\nspaces, observation noise, and so on. However, there is another interesting\nphenomena that creates problems in FDA. The functional data often comes with\nlateral displacements/deformations in curves, a phenomenon which is different\nfrom the height or amplitude variability and is termed phase variation. The\npresence of phase variability artificially often inflates data variance, blurs\nunderlying data structures, and distorts principal components. While the\nseparation and/or removal of phase from amplitude data is desirable, this is a\ndifficult problem. In particular, a commonly used alignment procedure, based on\nminimizing the $\\mathbb{L}^2$ norm between functions, does not provide\nsatisfactory results.

In the presence of external pressure,\nthe pressure gradient set up within a self-gravitating isothermal cloud leads\nto a non-uniform density distribution. Thus the local environment of a cloud\ninfluences its internal structure. In the simple equilibrium model, the\nfraction of gas at high density in the cloud interior is determined simply by\nthe cloud surface density, which is itself inherited from the pressure in the\nimmediate surroundings. This idea is tested using measurements of the\nproperties of local clouds, which are found to show remarkable agreement with\nthe simple equilibrium model. The model also naturally predicts the star\nformation relation observed on cloud scales and, at the same time, provides a\nmapping between this relation and the closer-to-linear molecular star formation\nrelation measured on larger scales in galaxies. The key is that pressure\nregulates not only the molecular content of the ISM but also the cloud surface\ndensity.

In order\nto gain insight into the fate of impactor we have carried out a laboratory\nprogramme, covering the velocity range of 0.38 - 3.50 km/s, devoted to\nmeasuring the survivability, fragmentation and final state of the impactor.\nForsterite olivine and synthetic basalt projectiles were fired onto low\nporosity (<10%) pure water-ice targets using the University of Kent's Light Gas\nGun (LGG).

This procedure enabled us to\nestimate the implanted mass on the target body, which was found to be a few\npercent of the initial mass of the impactor. We calculated an order of\nmagnitude difference in the energy density of catastrophic disruption, Q*,\nbetween peridot and basalt projectiles. However, we found very similar\nbehaviour of the size frequency distributions for the hypervelocity shots (>1\nkm/s).

We show that this\nunique acoustic topological phenomenon can offer a new promising application\nplatform for the design of novel acoustic devices, such as one-way sound\nisolators, acoustic mode switchers, splitters, filters etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 14:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

In the first part we consider the theory\nof time-inhomogeneous affine processes on general state spaces. We present a\nconcise setup for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. For stochastically\ncontinuous affine processes we show that there always exists a c\\`adl\\`ag\nmodification. Afterwards we consider the regularity and the semimartingale\nproperty of affine processes. Contrary to the time-homogeneous case,\ntime-inhomogeneous affine processes are in general neither regular nor\nsemimartingales and the time-inhomogeneous case raises many new and interesting\nquestions. Assuming that an affine process is a semimartingale, we show that\neven without regularity the parameter functions satisfy generalized Riccati\nintegral equations. This generalizes an important result for time-homogeneous\naffine processes. We also show that stochastically continuous affine\nsemimartingales are essentially generated by deterministic time-changes of what\nwe call absolutely continuously affine semimartingales. These processes\ngeneralize time-homogeneous regular affine processes.\n  In the second part we consider the class of affine LIBOR market models. We\ncontribute to this class of models in two ways. First, we modify the original\nsetup of the affine LIBOR market models in such a way that next to nonnegative\naffine processes real-valued affine processes can also be used. Numerical\nexamples show that this allows for more flexible implied volatility surfaces.\nSecond, we introduce the class of affine inflation market models, an extension\nof the affine LIBOR market models. A calibration example shows that these\nmodels perform very well in fitting market-observed prices of inflation\nderivatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 15:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-11"}

The\nHamiltonian for moderately eccentric motion of two non-spinning compact objects\nin the extreme mass-ratio limit is given in terms of three potentials: $a(v),\n\\bar{d}(v), q(v)$. By generalizing the first law of mechanics for\n(non-spinning) black hole binaries to eccentric orbits, [\\prd{\\bf92}, 084021\n(2015)] recently obtained new expressions for $\\bar{d}(v)$ and $q(v)$ in terms\nof quantities that can be readily computed using the gravitational self-force\napproach. Using these expressions we present a new computation of the EOB\npotential $q(v)$ by combining results from two independent numerical self-force\ncodes. We determine $q(v)$ for inverse binary separations in the range $1/1200\n\\le v \\lesssim 1/6$. Our computation thus provides the first-ever strong-field\nresults for $q(v)$. We also obtain $\\bar{d}(v)$ in our entire domain to a\nfractional accuracy of $\\gtrsim 10^{-8}$. We find to our results are compatible\nwith the known post-Newtonian expansions for $\\bar{d}(v)$ and $q(v)$ in the\nweak field, and agree with previous (less accurate) numerical results for\n$\\bar{d}(v)$ in the strong field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 20:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

The LH content of the\noutgoing medium serves as a readout of the GnRH signaling pathway activation in\nthe cells. The challenge lies in relating the LH content of the medium leaving\nthe chamber to the cellular processes producing LH secretion. To investigate\nthis relation we developed and analyzed a mathematical model consisting of\ncoupled partial differential equations describing LH secretion in a perifusion\ncell culture. We match the mathematical model to three different data sets and\ngive cellular mechanisms that explain the data. Our model illustrates the\nimportance of the negative feedback in the signaling pathway and receptor\ndesensitization. We demonstrate that different LH outcomes in oxytocin and GnRH\nstimulations might originate from different receptor dynamics and\nconcentration. We ana- lyze the model to understand the influence of\nparameters, like the velocity of the medium flow or the fraction collection\ntime, on the LH outcomes. We show that slow velocities lead to high LH\noutcomes. Also, we show that fraction collection times, which do not divide the\nGnRH pulse period evenly, lead to irregularities in the data. We examine the\ninfluence of the rate of binding and dissociation of GnRH on the GnRH movement\ndown the chamber. Our model serves as an important tool that can help in the\ndesign of perifusion experiments and the interpretation of results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 21:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}
