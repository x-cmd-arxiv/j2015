They have been linked to\nthe population firing rate of neurons, with individual neurons firing in a\nclose-to-irregular fashion at low rates. Using a combination of mean-field and\nlinear response theory we predict the spectra generated in a layered\nmicrocircuit model of V1, composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and\nbased on connectivity compiled from anatomical and electrophysiological\nstudies. The model exhibits low- and high-gamma oscillations visible in all\npopulations. Since locally generated frequencies are imposed onto other\npopulations, the origin of the oscillations cannot be deduced from the spectra.\nWe develop an universally applicable systematic approach that identifies the\nanatomical circuits underlying the generation of oscillations in a given\nnetwork. Based on a theoretical reduction of the dynamics, we derive a\nsensitivity measure resulting in a frequency-dependent connectivity map that\nreveals connections crucial for the peak amplitude and frequency of the\nobserved oscillations and identifies the minimal circuit generating a given\nfrequency.

The timing of such events is\nstochastic as a consequence of the innate randomness in gene expression. A\nquestion of interest is to understand how gene expression is regulated to\nachieve precision in event timing. To address this, we model event timing using\nthe first-passage time framework - a mathe- matical tool to analyze the time\nwhen a stochastic process first crosses a specific threshold. The protein\nevolution is described via a simple stochastic model of gene expression.\nMoreover, we consider the feedback regulation of protein degradation to be a\npossible noise control mechanism employed to achieve the precision. Exact\nanalytical formulas are developed for the distribution and moments of the\nfirst-passage time. Using these expressions, we investigate for the optimal\nfeedback strategy such that noise (coefficient of variation squared) in event\ntiming is minimized around a given fixed mean time. Our results show that the\nminimum noise is achieved when the protein degradation rate is zero for all\nprotein levels. Lastly, the implications of this finding are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 17:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-24"}

These objects were selected because\nthey showed signs of an interstellar medium and/or star formation. A large\namount of gas ($>$2$\\times$10$^8$ M$_{\\odot}$) is present in 10 out of 15\nobjects, and these galaxies have gas fractions higher than expected based on\nextrapolation from lower mass samples. We tentatively interpret this as\nevidence that stellar mass loss and hot halo cooling may be starting to play a\nrole in fuelling the most massive galaxies. These MASSIVE ETGs seem to have\nlower star-formation efficiencies (SFE=SFR/M$_{\\rm H2}$) than spiral galaxies,\nbut the SFEs derived are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution\nfound in other lower mass ETG samples. This suggests that the SFE is not simply\na function of stellar mass, but that local, internal processes are more\nimportant for regulating star formation. Finally we used the CO line profiles\nto investigate the high-mass end of the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We find\nthat there is a break in the slope of the TFR for ETGs at high masses\n(consistent with previous studies). The strength of this break correlates with\nthe stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, suggesting it is caused\nby additional baryonic mass being present in the centre of massive ETGs. We\nspeculate on the root cause of this change and its implications for galaxy\nformation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 20:41:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

An\nimproved implementation based on the reduction of the number of column\nsubstitutions and on a very efficient implementation of the calculation of the\nscalar products involved is presented. It is emphasized that multideterminant\nexpansions contain in general a large number of identical spin-specific\ndeterminants: for typical configuration interaction-type wavefunctions the\nnumber of unique spin-specific determinants $N_{\\rm det}^\\sigma$\n($\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow$) with a non-negligible weight in the expansion is\nof order ${\\cal O}(\\sqrt{N_{\\rm det}})$.

We used radio polarization observations at\n{\\lambda}6 cm and 13 cm obtained with the VLA, Effelsberg and ATCA telescopes\nand APEX sub-mm observations at 870 {\\mu}m, which are first published here,\ntogether with maps of the emission of warm dust, ionized gas, molecular gas,\nand atomic gas. The spatial power spectra are similar for the tracers of dust,\ngas, and total magnetic field, while the spectra of the ordered magnetic field\nare significantly different. The wavelet cross-correlation between all material\ntracers and total magnetic field is high, while the structures of the ordered\nmagnetic field are poorly correlated with those of other tracers. -- The\nmagnetic field configuration in M83 contains pronounced magnetic arms. Some of\nthem are displaced from the corresponding material arms, while others overlap\nwith the material arms. The magnetic field vectors at {\\lambda}6 cm are aligned\nwith the outer material arms, while significant deviations occur in the inner\narms and in the bar region, possibly due to non-axisymmetric gas flows. Outside\nthe bar region, the typical pitch angles of the material and magnetic spiral\narms are very close to each other at about 10{\\deg}. The typical pitch angle of\nthe magnetic field vectors is about 20{\\deg} larger than that of the material\nspiral arms. One of the main magnetic arms in M83 is displaced from the gaseous\narms, while the other main arm overlaps a gaseous arm. We propose that a\nregular spiral magnetic field generated by a mean-field dynamo is compressed in\nmaterial arms and partly aligned with them. The interaction of galactic dynamo\naction with a transient spiral pattern is a promising mechanism for producing\nsuch complicated spiral patterns as in M83.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 22:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 22:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The isotopic composition of a consumer is a product of these factors as\nwell as the isotopic 'landscape' of its prey, i.e. the isotopic mixing space.\nHere we build a mechanistic framework that links the ecological and\nphysiological processes of an individual consumer to the isotopic distribution\nthat describes its diet, and ultimately to the isotopic composition of its own\ntissues, defined as its 'isotopic niche'. By coupling these processes, we\nsystematically investigate under what conditions the isotopic niche of a\nconsumer changes as a function of both the geometric properties of its mixing\nspace and foraging strategies that may be static or dynamic over time. Results\nof our derivations reveal general insight into the conditions impacting\nisotopic niche width as a function of consumer specialization on prey, as well\nas the consumer's ability to transition between diets over time. We show\nanalytically that moderate specialization on isotopically unique prey can serve\nto maximize a consumer's isotopic niche width, while temporally dynamic diets\nwill tend to result in peak isotopic variance during dietary transitions. We\ndemonstrate the relevance of our theoretical findings by examining a marine\nsystem composed of nine invertebrate species commonly consumed by sea otters.\nIn general, our analytical framework highlights the complex interplay of mixing\nspace geometry and consumer dietary behavior in driving expansion and\ncontraction of the isotopic niche.

They range from superficial to professional, from focused to\ngeneral-purpose, and, from free-form to highly structured. Numerous people have\nmultiple accounts within the same OSN and even more people have an account on\nmore than one OSN. Since all OSNs involve some amount of user input, often in\nwritten form, it is natural to consider whether multiple incarnations of the\nsame person in various OSNs can be effectively correlated or linked. One\nintuitive means of linking accounts is by using stylometric analysis.\n  This paper reports on (what we believe to be) the first trilateral\nlarge-scale stylometric OSN linkability study. Its outcome has important\nimplications for OSN privacy. The study is trilateral since it involves three\nOSNs with very different missions: (1) Yelp, known primarily for its\nuser-contributed reviews of various venues, e.g, dining and entertainment, (2)\nTwitter, popular for its pithy general-purpose micro-blogging style, and (3)\nFlickr, used exclusively for posting and labeling (describing) photographs. As\nour somewhat surprising results indicate, stylometric linkability of accounts\nacross these heterogeneous OSNs is both viable and quite effective. The main\ntake-away of this work is that, despite OSN heterogeneity, it is very\nchallenging for one person to maintain privacy across multiple active accounts\non different OSNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 06:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

This formalism is an extension of the Hamilton principle in\nclassical mechanics that allows the inclusion of irreversible phenomena in both\ndiscrete and continuum systems (i.e., systems with finite and infinite degrees\nof freedom). The irreversibility is encoded into a nonlinear nonholonomic\nconstraint given by the expression of entropy production associated to all the\nirreversible processes involved. Hence from a mathematical point of view, our\nvariational formalism may be regarded as a generalization of the\nLagrange-d'Alembert principle used in nonholonomic mechanics. In order to\nformulate the nonholonomic constraint, we associate to each irreversible\nprocess a variable called the thermodynamic displacement. This allows the\ndefinition of a corresponding variational constraint. Our theory is illustrated\nwith various examples of discrete systems such as mechanical systems with\nfriction, matter transfer, electric circuits, chemical reactions, and diffusion\nacross membranes.

We prove continuous dependence\nof solutions on initial data and convergence of solutions of a low order model\nto solutions of the NSK system.

I\nextend the standard CC model by introducing a damping factor into the coupling\nmatrix elements in the standard CC model. I adopt the Yukawa-plus-exponential\n(YPE) model as a basic heavy ion-ion potential, which is advantageous for a\nunified description of the one- and two-body potentials. For the purpose of\nthese systematic investigations, I approximate the one-body potential with a\nthird-order polynomial function based on the YPE model. Calculated fusion cross\nsections for the medium-heavy mass systems of $^{64}$Ni + $^{64}$Ni, $^{58}$Ni\n+ $^{58}$Ni, and $^{58}$Ni + $^{54}$Fe, the medium-light mass systems of\n$^{40}$Ca + $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca + $^{48}$Ca, and $^{24}$Mg + $^{30}$Si, and\nthe mass-asymmetric systems of $^{48}$Ca + $^{96}$Zr and $^{16}$O + $^{208}$Pb\nare consistent with the experimental data. The astrophysical S factor and\nlogarithmic derivative representations of these are also in good agreement with\nthe experimental data. Since the results calculated with the damping factor are\nin excellent agreement with the experimental data in all systems, I conclude\nthat the smooth transition from the sudden to adiabatic processes occurs and\nthat a coordinate-dependent coupling strength is responsible for the fusion\nhindrance.

In recent years, SL has\nemerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the\nSL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively\nkilled while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have\nattempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating\nSL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms.\nHowever, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or\ndo not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are\ntherefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy.\n  Results: Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions\ndirectly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the\nobservation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually\nexclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using\ngenomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast,\nprostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and\nare likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes\nin these cancers.

However, while the\nclassical framework of information theory focuses on the relation between one\ninput and one output (Shannon's mutual information), we argue that neural\ninformation processing crucially depends on the combination of\n\\textit{multiple} inputs to create the output of a processor. To account for\nthis, we use a very recent extension of Shannon Information theory, called\npartial information decomposition (PID). PID allows to quantify the information\nthat several inputs provide individually (unique information), redundantly\n(shared information) or only jointly (synergistic information) about the\noutput. First, we review the framework of PID. Then we apply it to reevaluate\nand analyze several earlier proposals of information theoretic neural goal\nfunctions (predictive coding, infomax, coherent infomax, efficient coding).

We propose several discrete-time population models to\ninvestigate the coexistence of migrants and residents. The first class of\nmodels is linear, and we distinguish two scenarios. In the first, there is a\nsingle egg pool to which both populations contribute. A fraction of the eggs is\ndestined to become migrants, and the remainder become residents. In a second\nmodel, there are two distinct egg pools to which the two types contribute, one\ncorresponding to residents and another to migrants. The asymptotic growth or\ndecline in these models can be phrased in terms of the value of the basic\nreproduction number being larger or less than one respectively. A second class\nof models incorporates density dependence effects. It is assumed that increased\ndensities in the various life history stages adversely affect the success of\ntransitioning of individuals to subsequent stages. Here too we consider models\nwith one or two egg pools. Although these are nonlinear models, their\nasymptotic dynamics can still be classified in terms of the value of a locally\ndefined basic reproduction number: If it is less than one, then the entire\npopulation goes extinct, whereas it settles at a unique fixed point consisting\nof a mixture of residents and migrants, when it is larger than one. Thus, the\nvalue of the basic reproduction number can be used to predict the stable\ncoexistence or collapse of populations exhibiting partial migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 15:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

Rather than extending the\nknowledge of game classes for which the pre-kernel consists of a single point,\nwe apply a different approach. We select a game from an arbitrary game class\nwith a single pre-kernel element satisfying the non-empty interior condition of\na payoff equivalence class, and then establish that the set of related and\nlinear independent games which are derived from this pre-kernel point of the\ndefault game replicates this point also as its sole pre-kernel element. In the\nproof we apply results and techniques employed in the above work. Namely, we\nprove in a first step that the linear mapping of a pre-kernel element into a\nspecific vector subspace of balanced excesses is a singleton. Secondly, that\nthere cannot exist a different and non-transversal vector subspace of balanced\nexcesses in which a linear transformation of a pre-kernel element can be\nmapped. Furthermore, we establish that on the restricted subset on the game\nspace that is constituted by the convex hull of the default and the set of\nrelated games, the pre-kernel correspondence is single-valued, and therefore\ncontinuous. Finally, we provide sufficient conditions that preserve the\npre-nucleolus property for related games even when the default game has not a\nsingle pre-kernel point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 11:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}
