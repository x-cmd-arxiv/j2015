Our collapsing algorithm however can only deal with MWEs when they\nform a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach.\n  We study the effect of collapsing training and test data. A parsing effect\ncan be obtained if collapsed data help the parser in its decisions and a\ntraining effect can be obtained if training on the collapsed data improves\nresults.

For Sc >> 1, there appeared a k^{-1}\npower law in the viscous-convective range, while for Sc << 1, a k^{-17/3} power\nlaw was identified in the inertial-diffusive range. The scaling constant for\nthe mixed third-order structure function of velocity-scalar increment grew over\nSc, and the effect of compressibility made it smaller than the classical 4/3\nvalue.

At large scales, the PDF of scalar increment behaved similarly to\nthat of scalar fluctuation, while at small scales it resembled the PDF of\nscalar gradient. The scalar dissipation occurring at large magnitudes was found\nto grow with Sc. Due to low molecular diffusivity, for Sc >> 1, the scalar\nfield rolled up and got mixed sufficiently.

We find\nthat the dynamics of the cold disk gas in the tidal bridge and the amount of\nthe newly formed stars depend strongly on the existence of a gas halo. In the\nrun of interacting galaxies not having a hot gas halo, the gas and stars\naccreted into the ETG do not include newly formed stars. However, in the run\nusing the ETG with a gas halo and the LTG without a gas halo, a shock forms\nalong the disk gas tidal bridge and induces star formation near the closest\napproach. The shock front is parallel to a channel along which the cold gas\nflows toward the center of the ETG. As a result, the ETG can accrete\nstar-forming cold gas and newly born stars at and near its center. When both\ngalaxies have hot gas halos, a shock is formed between the two gas halos\nsomewhat before the closest approach.

A central focus of these\nmodels is to understand how associations are established amongst neurons, in\norder to predict spiking patterns that are compatible with empirical\nobservations. Although these models have led to major insights and advances,\nthey still do not account for the astonishing velocity with which the brain\nsolves certain problems and what lies behind its creativity, amongst others\nfeatures. We examine two important components that may crucially aid\ncomprehensive understanding of said neurodynamical processes. First, we argue\nthat once presented with a problem, different putative solutions are generated\nin parallel by different groups or local neuronal complexes, with the\nsubsequent stabilization and spread of the best solutions. Using mathematical\nmodels we show that this mechanism accelerates finding the right solutions.\nThis formalism is analogous to standard replicator-mutator models of evolution\nwhere mutation is analogous to the probability of neuron state switching\n(on/off). The second factor that we incorporate is structural synaptic\nplasticity, i.e. the making of new and disbanding of old synapses, which we\napply as a dynamical reorganization of synaptic connections. We show that\nHebbian learning alone does not suffice to reach optimal solutions. However,\ncombining it with parallel evaluation and structural plasticity opens up\npossibilities for efficient problem solving. In the resulting networks,\ntopologies converge to subsets of fully connected components. Imposing costs on\nsynapses reduces the connectivity, although the number of connected components\nremains robust. The average lifetime of synapses is longer for connections that\nare established early, and diminishes with synaptic cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 18:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

White dwarfs, with their\nastronomical lifetimes and sizes, can thus act as large space-time volume\ndetectors enabling a unique probe of the properties of dark matter, especially\nof dark matter candidates that have low number density. This mechanism also\nraises the intriguing possibility that a class of supernova may be triggered\nthrough rare events induced by dark matter rather than the conventional\nmechanism of accreting white dwarfs that explode upon reaching the\nChandrasekhar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 19:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

During the rising phase, the accretion luminosity can increase\nby orders of magnitude in several weeks and the emergent ionizing radiation\nilluminates the fresh accretion flow. In this paper, we simulated the evolution\nof the expected spectral line profile of iron due to such a flare by using a\nray-tracing code with effects of general relativity (GR) taken into account. We\nfound that the time-dependent profile changes significantly with black hole\nspin, inclination angle with respect to the black-hole equatorial plane, and\nthe expansion velocity of the ionization front. At low values of spin, a \"loop\"\nfeature appears in the line profile vs. time plot when the inclination is no\nless than $30^\\circ$ and the expansion velocity $v_{\\rm exp}$ is no less than\nhalf speed of light, due to a shadow in the emission of the truncated disk. In\nthe light curve two peaks occur depending on the inclination angle. At large\n$v_{\\rm exp}$, a shallow \"nose\" feature may develop ahead of the loop, its\nduration depends on the expansion velocity and the inclination angle.

Thermal\nfluctuations of a 2D membrane tend to destroy the long-range order in the\nsystem. Such fluctuations are stabilized by strong anharmonicity effects, which\npreserve thermodynamic stability. The anharmonic effects demonstrate critical\nbehaviour on scales larger than the Ginzburg scale. In particular, clean\nsuspended flake of graphene shows a power-law increase of the bending rigidity\nwith the system size, $\\varkappa\\propto L^{\\eta},$ due to anharmonic\ninteraction between in-plane and out-of-plane (flexural) phonon modes. We\ndemonstrate that random fluctuations of membrane curvature caused by static\ndisorder may change dramatically the scaling of the bending rigidity and lead\nto a non-monotonous dependence of $\\varkappa$ on $L.$ We derive coupled RG\ndescribing combined flow of $\\varkappa$ and effective disorder strength $b$,\nfind a critical curve $b(\\varkappa)$ separating flat and crumpled phases, and\nexplore the behavior of disorder in the flat phase. Deep in the flat phase,\ndisorder decays in a power-law way at scales larger than the Ginzburg length\nwhich therefore sets a characteristic size for the ripples--static out-of-plane\ndeformations observed experimentally in suspended graphene.

For sufficiently\nstrong disorder, there exists an intermediate range of spatial scales where\nripples decay much slower, with exponent $\\eta/4$. In the near-critical regime,\nthe membrane shows fractal properties implying a multiple folding starting from\na certain length scale $L_1$ and finally flattens at a much larger scale $L_2$\n(which diverges at criticality).

Chapter 2 is a\nreview of SPMHD. In Chapter 3, a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic scheme is developed\nwhich cleans divergence error from the magnetic field. Average divergence error\nis an order of magnitude lower for all test cases considered, and allows for\nthe stable simulation of the gravitational collapse of magnetised molecular\ncloud cores. The effectiveness of the cleaning may be improved by explicitly\nincreasing the hyperbolic wave speed or by cycling the cleaning equations\nbetween timesteps. In the latter, it is possible to achieve DivB=0. Chapter 4\ndevelops a switch to reduce dissipation of the magnetic field from artificial\nresistivity. Compared to the existing switch in the literature, this leads to\nsharper shock profiles in shocktube tests, lower overall dissipation of\nmagnetic energy, and importantly, is able to capture magnetic shocks in the\nhighly super-Alfvenic regime. Chapter 5 compares these numerical methods\nagainst grid-based MHD methods (using the Flash code) in simulations of the\nsmall-scale dynamo amplification of a magnetic field in driven, isothermal,\nsupersonic turbulence. Both codes exponentially amplify the magnetic energy at\na constant rate, though SPMHD shows a resolution dependence that arises from\nthe scaling of the numerical dissipation terms. The time-averaged saturated\nmagnetic spectra have similar shape, and both codes have PDFs of magnetic field\nstrength that are log-normal, which become lopsided as the magnetic field\nsaturates. We conclude that SPMHD is able to reliably simulate the small-scale\ndynamo amplification of magnetic fields. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and\npresents some preliminary work demonstrating that SPMHD can activate the\nmagneto-rotational instability in 2D shearing box tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 02:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It has been shown\nrecently that a low-mass classical bulge (ClB) in a barred galaxy can acquire\nrotation from absorbing a significant fraction of the angular momentum emitted\nby the bar. Our aim here is to investigate whether bars can spin up also more\nmassive ClBs during the secular evolution of the bar, and to study the\nkinematics and dynamics of these ClBs. We use a set of self-consistent N-body\nsimulations to study the interaction of ClBs with a bar that forms\nself-consistently in the disk. We use orbital spectral analysis to investigate\nthe angular momentum gain by the classical bulge stars. We show that the ClBs\ngain, on average, about 2 - 6% of the disk's initial angular momentum within\nthe bar region. Most of this angular momentum gain occurs via low-order\nresonances, particularly 5:2 resonant orbits. A density wake forms in the ClB\nwhich corotates and aligns with the bar at the end of the evolution. The\nspin-up process creates a characteristic linear rotation profile and mild\ntangential anisotropy in the ClB. The induced rotation is small in the centre\nbut significant beyond $\\sim2$ bulge half mass radii, where it leads to\nmass-weighted $V/\\sigma \\sim 0.2$, and reaches a local $V_{max}/\\sigma_{in}\n\\sim 0.5$ at around the scale of the bar. The resulting $V/\\sigma$ is tightly\ncorrelated with the ratio of the bulge size to the bar size. In all models, a\nbox/peanut bulge forms suggesting that composite bulges may be common.\nBar-bulge resonant interaction in barred galaxies can provide some spin up of\nmassive ClBs, but the process appears to be less efficient than for low-mass\nClBs. Further angular momentum transfer due to nuclear bars or gas inflow would\nbe required to explain the observed rotation if it is not primordial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 04:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 06:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 06:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

As a Boolean model it\ndoes not support modelling of dynamic effects like sequence dependencies\nbetween fault events. This work describes a method that allows consideration of\nsequence dependencies without transformations into state-space.\n  Concept:\n  The new temporal fault tree analysis (TFTA) described in this work extends\nthe Boolean FTA. The TFTA is based on a new temporal logic which adds a concept\nof time to the Boolean logic and algebra. This allows modelling of temporal\nrelationships between events using two new temporal operators (PAND and SAND).\nWith a set of temporal logic rules, a given temporal term may be simplified to\nits temporal disjunctive normal form (TDNF) which is similar to the Boolean DNF\nbut includes event sequencies. In TDNF the top event's temporal system function\nmay be reduced to a list of minimal cutset sequences (MCSS). These allow\nqualitative analyses similar to Boolean cutset analysis in normal FTA.\nFurthermore the TFTA may also be used for probabilistic analyses without using\nstate-space models.\n  Results:\n  One significant aspect of the new TFTA described in this work is the\npossibility to take sequence dependencies into account for qualitative and\nprobabilistic analyses without state-space transformations. Among others, this\nallows for modelling of event sequencies at all levels within a fault tree, a\nreal qualitative analysis similar to the FTA's cutset analysis, and\nquantification of sequence dependencies within the same model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 04:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

It is therefore important to\nunderstand when we can expect a quantum walk to be Anderson localized and when\nwe can expect it to spread to infinity even in the presence of disorder. In\nthis work we analyze the response of a generic one-dimensional quantum walk --\nthe split-step walk -- to different forms of static disorder. We find that\nintroducing static, symmetry-preserving disorder in the parameters of the walk\nleads to Anderson localization. In the completely disordered limit, however, a\ndelocalization sets in, and the walk spreads subdiffusively.

The model also explains the striking\ndifference between the value of water dipole $\\mu$~3D reported in recent ab\ninitio and experimental studies with the value $\\mu_{eff}$~2.3D typically used\nin the empirical potentials, such as TIP3P or SPC/E. It is shown that the\neffective dipole of water can be understood as a scaled value\n$\\mu_{eff}=\\mu/\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{el}}$, where $\\epsilon_{el}$=1.78 is the\nelectronic (high-frequency) dielectric constant of water. This simple\ntheoretical framework provides important insights into the nature of the\neffective parameters, which is crucial when the computational models of liquid\nwater are used for simulations in different environments, such as proteins, or\nfor interaction with solutes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 10:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This paper proposes a mechanism for\nproducing inhomogeneous cloud coverage due to the depletion of cloud particles\nthrough the Coulomb explosion of dust in atmospheric plasma regions. Charged\ndust grains Coulomb-explode when the electrostatic stress of the grain exceeds\nits mechanical tensile stress, which results in grains below a critical radius\n$a<a^{\\rm Coul}_{\\rm crit}$ being broken up. This work outlines the criteria\nrequired for the Coulomb explosion of dust clouds in substellar atmospheres,\nthe effect on the dust particle size distribution function, and the resulting\nradiative properties of the atmospheric regions. Our results show that for an\natmospheric plasma region with an electron temperature of $T_{e}=10$~eV\n($\\approx10^{5}$~K), the critical grain radius varies from $10^{-7}$ to\n$10^{-4}$~cm, depending on the grains' tensile strength. Higher critical radii\nup to $10^{-3}$~cm are attainable for higher electron temperatures. We find\nthat the process produces a bimodal particle size distribution composed of\nstable nanoscale seed particles and dust particles with $a\\geq a^{\\rm\nCoul}_{\\rm crit}$, with the intervening particle sizes defining a region devoid\nof dust. As a result, the dust population is depleted, and the clouds become\noptically thin in the wavelength range $0.1-10~\\mu$m, with a characteristic\npeak that shifts to higher wavelengths as more sub-micrometer particles are\ndestroyed. In an atmosphere populated with a distribution of plasma volumes,\nthis will yield regions of contrasting radiative properties, thereby giving a\nsource of inhomogeneous cloud coverage.

The proof of this\nfact uses generalized Tannaka duality and a variant of Deligne's argument for\nthe existence of fiber functors which works in arbitrary characteristic.\n  We use this version of Deligne's existence theorem for fiber functors as a\nnovel way of recognizing stacks which have atlases.

However, although recent research contradicts\nthis classical picture and indicates that CaSO4*2H2O forms at room temperature\nthrough multiple steps at different length and time-scales, these steps have so\nfar not been quantified. By using in situ and fast time-resolved small angle\nX-ray scattering (SAXS), we demonstrate that the nucleation and growth of\nCaSO4*2H2O involves at the very initial stages the formation of well-defined,\nprimary species of < 3 nm in length (stage I). Stage II of the reaction is\ncharacterized by the arrangement of these primary species into domains, while\nin stage III these domains condense into larger aggregates. Based on volume\nfractions and electron density considerations we propose that the fast forming\nprimary species from supersaturated aqueous CaSO4 solutions are composed of\nanhydrous Ca-SO4-cores. The first three stages of nucleation and aggregation of\nthe primary species are followed by a final stage (stage IV), where the primary\nspecies grow within the aggregates, and eventually transform into gypsum\n(CaSO4*2H2O). This final stage was also confirmed through simultaneously\ncollected wide-angle scattering (diffraction, WAXS) data, which clearly show\nthe growth of gypsum during stage IV only. Our results demonstrate that CaSO4\nformation is driven by the nucleation and aggregation of well-defined anhydrous\nCa-SO4-cores that transform through hydration into gypsum through a complex\nnucleation and growth pathway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 12:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 14:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-12"}

We recalculate turnover times from total fluxes by performing an\nenergy balance analysis of the network and recurring to the fluctuation\ntheorem. We find in many cases values one of order of magnitude lower, implying\na faster picture of intermediate metabolism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 12:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

For a given set of testing images,\nSRC codes every image over the base images as a sparse representation then\nclassifies it to the class with the least representation error. This scheme\nutilizes an individual representation rather than the collective one to\nclassify such a set of images, doing so obviously ignores the correlation among\nthe given images. In this paper, a joint representation classification (JRC)\nfor collective face recognition is proposed. JRC takes the correlation of\nmultiple images as well as a single representation into account. Under the\nassumption that the given face images are generally related to each other, JRC\ncodes all the testing images over the base images simultaneously to facilitate\nrecognition. To this end, the testing inputs are aligned into a matrix and the\njoint representation coding is formulated to a generalized\n$l_{2,q}-l_{2,p}$-minimization problem. To uniformly solve the induced\noptimization problems for any $q\\in[1,2]$ and $p\\in (0,2]$, an iterative\nquadratic method (IQM) is developed. IQM is proved to be a strict descent\nalgorithm with convergence to the optimal solution. Moreover, a more practical\nIQM is proposed for large-scale case. Experimental results on three public\ndatabases show that the JRC with practical IQM no only saves much computational\ncost but also achieves better performance in collective face recognition than\nthe state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 13:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The K-band\nluminosity function of L1630N is remarkably similar to that of the Trapezium\ncluster, i.e., it presents a broad peak in the range 0.3-0.7 M$_\\odot$ and a\nfraction of sub-stellar objects of $\\sim$20%. The fraction of YSOs still\nsurrounded by disk/envelopes is very high ($\\sim$85%) compared to other star\nforming regions of similar age (1-2 Myr), but includes some uncertain\ncorrections for diskless YSOs. Yet, a possibly high disk fraction together with\nthe fact that 1/3 of the cloud mass has a gas surface density above the\nthreshold for star formation ($\\sim$129 M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$), points towards a\nstill on-going star formation activity in L1630N. The star formation efficiency\n(SFE), star formation rate (SFR) and density of star formation of L1630N are\nwithin the ranges estimated for galactic star forming regions by the Spitzer\n\"core to disk\" and \"Gould's Belt\" surveys. However, the SFE and SFR are lower\nthan the average value measured in the Orion A cloud and, in particular, lower\nthan that in the southern regions of L1630. This might suggest different star\nformation mechanisms within the L1630 cloud complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 13:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Their orbits are expected to be circular\ndue to tidal interactions during the binary evolution, as observed in most of\nthe binary MSPs. There are some peculiar systems that do not fit this picture.\nThree recent examples are PSRs J2234$+$06, J1946$+$3417 and J1950$+$2414, all\nof which are MSPs in eccentric orbits but with mass functions compatible with\nexpected He white dwarf companions.

Assuming that the core density of accreting neutron stars in\nLMXBs may reach the density of quark deconfinement, which can lead to phase\ntransition from neutron stars to strange quark stars, we show that the\nresultant MSPs are likely to have an eccentric orbit, due to the sudden loss of\nthe gravitational mass of the neutron star during the transition.

We employ a recently\ndeveloped kinetic model of T-cell regulation that contains the essential\nimmunosuppressive effects of vitamin-D. We employ Gillespie algorithm to make\nthe first study of fluctuations along the stochastic trajectories. This\nfluctuation-based IMRF can differentiate responses of different individuals\nafter pathogenic incursion both under healthy and disease conditions. We find\nthat relative fluctuations in T-cells (and hence IMRF) are different in\nstrongly regulated (malignant prone) and weakly regulated (autoimmune prone)\nregions. The cross-over from one steady state (weakly regulated) to the other\n(strongly regulated) is accompanied by a divergence-like growth in the\nfluctuation of both the effector and regulatory T-cell concentration over a\nwide range of pathogenic stimulation, displaying a dynamical phase transition\nlike behavior. The growth in fluctuation in this desired immune response regime\nis found to arise from an intermittent fluctuation between regulatory and\neffector T-cells that results in a bimodal distribution of population of each,\nindicating bistability. The signature of intermittent behavior is further\nconfirmed by calculating the power spectrum of the corresponding fluctuation of\ntime correlation function. The calculated time correlation functions of\nfluctuations show that the slow fluctuation causes the bistabilty in healthy\nstate. Thus, in diseases diagnosis process, such steady state response\nparameters can provide immense information which might become helpful to define\nan immune status.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 14:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We show that\n$\\mathcal{C}_P$ also lies on the points $P'$ and $Q'$, where $Q'$ is the\nisotomcomplement of $P'$. The conic $\\mathcal{C}_P$ lies on six other points\nwhich are the images of the vertices of $ABC$ under the affine mapping\n$\\lambda=T_{P'} \\circ T_P^{-1}$ and its inverse, where $T_P$ and $T_{P'}$ are\nthe unique affine maps taking $ABC$ to the cevian triangles of $P$ and $P'$,\nrespectively. In the paper we characterize the center $Z$ of $\\mathcal{C}_P$ as\nthe unique fixed point of $\\lambda$ in the extended plane, when $\\mathcal{C}_P$\nis a parabola or an ellipse, and the unique ordinary fixed point of $\\lambda$,\nwhen $\\mathcal{C}_P$ is a hyperbola. We also show that $Z=GV \\cdot T_P(GV)$,\nwhere $G$ is the centroid of $ABC$ and $V=PQ \\cdot P'Q'$.

In the case of coupling of leptons and quarks\nwith $W$, we extend the coupling ${^t\\phi}{\\mathcal C}X\\psi$ to\n${^t\\phi}{\\mathcal C}X(1-\\gamma_5)\\psi$, where $X=x_i$ or ${x_i}'$, and unify\nthe interactions in the form $ {^t\\phi}{\\mathcal\nC}\\bar{x_i}\\psi+{^t\\phi}{\\mathcal C} \\bar{{x_i}'} {\\mathcal C}\\psi $, where\n$\\bar{x_i}$ implies appropriate $x_i$ or $(-\\gamma_5 x_i)$ is chosen.
