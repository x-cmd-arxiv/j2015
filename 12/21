Typically a\nlonger-span non-local state or sequential application of few-qubit entangling\ngates are needed to produce a non-trivial multiqubit gate. In many cases a\nsingle non-local state that span over the entire system is difficult to use due\nto spectral crowding or impossible to have. At the same time, many multiqubit\nsystems can naturally develop a network of multiple non-local higher-energy\nstates that span over few qubits each. We show that continuous time quantum\nwalks can be used to address this problem by involving multiple such states to\nperform local and entangling operations concurrently on many qubits. This\nintroduces an alternative approach to multiqubit gate compression based on\navailable physical resources.

Daisy-chain regression methods are applied to inter-calibrate the\nobservers which may lead to significant bias and error accumulation. Here we\npresent a novel method to calibrate the visual acuity of the key observers to\nthe reference data set of Royal Greenwich Observatory sunspot groups for the\nperiod 1900-1976, using the statistics of the active-day fraction. For each\nobserver we independently evaluate their observational thresholds [S_S] defined\nsuch that the observer is assumed to miss all of the groups with an area\nsmaller than S_S and report all the groups larger than S_S. Next, using a\nMonte-Carlo method we construct, from the reference data set, a correction\nmatrix for each observer. The correction matrices are significantly non-linear\nand cannot be approximated by a linear regression or proportionality. We\nemphasize that corrections based on a linear proportionality between annually\naveraged data lead to serious biases and distortions of the data. The\ncorrection matrices are applied to the original sunspot group records for each\nday, and finally the composite corrected series is produced for the period\nsince 1748. The corrected series displays secular minima around 1800 (Dalton\nminimum) and 1900 (Gleissberg minimum), as well as the Modern grand maximum of\nactivity in the second half of the 20th century. The uniqueness of the grand\nmaximum is confirmed for the last 250 years.

Cyclic overlays may provide multiple paths, however, the\nsubscription broadcast process generates one content-based routing path per\nsubscription. This poses serious challenges in offering dynamic routing of\nnotifications when congestion is detected because instantaneous updates in\nrouting tables are required to generate alternative routing paths. This paper\nintroduces the first subscription-based publish/subscribe system, OctopiS,\nwhich offers inter-cluster dynamic routing when congestion in the output queues\nis detected. OctopiS is based on a formally defined Structured Cyclic Overlay\nTopology (SCOT). SCOT is divided into homogeneous clusters where each cluster\nhas equal number of brokers and connects to other clusters through multiple\ninter-cluster overlay links. These links are used to provide parallel routing\npaths between publishers and subscribers connected to brokers in different\nclusters. While aiming at deployment at data center networks, OctopiS generates\nsubscription-trees of shortest lengths used by Static Notification Routing\n(SNR) algorithm. Dynamic Notification Routing (DNR) algorithm uses a bit-vector\nmechanism to exploit the structuredness of a clustered SCOT to offer\ninter-cluster dynamic routing without making updates in routing tables and\nminimizing load on overwhelmed brokers and congested links.

The\nrestructuring problems correspond to redesign (improvement, upgrade) of modular\nsystems or solutions. The restructuring approach is described and illustrated\n(problem statements, solving schemes, examples) for the following combinatorial\noptimization problems: knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, assignment\nproblem, spanning tree problems, clustering problem, multicriteria ranking\n(sorting) problem, morphological clique problem.

In this paper, we focus on\nthe energy-aware design of the network selection, subchannel, and power\nallocation in cellular and Wi-Fi networks, while taking into account the\ntraffic delay of mobile users. The problem is particularly challenging due to\nthe two-timescale operations for the network selection (large timescale) and\nsubchannel and power allocation (small timescale). Based on the two-timescale\nLyapunov optimization technique, we first design an online Energy-Aware Network\nSelection and Resource Allocation (ENSRA) algorithm. The ENSRA algorithm yields\na power consumption within O(1/V) bound of the optimal value, and guarantees an\nO(V) traffic delay for any positive control parameter V. Motivated by the\nrecent advancement in the accurate estimation and prediction of user mobility,\nchannel conditions, and traffic demands, we further develop a novel predictive\nLyapunov optimization technique to utilize the predictive information, and\npropose a Predictive Energy-Aware Network Selection and Resource Allocation\n(P-ENSRA) algorithm. We characterize the performance bounds of P-ENSRA in terms\nof the power-delay tradeoff theoretically. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity, we finally propose a Greedy Predictive Energy-Aware Network\nSelection and Resource Allocation (GP-ENSRA) algorithm, where the operator\nsolves the problem in P-ENSRA approximately and iteratively. Numerical results\nshow that GP-ENSRA significantly improves the power-delay performance over\nENSRA in the large delay regime. For a wide range of system parameters,\nGP-ENSRA reduces the traffic delay over ENSRA by 20~30% under the same power\nconsumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 20:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 04:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

Thus\nSerifos is able to predict the latency caused by workload interference and the\naverage latency of concurrent workloads. Furthermore, Serifos leverages an I/O\nload balancing algorithm to dynamically balance the volumes across the cluster.\nExperimental results indicate that Serifos consolidation model is able to\nmaintain the mean prediction error of around 10% for heterogeneous hardware. As\na result of Serifos load balancing, we found that the variance and the maximum\naverage latency are reduced by 82% and 52%, respectively.

Our classification differs from the historical use of the\nterm \"gamma Cas stars\" defined from optical properties alone. The luminosity\noutput of this class contributes significantly to the hard X-ray production in\nmassive stars in the Galaxy. The gamma Cas stars have light curves showing\nvariability on a few broadly-defined timescales and spectra indicative of an\noptically thin plasma consisting of one or more hot thermal components. By now\n9--13 Galactic \\approx B0-1.5e main sequence stars are judged to be members or\ncandidate members of the \\gamma Cas class. Conservative criteria for this\ndesignation are for a \\approxB0-1.5e III-V star to have an X-ray luminosity of\n10^{32}--10^{33} ergs s^{-1}, a hot thermal spectrum containing the short\nwavelength Ly \\alpha FeXXV and FeXXVI lines and the fluorescence FeK feature\nall in emission. If thermality cannot be demonstrated, for example from either\nthe presence of these Ly \\alpha lines or curvature of the hard continuum; these\nare the gamma Cas candidates. We discuss the history of the discovery of the\ncomplicated characteristics of the variability in the optical, UV, and X-ray\ndomains, leading to suggestions for the physical cause of the production of\nhard X-rays. These include scenarios in which matter from the Be star accretes\nonto a degenerate secondary star and interactions between magnetic fields on\nthe Be star and its decretion disk. The greatest aid to the choice of the\ncausal mechanism is the temporal correlations of X-ray light curves and spectra\nwith diagnostics in the optical and UV wavebands.

We also\naddress an auxiliary consequence: The proliferation of networks as a now-common\ntheoretical model for large-scale systems, in concert with the use of\ntransfer-like entropies, has shoehorned dyadic relationships into our\nstructural interpretation of the organization and behavior of complex systems.\nThis interpretation thus fails to include the effects of polyadic dependencies.\nThe net result is that much of the sophisticated organization of complex\nsystems may go undetected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 03:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 15:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

After detailed analysis, we find that in order to realize\nchiral symmetry breaking and restoration, both profiles for the scalar\npotential and the dilaton field are essential. The scalar potential determines\nthe possible solution structure of the chiral condensate, except the mass term,\nit takes another quartic term for the two-flavor case, and for the three-flavor\ncase, one has to take into account an extra cubic term due to the t'Hooft\ndeterminant interaction.

Such high photoresponsivity is attributed to the\nincreased light absorption as well as the gain enhancement due to the existence\nof trap states in the few-layer ReS2 flakes. It further enables the detection\nof weak signals, as successfully demonstrated with weak light sources including\na lighter and limited fluorescent lighting.

Along compact\ndimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of the\nphases and on the branes Robin boundary conditions are imposed for the field\noperator.

The current density has nonzero components\nalong compact dimensions only. These components are decomposed into the\nbrane-free and brane-induced contributions. The component along a given compact\ndimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by that\ndimension, with the period of the flux quantum. An important feature, that\ndistinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the field\nsquared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes.

The separation of\nplanes in SDN, however, introduces new vulnerabilities in SDN networks since\nthe difference in processing packets at each plane allows an adversary to\nfingerprint the network's packet-forwarding logic. In this paper, we study the\nfeasibility of fingerprinting the controller-switch interactions by a remote\nadversary, whose aim is to acquire knowledge about specific flow rules that are\ninstalled at the switches. This knowledge empowers the adversary with a better\nunderstanding of the network's packet-forwarding logic and exposes the network\nto a number of threats. In our study, we collect measurements from hosts\nlocated across the globe using a realistic SDN network comprising of OpenFlow\nhardware and software switches. We show that, by leveraging information from\nthe RTT and packet-pair dispersion of the exchanged packets, fingerprinting\nattacks on SDN networks succeed with overwhelming probability. We also show\nthat these attacks are not restricted to active adversaries, but can be equally\nmounted by passive adversaries that only monitor traffic exchanged with the SDN\nnetwork. Finally, we discuss the implications of these attacks on the security\nof SDN networks, and we present and evaluate an efficient countermeasure to\nstrengthen SDN networks against fingerprinting. Our results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our countermeasure in deterring fingerprinting attacks on SDN\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 11:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

For these\noverlay networks to preserve their functionality, they should be able to\nrecover from various problems like membership changes or faults. Various\nself-stabilizing overlay networks have already been proposed in recent years,\nwhich have the advantage of being able to recover from any illegal state, but\nnone of these networks can give any guarantees on its functionality while the\nrecovery process is going on. We initiate research on overlay networks that are\nnot only self-stabilizing but that also ensure that searchability is maintained\nwhile the recovery process is going on, as long as there are no corrupted\nmessages in the system. More precisely, once a search message from node $u$ to\nanother node $v$ is successfully delivered, all future search messages from $u$\nto $v$ succeed as well. We call this property monotonic searchability. We show\nthat in general it is impossible to provide monotonic searchability if\ncorrupted messages are present in the system, which justifies the restriction\nto system states without corrupted messages. Furthermore, we provide a\nself-stabilizing protocol for the line for which we can also show monotonic\nsearchability. It turns out that even for the line it is non-trivial to achieve\nthis property.

In Euclidean space within the Matsubara imaginary\ntime formalism the quark propagator is not longer a O(4) symmetric function and\npossesses a discrete spectra of the fourth component of the momentum.

The key\nidea of ETS is the division of the spatial volume into a small region around\nthe nucleus and its outside; the radial coordinates are time scaled only in the\nouter region. The continuum components of photoelectron wave packets are\nprevented from reaching the edge of the spatial simulation volume, enabling the\nlong-time evolution of wave packets with a relatively small number of basis\nfunctions without concerns of electron reflections. On the other hand, the\nbound-state components are free from shrinking toward the origin because of\nnon-time scaling in the inner region. Hence, the equations of motion in ETS are\nless stiff than the ones in the original time-scaled coordinate approach in\nwhich the shrinking bound states make the equations of motion seriously stiff.\nFor numerical implementation of ETS, the working equations are derived in terms\nof finite-element discrete-variable-representation functions. Furthermore, the\nstiffness-free Lanczos time propagator is introduced to remove any persistent\nstiffness in the treatment of mid-IR lasers due to the involvement of hundreds\nof angular-momentum states. The test calculations for atomic hydrogen\ninteracting with linearly polarized mid-IR pulses demonstrate the accuracy and\nnumerical efficiency of the new scheme, and exhibit its special capability if\nthere is no recollision with the parent ion. Hence, ETS will show its true\npotential for the detailed analysis of photoelectron wave packet dynamics in\ncircularly or near-circularly polarized mid-IR fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 12:38:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 04:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

However, they also found\nthat the same algorithm is inefficient in the high signal-to-noise regime,\nsince a brute-force rescaling operation does not account for phase information.\nThis problem is mitigated in the new algorithm by subtracting the Wiener filter\nmean field from the proposed map prior to rescaling, leaving high\nsignal-to-noise information invariant in the joint step, and effectively only\nrescaling the low signal-to-noise component. To explore the full posterior, the\nnew joint move is then interleaved with a standard conditional Gibbs sky map\nmove. We apply our new algorithm to simplified simulations for which we can\nevaluate the exact posterior to study both its accuracy and performance, and\nfind good agreement with the exact posterior; marginal means agree to less than\n0.006 sigma, and standard deviations to better than 3%. The Markov Chain\ncorrelation length is of the same order of magnitude as those obtained by other\nstandard samplers in the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 13:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 12:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

New precision\nmeasurements of the reactor neutrino spectra as well as more complete input in\nnuclear data bases are needed to resolve the observed discrepancies between\nmodels and experimental results. This article proposes the combination of\nexperiments at reactors which are highly enriched in ${}^{235}$U with\ncommercial reactors with typically lower enrichment to gain new insights into\nthe origin of the anomalous neutrino spectrum. The presented method clarifies,\nif the spectral anomaly is either solely or not at all related to the predicted\n${}^{235}$U spectrum. Considering the current improvements of the energy scale\nuncertainty of present-day experiments, a significance of three sigma and above\ncan be reached. As an example, we discuss the option of a direct comparison of\nthe measured shape in the currently running Double Chooz near detector and the\nupcoming Stereo experiment. A quantitative feasibility study emphasizes that a\nprecise understanding of the energy scale systematics is a crucial prerequisite\nin recent and next generation experiments investigating the spectral anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 15:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 10:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}

Conventionally, the magnitude is defined by the logarithm of the\nreceived flux. This relationship is known as the Pogson formula. For received\nflux with a small signal to noise ratio (S/N), however, the formula gives a\nlarge magnitude error. We investigate whether the use of Inverse Hyperbolic\nSine function (after this referred to as the Asinh magnitude) in the modified\nformulae could allow for an alternative calculation of magnitudes for small S/N\nflux, and whether the new approach is better for representing the brightness of\nthat region.

Being a paper scientist the author\nrefers to the sheet of paper which is a stochastic fibrous set whose porous\ntexture can be considered as an archetype for many natural or artificial human\nstructures. The paper properties are correlated with its texture by taking\naccount the effect of chance occurring during its manufacturing process. The\ntheoretical developments, the formalism and the application methods presented\nin this study have a general significance beyond the only paper material.A\nspecific property of sets of objects randomly unorderly distributed in space is\ntheir interfaces orientation distribution. This distribution is usually\nobtained by the analysis of images sampled in the object sets. The density of\norientation probability of the fibers or of the texture interfaces, weighted by\ntheir length or by their area, can be interpreted as the radius of curvature of\nan outline or of a warped surface which characterizes, from a global and\nstatistical point of view, the texture geometry in two or three dimensions.\nThis figure named by the author the \"equivalent pore\", is with its elliptical\nshape similar to the one of the mean pore defined by the mean directional chord\nbetween the interfaces in the texture. Different methods of \"equivalent pore\"\nestablishing are analyzed : by conformal map of the fiber network or of the\ntexture interfaces, by images stereometric analysis of texture tomographical\ncuts, by scattering and diffraction of a laser light beam impacting the fibrous\ntexture or the material surface replica, by hard X-ray absorption and phase\ncontrast at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities(ESRF), in Grenoble.\nThe \"equivalent pore\" concept allows us to study random unordered sets behavior\nin strength fields while simplifying this analysis. Thus a phenomenon occurring\nin a plane set, in two dimensions, can be analyzed on its \"equivalent pore\"\nlinear outline, and a phenomenon which occurs in volume in a three dimensional\nset can be analyzed on its \"equivalent pore\" warped surface. This concept has\nbeen applied for physical, mechanical, optical and ionic conduction properties\nof materials like papers, boards, felts, nonwoven textiles, polymer foams,\nmetallic alloys with grain joints, geological grounds, and for the surface\nmapping of natural relief and of materials with different gloss, worn or\nroughness levels.The ellipse and the ellipso\\\"id, as well as multi-modes\ncompositions of it, are the most appropriate figures to represent the\n\"equivalent pore\" of materials with a random unordered texture. The fact that a\nlaw, which defines the curvature of an elliptic deterministic geometrical\nconfiguration, is essential to represent interface orientation allocation of\nelements whose spatial distribution is probabilistic is a noteworthy fact that\nmakes us wonder. This assertion is corroborated by fluid flow analysis through\nporous media. The global dissipated energy for fluid flow is distributed along\nthe motion (translation and rotation) and fluid deformation components on the\n\"equivalent pore\" whose surface is conformal to the texture interfaces\ntangential space. The porous media being homogenous and the fluid particles\nindistinguishable each ones from the others, due to permanent stochastic\nexchanges from one fluid volume element into another, we conclude that their\nmotion quantification is invariant on each point of the \"equivalent pore\"\nsurface. This quantification can be represented by a group of elliptical\ncylinders.The \"equivalent pore\" and cylinders group surface intersections\ndefine the fluid particle probabilistic paths in the porous media. One singular\ngeometrical configuration of the elliptic cylinders group union with the\nellipsoidal \"equivalent pore\" fulfills the minimal energy dissipation\nrequirements in the stress field applied to the fluid. The resulting paths are\nellipso\\\"ido-cylindrical curves carpeting the ellipso\\\"id by a beam of\nisoperim\\'etric lacets, in close or open loops depending on the possible\npairing off the curves in their nodals and isoclinal tangency points. The flow\nlaminarity and unrotationality are globally established in the porous media at\nthe macroscopic scale, for Reynold's number small values, in agreement with the\nresults found moreover. The so defined ellipso\\\"ido-cylindrical curve is a\nstationary curve at the average least action meaning, for a punctual mobile or\na deformable volume element moving on the surface of the ellipsoid from a nodal\nspot to the other in an antipodal position. This curve establishes a gauge\nwhich characterizes, from a global point of view, the physical space embraced\nby the fluid during its flow, in dynamical balance conditions compatible with\nthe stress field. The ellipso\\\"ido-cylindrical curve allows to carpet the\nellipso\\\"id as a function of one cyclic angular variable, which is a new\nconstruction for the ellipso\\\"id. When the set of the objects is isotropic the\ncurve is sphero-cylindrical whose plan mapping permit to decipher the tai-chi\nfigure of the Tao\\\"ist Buddhism philosophy.This study of random unordered\nobject sets, and more specially of fibrous porous media, allows to establish a\nstructural link between their small scale texture stochastic disorder and the\nharmonious order that emerges from these sets at a larger scale. The largest\nchance possible, compatible with the stress field which put a strain on these\nsets, is the necessary and sufficient variable which allows to best globally\nadjust their behaviors according to the probabilistic and deterministic laws\ngoverning their evolution.The vocabulary used in this study is issued from the\ncommon language, most of the time adapted to the material class, it is\ntransposable in other fields of interest. The text is completed by notes and a\nbibliography which refer to the works done following the presented concepts or\nin relation to this field of studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 13:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

In the experiments,\npedestrians are required to walk clockwise/anti-clockwise in a ring-shaped\ncorridor under normal situation and holding umbrella situation. No matter in\nuni- or bi-directional flow, the flow rate under holding umbrella situation\ndecreases comparing with that in normal situation. In bidirectional flow,\npedestrians segregate into two opposite moving streams very quickly under\nnormal situation, and clockwise/anti-clockwise walking pedestrians are always\nin the inner/outer lane due to right-walking preference. Under holding umbrella\nsituation, spontaneous lane formation has also occurred. However, when holding\numbrella, pedestrians may separate into more than two lanes. Moreover, the\nmerge of lanes have been observed, and clockwise/anti-clockwise pedestrians are\nnot always in the inner/outer lane. To model the flow dynamics, an improved\nforce-based model has been proposed. The contact force between umbrellas has\nbeen taken into account. Simulation results are in agreement with the\nexperimental ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 14:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-13"}
