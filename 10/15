The majority of them is at high redshifts (z~2-3), at the\npeak epoch of star formation in the Universe. Infrared, optical, radio, and\nX-ray data suggest that hot DOGs contain heavily obscured, extremely luminous\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). This class may represent a short phase in the\nlife of the galaxies, signifying the transition from starburst- to\nAGN-dominated phases. Hot DOGs are typically radio-quiet, but some of them show\nmJy-level emission in the radio (microwave) band. We observed four hot DOGs\nusing the technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The 1.7-GHz\nobservations with the European VLBI Network (EVN) revealed weak radio features\nin all sources. The radio is free from dust obscuration and, at such high\nredshifts, VLBI is sensitive only to compact structures that are characteristic\nof AGN activity. In two cases (WISE J0757+5113, WISE J1603+2745), the flux\ndensity of the VLBI-detected components is much smaller than the total flux\ndensity, suggesting that ~70-90 per cent of the radio emission, while still\ndominated by AGN, originates from angular scales larger than probed by the EVN.\nThe source WISE J1146+4129 appears a candidate compact symmetric object, and\nWISE J1814+3412 shows a 5.1-kpc double structure, reminiscent of hot spots in a\nmedium-sized symmetric object. Our observations support that AGN residing in\nhot DOGs may be genuine young radio sources where starburst and AGN activities\ncoexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 16:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

A challenge in machine learning is to create models that\ngeneralize to new data samples not seen in the training data. Recently, a\ncommon flaw in several machine learning algorithms was discovered: small\nperturbations added to the input data lead to consistent misclassification of\ndata samples. Samples that easily mislead the model are called adversarial\nexamples. Training a \"maxout\" network on adversarial examples has shown to\ndecrease this vulnerability, but also increase classification performance. This\npaper shows that adversarial training has a regularizing effect also in\nnetworks with logistic, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. A simple\nextension to the back-propagation method is proposed, that adds an adversarial\ngradient to the training. The extension requires an additional forward and\nbackward pass to calculate a modified input sample, or mini batch, used as\ninput for standard back-propagation learning. The first experimental results on\nMNIST show that the \"adversarial back-propagation\" method increases the\nresistance to adversarial examples and boosts the classification performance.\nThe extension reduces the classification error on the permutation invariant\nMNIST from 1.60% to 0.95% in a logistic network, and from 1.40% to 0.78% in a\nnetwork with rectified linear units. Results on CIFAR-10 indicate that the\nmethod has a regularizing effect similar to dropout in fully connected\nnetworks. Based on these promising results, adversarial back-propagation is\nproposed as a stand-alone regularizing method that should be further\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 16:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 16:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

The emergence of a new generation of interferometers\nwill allow to resolve these accretion disks and provide more information about\nthe properties of the central gravitating object. Due to this instrumental leap\nforward it is crucial to investigate the accretion disk physics near various\ntypes of inner compact objects now to deduce later constraints on the central\nobjects from observations. A possible candidate for the inner object is the\nboson star. Here, we will try to analyze the differences between accretion\nstructures surrounding boson stars and black holes. We aim at analysing the\nphysics of circular geodesics around boson stars and study simple thick\naccretion tori (so-called Polish doughnuts) in the vicinity of these stars. We\nrealize a detailed study of the properties of circular geodesics around boson\nstars. We then perform a parameter study of thick tori with constant angular\nmomentum surrounding boson stars. This is done using the boson star models\ncomputed by a code constructed with the spectral solver library KADATH. We\ndemonstrate that all the circular stable orbits are bound. In the case of a\nconstant angular momentum torus, a cusp in the torus surface exists only for\nboson stars with a strong gravitational scalar field. Moreover, for each inner\nradius of the disk, the allowed specific angular momentum values lie within a\nconstrained range which depends on the boson star considered. We show that the\naccretion tori around boson stars have different characteristics than in the\nvicinity of a black hole. With future instruments it could be possible to use\nthese differences to constrain the nature of compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 16:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Our focus is on protoplanetary disks (PPDs), which are\nexposed during their later evolution to an intense, magnetized wind from the\ncentral star. A radial magnetic field is mixed into a thin surface layer, is\nwound up by the disk shear, and is pushed downward by a combination of\nturbulent mixing and ambipolar and Ohmic drift. The toroidal field reaches much\ngreater strengths than the seed vertical field that is usually invoked in PPD\nmodels, even becoming superthermal. Linear stability analysis indicates that\nthe disk experiences the magnetorotational instability (MRI) at a higher\nmagnetization than a vertically magnetized disk when both the effects of\nambipolar and Hall drift are taken into account. Steady vertical profiles of\ndensity and magnetic field are obtained at several radii between 0.06 and 1 AU\nin response to a wind magnetic field $B_r \\sim (10^{-4}$-$10^{-2})(r/{\\rm\nAU})^{-2}$ G. Careful attention is given to the radial and vertical ionization\nstructure resulting from irradiation by stellar X-rays. The disk is more\nstrongly magnetized closer to the star, where it can support a higher rate of\nmass transfer.

Both groups\ninteract similarly with the information within their echo chamber. We examine\n47,780 debunking posts and find that attempts at debunking are largely\nineffective. For one, only a small fraction of usual consumers of\nunsubstantiated information interact with the posts. Furthermore, we show that\nthose few are often the most committed conspiracy users and rather than\ninternalizing debunking information, they often react to it negatively. Indeed,\nafter interacting with debunking posts, users retain, or even increase, their\nengagement within the conspiracy echo chamber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 17:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-16"}

Both observational\nand computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer\nthat massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale\n($\\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present\nstudy is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a\nfilament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can\nexpand $\\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\\gtrsim10^4\nM_\\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today.

All the\ncomputed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared\nwith those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\\lesssim100$ Myr, in\nthe Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the\nabove compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to\ntwo-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by\nprimordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of\nyoung massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the\nobserved ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the\nexpansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body\ncalculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion, with\n$\\approx30$% star formation efficiency, can indeed swell the newborn embedded\ncluster adequately.

The\nvalidity of using the explicit hydrogen model is proved by its ability to\npredict the side chain dihedral angle distributions observed in proteins.

We observe distinct gas absorption properties among different lenses\nand among sightlines of individual lenses. Specifically, while the quadruple\nlens for HE0435-1223 shows no absorption features to very sensitive limits\nalong all four sightlines, strong Mg II, Fe II, Mg I, and Ca II absorption\ntransitions are detected along both sightlines near the double lens for\nHE0047-1756, and in one of the two sightlines near the double lens for\nHE1104-1805. The absorbers are resolved into 8-15 individual components with a\nline-of-sight velocity spread of dv~300-600 km/s. The large ionic column\ndensities, log N>14, observed in two components suggest that these may be Lyman\nlimit or damped Lya absorbers with a significant neutral hydrogen fraction. The\nmajority of the absorbing components exhibit a uniform super solar Fe/Mg ratio\nwith a scatter of <0.1 dex across the full dv range.

In V-T theory\nthe liquid atomic motion consists of two contributions, normal mode vibrations\nin a single representative potential energy valley, and transits, which carry\nthe system across boundaries between valleys. The mean square displacement time\ncorrelation function (the MSD) is a direct measure of the atomic motion , and\nour goal is to determine if the V-T formalism can produce a physically sensible\naccount of this motion. We employ molecular dynamics (MD) data for a system\nrepresenting liquid Na, and find the motion evolves in three successive time\nintervals: On the first \"vibrational\" interval, the vibrational motion alone\ngives a highly accurate account of the MD data; on the second \"crossover\"\ninterval, the vibrational MSD saturates to a constant while the transit motion\nbuilds up from zero; on the third \"random walk\" interval, the transit motion\nproduces a purely diffusive random walk of the vibrational equilibrium\npositions. This motional evolution agrees with, and adds refinement to, the MSD\natomic motion as described by current liquid dynamics theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 21:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation\nglobally solves many OPF problems. However, there exist practical problems for\nwhich the SDP relaxation fails to yield the global solution. Conditions for the\nsuccess or failure of the SDP relaxation are valuable for determining whether\nthe relaxation is appropriate for a given OPF problem. To move beyond existing\nconditions, which only apply to a limited class of problems, a typical\nconjecture is that failure of the SDP relaxation can be related to physical\ncharacteristics of the system. By presenting an example OPF problem with two\nequivalent formulations, this paper demonstrates that physically based\nconditions cannot universally explain algorithm behavior. The SDP relaxation\nfails for one formulation but succeeds in finding the global solution to the\nother formulation. Since these formulations represent the same system, success\n(or otherwise) of the SDP relaxation must involve factors beyond just the\nnetwork physics. The lack of universal physical conditions for success of the\nSDP relaxation motivates the development of tighter convex relaxations capable\nof solving a broader class of problems. Tools from polynomial optimization\ntheory provide a means of developing tighter relaxations. We use the example\nOPF problem to illustrate relaxations from the Lasserre hierarchy for\npolynomial optimization and a related \"mixed semidefinite/second-order cone\nprogramming\" hierarchy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 22:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Then the question is if the effects of a Type IV\nsingularity can be detected in the process of cosmic evolution. In this paper\nwe address this question in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. As we demonstrate,\nthe effects of a Type IV singularity appear in the Hubble flow parameters,\nwhich determine the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system. So we study\nvarious inflation models incorporating a Type IV singularity, with the\nsingularity occurring at the end of inflation. Particularly we study a toy\nmodel and a singular version of the $R^2$ gravity Hubble rate. As we evince,\nsome of the Hubble flow parameters become singular at the singularity, an\neffect which indicates that at that point a dynamical instability occurs. This\ndynamical instability eventually indicates the graceful exit from inflation. We\ndemonstrate that the toy model has an unstable de Sitter point at the\nsingularity, so indeed graceful exit could be triggered. In the case of the\nsingular inflation model, graceful exit proceeds in the standard way. In the\ncase of the singular inflation model, we found various scenarios for singular\nevolution, most of which are compatible with observations, and only one leads\nto severe instabilities. We also compare the ordinary Starobinsky with the\nsingular inflation model, and we point out the qualitative and quantitative\ndifferences. Finally, we study the late-time dynamics of the toy model and of\nthe singular inflation model and we demonstrate that the unification of early\nand late-time acceleration can be achieved.

Thus, each User Equipment (UE) can\ncommunicate with its Avatar, a software clone located in a cloudlet, with lower\nend-to-end (E2E) delay. However, UEs are moving over time, and so the low E2E\ndelay may not be maintained if UEs' Avatars stay in their original cloudlets.\nThus, live Avatar migration (i.e., migrating a UE's Avatar to a suitable\ncloudlet based on the UE's location) is enabled to maintain low E2E delay\nbetween each UE and its Avatar. On the other hand, the migration itself incurs\nextra overheads in terms of resources of the Avatar, which compromise the\nperformance of applications running in the Avatar. By considering the gain\n(i.e., the E2E delay reduction) and the cost (i.e., the migration overheads) of\nthe live Avatar migration, we propose a PRofIt Maximization Avatar pLacement\n(PRIMAL) strategy for the cloudlet network in order to optimize the tradeoff\nbetween the migration gain and the migration cost by selectively migrating the\nAvatars to their optimal locations.

A key in both approaches is to obtain the so called\n\"memory kernel\" or \"generator\", going beyond second or fourth order\nperturbation techniques. While numerically converged techniques are available\nfor the TC memory kernel, the canonical approach to obtain the TCL generator is\nbased on inverting a super-operator in the \\emph{full} Hilbert space, which is\ndifficult to perform and thus, all applications of the TCL approach rely on a\nperturbative scheme of some sort.

Classical approaches are typically designed for the case in which the\nsubspace dimension is small relative to the ambient dimension. Our approach\nworks with a dual representation of the subspace and hence aims to find its\northogonal complement; as such, it is particularly suitable for subspaces whose\ndimension is close to the ambient dimension (subspaces of high relative\ndimension). We pose the problem of computing normal vectors to the inlier\nsubspace as a non-convex $\\ell_1$ minimization problem on the sphere, which we\ncall Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) problem. We provide theoretical\nguarantees under which every global solution to DPCP is a vector in the\northogonal complement of the inlier subspace. Moreover, we relax the non-convex\nDPCP problem to a recursion of linear programs whose solutions are shown to\nconverge in a finite number of steps to a vector orthogonal to the subspace. In\nparticular, when the inlier subspace is a hyperplane, the solutions to the\nrecursion of linear programs converge to the global minimum of the non-convex\nDPCP problem in a finite number of steps.

In order to secure the transmission of secret data over\nthe public network (Internet), various schemes have been presented over the\nlast decade. Steganography combined with cryptography, can be one of the best\nchoices for solving this problem. This paper proposes a new steganographic\nmethod based on gray-level modification for true colour images using image\ntransposition, secret key and cryptography. Both the secret key and secret\ninformation are initially encrypted using multiple encryption algorithms\n(bitxor operation, bits shuffling, and stego key-based encryption); these are,\nsubsequently, hidden in the host image pixels. In addition, the input image is\ntransposed before data hiding. Image transposition, bits shuffling, bitxoring,\nstego key-based encryption, and gray-level modification introduce five\ndifferent security levels to the proposed scheme, making the data recovery\nextremely difficult for attackers. The proposed technique is evaluated by\nobjective analysis using various image quality assessment metrics, producing\npromising results in terms of imperceptibility and security. Moreover, the high\nquality stego images and its minimal histogram changeability, also validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 06:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

Here we report on an XMM-Newton\nobservation of RX J2015.6+3711 performed in 2014, where we detected a coherent\nX-ray modulation at a period of 7196+/-11 s, and discovered other significant\n(>6sigma) small-amplitude periodicities which we interpret as the CV spin\nperiod and the sidebands of a possible ~12 hr periodicity, respectively. The\n0.3-10 keV spectrum can be described by a power law (Gamma = 1.15+/-0.04) with\na complex absorption pattern, a broad emission feature at 6.60+/-0.01 keV, and\nan unabsorbed flux of (3.16+/-0.05)x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2. We observed a\nsignificant spectral variability along the spin phase, which can be ascribed\nmainly to changes in the density of a partial absorber and the power law\nnormalization.

The focus is on the stationary dynamics of the model and in\nparticular on the effect of inhomogeneities in the interaction topology on the\nstationary behavior. We start from a micro-level Markov chain description of\nthe model. Markov chain aggregation is then used to derive a macro chain for\nthe complete graph as well as a meso-level description for the two-community\ngraph composed of two (weakly) coupled sub-communities. In both cases, a\ndetailed understanding of the model behavior is possible using Markov chain\ntools. More importantly, however, this setting provides an analytical scenario\nto study the discrepancy between the homogeneous mixing case and the model on a\nslightly more complex topology. We show that memory effects are introduced at\nthe macro level when we aggregate over agent attributes without sensitivity to\nthe microscopic details and quantify these effects using concepts from\ninformation theory. In this way, the method facilitates the analysis of the\nrelation between microscopic processes and a their aggregation to a macroscopic\nlevel of description and informs about the complexity of a system introduced by\nheterogeneous interaction relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 10:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-16"}

In the large deviation setting, this\nproblem is equivalent to maximizing the asymptotic decay rate of the largest\nqueue-overflow probability. We first derive an upper bound on the decay rate of\nthe queue overflow probability as the queue overflow threshold approaches\ninfinity. Then, we study several structural properties of the minimum-cost-path\nto overflow of the queue with the largest length, which is basically equivalent\nto the decay rate of the largest queue-overflow probability. Given these\nproperties, we prove that the queue with the largest length follows a sample\npath with linear increment.

Specifically,\nthe MTs first cache in their local memories in off-peak hours and then exchange\nthe requested files with each other in the vicinity during peak hours. However,\nprior works largely overlook MTs' heterogeneity in file preferences and their\nselfish behaviours. In this paper, we practically categorize the MTs into\ndifferent interest groups according to the MTs' preferences. Each group of MTs\naims to increase the probability of successful file discovery from the\nneighbouring MTs (from the same or different groups). Hence, we define the\ngroups' utilities as the probability of successfully discovering the file in\nthe neighbouring MTs, which should be maximized by deciding the caching\nstrategies of different groups. By modelling MTs' mobilities as homogeneous\nPoisson point processes (HPPPs), we analytically characterize MTs' utilities in\nclosed-form. We first consider the fully cooperative case where a centralizer\nhelps all groups to make caching decisions. We formulate the problem as a\nweighted-sum utility maximization problem, through which the maximum utility\ntrade-offs of different groups are characterized. Next, we study two benchmark\ncases under selfish caching, namely, partial and no cooperation, with and\nwithout inter-group file sharing, respectively. The optimal caching\ndistributions for these two cases are derived. Finally, numerical examples are\npresented to compare the utilities under different cases and show the\neffectiveness of the fully cooperative local caching compared to the two\nbenchmark cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 13:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 07:47:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 04:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 03:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 04:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

First, a novel criterion for the general\ncharacterization of least favorable distributions is proposed, which unifies\nexisting results. This criterion is then used to derive an implicit definition\nof the least favorable distributions under band uncertainties. In contrast to\nthe existing solution, it only requires two scalar values to be determined and\neliminates the need for case-by-case statements. Based on this definition, a\ngeneric fixed-point algorithm is proposed that iteratively calculates the least\nfavorable distributions for arbitrary band specifications. Finally, three\ndifferent types of robust tests that emerge from band models are discussed and\na numerical example is presented to illustrate their potential use in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 13:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2018 18:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-05"}

One interesting candidate for the walking\ntechnicolor is the QCD with the large number of fermion flavors, involving the\none-family model having the eight-fermion flavors. The smallness of the\ntechnidilaton mass can be ensured by the generic walking feature, Miransky\nscaling, and the presence of the \"anti-Veneziano limit\" characteristic to the\nlarge-flavor walking scenario.

The\ngoal is to use known signals corresponding to individual cell-types along with\na model of the mixing process to cast the deconvolution problem as a suitable\noptimization problem.\n  In this paper, we present a survey of models, methods, and assumptions\nunderlying deconvolution techniques. We investigate the choice of the different\nloss functions for evaluating estimation error, constraints on solutions,\npreprocessing and data filtering, feature selection, and regularization to\nenhance the quality of solutions, along with the impact of these choices on the\nperformance of regression-based methods for deconvolution. We assess different\ncombinations of these factors and use detailed statistical measures to evaluate\ntheir effectiveness. We identify shortcomings of current methods and avenues\nfor further investigation. For many of the identified shortcomings, such as\nnormalization issues and data filtering, we provide new solutions. We summarize\nour findings in a prescriptive step-by-step process, which can be applied to a\nwide range of deconvolution problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 15:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

New insights are achieved by defining the average uncertainty in the\nprobability domain as a transformation of entropy functions. The Shannon\nentropy when transformed to the probability domain is the weighted geometric\nmean of the probabilities. For the exponential and Gaussian distributions, we\nshow that the weighted geometric mean of the distribution is equal to the\ndensity of the distribution at the location plus the scale, i.e. at the width\nof the distribution. The average uncertainty is generalized via the weighted\ngeneralized mean, in which the moment is a function of the nonlinear source.\nBoth the Renyi and Tsallis entropies transform to this definition of the\ngeneralized average uncertainty in the probability domain. For the generalized\nPareto and Student's t-distributions, which are the maximum entropy\ndistributions for these generalized entropies, the appropriate weighted\ngeneralized mean also equals the density of the distribution at the location\nplus scale. A coupled entropy function is proposed, which is equal to the\nnormalized Tsallis entropy divided by one plus the coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 15:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 20:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 19:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

Namely, two ratios of order unity. (1) The\ncombination of the stellar mass scale, M*, with the Planck mass, MPl, and the\nChandrasekhar mass leads to a ratio of order unity that reads\nNPl*=MPl/[(M*)(mp)^2]^{1/3}=0.15-3, where mp is the proton mass. (2) A system\nwith a dynamical time equals to the nuclear life times of stars, tau, has a\ndensity of rhoD = 1/[(G)(tau)^2]. The ratio of the dark energy density to this\ndensity is NL*=rhoL/rhoD=10^{-7} - 10^{5}$. Although the range is large, it is\ncritically much smaller than the 123 orders of magnitude usually referred to\nwhen rhoL is compered to the Planck density. In the pure fundamental particles\ndomain there is no naturalness; either naturalness does not exist or there is a\nneed for a new physics or new particles. The `Astrophysical Naturalness' offers\na third possibility: stars introduce the combinations of, or relations among,\nknown fundamental quantities that lead to naturalness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 17:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 13:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}
