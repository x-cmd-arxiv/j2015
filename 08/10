Our\nframework is based on the Fourier-Galerkin method with exact and approximate\nintegrations that has recently been shown to generalize the Lippmann-Schwinger\nsetting of the original work by Moulinec and Suquet from 1994. It follows from\nthis variational format that the ensuing system of linear equations can be\nsolved by general-purpose iterative algorithms for symmetric positive-definite\nsystems, such as the Richardson, the Conjugate gradient, and the Chebyshev\nalgorithms, that are compared here to the Eyre-Milton scheme - the most\nefficient specialized method currently available. Our numerical experiments,\ncarried out for two-dimensional elliptic problems, reveal that the Conjugate\ngradient algorithm is the most efficient option, while the Eyre-Milton method\nperforms comparably to the Chebyshev semi-iteration. The Richardson algorithm,\nequivalent to the still widely used original Moulinec-Suquet solver, exhibits\nthe slowest convergence. Besides this, we hope that our study highlights the\npotential of the well-established techniques of numerical linear algebra to\nfurther increase the efficiency of FFT-based homogenization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2015 16:14:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 13:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

Experimentally, it is known that\nmultivalent counterions have strong effect on the DNA condensation phenomenon.\nWhile tri- and tetra-valent counterions are shown to easily condense free DNA\nmolecules in solution into toroidal bundles, the situation with divalent\ncounterions are not as clear cut.

It has been suggested that divalent\ncounterions can induce attraction between DNA molecules but the strength of the\nattraction is not strong enough to condense free DNA in solution. However, if\nthe configuration entropy of DNA is restricted, these attractions are enough to\ncause appreciable effects. The variations among different divalent salts might\nbe due to the hydration effect of the divalent counterions.

This deceptively simple question has important consequences\nfor ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo\ndramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of\nthese shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states.\nUnfortunately, the concept of stability in ecology has suffered from\nsubstantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where\nstochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable\nstates. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a\nball-in-cup diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the\nposition of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push\nthe ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by\na potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. However,\nsystems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite\nrare. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other\napproaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear\nstability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and,\nas we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will\nbehave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how\nthe potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly,\nemploying a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using\nthree classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential\nprovides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2015 21:52:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 17:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 05:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

The spin-phonon coupling can\nbe turned off by electrostatically shifting the electron wave function on the\nnanotube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 02:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

For hyperbolic groups, it is known that asymptotic\ndimension of the group is bounded above by the dimension of the boundary plus\none, which is known to be finite. For CAT(0) groups, the latter quantity is\nalso known to be finite, so one approach is to try proving a similar\ninequality. So far those efforts have failed.\n  Motivated by these questions we work toward understanding the relationship\nbetween large scale dimension of CAT(0) groups and small scale dimension of the\ngroup's boundary by shifting attention to the linearly controlled dimension of\nthe boundary. To do that, one must choose appropriate metrics for the\nboundaries. In this paper, we suggest two candidates and develop some basic\nproperties. Under one choice, we show that linearly controlled dimension of the\nboundary remains finite; under another choice, we prove that macroscopic\ndimension of the group is bounded above by twice the linearly controlled\ndimension of the boundary plus one.

In this paper, the fracture\nresistance of zigzag SWNTs with preexisting defects is calculated using\nfracture mechanics concepts based on atomistic simulations. The problem of\nunstable crack growth at finite temperature, presumably caused by lattice\ntrapping effect, is circumvented by computing the strain energy release rate\nthrough a series of displacement-controlled tensile loading of SWNTs (applied\nthrough moving the outermost layer of atoms at one end at constant strain rate\nof 9.4x10-4/ps) with pre-existing crack-like defects of various lengths. The\nstrain energy release rate, G, is computed for (17,0), (28,0) and (35,0) SWNTs\n(each with aspect ratio 4) with pre-existing cracks up to 29.5{\\AA} long. The\nfracture resistance, Gc, is determined as a function of crack length for each\ntube at three different temperatures (1K, 300K and 500K). A significant\ndependence of Gc on crack length is observed reminiscent of the rising R curve\nbehavior of metals at the macroscale: for the zigzag nanotubes Gc increases\nwith crack length at small length, and tends to reach a constant value if the\ntube diameter is large enough. We suspect that the lattice trapping effect\nplays the role of crack tip plasticity at the atomic scale. For example, at 300\nKelvin, Gc for the (35,0) tube with aspect ratio 4 converges to 6 Joule/m2 as\nthe crack length exceeds 20 Angstrom. This value is comparable with the\nfracture toughness of graphite and Silicon. The fracture resistance of the\ntubes is found to decrease significantly as the temperature increases. To study\nthe length effects, the computations are repeated for zigzag nanotubes with the\nsame three chiralities but with aspect ratio 8 at 1K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 04:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

In this area most algorithms are\nrandomized, and in almost all cases the approximation ratios obtained by\ncurrent randomized algorithms are superior to the best results obtained by\nknown deterministic algorithms. Derandomization of algorithms for general\nsubmodular function maximization seems hard since the access to the function is\ndone via a value oracle. This makes it hard, for example, to apply standard\nderandomization techniques such as conditional expectations. Therefore, an\ninteresting fundamental problem in this area is whether randomization is\ninherently necessary for obtaining good approximation ratios.\n  In this work we give evidence that randomization is not necessary for\nobtaining good algorithms by presenting a new technique for derandomization of\nalgorithms for submodular function maximization.

Since the weight evaluations are not\ntrivial tasks, an alternative approximated approach was proposed by Park and\nPande (Phys. Rev.

The ideas above are\nanalyzed in four distinct lattice models presenting strong first-order phase\ntransitions, hence constituting ideal examples in which the performance of\nalgorithm is fundamental. In all cases, our results reveal that approximated\nweights work properly in the regime of larger $R$'s.

As\nsimulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whether\nthe black hole dynamics is influenced by the treatment of the interstellar\nmedium in different simulation codes. We here compare simulations of black hole\ngrowth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\ncode Gasoline, and the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code Ramses. We seek to\nidentify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences in\nhydrodynamic methods and implementations of sub-grid physics. We find that the\ngeneral behavior is consistent between codes. Black hole accretion is minimal\nwhile the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they \"fly-by\" within 10 kpc\nat first pericenter). At late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,\ntidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black hole\naccretion accompanied by star formation. We also note quantitative\ndiscrepancies that are model-dependent: our Ramses simulations show less star\nformation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with larger\nclumps and filaments, than our Gasoline simulations. We attribute these\ndifferences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling and\nfeedback and gas thermodynamics. The main conclusion is that differences exist\nquantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when making\ncomparisons with observations. However, reassuringly, both codes capture the\nsame dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering of black hole accretion, star\nformation, and black hole dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 12:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

We consider a scenario where sensors need to identify\nwhether a given event has occurred based on its periodic, noisy, observations\nof a given signal. Such information about the signal needs to be sent to a\nfusion center that decides about the actual state at that specific observation\ntime. The communication links -- single- or multi-hop -- are modeled as binary\nsymmetric channels, which may have different error probabilities. The decision\nat the fusion center is based on OR, AND, K-OUT-OF-N and MAJORITY Boolean\noperations on the received signals associated to individual sensor\nobservations. We derive closed-form equations for the average decision error\nprobability as a function of the system parameters (e.g. number of sensors and\nhops) and the input signal characterization.

Additionally, the time\none map of the associated flow is computed by a familiar algorithm in numerical\nlinear algebra.\n  The text is mostly expositive and self contained, presenting alternative\nformulations of familiar results and applications to numerical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 12:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

The dynamics, derived\nfrom the consideration of experimental observations on human social behavior\ndriven by self-esteem, turns out to be non-payoff monotonic. This property\ngives rise to nontrivial evolution in the players' strategies, which we study\nboth numerically and analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 11:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 00:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}
