Our aim is to explain these\nvariations with changes in the ISM properties and grain evolution. Our starting\npoint is the latest core-mantle dust model. It consists of small aromatic-rich\ncarbon grains, larger amorphous carbon grains with aliphatic-rich cores and\naromatic-rich mantles, and amorphous silicates with Fe/FeS nano-inclusions\ncovered by aromatic-rich carbon mantles. We explore whether variations in the\nradiation field or in the gas density distribution in the diffuse ISM could\nexplain the observations. The dust properties are also varied in terms of\nmantle thickness, Fe/FeS inclusions, carbon abundance, and size distribution.\nVariations in the radiation field intensity and gas density distribution cannot\nexplain the observed variations but radiation fields harder than the standard\nISRF may participate in creating part of them. We further show that variations\nin the grain mantle thickness coupled with changes in the grain size\ndistribution can reproduce most of the observations. We put a limit on the\nmantle thickness of the silicates (~10-15nm), and find that aromatic-rich\nmantles are needed for the carbon grains (at least 5-7.5nm thick). We also find\nthat changes in the carbon abundance in the grains could explain part of the\nobserved variations. Finally, we show that varying the composition of Fe/FeS\ninclusions in the silicates cannot account for the variations. With small\nvariations in the dust properties, we are able to explain most of the\nvariations in the dust emission observed by Planck-HFI in the diffuse ISM.

A community\n(also referred to as a cluster) is a set of cohesive vertices that have more\nconnections inside the set than outside. In many social and information\nnetworks, these communities naturally overlap. For instance, in a social\nnetwork, each vertex in a graph corresponds to an individual who usually\nparticipates in multiple communities. In this paper, we propose an efficient\noverlapping community detection algorithm using a seed expansion approach. The\nkey idea of our algorithm is to find good seeds, and then greedily expand these\nseeds based on a community metric. Within this seed expansion method, we\ninvestigate the problem of how to determine good seed nodes in a graph. In\nparticular, we develop new seeding strategies for a personalized PageRank\nclustering scheme that optimizes the conductance community score. Experimental\nresults show that our seed expansion algorithm outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art overlapping community detection methods in terms of producing\ncohesive clusters and identifying ground-truth communities. We also show that\nour new seeding strategies are better than existing strategies, and are thus\neffective in finding good overlapping communities in real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 16:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 16:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-06"}

We suggest a\nstraightforward extension of tdBAG in order to take the dynamical breaking of\nchiral symmetry and the influence of vector interactions explicitly into\naccount. As for tdBAG the model mimics confinement in a phenomenological\napproach. It is based on an analysis of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at\nfinite density. Furthermore, we demonstrate how NJL and bag models in this\nregime follow from the more general and QCD based framework of Dyson-Schwinger\n(DS) equations in medium by assuming a simple gluon contact interaction. Based\non our simple and novel model, we construct quark hadron hybrid equations of\nstate (EoS) and study systematically chiral and deconfinement phase\ntransitions, the appearance of $s$-quarks and the role of vector interaction.\nWe further study these aspects for matter in beta-equilibrium at zero\ntemperature, with particular focus on the current ~2 solar masses maximum mass\nconstraint for neutron stars. Our approach indicates that the currently only\ntheoretical evidence for the hypothesis of stable strange matter is an artifact\nof tdBAG and results from neglecting the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 16:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Previous analysis on the prompt phase revealed\nsimilarities with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) bursts observed by Fermi: i) a\ndelayed onset of the high-energy emission ($> 100$ MeV), ii) a short-lasting\nbright peak at later times and iii) a temporally extended component from this\nphase and lasting hundreds of seconds. Additionally to the prompt phase,\nmultiwavelength observations over different epochs showed that the spectral\nenergy distribution was better fitted by a wind afterglow model. We present a\nleptonic model based on an early afterglow that evolves in a stellar wind of\nits progenitor. We apply this model to interpret the temporally extended LAT\nemission and the brightest LAT peak exhibited by the prompt phase of GRB\n110731A. Additionally, using the same set of parameters, we describe the\nmultiwavelength afterglow observations. The origin of the temporally extended\nLAT, X-ray and optical flux is explained through synchrotron radiation from the\nforward shock and the brightest LAT peak is described evoking the synchrotron\nself-Compton emission from the reverse shock.

To this aim the current FNAL--Booster neutrino beam\nfor a Short--Baseline experiment was carefully evaluated by considering the use\nof magnetic spectrometers at two sites, near and far ones. The detector\nlocations were studied, together with the achievable performances of two\nOPERA--like spectrometers. The study was constrained by the availability of\nexisting hardware and a time--schedule compatible with the undergoing project\nof multi--site Liquid--Argon detectors at FNAL.\n  The settled physics case and the kind of proposed experiment on the Booster\nneutrino beam would definitively clarify the existing tension between the\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$ disappearance and the $\\nu_e$ appearance/disappearance at the eV\nmass scale. In the context of neutrino oscillations the measurement of\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$ disappearance is a robust and fast approach to either reject or\ndiscover new neutrino states at the eV mass scale. We discuss an experimental\nprogram able to extend by more than one order of magnitude (for neutrino\ndisappearance) and by almost one order of magnitude (for antineutrino\ndisappearance) the present range of sensitivity for the mixing angle between\nstandard and sterile neutrinos. These extensions are larger than those achieved\nin any other proposal presented so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 17:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 12:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 15:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

We investigate our ability to reconstruct this relative\nvelocity using large N-body simulations where we evolve neutrinos as distinct\nparticles alongside the dark matter.

Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to\nconstrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their\nproperties evolve with time on the main-sequence.\n  Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed\nrotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters\nin our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar\nmass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed\nin Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the\nmain-sequence.\n  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters\nas $\\dot{M}_\\star \\propto R_\\star^2 \\Omega_\\star^{1.33} M_\\star^{-3.36}$. We\nestimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is\nan order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to\nthe wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of\nthis change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the\nspread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at\na given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age.\n  Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution\nof stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of\nstellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages. Given the\nsensitivity of planetary atmospheres to stellar wind and radiation conditions,\nthese uncertainties can be significant for our understanding of the evolution\nof planetary environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 18:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 22:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

In our picture, cosmic rays streaming ahead\nof the forward shock generate parallel (with respect to the local magnetic\nfield direction) circularly polarized Alfven waves that are almost free of\ndissipation, and due to being circularly polarized exhibit no spatial variation\nof magnetic field strength. Following interaction with the SNR shock with\nnonzero obliquity, these parallel waves become obliquely propagating, due the\nthe wave refraction (different in principle for the different plane wave\ncomponents), and dissipation sets in. The magnetosonic polarization decays\nfaster, due to transit time damping, leaving only the Alfven mode. This\nsurviving mode now exhibits a spatial variation of the magnetic field, leading\nto local maxima and minima in the synchrotron emission, i.e. the stripes. We\nattribute the initial wave generation to the Bell instability, which in\ncontrast to the resonant generation of upstream Alfven waves, gives rise to a\npreferred wavelength, and hence the single wave period at which the stripes are\nseen. Based on estimates for damping rates due to turbulent cascade and transit\ntime damping, we estimate the dependence of the visibility of the stripes on\nthe shock obliquity, and determine a maximum cosmic ray energy in Tycho's SNR\nin the range $6\\times 10^{14} - 1\\times 10^{15}$ eV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 19:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Many authors have associated this\namplification ability to some type of mechanical resonance within the cochlea,\nhowever there is still no consensus regarding the precise cause of\namplification. Our work is inspired by experiments showing that the outer hair\ncells within the cochlear partition change their lengths when stimulated, which\ncan in turn cause periodic distortions of the BM and other structures in the\ncochlea. This paper investigates a novel fluid-mechanical resonance mechanism\nthat derives from hydrodynamic interactions between an oscillating BM and the\nsurrounding cochlear fluid.

For a given temperature, the effective\ninteraction is obtained best from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on a\ndensity functional approach, this study proposes three methods of predicting\nthe PMF for any temperature based on a single molecular dynamics simulation for\none temperature. The three methods construct the PMF by considering the ligands\nas an ideal gas, as hard-sphere chains, or as Lennard-Jones interaction sites.\nTo apply this methodology, the density of the interaction centers must be\nextracted from the simulation data. For the ideal gas model, a straightforward\nsampling procedure with a fixed lattice in space leads to free energies that\nare too large in order to consistently explain the simulation data for\ndifferent temperatures. Naive sampling does not account for the small momenta\nadded to the NCs when coupled to a thermostat. A method is proposed that\ncorrects for the unphysical steps during the simulation. The ideal gas\ncontribution computed for the corrected density is significantly smaller than\nthe one obtained from naive sampling and can thus explain the temperature\ndependence of the PMF correctly. For the hard-sphere chain model, where a\nweighted density is used, the correction of the particle density is not\nessential. However, the PMF calculated based on the corrected density confirms\nour approach. All three models predict PMF curves in very good agreement with\nsimulation results, but they differ in the number of input parameters and the\ncomputational effort.

The aim of the study is to constrain the physics of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs) by analysing the multi-wavelength afterglow data set of GRB 121024A that\ncovers the full range from radio to X-rays. Methods. Using multi-epoch\nbroad-band observations of the GRB 121024A afterglow, we measured the three\ncharacteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum. We used six\nepochs of combined XRT and GROND data to constrain the temporal slopes, the\ndust extinction, the X-ray absorption, and the spectral slope with high\naccuracy. Two more epochs of combined data from XRT, GROND, APEX, CARMA, and\nEVLA were used to set constraints on the break frequencies and therefore on the\nmicro-physical and dynamical parameters. Results. The XRT and GROND light\ncurves show a simultaneous and achromatic break at around 49 ks. As a result,\nthe crossing of the synchrotron cooling break is no suitable explanation for\nthe break in the light curve. The multi wavelength data allow us to test two\nplausible scenarios explaining the break: a jet break, and the end of energy\ninjection.

Many of them invoke multiple\ngenerations of stars to explain the observed chemical abundance anomalies, but\nit has also been suggested that self-enrichment could occur via accretion of\nejecta from massive stars onto the circumstellar disc of low-mass pre-main\nsequence stars. These scenarios imply different initial conditions for the\nkinematics of the various stellar populations. Given some net angular momentum\ninitially, models for which a second generation forms from gas that collects in\na cooling flow into the core of the cluster predict an initially larger\nrotational amplitude for the polluted stars compared to the pristine stars.\nThis is opposite to what is expected from the accretion model, where the\npolluted stars are the ones crossing the core and are on preferentially radial\n(low-angular momentum) orbits, such that their rotational amplitude is lower.\nHere we present the results of a suite of $N$-body simulations with initial\nconditions chosen to capture the distinct kinematic properties of these\npollution scenarios. We show that initial differences in the kinematics of\npolluted and pristine stars can survive to the present epoch in the outer parts\nof a large fraction of Galactic globular clusters. The differential rotation of\npristine and polluted stars is identified as a unique kinematic signature that\ncould allow us to distinguish between various scenarios, while other kinematic\nimprints are generally very similar from one scenario to the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 20:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

A relation between mound evolution and\nlarge-wavelength fluctuations at CdTe surface has been established. One finds\nthat short-length scales are dictated by an interplay between the effects of\nthe formation of defects at boundaries of neighbouring grains and a relaxation\nprocess which stems from the diffusion and deposition of particles (CdTe\nmolecules) torward these regions. A Kinetic Monte Carlo model corroborates\nthese reasonings. As $T$ is increased, the competition gives rise to different\nscenarios in the roughening scaling such as: uncorrelated growth, a crossover\nfrom random to correlated growth and transient anomalous scaling. In\nparticular, for $T = 250\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, one shows that surface\nfluctuations are described by the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nequation, in the meantime that, the universality of height, local roughness and\nmaximal height distributions for the KPZ class is, finally, experimentally\ndemonstrated. The dynamic of fluctuations at the CdTe surface for other\ntemperatures still is described by the KPZ equation, but with different values\nfor the superficial tension ($\\nu$) and excess of velocity ($\\lambda$). Namely,\nfor $T = 150\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ one finds a Poissonian growth that indicates\n$\\nu = \\lambda = 0$.

Here we extend this construction by including\nmatter fields to build partition functions in both two and three space-time\ndimensions. The matter fields introduces new weights to the vertices and they\ncorrespond to Potts spin configurations described by an $\\mathcal{A}$-module\nwith an inner product. Performing this construction on a triangulated manifold\nwith a boundary we obtain the transfer matrices which are decomposed into a\nproduct of local operators acting on vertices, links and plaquettes. The vertex\nand plaquette operators are similar to the ones appearing in the quantum double\nmodels (QDM) of Kitaev. The link operator couples the gauge and the matter\nfields, and it reduces to the usual interaction terms in known models such as\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter fields. The transfer matrices lead to\nHamiltonians that are frustration-free and are exactly solvable. According to\nthe choice of the initial input, that of the gauge group and a matter module,\nwe obtain interesting models which have a new kind of ground state degeneracy\nthat depends on the number of equivalence classes in the matter module under\ngauge action. Some of the models have confined flux excitations in the bulk\nwhich become deconfined at the surface. These edge modes are protected by an\nenergy gap provided by the link operator.

While for quantum consensus dynamics, the network's von\nNeumann entropy is in contrast non-decreasing. In light of this inconsistency,\nwe compare several gossiping algorithms with random or deterministic\ncoefficients for classical or quantum networks, and show that quantum gossiping\nalgorithms with deterministic coefficients are physically related to classical\ngossiping algorithms with random coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 04:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

The novelty is that\njet formation and maintenance is studied as a dynamics of the statistics of the\nflow rather than a dynamics of individual realizations.

Using this\nstatistical closure, large-scale structure formation is studied in barotropic\nturbulence on a $\\beta$-plane.\n  It is demonstrated that at analytically predicted critical parameter values\nthe homogeneous turbulent state undergoes a bifurcation becoming inhomogeneous\nwith the emergence of large-scale zonal and/or non-zonal flows. The mechanisms\nby which the turbulent Reynolds stresses organize to reinforce infinitesimal\nmean flow inhomogeneities, thus leading to this statistical state instability,\nare studied for various regimes of parameter values.

The spin nematic instability occurs when xi\nreaches a critical value xi_{cr}, i.e., its transition temperature T_{SN} is\nalways higher than the SDW critical temperature T_{SDW}.

Their spectral characteristics along with these\nphotometric changes provide further support for the hypothesis that these are\nstrongly magnetized O stars, analogous to the Of?p stars in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 09:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 09:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

This\nsecular growth of bulges in modern disk galaxies is driven by weak,\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudo-bulges at slow rates\nand with long star-formation timescales. Disk instabilities at high redshift\n(z>1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (10^10 to a few 10^11 Msun of stars)\nare very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. High-redshift\ndisks are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 10^8-10^9\nMsun of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxy\nmorphologies. The clumps and other features associated to the violent\ninstability drive disk evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms,\non short timescales. The giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into the\nbulge in a few 10^8 yr. The instability in the very turbulent media drives\nintense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region. Thick disks and\nsupermassive black holes can grow concurrently as a result of the violent\ninstability.

In Elliott, Golub and\nJackson's model, each institution in the network can buy underlying assets or\npercentage shares in other institutions (cross-holdings) and if any\ninstitution's value drops below a critical threshold value, its value suffers\nan additional failure cost.\n  This work shows that even in simple model put forward by Elliott, Golub and\nJackson there are fundamental barriers to understanding the risks that are\ninherent in a network. First, if institutions are not required to maintain a\nminimum amount of self-holdings, an $\\epsilon$ change in investments by a\nsingle institution can have an arbitrarily magnified influence on the net worth\nof the institutions in the system.

Second, we show that even if a regulator has complete information\nabout all cross-holdings in the system, it may be computationally intractable\nto even estimate the number of failures that could be caused by an arbitrarily\nsmall shock to the system.

We perform detailed imaging and\nspectral analyses and use a simplified model to study the kinematics of this\nsystem. The basic picture is that PLCK G036.7+14.9 is undergoing a major merger\n(mass ratio close to unity) between the two massive subclusters, with the\nmerger largely along the line-of-sight and probably at an early stage. G036N\nhosts a small, moderate cool-core, while G036S has at most a very weak\ncool-core in the central 40 kpc region. The difference in core cooling times is\nunlikely to be caused by the ongoing merger disrupting a pre-existing cool-core\nin G036S. G036N also hosts an unresolved radio source in the center, which may\nbe heating the gas if the radio source is extended. The Planck derived mass is\nhigher than the X-ray measured mass of either subcluster, but is lower than the\nX-ray measured mass of the whole cluster, due to the fact that Planck does not\nresolve PLCK G036.7+14.9 into subclusters and interprets it as a single\ncluster. This mass discrepancy could induce significant bias to the mass\nfunction if such previously unresolved systems are common in the Planck cluster\nsample. High resolution X-ray observations are necessary to identify the\nfraction of such systems and correct such a bias for the purpose of precision\ncosmological studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 11:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Currently, any of the existing theoretical models can\nexplain all aspects of GC-specific spatially selective patterns of activity. It\nis also not clear how these patterns are formed during the network development.\nOn the other hand, it was previously shown that the network that can learn to\nextract high principal components from the activity of the place cells could\nprovide the basis for GC-like activity patterns development. Supporting this\nhypothesis is the finding that PC activity remains spatially stable after the\ndisruption of the GC firing patterns and that grid patterns almost disappear\nwhen hippocampal cells are deactivated. Development of the early PCs before GCs\nformation also supports the role of PCs as the spatial information providers to\nGCs. Here we have developed a new theoretical model of grid fields formation\nbased on synaptic plasticity in synapses connecting PCs in hippocampus and\nneurons in entorhinal cortex. Learning of hexagonally symmetric fields in the\nmodel is due to complex action of several simple biologicaly motivated synaptic\nplasticity rules. These rules include associative synaptic plasticity rules\nsimilar to BCM rule and homeostatic plasticity rules which restrict synaptic\nweigths. In contrast to previously described models, this network could learn\nGC patterns after a very short experience of navigation in a novel environment.\nIn conclusion we suggest that learning on the basis of simple and biologically\nplausible associative synaptic plasticity rules could contribute to the\nformation of grid fields in early development and to maintainence of normal GCs\nactivity patterns in familiar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 11:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

I shall deal only with compact coregular linear\ngroups. The method exposed has been worked out together with prof. G. Sartori\nand it is based on the solution of a matrix differential equation. Such\nequation is easily solved if an integrity basis of the group is known. If the\nintegrity basis is unknown one may determine anyway for which degrees of the\nbasic invariants there are solutions to the equation, and in all these cases\nalso find out the explicit form of the solutions. The solutions determine\ncompletely the stratification of the orbit spaces. Such calculations have been\ncarried out for 2, 3 and 4-dimensonal orbit spaces. The method is of general\nvalidity but the complexity of the calculations rises tremendously with the\ndimension $q$ of the orbit space. Some induction rules have been found as well.\nThey allow to determine easily most of the solutions for the\n$(q+1)$-dimensional case once the solutions for the $q$-dimensional case are\nknown. The method exposed is interesting because it allows to determine the\norbit spaces without using any specific knowledge of group structure and\nintegrity basis and evidences a certain hidden and yet unknown link with group\ntheory and invariant theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 13:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

It has been asserted in the past that the presence of\nthese super-voters undermines the democratic process, and therefore delegative\ndemocracy should be avoided. In this paper, we look at the emergence of\nsuper-voters in the largest delegative online democracy platform worldwide,\noperated by Germany's Pirate Party.

While we\nfind that the theoretical power of super-voters is indeed high, we also observe\nthat they use their power wisely. Super-voters do not fully act on their power\nto change the outcome of votes, but they vote in favour of proposals with the\nmajority of voters in many cases thereby exhibiting a stabilising effect on the\nsystem.

Long timescale Langevin\ntrajectories were calculated using the path integral hyperdynamics method to\nevaluate the escape rate. A minimum is found in the rate for self-avoiding\npolymers of intermediate length while the escape rate decreases monotonically\nwith polymer length for ideal polymers. The increase in the rate for long,\nself-avoiding polymers is ascribed to crowding in the potential well which\nreduces the free energy escape barrier. An effective potential curve obtained\nusing the centroid as an independent variable was evaluated by thermodynamic\naveraging and Kramers rate theory then applied to estimate the escape rate.\nWhile the qualitative features are well reproduced by this approach, it\nsignificantly overestimates the rate, especially for the longer polymers. The\nreason for this is illustrated by constructing a two-dimensional effective\nenergy surface using the radius of gyration as well as the centroid as\ncontrolled variables. This shows that the description of a transition state\ndividing surface using only the centroid fails to confine the system to the\nregion corresponding to the free energy barrier and this problem becomes more\npronounced the longer the polymer is. A proper definition of a transition state\nfor polymer escape needs to take into account the shape as well as the location\nof the polymer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 13:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

We completed observations with the\nAustralian Long Baseline Array (LBA) to resolve the system at mas angular\nresolutions and reduced archival Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) data\nto derive the total radio emission. We also compiled optical astrometric data\nof the system in a homogeneous way. We reduced historical Hubble Space\nTelescope data and obtained absolute and relative astrometry with milliarcsec\naccuracy. The astrometric analysis leads us to conclude that the two stars in\nHD 93129A form a gravitationally bound system. The LBA data reveal an extended\narc-shaped non-thermal source between the two stars, indicative of a WCR. The\nwind momentum-rate ratio of the two stellar winds is estimated.

The aim of our present investigation is to obtain and analyze a set\nof evolutionary models of cool, close detached binaries with a low metal\nabundance, which are characteristic of GC. We computed the evolution of 975\nmodels of initially detached, cool close binaries with different initial\nparameters. The models include mass exchange between components as well as mass\nand angular momentum loss due to the magnetized winds for very low-metallicity\nbinaries with Z = 0.001. The models are interpreted in the context of existing\ndata on contact binary and blue straggler members of GCs. The model parameters\nagree well with the observed positions of the GC contact binaries in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Contact binaries in the lower part of the cluster\nmain sequence are absent because there are no binaries with initial orbital\nperiods shorter than 1.5 d. Contact binaries end their evolution as mergers\nthat appear in the BS region. Binary-formed BSs populate the whole observed BS\nregion in a GC, but a gap is visible between low-mass mergers that are\nconcentrated along the zero-age main sequence and binary BSs occupying the red\npart of the BS region. Very few binary mergers are expected to rotate rapidly\nand/or possess chemical peculiarities resulting from the exposure of the layers\nprocessed by CNO nuclear reactions.

This addresses the question if the general inflationary\nparadigm is sufficient to predict within a given model the spectrum and\namplitude of cosmic fluctuations, or if additional particular assumptions about\nthe initial conditions are needed. The answer depends on the number of\ne-foldings $N_{in}$ between the beginning of inflation and horizon crossing of\nthe observable fluctuations. We discuss an interacting inflaton field in an\narbitrary homogeneous and isotropic geometry, employing the quantum effective\naction $\\Gamma$. An exact time evolution equation for the correlation function\ninvolves the second functional derivative $\\Gamma^{(2)}$. The operator\nformalism and quantum vacua for interacting fields are not needed. Use of the\neffective action also allows one to address the change of frames by field\ntransformations (field relativity). Within the approximation of a derivative\nexpansion for the effective action we find the most general solution for the\ncorrelation function, including mixed quantum states. For not too large\n$N_{in}$ the memory of the initial conditions is preserved. In this case the\ncosmic microwave background cannot disentangle between the initial spectrum and\nits processing at horizon crossing. The inflaton potential cannot be\nreconstructed without assumptions about the initial state of the universe. We\nargue that for very large $N_{in}$ a universal scaling form of the correlation\nfunction is reached for the range of observable modes. This can be due to\nsymmetrization and equilibration effects, not yet contained in our\napproximation, which drive the short distance tail of the correlation function\ntowards the Lorentz invariant propagator in flat space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 15:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 16:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

For understanding this phenomenon, some\naging changes are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in\nMisrepair-accumulation theory. I. Misrepair is a strategy of repair for\nsurvival of an organism in situations of severe injuries; however a Misrepair\nalters the structure of a tissue, a cell or a molecule, which are the\nsub-structures of an organism. II. Misrepair of a sub-structure also alters the\nspatial relationship of this sub-structure with its neighbor sub-structures.\nThus a Misrepair leads to increased damage-sensitivity and reduced\nrepair-efficiency of these sub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a\ntendency to occur to the sub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an\nold Misrepair has taken place. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again\nthe damage-sensitivity of these sub-structures and the surrounding\nsub-structures. By such a vicious circle, the frequency of Misrepairs to these\nsub-structures is increased and the range of affected sub-structures is\nenlarged after each time of Misrepair. Thus, accumulation of Misrepairs is\nfocalized and self-accelerating. III. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs\nleads to formation and growing of a \"spot\" or \"plaque\" in a tissue. Growing of\na spot is self-accelerating, and old spots grow faster than new ones. New spots\ntend to develop close to old ones, resulting in an inhomogeneous distribution\nof spots. In conclusion, the inhomogeneous development of aging changes is a\nresult of self-accelerated and focalized accumulation of Misrepairs; and the\nprocess of aging is self-accelerating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 13:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 10:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

In biosensors, a key factor\ndetermining the sensitivity and thus the performance of the device is the\norientation of the ligand molecules on the bioactive device surface. Adsorption\nstudies thus seek to determine how orientation can be influenced by surface\npreparation. In this work, protein orientation near charged nanosurfaces is\nobtained under electrostatic effects using the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in\nan implicit-solvent model. Sampling the free energy for protein GB1D4' at a\nrange of tilt and rotation angles with respect to the charged surface, we\ncalculated the probability of the protein orientations and observed a dipolar\nbehavior. This result is consistent with published experimental studies and\ncombined Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations using this small\nprotein, validating our method. More relevant to biosensor technology,\nantibodies such as immunoglobulin G are still a formidable challenge to\nmolecular simulation, due to their large size. We obtained the probability\ndistribution of orientations for the iso-type IgG2a at varying surface charge\nand salt concentration. This iso-type was not found to have a preferred\norientation in previous studies, unlike the iso-type IgG1 whose larger dipole\nmoment was assumed to make it easier to control. We find that the preferred\norientation of IgG2a can be favorable for biosensing with positive surface\ncharge of 0.05C/m$^{2}$ or higher and 37mM salt concentration. The results also\nshow that local interactions dominate over dipole moment for this protein.\nImproving immunoassay sensitivity may thus be assisted by numerical studies\nusing our method (and open-source code), guiding changes to fabrication\nprotocols or protein engineering of ligand molecules to obtain more favorable\norientations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 21:19:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 12:47:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 20:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 13:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

A model that can\nexpress all the failure characteristics of the whole RAID storage system can be\nused to evaluate design choices, perform cost reliability trade-offs and\nconduct sensitivity analyses. However, including such details makes the\ncomputational models of reliability quickly infeasible.\n  We present a CTMC reliability model for RAID storage systems that scales to\nmuch larger systems than heretofore reported and we try to model all the\ncomponents as accurately as possible. We use several state-space reduction\ntechniques at the user level, such as aggregating all in-series components and\nhierarchical decomposition, to reduce the size of our model. To automate\ncomputation of reliability, we use the PRISM model checker as a CTMC solver\nwhere appropriate. Our modelling techniques using PRISM are more practical (in\nboth time and effort) compared to previously reported Monte-Carlo simulation\ntechniques.\n  Our model for RAID storage systems (that includes, for example, disks,\nexpanders, enclosures) uses Weibull distributions for disks and, where\nappropriate, correlated failure modes for disks, while we use exponential\ndistributions with independent failure modes for all other components. To use\nthe CTMC solver, we approximate the Weibull distribution for a disk using sum\nof exponentials and we confirm that this model gives results that are in\nreasonably good agreement with those from the sequential Monte Carlo simulation\nmethods for RAID disk subsystems reported in literature earlier. Using a\ncombination of scalable techniques, we are able to model and compute\nreliability for fairly large configurations with upto 600 disks using this\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 10:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}
