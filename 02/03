Quantum tomography, the standard tool used for this purpose, uses a\nwell-designed measurement record to reconstruct quantum states and processes.\nIt is, however, notoriously inefficient. Recently, the classical signal\nreconstruction technique known as \"compressed sensing\" has been ported to\nquantum information science to overcome this challenge: accurate tomography can\nbe achieved with substantially fewer measurement settings, thereby greatly\nenhancing the efficiency of quantum tomography. Here we show that compressed\nsensing tomography of quantum systems is essentially guaranteed by a special\nproperty of quantum mechanics itself---that the mathematical objects that\ndescribe the system in quantum mechanics are matrices with nonnegative\neigenvalues. This result has an impact on the way quantum tomography is\nunderstood and implemented. In particular, it implies that the information\nobtained about a quantum system through compressed sensing methods exhibits a\nnew sense of \"informational completeness.\" This has important consequences on\nthe efficiency of data taking for quantum tomography, and enables us to\nconstruct informationally complete measurements that are robust to noise and\nmodeling errors. Moreover, our result shows that one can expand the numerical\ntool-box used in quantum tomography and employ highly efficient algorithms\ndeveloped to handle large dimensional matrices on a large dimensional Hilbert\nspace. While we mainly present our results in the context of quantum\ntomography, they apply to the general case of positive semidefinite matrix\nrecovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 16:27:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 16:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 17:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

A BRST invariant action accounting\nfor those quartic interaction terms is identified and proven to be\nmultiplicative renormalizable to all orders by means of the algebraic\nrenormalization procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 17:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

One such phenomenon is\nco-non-solvency. Co-non-solvency occurs when two (perfectly) miscible and\ncompeting good solvents, for a given polymer, are mixed together. As a result,\nthe same polymer collapses into a compact globule within intermediate mixing\nratios. More interestingly, polymer collapses when the solvent quality remains\ngood and even gets increasingly better by the addition of the better cosolvent.\nThis is a puzzling phenomenon that is driven by strong local concentration\nfluctuations. Because of the discrete particle based nature of the\ninteractions, Flory-Huggins type mean field arguments become unsuitable. In\nthis work, we extend the analysis of the co-non-solvency effect presented\nearlier [Nature Communications 5, 4882 (2014)]. We explain why co-non-solvency\nis a generic phenomenon that can be understood by the thermodynamic treatment\nof the competitive displacement of (co)solvent components. This competition can\nresult in a polymer collapse upon improvement of the solvent quality. Specific\nchemical details are not required to understand these complex conformational\ntransitions.

They compute analytic expressions for the nonlinear matter\npower spectrum, to first order in the interaction, and at one-loop order in the\nlinear power spectrum. The resulting power spectrum is well behaved even at\nlarge wavenumbers and seems in good agreement with results from numerical\nsimulations. In this paper, we rederive their results concisely with a\ndifferent approach, starting from the implicit integral solution to particle\ntrajectories. We derive the matter power spectrum to first order in the\ninteraction, but to arbitrary order in the linear power spectrum, from which\nthe one-loop result follows. We also show that standard linear perturbation\ntheory can only be recovered at infinite order in the gravitational\ninteraction. At finite order in the interaction, we find that the linear power\nspectrum is systematically and significantly underestimated. A comprehensive\nstudy of the convergence of the theory with the order of the interaction for\nnonlinear scales will be the subject of future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 19:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 15:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Probabilistic models can\nlearn users' tastes from the history of their item adoptions and recommend new\nitems to users. However, current models ignore cognitive biases that are known\nto affect behavior. Specifically, people pay more attention to items at the top\nof a list than those in lower positions. As a consequence, items near the top\nof a user's social media stream have higher visibility, and are more likely to\nbe seen and adopted, than those appearing below. Another bias is due to the\nitem's fitness: some items have a high propensity to spread upon exposure\nregardless of the interests of adopting users. We propose a probabilistic model\nthat incorporates human cognitive biases and personal relevance in the\ngenerative model of information spread.

Here, we use photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy\nto study the formation of the so- called trions in a synthesized freestanding\ntrilayer MoS2. A trion is a charged quasi-particle formed by adding one\nelectron or hole to a neutral exciton (a bound electron-hole pair). We\ndemonstrate accurate control over the transformation of excitons to trions by\ntuning the power of the optical pump (laser). Increasing the power of the\nexcitation laser beyond a certain threshold (~ 4 mW) allows modulation of\ntrion-to-exciton PL intensity ratio as well as the spectral linewidth of both\ntrions and excitons. Via a systematic and complementary Raman analysis we\ndisclose a strong coupling between laser induced exciton-to-trion\ntransformation and the characteristic phononic vibrations of MoS2. The onset of\nsuch an optical transformation corresponds to the onset of a previously unknown\nnonlinear Raman shift of the in-plane (E12g) and out-of-plane (A1g) vibrational\nmodes. This coupling directly affects the well-known linear red-shift of the\nA1g and E12g vibrations due to heating at low laser powers, and changes it to a\nnonlinear and non-monotonic dependence with a blue-shift in the high laser\npower regime. Local reduction of the electron density upon exciton-to-trion\ntransformation is found to be the underlying mechanism for the blue-shift at\nhigh laser powers.

The Keck Array was first deployed in late 2010 and will\nobserve through 2016 with five receivers at several frequencies (95, 150, and\n220 GHz). BICEP2 and the Keck Array share a common optical design and employ\nthe field-proven BICEP1 strategy of using small-aperture, cold, on-axis\nrefractive optics, providing excellent control of systematics while maintaining\na large field of view.

In contrast with the conventional approach where the mirror-field\nentanglement is understood as arising from the radiation pressure of an optical\nfield inducing the motion of the mirror's CoM, the MOF model incorporates the\ndynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror that couple to the\noptical field directly. The major advantage in this approach is that it\nprovides a self-consistent treatment of the three pertinent subsystems (the\nmirror's CoM motion, its internal degrees of freedom and the field) including\ntheir back-actions on each other, thereby giving a more accurate account of the\nquantum correlations between the individual subsystems. The optical and the\nmechanical properties of a mirror arising from its dynamical interaction with a\nquantum field are obtained without imposing any boundary conditions on the\nfield additionally, as is done in the conventional way. As one of the new\nphysical features that arise from this self-consistent treatment of the coupled\noptics and mechanics behavior we observe a coherent transfer of quantum\ncorrelations from the field to the mirror via its internal degrees of freedom.\nWe find the quantum entanglement between the optical field and the mirror's\ncenter of mass motion upon coarse-graining over the internal degree of freedom.\nFurther, we show that in certain parameter regimes the mirror-field\nentanglement is enhanced when the field interacts resonantly with the mirror's\ninternal degree of freedom, a new result which highlights the importance of\nincluding the internal structure of the mirror in quantum optomechanical\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 20:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

In the presence\nof a positive or negative exponential potential, the WKB condition is satisfied\nin proportion to a factor $e^{-(\\epsilon - 3)N/(\\epsilon -1)},$ where\n$\\epsilon$ is the (constant) slow-roll/fast-roll parameter and $N$ designates\nthe number of e-folds. Thus classicality is reached exponentially fast in $N$,\nbut only when $\\epsilon < 1$ (inflation) or $\\epsilon > 3$ (ekpyrosis).\nFurthermore, when the potential switches off and the ekpyrotic phase goes over\ninto a phase of kinetic domination, the level of classicality obtained up to\nthat point is preserved. Similar results are obtained in a cyclic potential,\nwhere a dark energy plateau is added. Finally, for a potential of the form\n$-\\phi^n$ (with $n=4,6,8$), where the classical solution becomes increasingly\nkinetic-dominated, there is an initial burst of classicalisation which then\nquickly levels off. These results demonstrate that inflation and ekpyrosis,\nwhich are the only dynamical mechanisms known for smoothing the universe, share\nthe perhaps even more fundamental property of rendering space and time\nclassical in the first place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 21:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 07:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

We analysed spectra of different parts of the\nremnant to observe if the plasma properties provide hints on the origin of the\nmixed-morphology class. These remnants often show overionization, which is a\nsign of rapid cooling of the thermal plasma, and super-solar abundances of\nelements which is a sign of ejecta emission. Our analysis shows that the\nthermal emission of 3C400.2 can be well explained by a two component\nnon-equilibrium ionization model, of which one component is underionized, has a\nhigh temperature ($kT \\approx 3.9$ keV) and super-solar abundances, while the\nother component has a much lower temperature ($kT \\approx 0.14$ keV), solar\nabundances and shows signs of overionization. The temperature structure,\nabundance values and density contrast between the different model components\nsuggest that the hot component comes from ejecta plasma, while the cooler\ncomponent has an interstellar matter origin. This seems to be the first\ninstance of an overionized plasma found in the outer regions of a supernova\nremnant, whereas the ejecta component of the inner region is underionized. In\naddition, the non-ionization equilibrium plasma component associated with the\nejecta is confined to the central, brighter parts of the remnant, whereas the\ncooler component is present mostly in the outer regions. Therefore our data can\nmost naturally be explained by an evolutionary scenario in which the outer\nparts of the remnant are cooling rapidly due to having swept up high density\nISM, while the inner parts are very hot and cooling inefficiently due to low\ndensity of the plasma. This is also known as the relic X-ray scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 21:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

We situate our analysis using\nBourdieu's theory of cultural reproduction and then focus on the peculiarities\nof the 2008 RAE and the 2014 REF the rules of which allowed for, and indeed\nencouraged, significant game-playing on the part of striving universities. We\nconclude with practical recommendations to maintain the general intention of\nresearch assessment without the undesirable side-effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 21:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

The\nmain object of interest is the class s-sparse vectors for which we also provide\ncompletely adaptive estimators (independent of s and of the noise variance)\nhaving only logarithmically slower rates than the minimax ones. Furthermore, we\nobtain the minimax rates on the Lq-balls where 0 < q < 2. This analysis shows\nthat there are, in general, three zones in the rates of convergence that we\ncall the sparse zone, the dense zone and the degenerate zone, while a fourth\nzone appears for estimation of the quadratic functional. We show that, as\nopposed to estimation of the vector, the correct logarithmic terms in the\noptimal rates for the sparse zone scale as log(d/s^2) and not as log(d/s). For\nthe sparse class, the rates of estimation of the linear functional and of the\nL2-norm have a simple elbow at s = sqrt(d) (boundary between the sparse and the\ndense zones) and exhibit similar performances, whereas the estimation of the\nquadratic functional reveals more complex effects and is not possible only on\nthe basis of sparsity described by the sparsity condition on the vector.\nFinally, we apply our results on estimation of the L2-norm to the problem of\ntesting against sparse alternatives. In particular, we obtain a non-asymptotic\nanalog of the Ingster-Donoho-Jin theory revealing some effects that were not\ncaptured by the previous asymptotic analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 22:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

It is primarily sensitive\nto the position of electrons and their momentum distribution. Elastic X-ray\nscattering forms the basis of atomic structural determination while inelastic\nCompton scattering is often used as a spectroscopic probe of both\nsingle-particle excitations and collective modes. X-ray free-electron lasers\n(XFELs) are unique tools for studying matter on its natural time and length\nscales due to their bright and coherent ultrashort pulses. However, in the\nfocus of an XFEL the assumption of a weak linear probe breaks down, and\nnonlinear light-matter interactions can become ubiquitous. The field can be\nsufficiently high that even non-resonant multiphoton interactions at hard\nX-rays wavelengths become relevant. Here we report the observation of one of\nthe most fundamental nonlinear X-ray-matter interactions, the simultaneous\nCompton scattering of two identical photons producing a single photon at nearly\ntwice the photon energy. We measure scattered photons with an energy near 18\nkeV generated from solid beryllium irradiated by 8.8-9.75 keV XFEL pulses. The\nintensity in the X-ray focus reaches up to 4x20 W/cm2, which corresponds to a\npeak electric field two orders of magnitude higher than the atomic unit of\nfield-strength and within four orders of magnitude of the quantum\nelectrodynamic critical field. The observed signal scales quadratically in\nintensity and is emitted into a non-dipolar pattern, consistent with the\nsimultaneous two-photon scattering from free electrons. However, the energy of\nthe generated photons shows an anomalously large redshift only present at high\nintensities.

Unfortunately, the determination of precise stellar ages is a very\ndifficult task. Different methods can be used to do so (based on isochrones or\nchemical element abundances) but they usually provide large uncertainties.\nDuring its evolution a star goes through processes leading to loss of angular\nmomentum but also changes in its magnetic activity. Building rotation,\nmagnetic, age relations would be an asset to infer stellar ages model\nindependently. Several attempts to build empirical relations between rotation\nand age (namely gyrochronology) were made with a focus on cluster stars where\nthe age determination is easier and for young stars on the main sequence. For\nfield stars, we can now take advantage of high-precision photometric\nobservations where we can perform asteroseismic analyses to improve the\naccuracy of stellar ages. Furthermore, the variability in the light curves\nallow us to put strong constraints on the stellar rotation and magnetic\nactivity. By combining these precise measurements, we are on the way of\nunderstanding and improving relations between magnetic activity, rotation, and\nage, in particular at different stages of stellar evolution. I will review the\nstatus on gyrochronology relationships based on observations of young cluster\nstars. Then I will focus on solar-like stars and describe the inferences on\nstellar ages, rotation, and magnetism that can be provided by high-quality\nphotometric observations such as the ones of the Kepler mission, in particular\nthrough asteroseismic analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 02:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Here, we report on a new family of\nlead-based pyrochlores A$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ (A = Pr, Nd, Gd), which we have\ncharacterized with magnetic susceptibility and specific heat.

Thus, Pr$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ is\na candidate for a quantum spin ice state, despite weaker exchange.\nNd$_2$Pb$_2$O$_7$ transitions to a magnetically ordered state at 0.41 K.

One of the key reasons for this success is the \"self-gating\" pulse\neffect, whereby the x-ray laser pulses do not need to outrun all radiation\ndamage processes. Instead, x-ray induced damage terminates the Bragg\ndiffraction prior to the pulse completing its passage through the sample, as if\nthe Bragg diffraction was generated by a shorter pulse of equal intensity. As a\nresult, serial femtosecond crystallography does not need to be performed with\npulses as short as 5--10 fs, as once thought, but can succeed for pulses\n50--100 fs in duration. We show here that a similar gating effect applies to\nsingle molecule diffraction with respect to spatially uncorrelated damage\nprocesses like ionization and ion diffusion. The effect is clearly seen in\ncalculations of the diffraction contrast, by calculating the diffraction of\naverage structure separately to the diffraction from statistical fluctuations\nof the structure due to damage (\"damage noise\").

However, its underlying kinetic\nmechanism is unclear. The Gompertz law cannot explain the effect of temperature\non lifespan and the mortality plateau at advanced ages. In this study a\nreaction kinetics model with a time dependent rate coefficient is proposed to\ndescribe the survival and senescence processes. A temperature-dependent\nmortality function was derived. The new mortality function becomes the Gompertz\nmortality function with the same relationship of parameters prescribed by the\nStrehler-Mildvan correlation when age is smaller than a characteristic value\n{\\delta}, and reaches the mortality plateau when age is greater than {\\delta}.\nA closed-form analytical expression for describing the relationship of average\nlifespan with temperature and other equations are derived from the new\nmortality function. The derived equations can be used to estimate the limit of\naverage lifespan, predict the maximal longevity, calculate the temperature\ncoefficient of lifespan, and explain the tendency of survival curve. This\nprediction is consistent with the most recently reported mortality trajectories\nfor single-year birth cohorts. This study suggests that the senescence process\nresults from the imbalance between damaging energy and protecting energy for\nthe critical chemical substance in the body. The rate of senescence of the\norganism increases while the protecting energy decreases. The mortality plateau\nis reached when the protecting energy decreases to its minimal levels. The\ndecreasing rate of the protecting energy is temperature-dependent.

These chronic problems\noften fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe\nimpacts (e.g. system failure). Therefore it's a challenging issue how to timely\ndetect these problems to prevent system crash. Although a large quantity of\napproaches have been proposed to solve this issue, the accuracy and\neffectiveness of these approaches are still far from satisfactory due to the\ninsufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. In this paper, we present a\nnovel entropy-based aging indicator, Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy\n(MMSE). MMSE employs the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to\nindicate software aging and leverages multi-scale and multi-dimension\nintegration to tolerate system fluctuations. Via theoretical proof and\nexperimental evaluation, we demonstrate that MMSE satisfies Stability,\nMonotonicity and Integration which we conjecture that an ideal aging indicator\nshould have. Based upon MMSE, we develop three failure detection approaches\nencapsulated in a proof-of-concept named CHAOS. The experimental evaluations in\na Video on Demand (VoD) system and in a real-world production system,\nAntVision, show that CHAOS can detect the failure-prone state in an\nextraordinarily high accuracy and a near 0 Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF).\nCompared to previous approaches, CHAOS improves the detection accuracy by about\n5 times and reduces the ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude.

In order to unravel some key properties\nenabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own\nexistence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe\nthem in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by\ndifferent structural properties. From the point of view of network topology, an\nautocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected\ncomponents (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets\n(RAFs). We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the\nprobability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region\nwhere the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter\nalso affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized\ninto linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs. Interestingly, we show that the\ndifferent network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems)\ndoes not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance,\nwhereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to\nplay a role. A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and\nthat may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be\nthe presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or\ncatalyst of any reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 09:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

It is well-known that dynamics of\natmospheric CO2 is governed by multiple time-constants, and here we approximate\nthe solutions to a linear model of atmospheric CO2 dynamics with four\ntime-constants to identify factors governing the time-delay between peaks in\nCO2 emissions and concentrations, and therefore the timing of the concentration\npeak. The main factor affecting this time-delay is the ratio of the rate of\nchange of emissions during its increasing and decreasing phases. If this ratio\nis large in magnitude then the time-delay between peak emissions and\nconcentrations is large. Therefore it is important to limit the magnitude of\nthis ratio through mitigation, in order to achieve an early peak in CO2\nconcentrations. This can be achieved with an early global emissions peak,\ncombined with rapid decarbonization of economic activity, because the delay\nbetween peak emissions and concentrations is affected by the time-scale with\nwhich decarbonization occurs. Of course, for limiting the magnitude of peak\nconcentrations it is also important to limit the magnitude of emissions\nthroughout its trajectory, but that aspect has been studied elsewhere and is\nnot examined here. The carbon cycle parameters affecting the timing of the\nconcentration peak are primarily the long multi-century time-constant of\natmospheric CO2, and the ratio of contributions to the impulse response\nfunction of atmospheric CO2 from the infinite time-constant and the long\ntime-constant respectively.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

On the one hand, we consider quenches: sudden decreases of\nthe Reynolds number R which force the formation of holes. The Reynolds number\nis decreased from featureless turbulence to the range of existence of the\noblique laminar-turbulent bands [Rg;Rt]. The successive stages of the quench\nare studied by means of visualisations and measurements of kinetic energy and\nturbulent fraction. The behaviour of the kinetic energy is explained using a\nkinetic energy budget: it shows that viscosity causes quasi modal decay until\nlift-up equals it and creates a new balance. Moreover, the budget confirms that\nthe physical mechanisms at play are independent of the way the quench is\nperformed. On the other hand we consider the natural formation of laminar holes\nin the bands, near Rg. The Direct Numerical simulations (DNS) show that holes\nin the turbulent bands provide a mechanism for the fragmented bands regime and\norientation fluctuations near Rg. Moreover the analysis of the fluctuations of\nkinetic energy toward low values demonstrates that the disappearance of\nturbulence in the bands can be described within the framework of Large\nDeviations.

Physicists usually apply the concepts and methods\nin statistical physics, such as temporal correlation functions, to study\nfinancial dynamics. However, the usual volatility-return correlation function,\nwhich is local in time, typically fluctuates around zero. Here we construct\ndynamic observables nonlocal in time to explore the volatility-return\ncorrelation, based on the empirical data of hundreds of individual stocks and\n25 stock market indices in different countries. Strikingly, the correlation is\ndiscovered to be non-zero, with an amplitude of a few percent and a duration of\nover two weeks.

The predictions of this first model have outperformed\nthat of other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks on large\nscale data. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we\ninterpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret\nword meaning.\n  In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum\nmechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's\nCPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity\nand distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and\npolysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means\na passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change\nof model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily\nadopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data.\nThis experiment moreover provides preliminary evidence of the validity of our\nproposed new model for word meaning.\n  Secondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative\ncounterparts that arise in the image of the CPM-construction allow for encoding\nrelative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, and finally, iteration of the\nCPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm,\nenables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 12:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 19:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}

As a generative model, it requires the dictionary\nto be highly redundant in order to ensure both a stable high sparsity level and\na low reconstruction error for the signal. However, in practice, this\nrequirement is usually impaired by the lack of labelled training samples.\nFortunately, previous research has shown that the requirement for a redundant\ndictionary can be less rigorous if simultaneous sparse approximation is\nemployed, which can be carried out by enforcing various structured sparsity\nconstraints on the sparse codes of the neighboring pixels. In addition,\nnumerous works have shown that applying a variety of dictionary learning\nmethods for the sparse representation model can also improve the classification\nperformance. In this paper, we highlight the task-driven dictionary learning\nalgorithm, which is a general framework for the supervised dictionary learning\nmethod. We propose to enforce structured sparsity priors on the task-driven\ndictionary learning method in order to improve the performance of the\nhyperspectral classification.

Under such a setup, it is shown that in the $N=1$ case, all the\n$U(1)'$ charges of left-handed quark doublets and right-handed up- and\ndown-type quarks are required to be the same, while in the $N \\ge 3$ case one\ncan take different charges for the three types of quarks.

The cross\nsection is calculated using a microscopic multichannel theory for the Feshbach\nresonance scattering, including finite range and medium effects. We show that\npair correlations significantly increase the cross section for strong\ninteractions close to the unitarity regime. These pair correlations give rise\nto a molecule pole of the cross section at negative energy on the BEC side of\nthe resonance, which smoothly evolves into a resonance at positive scattering\nenergy with a non-zero imaginary part on the BCS side. The resonance is the\nanalogue of superfluid pairing for the corresponding population balanced\nsystem. Using Fermi liquid theory, we then show that the low temperature\nscattering rate of the impurity atom is significantly increased due to these\npair correlations for low momenta. We demonstrate that finite range and mass\nimbalance effects are significant for the experimentally relevant\n$^6$Li-$^{40}$K mixture, and we finally discuss how the scattering rate can be\nmeasured using radio-frequency spectroscopy and Bose-Fermi mixtures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 15:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

The wave theory of light is so deeply rooted that it has\nbeen--and currently is--applied to describe phenomena in which the fundamental\nentities at work are discrete (photons). The fact that the wave theory of light\ncan describe one aspect of these phenomena can not overshadow two issues: the\ncorpuscular theory of light, firstly applied to the Doppler effect for photons\nby Schr\\\"odinger in 1922, is by far more complete since it describes all the\nfeatures of the studied phenomena; the wave theory can be used only when the\nnumber of photons at work is statistically significant. The disregard of basic\nmethodological criteria may appear as a minor fault. However, the historical\ndevelopment of quantum physics shows that the predominance of the wave theory\nof radiation, beyond its natural application domain, has hampered the\nreorientation toward the photon description of the underlying phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 16:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

In that paper, the flying atom was conceived as a flying clock:\nthe reference to the Doppler effect was only indirect (the experiments by Stark\nto the first order of $v/c$). In 1922, Schr\\\"odinger showed that the emission\nof a light quantum by a (flying) atom is regulated by the conservation laws of\nenergy and linear momentum. Therefore, the Doppler effect for photons is the\nconsequence of the energy and momentum exchange between the atom and the\nphoton: a central role is played by the quantum energy jump $\\Delta E$ of the\ntransition (a relativistic invariant). The first realization of the experiment\ndevised by Einstein is due to Ives and Stilwell (1938). Since then till\nnowadays experiments of this kind have been repeated in search of better\nprecision and/or a deviation from the predictions of special relativity.

While\ntraditional parametric models are able to learn high-dimensional systems from\nsmall data sets, their rigid parametric structure makes them vulnerable to\nmodel error. On the other hand, nonparametric models have a very flexible\nstructure, but they suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality and are not\npractical for high-dimensional systems. The semiparametric approach loosens the\nstructure of a parametric model by fitting a data-driven nonparametric model\nfor the parameters. Given a parametric dynamical model and a noisy data set of\nhistorical observations, an adaptive Kalman filter is used to extract a\ntime-series of the parameter values. A nonparametric forecasting model for the\nparameters is built by projecting the discrete shift map onto a data-driven\nbasis of smooth functions. Existing techniques for filtering and forecasting\nalgorithms extend naturally to the semiparametric model which can effectively\ncompensate for model error, with forecasting skill approaching that of the\nperfect model. Semiparametric forecasting and filtering are a generalization of\nstatistical semiparametric models to time-dependent distributions evolving\nunder dynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 01:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}
