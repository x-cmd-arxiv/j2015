Nonlinear feedback laws can be\ncomputed via the value function characterized as the unique viscosity solution\nto the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation which stems from\nthe dynamic programming approach. However, the bottleneck is mainly due to the\ncurse of dimensionality and HJB equations are only solvable in a relatively\nsmall dimension. Therefore, a reduced-order model is derived for the dynamical\nsystem and for this purpose the method of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)\nis used. The resulting errors in the HJB equations are estimated by an a-priori\nerror analysis, which suggests a new sampling strategy for the POD method.\nNumerical experiments illustrates the theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2015 16:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

In these relations, quantum\nuncertainty takes the form of preparation uncertainty where one of two\nincompatible measurements is applied. In particular, the \"uncertainty witness\"\nlower bound in the EUR-QSI is not a function of a post-measurement state. An\ninsightful proof of the EUR-QSI from [Coles et al., Phys. Rev.

Here, we exploit this perspective to establish\na tightening of the EUR-QSI which adds a new state-dependent term in the lower\nbound, related to how well one can reverse the action of a quantum measurement.\nAs such, this new term is a direct function of the post-measurement state and\ncan be thought of as quantifying how much disturbance a given measurement\ncauses.

The invariant Lagrangian is expressed in terms of new\nhigher-rank field strength tensors. It does not contain higher derivatives of\ntensor gauge fields and all interactions take place through three- and\nfour-particle exchanges with a dimensionless coupling constant. We calculated\nthe scattering amplitudes of non-Abelian tensor gauge bosons at tree level, as\nwell as their one-loop contribution into the Callan-Symanzik beta function.\nThis contribution is negative and corresponds to the asymptotically free\ntheory. Considering the contribution of tensorgluons of all spins into the beta\nfunction we found that it is leading to the theory which is conformally\ninvariant at very high energies. The proposed extension may lead to a natural\ninclusion of the standard theory of fundamental forces into a larger theory in\nwhich vector gauge bosons, leptons and quarks represent a low-spin subgroup. We\nconsider a possibility that inside the proton and, more generally, inside\nhadrons there are additional partons - tensorgluons, which can carry a part of\nthe proton momentum.

In such cases when an external shock induces a\nchange to the stochastic structure of panel data, it is unclear whether the\nchange would be reflected in the mean, the covariance structure, or both. In\nthis paper, we develop a test for structural stability of linear panel data\nmodels that is based on monitoring for changes in the largest eigenvalue of the\nsample covariance matrix. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed test\nstatistic is established under the null hypothesis that the mean and covariance\nstructure of the panel data's cross sectional units remain stable during the\nobservation period. We show that the test is consistent assuming common breaks\nin the mean or factor loadings. These results are investigated by means of a\nMonte Carlo simulation study, and their usefulness is demonstrated with an\napplication to U.S. treasury yield curve data, in which some interesting\nfeatures of the 2007-2008 subprime crisis are illuminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2015 18:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

We report the\nresults from three\\hbox{-}dimensional, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of a rotating self-gravitating primordial gas cloud with a modified\nversion of the Gadget-2 code, in which the initial ratio of the rotational to\nthe gravitational energy ($\\beta_0$) is varied over two orders of magnitude. We\nfind that despite the lack of any initial turbulence and magnetic fields in the\nclouds, the angular momentum distribution leads to the formation and build-up\nof a disk that fragments into several clumps. We further examine the behavior\nof the protostars that form in both idealized as well as more realistic\nminihalos from the cosmological simulations. The thermodynamical evolution and\nthe fragmentation behavior of the cosmological minihalos are similar to that of\nthe artificial cases, especially in those with a similar $\\beta_0$-parameter.\nProtostars with a higher rotation support exhibit spiral-arm-like structures on\nseveral scales, and have lower accretion rates.

There was particular interest in determining\nthe rationality of a given algebraic $k$-tori. As rationality problems for\nalgebraic varieties are in general difficult, it is natural to consider relaxed\nnotions such as stable rationality, or even retract rationality. Work of the\nabove authors and later Saltman in the eighties determined necessary and\nsufficient conditions to determine when an algebraic torus is stably rational,\nrespectively retract rational in terms of the integral representations of its\nassociated character lattice. An interesting question is to ask whether a\nstably rational algebraic $k$-torus is always rational. In the general case,\nthere exist examples of non-rational stably rational $k$-varieties. Algebraic\n$k$-tori of dimension $r$ are classified up to isomorphism by conjugacy classes\nof finite subgroups of GL$_r(\\mathbb{Z})$. This makes it natural to examine the\nrationality problem for algebraic $k$-tori of small dimensions. In 1967,\nVoskresenskii proved that all algebraic tori of dimension 2 are rational. In\n1990, Kunyavskii determined which algebraic tori of dimension 3 were rational.\nIn 2012, Hoshi and Yamasaki determined which algebraic tori of dimensions 4 and\n5 were stably (respectively retract) rational with the aid of GAP.

It reduces to the Jaynes-Cummings model via the rotating-wave\napproximation, which is applicable only to the cases of near resonance and weak\ncoupling. However, recent experimental breakthroughs in upgrading light-matter\ncoupling order require understanding the physics of the full quantum Rabi model\n(QRM). Despite the fact that its integrability and energy spectra have been\nexactly obtained, the challenge to formulate an exact wavefunction in a general\ncase still hinders physical exploration of the QRM. Here we unveil a\nground-state phase diagram of the QRM, consisting of a quadpolaron and a\nbipolaron as well as their changeover in the weak-, strong- and\nintermediate-coupling regimes, respectively. An unexpected overweighted\nantipolaron is revealed in the quadpolaron state, and a hidden scaling behavior\nrelevant to symmetry breaking is found in the bipolaron state. An\nexperimentally accessible parameter is proposed to test these states, which\nmight provide novel insights into the nature of the light-matter interaction\nfor all regimes of the coupling strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 00:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

We present a photometric study of\nthis star forming region (SFR) using imaging data obtained in passbands from\nthe optical to the mid-infrared in order to study the star formation process. A\ntotal of 218 members were identified using various selection criteria based on\ntheir observational properties. The SFR is reddened by at least E(B-V) = 0.8\nmag, and the reddening law toward the region is normal (R_V = 3.1). From the\nzero-age main sequence fitting method it is confirmed that the SFR is 2.1 +/-\n0.3 kpc from the Sun. The median age of the identified members is estimated to\nbe about 1.3 Myr from comparison of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) with\nstellar evolutionary models. The initial mass function (IMF) is derived from\nthe HRD and the near-infrared (J, J-H) color-magnitude diagram. The slope of\nthe IMF is about Gamma = -1.6 +/- 0.1, which is slightly steeper than that of\nthe Salpeter/Kroupa IMF. It implies that low-mass star formation is dominant in\nthe SFR. The sum of the masses of all the identified members provides the lower\nlimit of the cluster mass (169M_sun). We also analyzed the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of pre-main sequence stars using the SED fitting tool of\nRobitaille et al. and confirm that there is a significant discrepancy between\nstellar mass and age obtained from two different methods based on the SED\nfitting tool and the HRD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 00:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The H2O line widths are similar for all YSOs,\nwhereas those of 12CO 10-9 increase slightly with L_bol.

We have shown that mass of an isolated NS can, in principle, be\ndetermined if we could detect the continuous GW with two or more frequency\nmodes. Indeed, our Monte Carlo simulations have demonstrated that mass of a NS\nwith its ellipticity $10^{-6}$ at 1 kpc is typically measurable with precision\nof 20% using the ET, if the NS is precessing or has a pinned superfluid core\nand emits GWs with once and twice the spin frequencies. After briefly\nexplaining our idea and results, this paper concerns with the effect of\nmisalignment angle (\"wobble angle\" in the case of a precessing NS) on the mass\nmeasurement precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 02:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 15:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Most existing approaches for core decomposition assume that the\ngraph is kept in memory of a machine. Nevertheless, many real-world graphs are\nbig and may not reside in memory. In the literature, there is only one work for\nI/O efficient core decomposition that avoids loading the whole graph in memory.\nHowever, this approach is not scalable to handle big graphs because it cannot\nbound the memory size and may load most parts of the graph in memory. In\naddition, this approach can hardly handle graph updates. In this paper, we\nstudy I/O efficient core decomposition following a semi-external model, which\nonly allows node information to be loaded in memory. This model works well in\nmany web-scale graphs. We propose a semi-external algorithm and two optimized\nalgorithms for I/O efficient core decomposition using very simple structures\nand data access model. To handle dynamic graph updates, we show that our\nalgorithm can be naturally extended to handle edge deletion. We also propose an\nI/O efficient core maintenance algorithm to handle edge insertion, and an\nimproved algorithm to further reduce I/O and CPU cost by investigating some new\ngraph properties. We conduct extensive experiments on 12 real large graphs. Our\noptimal algorithm significantly outperform the existing I/O efficient algorithm\nin terms of both processing time and memory consumption. In many\nmemory-resident graphs, our algorithms for both core decomposition and\nmaintenance can even outperform the in-memory algorithm due to the simple\nstructures and data access model used.

More\nspecifically, filter sharpening is approached by determining the composing\npolynomial to minimize the infinity-norm of the approximation error, utilizing\nthe First Algorithm of Remez. This is applied both to sharpening for FIR,\neven-symmetric filters and for the more general case of subfilters that have\ncomplex-valued frequency responses including causal IIR filters and for\ncontinuous-time filters. Within the framework of functional composition, this\npaper also explores the use of functional decomposition to approximate a\ndesired system as a composition of simpler functions based on a two-norm on the\napproximation error.

The\ntheories of interest include General Relativity formulated in terms of tetrads,\nEinstein-Yang-Mills theory and Einstein-Dirac theory. Since the dynamical\nfields of these theories have gauge freedom, we argue that there is no group\naction of diffeomorphisms of spacetime on such dynamical fields. In general,\nsuch fields cannot even be represented as smooth, globally well-defined tensor\nfields on spacetime. Consequently the derivation of the first law by Iyer-Wald\ncannot be used directly. We show how such theories can be formulated on a\nprincipal bundle and that there is a natural action of automorphisms of the\nbundle on the fields. These bundle automorphisms encode both spacetime\ndiffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. Using this reformulation we define\nthe Noether charge associated to an infinitesimal automorphism and the\ncorresponding notion of stationarity and axisymmetry of the dynamical fields.\nWe define certain potentials and charges at the horizon of a black hole so that\nthe potentials are constant on the bifurcate Killing horizon, giving a\ngeneralised zeroth law for bifurcate Killing horizons. We identify the\ngravitational potential and perturbed charge as the temperature and perturbed\nentropy of the black hole which gives an explicit formula for the perturbed\nentropy analogous to the Wald entropy formula. We obtain a general first law of\nblack hole mechanics for such theories. The first law relates the perturbed\nHamiltonians at spatial infinity and the horizon, and the horizon contributions\ntake the form of a potential times perturbed charge term.

These examples are potentially\ncomplementary to previous work on automatic theorem proving, when a system is\nnot proven to be stable, but no proof of instability can be provided.\n  We experimentally evaluated the suitability of four model checking approaches\nto verify stability on a set of benchmarks including linear and nonlinear,\ncontrolled and uncontrolled, discrete systems, via Lyapunov's second method or\nLyapunov's direct method.

The one-loop divergences are renormalized by O(p^4)\neffective operators, and set their running. This implies the presence of chiral\nlogarithms in the amplitudes along with the O(p^4) low-energy couplings, which\nare of a similar importance and should not be neglected in next-to-leading\norder effective theory calculations, e.g. in composite scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 11:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

In particular, the minimal number\nof rounds, which an IIS protocol needs in order to solve the WSB task, does not\ngo to infinity, when the number of processes goes to infinity. Our methods can\nalso be used to generate such values of n.\n  We phrase our proofs in combinatorial language, while avoiding using\ntopology. To this end, we study a~certain class of graphs, which we call flip\ngraphs. These graphs encode adjacency structure in certain subcomplexes of\niterated standard chromatic subdivisions of a simplex. While keeping the\ngeometric background in mind for an additional intuition, we develop the\nstructure theory of matchings in flip graphs in a purely combinatorial way.

Young massive\nclusters (YMCs) host a high fraction of early-type stars, indicating an\nextremely high star formation efficiency. The Magellanic Clouds host a wide\nrange of such clusters with the youngest being still embedded in their giant\nHII regions. Hubble Space Telescope imaging of such star-forming complexes\nallows the detailed study of star formation at scales typical for molecular\nclouds. Our cluster analysis of newly-born stars in N66 shows that star\nformation in the region proceeds in a clumpy hierarchical fashion, leading to\nthe formation of both a dominant YMC, hosting about half of the observed\npre--main-sequence population, and a dispersed self-similar distribution of the\nremaining stars. We investigate the correlation between star formation rate\nderived from star-counts and molecular gas surface density in order to unravel\nthe physical conditions that gave birth to NGC 346. We find a steep correlation\nbetween these two parameters with a considerable scatter. The fraction of mass\nin stars is found to be systematically higher within the central 15 pc (where\nthe YMC is located) than outside, which suggests variations in the star\nformation efficiency within the same star-forming complex. This trend possibly\nreflects a change of star formation efficiency in N66 between clustered and\nnon-clustered star formation. Our findings suggest that the formation of NGC\n346 is the combined result of star formation regulated by turbulence and of\nearly dynamical evolution induced by the gravitational potential of the dense\ninterstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 11:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

This paper determines the variation in line\nstrength of CaII at 3933.661 A, as a function of probe separation for a sample\nof stars, including many sightlines in the Magellanic Clouds. Methods:\nFLAMES-GIRAFFE data taken with the VLT towards early-type stars in 3 Galactic &\n4 Magellanic open clusters in CaII are used to obtain the velocity, EW, column\ndensity and line width of IS Galactic Ca for a total of 657 stars, of which 443\nare Magellanic sightlines. In each cluster there are 43-110 stars observed.\nAdditionally, FEROS and UVES CaII & NaI spectra of 21 Galactic & 154 Magellanic\nearly-type stars are presented and combined with data from the literature to\nstudy the Ca column density/parallax relationship. Results: For the four\nMagellanic clusters studied with FLAMES, the strength of the Galactic IS CaII K\nEW over transverse scales from 0.05-9 pc is found to vary by factors of\n1.8-3.0, corresponding to column density variations of 0.3-0.5 dex in the\noptically-thin approximation. Using FLAMES, FEROS and UVES archive spectra, the\nmin and max reduced EW for MW gas is found to lie in the range 35-125 mA &\n30-160 mA for CaII K and NaI D, respectively. The range is consistent with a\nsimple model of the ISM published by van Loon et al. (2009) consisting of\nspherical cloudlets of filling factor 0.3, although other geometries are not\nruled out.

The\nobserved pulsating tails are characterized by a duration of $\\sim100\\,\\rm{s}$,\nan isotropic energy of $\\sim 10^{44}\\,\\rm{erg}$, and a pulse period of a few\nseconds. The pulsating tail emission likely originates from the residual energy\nafter the intense energy release during the initial spike, which forms a\ntrapped fireball composed of a photon-pair plasma in a closed field line region\nof the magnetars. Observationally the spectra of pulsating tails can be fitted\nby the superposition of a thermal component and a power-law component, with the\nthermal component dominating the emission in the early and late stages of the\npulsating tail observations. In this paper, assuming that the trapped fireball\nis from a closed field line region in the magnetosphere, we calculate the\natmosphere structure of the optically-thick trapped fireball and the\npolarization properties of the trapped fireball.

An extension of this powerful method to a time-resolved\nprobe technique at x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) to ultimately unravel\nultrafast chemical and structural changes on a femtosecond time scale is often\nchallenging, due to the small signal rate in conventional implementations at\nXFELs that rely on the usage of a monochromator set up to select a small\nfrequency band of the broadband, spectrally incoherent XFEL radiation. Here, we\nsuggest an alternative approach, based on stochastic spectroscopy, that uses\nthe full bandwidth of the incoming XFEL pulses. Our proposed method is relying\non stimulated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, where in addition to a pump\npulse that resonantly excites the system a probe pulse on a specific electronic\ninelastic transition is provided, that serves as seed in the stimulated\nscattering process.

Imagine an infinite list of \"boxes\", with a \"treasure\"\nhidden in one of them, where the boxes' order reflects the importance of\nfinding the treasure in a given box. At each time step, a search protocol\nexecuted by a searcher has the ability to peek into one box, and see whether\nthe treasure is present or not. By equally dividing the workload between them,\n$k$ searchers can find the treasure $k$ times faster than one searcher.\nHowever, this straightforward strategy is very sensitive to failures (e.g.,\ncrashes of processors), and overcoming this issue seems to require a large\namount of communication. We therefore address the question of designing\nparallel search algorithms maximizing their speed-up and maintaining high\nlevels of robustness, while minimizing the amount of resources for\ncoordination. Based on the observation that algorithms that avoid communication\nare inherently robust, we analyze the best running time performance of\nnon-coordinating algorithms. Specifically, we devise non-coordinating\nalgorithms that achieve a speed-up of $9/8$ for two searchers, a speed-up of\n$4/3$ for three searchers, and in general, a speed-up of $\\frac{k}{4}(1+1/k)^2$\nfor any $k\\geq 1$ searchers. Thus, asymptotically, the speed-up is only four\ntimes worse compared to the case of full-coordination, and our algorithms are\nsurprisingly simple and hence applicable. Moreover, these bounds are tight in a\nstrong sense as no non-coordinating search algorithm can achieve better\nspeed-ups. Overall, we highlight that, in faulty contexts in which coordination\nbetween the searchers is technically difficult to implement, intrusive with\nrespect to privacy, and/or costly in term of resources, it might well be worth\ngiving up on coordination, and simply run our non-coordinating exhaustive\nsearch algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 13:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

It uses the fact that the Renormalisation Group evolution of\nan observable predicts the functional form of its residual cutoff dependence on\nthe EFT breakdown scale, low-momentum scales, and the order of the calculation.\nPassing this test is a necessary but not sufficient consistency criterion for a\nsuggested power counting whose exact nature is disputed. For example, in ChiEFT\nwith more than one nucleon, a lack of universally accepted analytic solutions\nobfuscates the relation between convergence pattern and numerical results, and\nled to proposals which predict different numbers of Low Energy Coefficients at\nthe same chiral order. The method may provide an independent check whether an\nobservable is renormalised at a given order, and of both the breakdown scale\nand the momentum-dependent order-by-order convergence pattern of an EFT.\nConversely, it may help identify LECs which produce renormalised observables at\na given order. I also discuss its underlying assumptions and relation to the RG\nEquation; useful choices for observables and cutoffs; the momentum window in\nwhich the test provides best signals; its dependence on the values and forms of\ncutoffs as well as on the EFT parameters; the impact of fitting Low Energy\nCoefficients to data in different or the same channel; caveats and limitations.\nSince the test is designed to minimise the use of data, it allows one to\nquantitatively falsify if the EFT has been renormalised consistently, rather\nthan quantifying how an EFT compares to experiment.

For all\nspins $s \\geq \\frac{3}{2}$ we find a quantum phase diagram very similar to the\nclassical one, with a direct first-order transition between the two collinear\nAFM states at a value $\\kappa_{c}(s)$ which is slightly greater than\n$\\kappa_{{\\rm cl}}$ [e.g., $\\kappa_{c}(\\frac{3}{2}) \\approx 0.53(1)$] and which\napproaches it monotonically as $s \\to \\infty$. By contrast, for the case $s=1$\nthe transition is split into two such that the stable GS phases are ones with\nN\\'{e}el AFM order for $\\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{1}} = 0.485(5)$ and with striped\nAFM order for $\\kappa > \\kappa_{c_{2}} = 0.528(5)$, just as in the case\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$ (for which $\\kappa_{c_{1}} \\approx 0.47$ and $\\kappa_{c_{2}}\n\\approx 0.60$). For both the $s=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $s=1$ models the transition at\n$\\kappa_{c_{2}}$ appears to be of first-order type, while that at\n$\\kappa_{c_{1}}$ appears to be continuous. However, whereas in the\n$s=\\frac{1}{2}$ case the intermediate phase appears to have PVBC order over the\nentire range $\\kappa_{c_{1}} < \\kappa < \\kappa_{c_{2}}$, in the $s=1$ case PVBC\nordering either exists only over a very small part of the region or, more\nlikely, is absent everywhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 13:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

This concept, called as\ndensified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable\nspectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the\nprimary mirror. This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The\nacquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against\nlow-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation\nof the primary mirror. The reliability of the observation result is also\nincreased by statistically treating them.

In the\nnew simulation, electrons are modelled as a fluid, hence resembling hydrid\nsimulation, but in contrast to normal hybrid simulation, the Poisson equation\nis used as in normal PIC to calculate the self-consistent electrostatic field.\nFor electron-repulsive parts of the potential, the Boltzmann relation is used.\nFor electron-attractive parts of the potential we employ a power law which\ncontains a parameter that can be used to control the number of trapped\nelectrons. We perform a set of runs varying the parameter and select the one\nwith the smallest number of trapped electrons which still behaves in a\nphysically meaningful way in the sense of producing not more than one solar\nwind ion deflection shock upstream of the tether. By this prescription we\nobtain thrust per tether length values that are in line with earlier estimates,\nalthough somewhat smaller. We conclude that the Boltzmann PIC simulation is a\nnew tool for simulating the E-sail thrust. This tool enables us to calculate\nsolutions rapidly and allows to easily study different scenarios for trapped\nelectrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 14:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 07:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Rubin (1998) put forth such a method, and\nargued that testing for the complier average causal effect and averaging\npermutation based p-values over the posterior distribution of the compliance\nstatus could increase power, as compared to general intent-to-treat tests. The\ngeneral scheme is to repeatedly do a two-step process of imputing missing\ncompliance statuses and conducting a permutation test with the completed data.\nIn this paper, we explore this idea further, comparing the use of discrepancy\nmeasures, which depend on unknown but imputed parameters, to classical test\nstatistics and exploring different approaches for imputing the unknown\ncompliance statuses. We also examine consequences of model misspecification in\nthe imputation step, and discuss to what extent this additional modeling\nundercuts the permutation test's model independence. We find that, especially\nfor discrepancy measures, modeling choices can impact both power and validity.\nIn particular, imputing missing compliance statuses assuming the null can\nradically reduce power, but not doing so can jeopardize validity. Fortunately,\ncovariates predictive of compliance status can mitigate these results. Finally,\nwe compare this overall approach to Bayesian model-based tests, that is tests\nthat are directly derived from posterior credible intervals, under both correct\nand incorrect model specification. We find that adding the permutation step in\nan otherwise Bayesian approach improves robustness to model specification\nwithout substantial loss of power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 14:35:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 14:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 15:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

In field theory, the total partition\nfunction splits in a natural way in a piece that does not contain surface terms\nand a piece consisting of solely the so-called edge states. For open strings,\nwe illustrate that surface contributions to the higher spin fields correspond\nto open strings piercing the Rindler origin, unifying the higher spin surface\ncontributions in string language. For closed strings, we demonstrate that the\nstring partition function is not quite the same as the sum over the partition\nfunctions of the fields in the spectrum: an infinite overcounting is present\nfor the latter. Next we study the partition functions obtained by excluding the\nsurface terms. Using recent results of JHEP 1505 (2015) 106, this construction,\nfirst done by Emparan, can be put on much firmer ground. We generalize to type\nII and heterotic superstrings and demonstrate modular invariance. All of these\nexhibit an IR divergence that can be interpreted as a maximal acceleration\nclose to the black hole horizon. Ultimately, since these partition functions\nare only part of the full story, divergences here should not be viewed as a\nfailure of string theory: maximal acceleration is a feature of a faulty\ntreatment of the higher spin fields in the string spectrum.

This core\ntrainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding\ndecoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture\nof the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional\nlayers in the VGG16 network. The role of the decoder network is to map the low\nresolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for\npixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which\nthe decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically,\nthe decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the\ncorresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the\nneed for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then\nconvolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our\nproposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN and also with the well known\nDeepLab-LargeFOV, DeconvNet architectures. This comparison reveals the memory\nversus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance.\n  SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it\nis designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time\nduring inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable\nparameters than other competing architectures. We also performed a controlled\nbenchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D\nindoor scene segmentation tasks. We show that SegNet provides good performance\nwith competitive inference time and more efficient inference memory-wise as\ncompared to other architectures.

We assume that the wave packet is a possible model of\nparticle . When studying the behaviour of the wave packet for standing waves,\nin relation to an accelerated observer (i.e. Rindler observer), there can be\ndemonstrated that the equivalent mass of the packet is the inertial mass. In\nour scenario, the waves and of the wave packets are depicted by the strain\ninduced/produced in the medium. The properties of the waves, of the wave packet\nand, generally, of the perturbations in a material medium suggest the existence\nof an acoustic world. The acoustic world has mechanical and thermodynamical\nproperties. The perturbations that are generated and propagated in the medium\nare correlated by means of acoustic waves with maximum speed. The observers of\nthis world of disturbances (namely the acoustic world) have senses that are\nbased on the perception of mechanical waves (disturbance of any kind) and\napparatus for detecting and acquiring information by means of the same type of\nwave. Time and length measurements (and other parameters) are correlated by\nLorentz type transformations, where the maximum speed is the speed of the sound\nwaves. By applying these transformations to the packet of standing waves, there\nresults that the energy, mass, linear momentum and the action variable/variable\naction undergo relativistic changes. We highlight the fact that the dynamic\nrelativist relationship between energy and momentum is a consequence of the\nwave packet model for a particle. We have also emphasized the existence of\ncertain limits for the energy of the disturbance and the corresponding action\nvariable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 12:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 06:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

However, despite the foreseen technological benefits of such\nconsumer-centric grid features, to date, their widespread adoption in practice\nremains modest. To shed light on this challenge, this paper explores the\npotential of prospect theory, a Nobel-prize winning theory, as a\ndecision-making framework that can help understand how risk and uncertainty can\nimpact the decisions of smart grid consumers. After introducing the basic\nnotions of prospect theory, several examples drawn from a number of smart grid\napplications are developed.
