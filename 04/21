With the exception\nof the collision moments, the transport equations for the new variables are\nidentical to the usual moment equations, and thus naturally lend themselves to\nthe variety of already existing closure methods. Under the anelastic turbulence\napproximation, we derive equations for the Reynolds-averaged turbulent\nfluctuations around the coarse-grained state. We show that the global relative\nentropy of the coarse-grained state is bounded from above by the Reynolds\naverage of the fine-grained global relative entropy, and thus obeys the time\ndecay bound of Desvillettes and Villani.

Many models for density and\nsolubility calculations have been presented in the literature, but there exists\nonly one study, by Spycher and Pruess, that has compared theoretical molar\nenthalpy predictions with experimental data. In this report, we recommend two\ndifferent models for enthalpy calculations: the CPA equation of state by Li and\nFiroozabadi, and the CO$_2$ activity coefficient model by Duan and Sun. We show\nthat the CPA equation of state, which has been demonstrated to provide good\nagreement with density and solubility data, also accurately calculates molar\nenthalpies of pure CO$_2$, pure water, and both CO$_2$-rich and aqueous\n(H$_2$O-rich) mixtures of the two species.

In aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl)\nmixtures, we show that Duan and Sun's model yields accurate results for the\npartial molar enthalpy of CO$_2$. It can be combined with another model for the\nbrine enthalpy to calculate the molar enthalpy of H$_2$O-CO$_2$-NaCl mixtures.\nWe conclude by explaining how the CPA equation of state may be modified to\nfurther improve agreement with experiments.

It is a step\ntoward the ambitious goal of classifying all possible quantum gate sets acting\non qubits. Our theorem implies a linear-time algorithm (which we have\nimplemented), that takes as input the truth tables of reversible gates G and H,\nand that decides whether G generates H. Previously, this problem was not even\nknown to be decidable. The theorem also implies that any n-bit reversible\ncircuit can be \"compressed\" to an equivalent circuit, over the same gates, that\nuses at most 2^n*poly(n) gates and O(1) ancilla bits; these are the first upper\nbounds on these quantities known, and are close to optimal.

Most analyses rely on the\nassumption that the charm and bottom PDFs are generated perturbatively by gluon\nsplitting and do not involve any non-perturbative degrees of freedom. It is\nclearly necessary to test this hypothesis with suitable QCD processes.\nConversely, a non-perturbative, intrinsic heavy quark parton distribution has\nbeen predicted in the literature. We demonstrate that to a very good\napproximation the scale-evolution of the intrinsic heavy quark content of the\nnucleon is governed by non-singlet evolution equations. This allows us to\nanalyze the intrinsic heavy quark distributions without having to resort to a\nfull-fledged global analysis of parton distribution functions.

This technique can be applied to the case of intrinsic charm, albeit\nwithin the limitations outlined in the following.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 18:53:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The quotient complexity of an operation on regular languages is the\nmaximal quotient complexity of the result of the operation expressed as a\nfunction of the quotient complexities of the operands.

Although the frequency\nincrease is modest it can have important implications for wave dynamics in\ngalaxy discs, which have not been previously explored in detail. One of the\nmost interesting consequences is that for a given pattern frequency, each\nLindblad resonance does not exist in isolation, but rather is the parent of a\ncontinuous sequence of resonant radii, a Lindblad Zone, with each radius in\nthis zone characterized by a specific eccentricity. In the epicyclic\napproximation the precession or epicyclic frequency does not depend on epicycle\nsize, and this phenomenon is not captured. A better approximation for eccentric\norbits is provided by p-ellipse curves (Struck 2006), which do exhibit this\neffect. Here the p-ellipse approximation and precession-eccentricity relation\nare used as tools for finding the resonant radii generated from various\nLindblad parent resonances. Simple, idealized examples, in flat rotation curve\nand near solid-body discs, are used to show that ensembles of eccentric\nresonant orbits excited in Lindblad Zones can provide a backbone for generating\na variety of (kinematic) bars and spiral waves. In cases balancing\nradius-dependent circular frequencies and eccentricity-dependent precession, a\nrange of resonant orbits can maintain their form in the pattern frame, and do\nnot wind up. Eccentric resonance orbits require a strong perturbation to excite\nthem, and may be produced mostly in galaxy interactions or by strong internal\ndisturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 19:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the\ndifferences between quark and gluon jet quenching on the transverse momentum\n($p_{T}^{jet}$) dependence of the jet $R_{AA}$ and on the fragmentation\nfunctions, $D(z)$. Primordial quark and gluon parton distributions were\nobtained from PYTHIA8 and were parameterized using simple power-law functions\nand extensions to the power-law function which were found to better describe\nthe PYTHIA8 parton spectra. A simple model for the quark energy loss based on\nthe shift formalism is used to model $R_{AA}$ and $D(z)$ using both analytic\nresults and using direct Monte-Carlo sampling of the PYTHIA parton spectra. The\nmodel is capable of describing the full $p_{T}^{jet}$ , rapidity, and\ncentrality dependence of the measured jet $R_{AA}$ using three effective\nparameters. A key result from the analysis is that the $D(z)$ modifications\nobserved in the data, excluding the enhancement at low-$z$, may result\nprimarily from the different quenching of the quarks and gluons. The model is\nalso capable of reproducing the charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse\nmomentum. Predictions are made for the jet $R_{AA}$ at large rapidities where\nit has not yet been measured and for the rapidity dependence of $D(z)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 19:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-06"}

For finite-temperature ion-surface\ninteractions, the friction is essentially caused by Ohmic resistance due to the\nmotion of the image charge moving in a dielectric material.

We further find\nthat, in the mean-field approximation, the BPS Skyrme model approaches the\nWalecka model in the limit of high density - their thermodynamical functions as\nwell as the equation of state agree in this limit. This fact allows to read off\nsome properties of the $\\omega$-meson from the BPS Skyrme action, even though\nthe latter model is entirely based on the (pionic) $SU(2)$ Skyrme field. On the\nother hand, at low densities, at the order of the usual nuclear matter density,\nthe equations of state of the two models are no longer universal, such that a\ncomparison depends on some model details. Still, also the BPS Skyrme model\ngives rise to nuclear saturation in this regime, leading, in fact, to an exact\nbalance between repulsive and attractive forces. The perfect fluid aspects of\nthe BPS Skyrme model, which, together with its BPS properties, form the base of\nour results, are shown to be in close formal analogy with the Eulerian\nformulation of relativistic fluid dynamics. Within this analogy, the BPS Skyrme\nmodel, in general, corresponds to a non-barotropic perfect fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

Here, we show that this result (while\ncorrect) is highly misleading, at least in the small $Q$ limit. In particular,\nfor $V<V_c$ there is an abrupt crossover akin to a mobility edge at an energy\n$E_c$; states with energy $|E|<E_c$ are robustly delocalized, but those in the\ntails of the density of states, with $|E|>E_c$, form a set of narrow bands with\nexponentially small bandwidths $ \\sim t\\ \\exp[-(2\\pi\\alpha/Q)]$ (where $\\alpha$\nis an energy dependent number of order 1) separated by band-gaps $ \\sim t Q$.\nThus, the states with $|E|> E_c$ are \"almost localized\" in that they have an\nexponentially large effective mass and are easily localized by small\nperturbations.

After\nconvolution with the experimental mass resolution, the main effect of the\ninterference is to shift the position of the mass peak, as in the inclusive GF\ncase studied previously. The apparent mass shift is small in magnitude but\nstrongly dependent on the Higgs width, potentially allowing for a measurement\nof, or bound on, the width itself. In the $H(\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma)+2 \\text{\njets}$ channel, the VBF and GF contributions generate shifts of opposite signs\nwhich largely cancel, depending on the sets of cuts used, to as little as 5 MeV\n(toward a lower Higgs mass). The small magnitude of the shift makes this\nchannel a good reference mass for measuring the inclusive mass shift of around\n60 MeV in the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 18:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Each agent receives a private signal about the underlying state\nof the world, observes the past actions in a neighborhood of individuals, and\nchooses her action attempting to match the true state. Earlier research in this\nfield emphasizes that herding behavior occurs with a positive probability in\ncertain special cases; recent studies show that asymptotic learning is\nachievable under a more general observation structure. In particular, with\nunbounded private beliefs, asymptotic learning occurs if and only if agents\nobserve a close predecessor, i.e., the action of a close predecessor reveals\nthe true state in the limit. However, a prevailing assumption in these studies\nis that the observation structure in the society is exogenous. In contrast to\nmost of the previous literature, I assume in this paper that observation is\nendogenous and costly. More specifically, each agent must pay a specific cost\nto make any observation and can strategically choose the set of actions to\nobserve privately. I introduce the notion of maximal learning (relative to\ncost) as a natural extension of asymptotic learning: society achieves maximal\nlearning when agents can learn the true state with probability 1 in the limit\nafter paying the cost of observation. I show that observing only a close\npredecessor is no longer sufficient for learning the true state with unbounded\nprivate beliefs and positive costs. Instead, maximal learning occurs if and\nonly if the size of the observations extends to infinity. I provide interesting\ncomparative statics as to how various settings in the model affect the learning\nprobability. For instance, the probability to learn the true state may be\nhigher under positive costs than under zero cost; in addition, the probability\nto learn the true state may be higher under weaker private signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 15:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

This affects the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of each user, and\nhence is one of the limiting factors of network performance. However, in\nprevious works, interference management approaches in HetNets are mainly based\non interference level, and thus cannot effectively utilize the limited resource\nto improve network performance. In this paper, we propose a user-centric\ninterference nulling (IN) scheme in downlink two-tier HetNets to improve\nnetwork performance by improving each user's SIR. This scheme has three design\nparameters: the maximum degree of freedom for IN (IN DoF), and the IN\nthresholds for the macro and pico users, respectively. Using tools from\nstochastic geometry, we first obtain a tractable expression of the coverage\n(equivalently outage) probability.

A specific ratio exists in various species at multiple levels from the\nprocess of cell differentiation in multicellular organisms to the situation of\nsocial dilemma in a group of human beings. This study found a common basis of\nregulating a collective behavior which is realized by a series of local\ncontacts between individuals. The most essential behavior of individuals in\nthis theory is to change its internal mode through sharing information in\ncontact with others. Our numerical simulations with cellular automata model\nrealize to regulate the ratio of population of individuals who has either two\nkinds of modes. From the theoretical analysis and numerical calculations, we\nfound that asymmetric properties in local contacts, are essential for adaptive\nregulation in response to the global information such a group size and whole\ndensity. Furthermore, a discrete system is crucial in no-leader groups to\nrealize the flexible regulation, and the critical condition which eliminates\noverlap with one another (excluded volume effect) also affects the resulting\nproportion in high density. The foremost advantage of this strategy is that no\nglobal information is required for each individual, and only a couple of mode\nswitching can achieve the whole proportion regulation. The simple mechanism say\nthat proportion regulation in well-organized groups in nature can be realized\nthrough and limited to local contacts, and has a potential to solve various\nphenomena that microscopic individuals behaviors connect to macroscopic orderly\nbehaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 03:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 14:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 07:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

These remnants, which also possess bright\nnon-thermal radio shells, are often found to be interacting directly with\nsurrounding gas clouds. We explore the non-thermal emission mechanism at these\ndynamically evolved SNRs by constructing a hydrodynamical model. Two scenarios\nof particle acceleration, either a re-acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays\n(CRs) or an efficient nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration (NLDSA) of\nparticles injected from downstream, are considered. Using parameters inferred\nfrom observations, our models are contrasted with the observed spectra of SNR\nW44.

If sufficiently strong magnetic turbulence is present in the molecular\ncloud, the re-acceleration scenario can explain the observed broadband spectral\nproperties. The NLDSA scenario also succeeds in explaining the $\\gamma$-ray\nspectrum but fails to reproduce the radio spectral index. Efficient NLDSA also\nresults in a significant post-shock non-thermal pressure that limits the\ncompression during cooling and prevents the formation of a prominent dense\nshell.

Perhaps more surprisingly, our\nresults indicate there is little difference between the different word\nembedding methods, and that simple Brown clusters are often competitive with\nword embeddings across all tasks we consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 06:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 05:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

Perhaps surprisingly, it is often possible\nto \"de-noise\" the empirical distribution of the samples to return an\napproximation of the true distribution that is significantly more accurate than\nthe empirical distribution, without relying on any prior assumptions on the\ndistribution. We present an instance optimal learning algorithm which optimally\nperforms this de-noising for every distribution for which such a de-noising is\npossible. More formally, given $n$ independent draws from a distribution $p$,\nour algorithm returns a labelled vector whose expected distance from $p$ is\nequal to the minimum possible expected error that could be obtained by any\nalgorithm that knows the true unlabeled vector of probabilities of distribution\n$p$ and simply needs to assign labels, up to an additive subconstant term that\nis independent of $p$ and goes to zero as $n$ gets large. One conceptual\nimplication of this result is that for large samples, Bayesian assumptions on\nthe \"shape\" or bounds on the tail probabilities of a distribution over discrete\nsupport are not helpful for the task of learning the distribution.\n  As a consequence of our techniques, we also show that given a set of $n$\nsamples from an arbitrary distribution, one can accurately estimate the\nexpected number of distinct elements that will be observed in a sample of any\nsize up to $n \\log n$.

Although many\npsychological factors influencing risk perception have been identified in the\npast, it remains unclear how perceptions of risk change when propagated from\none person to another and what impact the repeated social transmission of\nperceived risk has at the population scale.

In this paper, we address the origin of\nthe EUV late phase by analyzing in detail two late phase flares, an M2.9 flare\non 2010 October 16 and an M1.4 flare on 2011 February 18, using multi-passband\nimaging observations from the Atmospheric Imaing Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO.

While the late phase\nloop arcade reaches its peak brightness progressively at a later time spanning\nfor more than one hour from high to low temperatures, the main phase loop\narcade reaches its peak brightness at almost the same time (within several\nminutes) in all temperatures. (3) Nevertheless, the two loop systems seem to be\nconnected magnetically, forming an asymmetric magnetic quadruple configuration.\n(4) Further, the footpoint brightenings in UV wavelengths show a systematic\ndelay of about one minute from the main flare region to the remote footpoint of\nthe late phase arcade system. We argue that the EUV late phase is the result of\na long-lasting cooling process in the larger magnetic arcade system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 08:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

We\nrationalize our findings as a function of the local variations of the shear\nrate in the rectangular channels and hydrodynamic attractive forces between\nbacteria and walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 08:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

However, they are not sufficient due to their limitations,\ni.e., being weaker than the original k-anonymity or requiring strong parametric\nassumptions. First we propose Pk-anonymity, a new probabilistic k-anonymity,\nand prove that Pk-anonymity is a mathematical extension of k-anonymity rather\nthan a relaxation. Furthermore, Pk-anonymity requires no parametric\nassumptions.

Equivalently, the bound can be formulated as a semidefinite\nprogram satisfying strong duality. The convex nature of the bound implies\nchannel symmetries can substantially simplify the optimization, enabling us to\nexplicitly compute the finite blocklength behavior for several simple qubit\nchannels.

The abundances of the three main isotopes of oxygen are altered in\nthe course of the CNO-cycle. When the first dredge-up mixes the burning\nproducts to the surface, the nucleosynthesis processes can be probed by\nmeasuring oxygen isotopic ratios. Aims. By measuring 16O/17O and 16O/18O in red\ngiants of known mass we compare the isotope ratios with predictions from\nstellar and galactic evolution modelling. Methods. Oxygen isotopic ratios were\nderived from the K-band spectra of six red giants. The sample red giants are\nopen cluster members with known masses of between 1.8 and 4.5 Msun . The\nabundance determination employs synthetic spectra calculated with the COMARCS\ncode. The effect of uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates, the mixing\nlength, and of a change in the initial abundance of the oxygen isotopes was\ndetermined by a set of nucleosynthesis and mixing models using the FUNS code.\nResults. The observed 16O/17O ratios are in good agreement with the model\nresults, even if the measured values do not present clear evidence of a\nvariation with the stellar mass. The observed 16O/18O ratios are clearly lower\nthan the predictions from our reference model. Variations in nuclear reaction\nrates and mixing length parameter both have only a very weak effect on the\npredicted values. The 12C/13C ratios of the K giants studied implies the\nabsence of extra-mixing in these objects. Conclusions. A comparison with\ngalactic chemical evolution models indicates that the 16O/18O abundance ratio\nunderwent a faster decrease than predicted. To explain the observed ratios, the\nmost likely scenario is a higher initial 18O abundance combined with a lower\ninitial 16 O abundance. Comparing the measured 18 O/17 O ratio with the\ncorresponding value for the ISM points towards an initial enhancement of 17O as\nwell. Limitations imposed by the observations prevent this from being a\nconclusive result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 10:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In experiments or cosmological models one typically wants to\ncompute the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a given initial distribution of\nsuch waves. Wave Turbulence deals with out-of-equilibrium ensembles of weakly\nnonlinear waves, and is therefore well-suited to address this problem. As an\nexample, we consider the complex Klein-Gordon equation with a Mexican-hat\npotential. This simple equation displays two kinds of excitations around the\nfundamental state: massive particles and massless Goldstone bosons. The former\nare waves with a nonzero frequency for vanishing wavenumber, whereas the latter\nobey an acoustic dispersion relation. Using wave turbulence theory, we derive\nwave kinetic equations that govern the coupled evolution of the spectra of\nmassive and massless waves. We first consider the thermodynamic solutions to\nthese equations and study the wave condensation transition, which is the\nclassical equivalent of Bose-Einstein condensation. We then focus on nonlocal\ninteractions in wavenumber space: we study the decay of an ensemble massive\nparticles into massless ones. Under rather general conditions, these massless\nparticles accumulate at low wavenumber. We study the dynamics of waves\ncoexisting with such a strong condensate, and we compute rigorously a nonlocal\nKolmogorov-Zakharov solution, where particles are transferred non-locally to\nthe condensate, while energy cascades towards large wave numbers through local\ninteractions. This nonlocal cascading state constitute the intermediate\nasymptotics between the initial distribution of waves and the thermodynamic\nstate reached in the long-time limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 11:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

For\nthe purpose we work on a metric in the gravity side, {\\em viz.} OKS-BH\ngeometry, whose dual in the gauge theory side runs with the energy and hence\nproves to be a better background for thermal QCD. The potential obtained has\nconfining term both in vacuum and in medium, in addition to the Coulomb term\nalone, usually reported in the literature. As the velocity of the pair is\nincreased the screening of the potential gets weakened, which may be understood\nby the decrease of effective temperature with the increase of velocity. The\ncrucial observation of our work is that beyond a critical separation of the\nheavy quark pair, the potential develops an imaginary part which is nowadays\nunderstood to be the main source of dissociation. The imaginary part is found\nto vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the perturbative result. Finally we\nhave estimated the thermal width for the ground and first excited states and\nfound that non-zero rapidities lead to an increase of thermal width. This\nimplies that the moving quarkonia dissociate easier than the static ones, which\nagrees with other calculations. However, the width in our case is larger than\nother calculations due to the presence of confining terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 11:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 05:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

In this respect, naturalness is still a powerful heuristic principle in\nmodel building beyond the standard model whenever new massive states are\ncoupled to the Higgs field. The most compelling case is provided by the\ngeneration of neutrino masses. In this paper we confront this problem from a\nnew perspective. The right-handed sector responsible for the seesaw\nmechanism---which introduces a large energy threshold above the electroweak\nscale---is made supersymmetric to comply with naturalness while the standard\nmodel is left unchanged and non-supersymmetric. Cancellations necessary to the\nnaturalness requirement break down only at two loops, thus offering the\npossibility to increase the right-handed neutrino mass scale up to one order of\nmagnitude above the usual values allowed by naturalness. If also the weak boson\nsector of the standard model is made supersymmetric, cancellations break down\nat three loops and the scale of new physics can be further raised. In the\ntype-I seesaw, this implementation provides right-handed neutrino masses that\nare natural and at the same time large enough to give rise to baryogenesis (via\nleptogenesis). The model contains a dark matter candidate and distinctive new\nphysics in the leptonic sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 12:28:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 19:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

We impose row sparsity on the transformation matrix of LDA\nthrough ${\\ell}_{2,1}$-norm regularization to achieve feature selection, and\nthe resultant formulation optimizes for selecting the most discriminative\nfeatures and removing the redundant ones simultaneously.

Lipid bilayers can be\nconsidered as a surface fluid and hence the governing equations for the\nevolution include the surface (Navier--)Stokes equations, which in particular\ntake the membrane viscosity into account. The evolution is driven by forces\nstemming from the curvature elasticity of the membrane. In addition, the\nsurface fluid equations are coupled to bulk (Navier--)Stokes equations.\n  We introduce a parametric finite element method to solve this complex free\nboundary problem, and present the first three dimensional numerical\ncomputations based on the full (Navier--)Stokes system for several different\nscenarios. For example, the effects of the membrane viscosity, spontaneous\ncurvature and area difference elasticity (ADE) are studied.

Identifying these faces in high-dimension is\nchallenging.

This is our first contribution.\n  Our second contribution concerns the composite maximum likelihood estimate.\nWhen the dimension of the problem is large, estimating the parameters of a\ngiven graphical model through maximum likelihood is challenging, if not\nimpossible. The traditional approach to this problem has been local with the\nuse of composite likelihood based on local conditional likelihoods.\n  A more recent development is to have the components of the composite\nlikelihood be marginal likelihoods centred around each $v$. We first show that\nthe estimates obtained by consensus through local conditional and marginal\nlikelihoods are identical.

The evolution of the BH-accretion tori is simulated for seconds with a\nNewtonian hydrodynamics code including viscosity effects, pseudo-Newtonian\ngravity for rotating BHs, and an energy-dependent two-moment closure scheme for\nthe transport of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos. The investigated cases\nare guided by relativistic double neutron star (NS-NS) and NS-BH merger models,\nproducing ~3-6 Msun BHs with rotation parameters of A~0.8 and tori of 0.03-0.3\nMsun. Our nucleosynthesis analysis includes the dynamical (prompt) ejecta\nexpelled during the CBM phase and the neutrino and viscously driven outflows of\nthe relic BH-torus systems. While typically ~20-25% of the initial\naccretion-torus mass are lost by viscously driven outflows, neutrino-powered\nwinds contribute at most another ~1%, but neutrino heating enhances the viscous\nejecta significantly. Since BH-torus ejecta possess a wide distribution of\nelectron fractions (0.1-0.6) and entropies, they produce heavy elements from\nA~80 up to the actinides, with relative contributions of A>130 nuclei being\nsubdominant and sensitively dependent on BH and torus masses and the exact\ntreatment of shear viscosity. The combined ejecta of CBM and BH-torus phases\ncan reproduce the solar abundances amazingly well for A>90. Varying\ncontributions of the torus ejecta might account for observed variations of\nlighter elements with 40<Z<56 relative to heavier ones, and a considerable\nreduction of the prompt ejecta compared to the torus ejecta, e.g. in highly\nasymmetric NS-BH mergers, might explain the composition of heavy-element\ndeficient stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 14:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 10:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

More recently, the trend is to enhance the\nsystem performance by exploiting the channel's degrees of freedom in the\nelevation, which necessitates the derivation and characterization of\nthree-dimensional (3D) channels in the presence of spatial correlation. In this\npaper, an exact closed-form expression for the Spatial Correlation Function\n(SCF) is derived for 3D MIMO channels. This novel SCF is developed for a\nuniform linear array of antennas with nonisotropic antenna patterns. The\nproposed method resorts to the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) of plane\nwaves and the trigonometric expansion of Legendre and associated Legendre\npolynomials. The resulting expression depends on the underlying arbitrary\nangular distributions and antenna patterns through the Fourier Series (FS)\ncoefficients of power azimuth and elevation spectrums. The novelty of the\nproposed method lies in the SCF being valid for any 3D propagation environment.\nThe developed SCF determines the covariance matrices at the transmitter and the\nreceiver that form the Kronecker channel model. In order to quantify the\neffects of correlation on the system performance, the information-theoretic\ndeterministic equivalents of the MI for the Kronecker model are utilized in\nboth mono-user and multi-user cases. Numerical results validate the proposed\nanalytical expressions and elucidate the dependence of the system performance\non azimuth and elevation angular spreads and antenna patterns. Some useful\ninsights into the behaviour of MI as a function of downtilt angles are\nprovided. The derived model will help evaluate the performance of correlated 3D\nMIMO channels in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

Single-domain protein side-chain\npacking has been thoroughly studied. A major challenge in generalizing these\nmethods to protein complexes is that they, unlike monomers, often have very\nlarge treewidth, and thus algorithms such as TreePack cannot be directly\napplied. To address this issue, SCWRL4 treats the complex effectively as a\nmonomer, heuristically excluding weak interactions to decrease treewidth; as a\nresult, SCWRL4 generates poor packings on protein interfaces. To date, few\nside-chain packing methods exist that are specifically designed for protein\ncomplexes. In this paper, we introduce a method, iTreePack, which solves the\nside-chain packing problem for complexes by using a novel combination of dual\ndecomposition and tree decomposition. In particular, iTreePack overcomes the\nproblem of large treewidth by decomposing a protein complex into smaller\nsubgraphs and novelly reformulating the complex side-chain packing problem as a\ndual relaxation problem; this allows us to solve the side-chain packing of each\nsmall subgraph separately using tree-decomposition. A projected subgradient\nalgorithm is applied to enforcing the consistency among the side-chain packings\nof all the small subgraphs. Computational results demonstrate that our\niTreePack program outperforms SCWRL4 on protein complexes. In particular,\niTreePack places side-chain atoms much more accurately on very large complexes,\nwhich constitute a significant portion of protein-protein interactions.\nMoreover, the advantage of iTreePack over SCWRL4 increases with respect to the\ntreewidth of a complex. Even for monomeric proteins, iTreePack is much more\nefficient than SCWRL and slightly more accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

It is\npivotal to know when the dynamics underlying a walk lead to quantum advantages\njust by examining its statistics. A walk with many indistinguishable particles\nand measurements of non-classical multi-particle correlations is likely to\nreveal the quantum nature. The number of elements $O(n)$ in a setup realizing\nwalks grows with their length or spread $n$. We introduce the concept of a\nquantum leap, a process which can be achieved with fewer or complementary\nresources and which in a single step simulates another long process. The\nprocess and its leap are described by the same Hamiltonian but, the latter\nparametrizes the evolution with a tunable parameter of a setup. In the case of\nwalks, a leap immediately gives a probability distribution which results only\nafter many steps. This may be appealing for simulation of processes which are\nlengthy or require dynamical control. We discuss a leap based on the\nmulti-particle Hong--Ou--Mandel interference, an inherently quantum phenomenon.\nIt reproduces a quantum walk enabling perfect state transfer through spin\nchains. It requires a beam splitter, two detectors and $n$ particles to mimic a\nwalk on a chain of size $O(n)$, for time fixed by beam-splitter's reflectivity.\nOur results apply to a broad class of systems where the HOM-like effects can be\nobserved, and may constitute a new approach to simulation of complex\nHamiltonians with passive interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 16:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

Even when the fifth-force constraint is\nsatisfied, the effective scalar degree of freedom may move to a point (close to\nits potential minima) in the field space where the Ricci scalar diverges. We\nelucidate this point further with a specific example of $f(R)$ gravity that\nincorporates several viable $f(R)$ gravity models in the literature. In\nparticular, we show that the nonlinear evolution of the scalar field in\npressureless contracting dust can easily lead to the curvature singularity,\nmaking this theory unviable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 15:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 13:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}
