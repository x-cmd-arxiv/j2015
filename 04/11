Inside a relativistically\nstrong laser field nonlinear effects in the laser amplitude can play an\nimportant role, as electrons and positrons interact nonperturbatively with the\ncoherent part of the photon field. Here, we calculate for the first time the\nleading-order contribution to the axial-vector--vector current-coupling tensor\ninside an arbitrary plane-wave laser field (which is taken into account exactly\nby employing the Furry picture). The current-coupling tensor appears in the\ncalculation of various electroweak processes inside strong laser fields like\nphoton emission or trident electron-positron pair production by a neutrino.\nMoreover, as we will see below, the axial-vector--vector current-coupling\ntensor contains the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly.

By contrast, the typical Voronoi cell shape,\nquantified by the Minkowski tensor anisotropy index $\\beta=\\beta_0^{2,0}$,\npoints towards a significant difference between random packings of spheres and\nthose of oblate ellipsoids. While the average cell shape $\\beta$ of all cells\nwith a given value of $\\phi_l$ is very similar in dense and loose jammed sphere\npackings, the structure of dense and loose ellipsoid packings differs\nsubstantially such that this does not hold true. This non-universality has\nimplications for our understanding of jamming of aspherical particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 16:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

However, conventional $v_2$ methods\nbased on one-dimensional (1D) azimuth correlations give inconsistent results\nand may include a jet contribution. In some cases the data trends appear to be\ninconsistent with hydrodynamic interpretations. In this study we distinguish\nseveral components of 2D angular correlations and isolate a nonjet (NJ) azimuth\nquadrupole denoted by $v_2\\{\\text{2D}\\}$. We establish systematic variations of\nthe NJ quadrupole on $y_t$, centrality and collision energy. We adopt\ntransverse rapidity $y_t$ as both a velocity measure and as a logarithmic\nalternative to transverse momentum $p_t$. Based on NJ quadrupole trends we\nderive a completely factorized universal parametrization of quantity\n$v_2\\{\\text{2D}\\}(y_t,b,\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ which describes the centrality, $y_t$\nand energy dependence. From $y_t$-differential $v_2(y_t)$ data we isolate a\nquadrupole spectrum and infer a quadrupole source boost having unexpected\nproperties. NJ quadrupole $v_2$ trends obtained with 2D model fits are\nremarkably simple. The centrality trend appear to be uncorrelated with a sharp\ntransition in jet-related structure that may indicate rapid change of Au-Au\nmedium properties. The lack of correspondence suggests that the NJ quadrupole\nmay be insensitive to such a medium.

Each subject is tested in four settings, given\nby combining the use of deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA medication. We\ndevelop two main feature-based representations of such signals, which are\nobtained by considering (i) the long-term correlations and multifractal\nproperties, and (ii) the power spectra. The feature-based representations are\ninitially utilized for the purpose of characterizing the subjects under\ndifferent settings. In agreement with previous studies, we show that deep brain\nstimulation does not significantly characterize neither of the two groups,\nregardless of the adopted representation.

ABDoradus is the main system of the ABDoradus moving group. It is a\nquadruple system formed by two widely separated binaries of pre-main-sequence\n(PMS) stars: ABDor A/C and ABDor Ba/Bb. The pair ABDor A/C has been extensively\nstudied and its dynamical masses have been determined with high precision, thus\nmaking of ABDor C a benchmark for calibrating PMS stellar models. If the orbit\nand dynamical masses of the pair ABDor Ba/Bb can be determined, they could not\nonly play a similar role to that of ABDor C in calibrating PMS models, but\nwould also help to better understand the dynamics of the whole ABDoradus\nsystem. Aims. We aim to determine the individual masses of the pair ABDor Ba/Bb\nusing VLBI observations and archive infrared data, as part of a larger program\ndirected to monitor binary systems in the ABDoradus moving group. Methods. We\nobserved the system ABDor B between 2007 and 2013 with the Australian Long\nBaseline Array (LBA), at a frequency of 8.4 GHz in phase-reference mode.\nResults. We detected, for the first time, compact radio emission from both\nstars in the binary, ABDor Ba and ABDor Bb. This result allowed us to determine\nthe orbital parameters of both the relative and absolute orbits and,\nconsequently, their individual dynamical masses: 0.28+/-0.05 Msun and\n0.25+/-0.05 Msun, respectively. Conclusions. Comparisons of the dynamical\nmasses with the prediction of PMS evolutionary models show that the models\nunderpredict the dynamical masses of the binary components Ba and Bb by 10-30%\nand 10-40%, respectively, although they all still agree at the 2-sigma level.\nSome of stellar models considered favour an age between 50 and 100 Myr for this\nsystem, meanwhile others predict older ages. We also discuss the evolutionary\nstatus of ABDor Ba/Bb in terms of an earlier double-double star scenario that\nmight explain the strong radio emission detected in both components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 19:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

At shorter wavelengths, the shape of the\ncurve is identical to that of the Calzetti relation, but with a lower\nnormalization (R_V). Hence, the new attenuation curve results in SFRs that are\n~20% lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained\nwith the Calzetti attenuation curve. Moreover, we find that the difference in\nthe reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellar\ncontinuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs\nlarger than 20 Msun/yr assuming a Chabrier IMF, the nebular emission lines\nsuffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum.

Second, exploiting these connections, we develop novel\n#SMT-based techniques to compute channel capacity, which achieve both accuracy\nand efficiency. These techniques are scalable to real-world programs, and\nillustrative case studies include C programs from Linux kernel, a Java program\nfrom a European project and anonymity protocols.\n  For formal verification, our contribution is also twofold.

Reservoir computing is an\napproach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time\ncomputing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a\ntime-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a\ndesired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the\ncomputational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated\nreadouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of\ninterconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal\namplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which\nimproves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number\nof output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small\nnetworks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform\ngeneration tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor\nof 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single\nmemristive networks are unable to produce the correct result.

We consider two realizations of spin-orbit coupling: the axial Rashba\ncoupling and balanced, effectively one-dimensional, Rashba-Dresselhaus one. In\nboth cases spin-dependent \"anomalous\" velocity, proportional to the spin-orbit\ncoupling strength, plays a crucial role. For the Rashba coupling, this velocity\nforms a centrifugal component in the density flux opposite to that arising due\nto the attraction between particles and prevents the collapse at a sufficiently\nstrong coupling. For the balanced Rashba-Dresselhaus coupling, the\nspin-dependent velocity can spatially split the initial state in one dimension\nand form spin-projected wavepackets, reducing the total condensate density.\nDepending on the spin-orbit coupling strength, interatomic attraction, and the\ninitial state, this splitting either prevents the collapse or modifies the\ncollapse process.

For quickly updating the classifier in such a\nsituation, incremental learning algorithms have been intensively studied in the\nliterature. Although they are much more efficient than solving the optimization\nproblem from scratch, their computational complexity yet depends on the entire\ntraining set size. It means that, if the original training set is large,\ncompletely solving an incremental learning problem might be still rather\nexpensive. To circumvent this computational issue, we propose a novel framework\nthat allows us to make an inference about the updated classifier without\nactually re-optimizing it. Specifically, the proposed framework can quickly\nprovide a lower and an upper bounds of a quantity on the unknown updated\nclassifier. The main advantage of the proposed framework is that the\ncomputational cost of computing these bounds depends only on the number of\nupdated instances. This property is quite advantageous in a typical sensitivity\nanalysis task where only a small number of instances are updated. In this paper\nwe demonstrate that the proposed framework is applicable to various practical\nsensitivity analysis tasks, and the bounds provided by the framework are often\nsufficiently tight for making desired inferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 13:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

Despite its\nsimple definition, the Subgraph Isomorphism problem turns out to be very broad,\nas it generalizes problems such as Clique, $r$-Coloring, Hamiltonicity, Set\nPacking and Bandwidth. However, for all of the mentioned problems\n$2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time algorithms exist, so a natural and frequently asked\nquestion in the past was whether there exists a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}$ time\nalgorithm for Subgraph Isomorphism. In the monograph of Fomin and Kratsch\n[Springer'10] this question is highlighted as an open problem, among few\nothers.\n  Our main result is a reduction from 3-SAT, producing a subexponential number\nof sublinear instances of the Subgraph Isomorphism problem. In particular, our\nreduction implies a $2^{\\Omega(n \\sqrt{\\log n})}$ lower bound for Subgraph\nIsomorphism under the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This shows that there exist\nclasses of graphs that are strictly harder to embed than cliques or Hamiltonian\ncycles.\n  The core of our reduction consists of two steps. First, we preprocess and\npack variables and clauses of a 3-SAT formula into groups of logarithmic size.\nHowever, the grouping is not arbitrary, since as a result we obtain only a\nlimited interaction between the groups. In the second step, we overcome the\ntechnical hardness of encoding evaluations as permutations by a simple, yet\nfruitful scheme of guessing the sizes of preimages of an arbitrary mapping,\nreducing the case of arbitrary mapping to bijections. In fact, when applying\nthis step to a recent independent result of Fomin et al.[arXiv:1502.05447\n(2015)], who showed hardness of Graph Homomorphism, we can transfer their\nhardness result to Subgraph Isomorphism, implying a nearly tight lower bound of\n$2^{\\Omega(n \\log n / \\log \\log n)}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 13:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

The mass-to-light ratio of Ret II within its half-light\nradius is 470 +/- 210 Msun/Lsun, demonstrating that it is a strongly dark\nmatter-dominated system.

The energy functional\nand constraint are discretized by either the finite difference, or sine or\nFourier pseudospectral discretization schemes and thus the original infinite\ndimensional nonconvex minimization problem is approximated by a finite\ndimensional constrained nonconvex minimization problem. Then an initial\nsolution is first constructed by using a feasible gradient type method, which\nis an explicit scheme and maintains the spherical constraint automatically. To\naccelerate the convergence of the gradient type method, we approximate the\nenergy functional by its second-order Taylor expansion with a regularized term\nat each Newton iteration and adopt a cascadic multigrid technique for selecting\ninitial data. It leads to a standard trust-region subproblem and we solve it\nagain by the feasible gradient type method. The convergence of the regularized\nNewton method is established by adjusting the regularization parameter as the\nstandard trust-region strategy. Extensive numerical experiments on challenging\nexamples, including a BEC in three dimensions with an optical lattice potential\nand rotating BECs in two dimensions with rapid rotation and strongly repulsive\ninteraction, show that our method is efficient, accurate and robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 15:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}
