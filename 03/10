A round nuclear ring forms exactly at the radius where the residual\nangular momentum of infalling gas balances the centrifugal force, which can be\ndescribed by a parameter $f_{\\rm ring}$ measured from the rotation curve.

An incomplete $d \\times N$ matrix is finitely rank-$r$ completable\nif there are at most finitely many rank-$r$ matrices that agree with all its\nobserved entries. Finite completability is the tipping point in LRMC, as a few\nadditional samples of a finitely completable matrix guarantee its unique\ncompletability. The main contribution of this paper is a deterministic sampling\ncondition for finite completability.

In\nthis way, collapse is only refined if it occurs along all three axes, ensuring\nthat the softening $\\epsilon$ is always of order twice the largest\ninter-particle spacing in a cell. This more conservative force softening\ncriterion is designed to minimise spurious two-body effects, while maintaining\nhigh force resolution in collapsed regions of the flow.

We introduce a new dual category of higher cooperads, a\nnew higher bar-cobar adjunction with the category of operads, and a new higher\nnotion of homotopy operads, for which we establish the relevant homotopy\nproperties. For instance, the higher bar-cobar construction provides us with a\ncofibrant replacement functor for operads over any ring.

Although automatic QC circumvents those issues, the\ntraditional methods results in high rates of false positives. Here, I propose a\nnovel approach to automatically QC oceanographic data based on the anomaly\ndetection technique. Multiple tests are combined into a single,\nmultidimensional criterion that learns the behavior of the good measurements,\nand identifies bad samples as outliers. When applied to 13 years of\nhydrographic profiles, the anomaly detection resulted in the best\nclassification performance, reducing the error by at least 50%. An open source\nPython package, CoTeDe, was developed to provide state of the art tools to\nquality control oceanographic data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 22:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 05:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Such\napproximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data\nanalysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although\nthe pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain\nscenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase\ntransitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the\napproximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future\nobservations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and\ntidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third\norder in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only\nweakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to\nthe isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in\nexplaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity\nvariation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the\nemergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not\naffect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in\ngravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an\nexplicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase\nin variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could\naffect their use in future X-ray observations.

Raman backscatter spectroscopy on similar surface regions exhibit\nspectra consistent with the literature results on bulk NbC but with\nsignificantly enhanced two-phonon scattering. The unprecedented strength and\nsharpness of the two-phonon signal has prompted a theoretical analysis, using\ndensity functional theory (DFT), of phonon modes in NbC for two different\ninterface models of the coherent precipitate. One model leads to overall\ncompressive strain and a comparison to ab-initio calculations of phonon\ndispersion curves under uniform compression of the NbC shows that the measured\ntwo-phonon peaks are linked directly to phonon anomalies arising from strong\nelectron-phonon interaction. Another model of the extended interface between Nb\nand NbC, studied by DFT, gives insight into the frequency shifts of the\nacoustic and optical mode density of states measured by first order Raman. The\nexact origin of the stronger two-phonon response is not known at present but it\nsuggests the possibility of enhanced electron-phonon coupling in transition\nmetal carbides under strain found either in the bulk NbC inclusions or at their\ninterfaces with Nb metal. Preliminary tunneling studies using a point contact\nmethod show some energy gaps larger than expected for bulk NbC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 23:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

We follow the gas from its origin as stellar winds of several\nobserved young massive stars, until it is either captured by the central black\nhole, or leaves the system. Unlike our previous models, we include an outflow\nfrom the inner accretion flow. Two different kinds of outflows are modelled:\n(i) an instantaneous-response feedback mode, in which the outflow rate is\ndirectly proportional to the current black hole gas capture rate; and (ii) an\noutburst mode, which is stronger but lasts for a limited time. The latter\nsituation may be particularly relevant to Sgr A*, since there is evidence that\nSgr A* was much brighter in the recent past.

We find that the iron\nmass fraction measured in the inner 0.15 R500 shows a larger dispersion across\nthe sample of low-mass clusters, than it does for the sample of high-mass\nclusters. We interpret this finding as the result of the mixing of more haloes\nin large clusters than in small clusters, which leads to an averaging of the\nmetal content in the large clusters, and thus less dispersion of metallicity\nfor high-mass clusters. This interpretation lends support to the idea that the\nlow-entropy, metal-rich gas of merging haloes reaches clusters' centers, which\nexplains observations of Core-Collapse Supernova products metallicity peaks,\nand which is seen in hydrodynamical simulations. The gas in these merging\nhaloes would have to reach the centers of clusters without mixing in the outer\nregions, in order to support our interpretation. On the other hand, metallicity\ndispersion does not change with mass in the outer regions of clusters,\nsuggesting that most of the outer metals come from a source with a more uniform\nmetallicity level, such as during pre-enrichment. We also measure a correlation\nbetween the metal content in low-mass clusters and the degree to which their\nIntra-Cluster Medium (ICM) is morphologically disturbed, as measured by\ncentroid shift.

The scales $\\sqrt{t_0}/a$ and $w_0/a$ and their tree-level\nimprovements, $\\sqrt{t_{0,{\\rm imp}}}$ and $w_{0,{\\rm imp}}$, are computed on\neach ensemble using Symanzik flow and the cloverleaf definition of the energy\ndensity $E$. Using a combination of continuum chiral-perturbation theory and a\nTaylor-series ansatz for the lattice-spacing and strong-coupling dependence,\nthe results are simultaneously extrapolated to the continuum and interpolated\nto physical quark masses. We determine the scales $\\sqrt{t_0} =\n0.1416({}_{-5}^{+8})$ fm and $w_0 = 0.1714({}_{-12}^{+15})$ fm, where the\nerrors are sums, in quadrature, of statistical and all systematic errors. The\nprecision of $w_0$ and $\\sqrt{t_0}$ is comparable to or more precise than the\nbest previous estimates, respectively. We then find the continuum mass\ndependence of $\\sqrt{t_0}$ and $w_0$, which will be useful for estimating the\nscales of new ensembles. We also estimate the integrated autocorrelation length\nof $\\langle E(t) \\rangle$. For long flow times, the autocorrelation length of\n$\\langle E \\rangle$ appears to be comparable to that of the topological charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 04:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 01:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 19:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 17:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

An important open question is whether this is a\nresult of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the\nlatter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in\nenvironmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in\nwhich replicators are explicitly coupled to their environment through the\nrecycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic,\nfirst-order phase transition from non-life to \"life,\" where the life phase is\ndistinguished by selection on replicators. We show that environmental coupling\nplays an important role in the dynamics of the transition. The transition\ncorresponds to a redistribution of matter in replicators and their environment,\ndriven by selection on replicators, exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity\nas replicators are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual\ninformation shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of\nsuccessfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete,\nleading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges.\nOften, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are\nultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's\npropensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of\nreplicators, characteristic of the transition from non-life to life. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for understanding life's emergence and\nevolutionary transitions more broadly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 05:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 23:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 05:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The mean EUDs (V10Gy, V20Gy) of the ipsilateral lung,\ncontralateral lung, esophagus, cord, liver, heart, and bronchus were 8.07 Gy\n(28.06, 13.17), 2.59 Gy (6.53, 1.18), 7.02 Gy (26.17, 12.32), 3.56 Gy (13.56,\n4.48), 0.72 Gy (2.15, 0.91), 5.14 Gy (19.68, 8.62), and 10.56 Gy (36.08,\n19.79), respectively. EUDs tended to decrease as OAR-PTV distance increased and\nOAR-PTV overlap volume decreased.

A renormalization of the partition algebras allows us to\nconsider the weak convergence as a simple convergence in a fixed space.

Using an improved triangular inequality\nfor the distance defined on partitions, we prove that the deformed partition\nalgebras, endowed with a deformation of the linear forms converge as N go to\ninfinity.

In addition, tight upper bounds are\nderived for the error probability for OSM systems with an arbitrary number of\ntransmit apertures as well as for convolutionally encoded signals. The\nperformance of OSM is compared to that of well established coherent FSO\nschemes, employing spatial diversity at the transmitter or the receiver only.\nSpecifically, it is shown that OSM can offer comparable performance with\nconventional coherent FSO schemes while outperforming the latter in terms of\nspectral efficiency and hardware complexity.

A central task is evaluation\nof a new policy given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and\nreceived rewards. The key challenge is that the past data typically does not\nfaithfully represent proportions of actions taken by a new policy. Previous\napproaches rely either on models of rewards or models of the past policy. The\nformer are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter have a large variance.

We identify a\nbuild-up to the ELM in which the VLD2 and VLD3 signals progressively align to\nthe phase at which ELMs preferentially occur, on a ~ 2 -5ms timescale. At the\nsame time, the VLD2 and VLD3 signals become phase synchronized with each other,\nconsistent with the emergence of coherent global dynamics in the integrated\ncurrent density. In a plasma that remains close to a global magnetic\nequilibrium, this can reflect bulk displacement or motion of the plasma. This\nbuild-up signature to an intrinsic ELM can be extracted from a time interval of\ndata that does not extend beyond the ELM occurrence time, so that these full\nflux loop signals could assist in ELM prediction or mitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 10:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

We systematically characterized\nthe \"reentrant condensation\" and the charge inversion of\npolyelectrolyte-decorated liposomes by means of dynamic light scattering and\nelectrophoresis. We explored the stability of this model\npolyelectrolyte/colloid system by fixing each time the charge of the bare\nliposomes and by changing two independent control parameters of the\nsuspensions: the polyelectrolyte/colloid charge ratio and the ionic strength of\nthe aqueous suspending medium. The progressive addition of neutral DOPC lipid\nwithin the liposome membrane gave rise to a new intriguing phenomenon: the\nstability diagram of the suspensions showed a novel reentrance due to the\ncrossing of the desorption threshold of the polyelectrolyte. Indeed, at fixed\ncharge density of the bare DOTAP/DOPC liposomes and for a wide range of polyion\nconcentrations, we showed that the simple electrolyte addition first (low salt\nregime) destabilizes the suspensions because of the enhanced screening of the\nresidual repulsion between the complexes, and then (high salt regime)\ndetermines the onset of a new stable phase, originated by the absence of\npolyelectrolyte adsorption on the particle surfaces.

The\nelectronic structure is modelled with the help of a full-potential linear\nmuffin-tin orbital method. The effects of strong electron correlations are\nconsidered within the charge self-consistent density functional theory plus\ndynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT). The exchange parameters are then\nextracted using the magnetic force theorem, hence all the calculations are\nperformed within a single computational framework. The method allows to\ninvestigate how the $J_{ij}$-parameters are affected by dynamical electron\ncorrelations. In addition to describing the formalism and details of the\nimplementation, we also present magnetic properties of a few commonly discussed\nsystems, characterised by different degrees of electron localisation. In bcc Fe\nwe found a minor renormalisation of the $J_{ij}$ interactions once the\ndynamical correlations are introduced. However, generally, if the magnetic\ncoupling has several competing contributions from different orbitals, the\nredistribution of the spectral weight and changes in the exchange splitting of\nthese states can lead to a dramatic modification of the total interaction\nparameter.

Unfortunately,\ntypical positioning techniques based on ranging or on velocity and angular\nmeasurements are inherently limited. To overcome the limitations of specific\npositioning techniques, the fusion of multiple and heterogeneous sensor\ninformation is an appealing strategy. In this paper, we investigate the\nfundamental performance of linear fusion of multiple measurements of the\nposition of mobile nodes, and propose a new distributed recursive position\nestimator. The Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds for the parametric and a-posteriori\ncases are investigated. The proposed estimator combines information coming from\nranging, speed, and angular measurements, which is jointly fused by a Pareto\noptimization problem where the mean and the variance of the localization error\nare simultaneously minimized. A distinguished feature of the method is that it\nassumes a very simple dynamical model of the mobility and therefore it is\napplicable to a large number of scenarios providing good performance. The main\nchallenge is the characterization of the statistical information needed to\nmodel the Fisher information matrix and the Pareto optimization problem. The\nproposed analysis is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, and the performance\nis compared to several Kalman-based filters, commonly employed for localization\nand sensor fusion. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator\noutperforms the traditional approaches that are based on the extended Kalman\nfilter when no assumption on the model of motion is used. In such a scenario,\nbetter performance is achieved by the proposed method, but at the price of an\nincreased computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 12:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We\ninvestigate collisional equilibration dynamics of this new state of molecular\ngases, and find that it follows a remarkable generic scenario. The route to\nequilibrium starts with a durable metastable 'gyroscopic stage', in the course\nof which the molecules maintain their fast rotation and orientation of the\nangular momentum through many collisions. The inhibited\nrotational-translational relaxation is characterized by a persistent anisotropy\nin the molecular angular distribution, and is manifested in the long-lasting\noptical birefringence, and anisotropic diffusion in the gas. After a certain\ninduction time, the 'gyroscopic stage' is abruptly terminated by a\nself-accelerating explosive rotational-translational energy exchange leading\nthe gas towards the final thermal equilibrium. We illustrate our conclusions by\ndirect Molecular Dynamics simulation of super-rotors in several gases\nconsisting of common linear molecules (such as N_2, O_2 and CO_2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 12:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

In the optical and X-ray\nregion, NGC 1275 also shows a bright core, but their origin has not been\nunderstood, since a disk emission is not ruled out. In fact, NGC 1275 exhibits\noptical broad emission lines and a X-ray Fe-K line, which are typical for\nSeyfert galaxies. In our precious studies of NGC 1275 with Suzaku/XIS, no X-ray\ntime variability was found from 2006 to 2011, regardless of moderate gamma-ray\nvariability observed by {it Fermi}-LAT~\\cite{Yamazaki}.

If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforward\ncascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus'\nprofile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains many\nfeedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the ones\nrepresenting the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currents\nare generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and therefore\nconstitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of the\ninput/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptive\nfield. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, from\nspike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs from\nnearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive field (filtering\nall input currents) and the effective receptive field (filtering only external\nstimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysical\nproperties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spike\ngeneration, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as the\nexternal stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate that\nspike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-pass\nprocessing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators. For strong\nfeedback, a sharp resonance in the spectral neuronal selectivity may appear.\nOur results provide a unified framework to interpret a collection of previous\nexperimental studies where specific feedback mechanisms were shown to modify\nthe filtering properties of neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

Starting from basic mechanics principles, we calculate the work that\nthe diver must provide through propulsion to counterbalance the action of drag,\nthe buoyant force and weight during immersion. Compared to those in previous\nstudies, the model presented here accurately analyses breath-hold divers which\nalternate active swimming with prolonged glides during the dive (as is the case\nin mammals). The energy cost of the dive is strongly dependent on these\nprolonged gliding phases. Here we investigate the length and impacts on energy\ncost of these glides with respect to the diver characteristics, and compare\nthem with those observed in different breath-hold diving species. Taking into\naccount the basal metabolic rate and chemical energy to propulsion\ntransformation efficiency, we calculate optimal swim velocity and the\ncorresponding total energy cost (including metabolic rate) and compare them\nwith observations. Energy cost is minimised when the diver passes through\nneutral buoyancy conditions during the dive. This generally implies the\npresence of prolonged gliding phases in both ascent and descent, where the\nbuoyancy (varying with depth) is best used against the drag, reducing energy\ncost. This is in agreement with past results (Miller et al., 2012; Sato et al.,\n2013) where, when the buoyant force is considered constant during the dive, the\nenergy cost was minimised for neutral buoyancy. In particular, our model\nconfirms the good physical adaption of dolphins for diving, compared to other\nbreath-hold diving species which are mostly positively buoyant (penguins for\nexample). The presence of prolonged glides implies a non-trivial dependency of\noptimal speed on maximal depth of the dive. This extends previous findings\n(Sato et al., 2010; Watanabe et al., 2011) which found no dependency of optimal\nspeed on dive depth for particular conditions. The energy cost of the dive can\nbe further diminished by reducing the volume of gas-filled body parts in divers\nclose to neutral buoyancy. This provides a possible additional explanation for\nthe observed exhalation of air before diving in phocid seals to minimise dive\nenergy cost. Until now the only explanation for this phenomenon has been a\nreduction in the risk of decompression sickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 14:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 09:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 12:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

A key factor in promoting the\ntransition is also to reward those who contribute to pool punishment, yet not\nabstaining from participation. Reward funds eventually vanish in raising pool\npunishment, which is sustainable by punishing the second-order free riders.\nThis suggests that considering the interdependence of reward and punishment may\nhelp to better understand the origins and transitions of social norms and\ninstitutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

PMMA/3-octanone has a UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) which\npresents a critical point at temperature Tc = 306.6 K and volume fraction\n$\\phi$c = 12.8 % [Crauste et al., ArXiv 1310.6720, 2012]. This oscillatory\nphenomenon appears because of thermophoretic and electrostriction effects and\nnon-linear diffusion. We analyze these oscillations and we propose a simple\nmodel which includes the minimal ingredients to produce the oscillatory\nbehavior. Phase transitions in binary mixtures are still a widely studied\nsubject, specifically near the critical point where several interesting and not\ncompletely understood phenomena may appear, among them we recall the critical\nCasimir forces [2],[3], confinement effects [4], [5] and out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics after a quench. The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of\nexternal fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For\nexample, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures\nbecause the radiation pressure can deform the interface between the two phases\nand it can be used to measure the interface tension [7]. Depending on the\nnature of the binary mixtures, laser illumination can also lead to a mixing or\ndemixing transition. In ref.[8], focused infrared laser light heats the medium\ninitially in the homogeneous phase and causes a separation in the LCST (Low\nCritical Solution Temperature) system. The radiation pressure gradients in a\nlaser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a\nphase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which\nattract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other\nforces like electrostriction can also be involved [10]. In this letter, we\nreport a new phenomenon, which consists in an oscillating phase transition\ninduced by a constant illumination from an infrared laser beam in the\nheterogeneous region of an UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) binary\nmixture. Oscillation phenomena in phase transition have already been reported\nin slow cooling UCST [11],[12] but as far as we know, never induced by a\nstationary laser illumination. After describing our experimental setup , we\nwill present the results.

By analogy\nwith Moran's index newly expressed in a spatial quadratic form and by means of\nmathematical reasoning, I derive a theoretical framework for geographical\ncrosscorrelation analysis. First, two sets of spatial crosscorrelation\ncoefficients are defined, including a global spatial crosscorrelation\ncoefficient and a set of local spatial crosscorrelation coefficients. Second, a\npair of scatterplots of spatial crosscorrelation is proposed, and different\nscatterplots show different relationships between correlated variables. Based\non the spatial crosscorrelation coefficient, Pearson's correlation coefficient\ncan be decomposed into two parts: direct correlation (partial crosscorrelation)\nand indirect correlation (spatial crosscorrelation). As an example, the\nanalytical process is applied to the relationships between China's urbanization\nand economic development. Spatial crosscorrelation and spatial autocorrelation\ncan complement one another, and the spatial crosscorrelation scatterplots can\nbe used to reveal the causality inside a self-organized system.

This results in what is called dimension dilemma. In\nparticular, the gravity model based on power law could not be derived from\ngeneral principles by traditional ways. Consequently, a negative exponential\nfunction substituted for the inverse power function to serve for a\ndistance-decay function for the gravity model. However, the exponential-based\ngravity model goes against the first law of geography. This paper is devoted to\nsolve these kinds of problems by mathematical reasoning and empirical analysis.\nFirst, it can be proved that the distance exponent of the gravity model is\nessentially a fractal dimension. Thus the dimensional dilemma of the\npower-based gravity model can be resolved using the concepts from fractal\ngeometry. Second, the exponential function indicates locality and localization,\nwhich violates the basic principle of spatial interaction. The power function\nimplies action at a distance, which is the necessary condition of geographical\ngravitation. Third, the gravity model based on power law decay can be derived\nfrom the entropy- maximizing principle by introducing a proper postulate. The\nobservational data of China's cities and regions are employed to verify the\ntheoretical inferences, and the results support power-law distance decay. A\nconclusion can be reached that the preferred form of geographical gravity model\nis its original form, which is based on an inverse power law rather than a\nnegative exponential law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 14:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

Rb, Sr, Zr, and Ba are produced by both the s- and\nr-process. The s-process contribution by spinstars is the same as in our\nprevious papers. Results. NSM that merge in less than 10 Myr or NSM combined\nwith a source of r-process generated by massive stars can explain the spread of\n[Eu/Fe] in the Galactic halo. The combination of r-process production by NSM\nand s-process production by spinstars is able to reproduce the available\nobservational data for Sr, Zr and Ba. We also show the first predictions for Rb\nin the Galactic halo. Conclusions. We confirm previous results that either NSM\nwith very short time scale or both NSM and at least a fraction of SNII should\nhave contributed to the synthesis of Eu in the Galaxy. The r-process production\nby NSM - complemented by an s-process production by spinstars - provide results\ncompatible with our previous findings based on other r-process sites. We\ncritically discuss the weak and strong points of both NSM and SNII scenarios\nfor producing Eu and eventually suggest that the best solution is probably a\nmixed one in which both sources produce Eu. In fact, this scenario better\nreproduces the scatter observed in all the studied elements.

In the case of live streaming this task becomes particularly\nchallenging. An important factor than might help improving performance is the\ncapability to correctly predict network throughput dynamics on short to medium\ntimescales. It becomes notably difficult in wireless networks that are often\nsubject to continuous throughput fluctuations.\n  In the present work, we develop an adaptation algorithm for HTTP-Based\nAdaptive Live Streaming that, for each adaptation decision, maximizes a\nQoE-based utility function depending on the probability of playback\ninterruptions, average video quality, and the amount of video quality\nfluctuations. To compute the utility function the algorithm leverages\nthroughput predictions, and dynamically estimated prediction accuracy.\n  We are trying to close the gap created by the lack of studies analyzing TCP\nthroughput on short to medium timescales. We study several time series\nprediction methods and their error distributions. We observe that Simple Moving\nAverage performs best in most cases. We also observe that the relative\nunderestimation error is best represented by a truncated normal distribution,\nwhile the relative overestimation error is best represented by a Lomax\ndistribution. Moreover, underestimations and overestimations exhibit a temporal\ncorrelation that we use to further improve prediction accuracy.\n  We compare the proposed algorithm with a baseline approach that uses a fixed\nmargin between past throughput and selected media bit rate, and an oracle-based\napproach that has perfect knowledge over future throughput for a certain time\nhorizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 15:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 13:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 15:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

Dykstra's algorithm is the\ncentral step in and the computationally most expensive part of statistical\nmulti-resolution methods. It projects a given vector onto the intersection of\nconvex sets. Compared with a CPU implementation our CUDA implementation is one\norder of magnitude faster. For a further speed up and to reduce memory\nconsumption we have developed a new variant, which we call incomplete Dykstra's\nalgorithm. Implemented in CUDA it is one order of magnitude faster than the\nCUDA implementation of the standard Dykstra algorithm. As sample application we\ndiscuss using the incomplete Dykstra's algorithm as preprocessor for the\nrecently developed super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) method\n(Dertinger et al. 2009). We show that statistical multi-resolution estimation\ncan enhance the resolution improvement of the plain SOFI algorithm just as the\nFourier-reweighting of SOFI. The results are compared in terms of their power\nspectrum and their Fourier ring correlation (Saxton and Baumeister 1982). The\nFourier ring correlation indicates that the resolution for typical second order\nSOFI images can be improved by about 30 per cent. Our results show that a\ncareful parallelization of Dykstra's algorithm enables its use in large-scale\nstatistical multi-resolution analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 09:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

We\nshow that every polynomial $W_n(x)$ is distinct-real-rooted, and that the roots\nof the polynomial $W_n(x)$ interlace the roots of the polynomial $W_{n-1}(x)$.\nWe find that, as $n\\to\\infty$, the sequence of smallest roots of the\npolynomials $W_n(x)$ converges decreasingly to a real number, and that the\nsequence of largest roots converges increasingly to a real number. Moreover, by\nusing the Dirichlet approximation theorem, we prove that there is a number to\nwhich, for every positive integer $i\\ge2$, the sequence of $i$th smallest roots\nof the polynomials $W_n(x)$ converges. Similarly, there is a number to which,\nfor every positive integer $i\\ge2$, the sequence of $i$th largest roots of the\npolynomials $W_n(x)$ converges. It turns out that these two convergence points\nare independent of the numbers $t$ and $r$, as well as $i$. We derive explicit\nexpressions for these four limit points, and we determine completely when some\nof these limit points coincide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 02:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

The Ehrenfest equation for strained solids is generalized to an\narbitrary temperature. Far from 0 K (in contrast to the situation near 0 K) the\nphase transition temperature derivative with respect to uniaxial pressure\ndepends on the temperature expansion coefficient of an ' effective' volume. For\nRochelle salt strained by a uniaxial pressure at room temperature the\npredominant contribution into this dependence is made by the coefficient A. At\nthe second order phase transition under uniaxial pressure the 'effective' (but\nnot true) volume is the continuous function of the temperature. The Ehrenfest\nequation for solids strained by hydrostatic pressure can be presented as a sum\nof three linear parts proportional to the crystal linear thermal expansion\ncoefficients along the axes a, b, c. These parts are equal to the second order\ntransition temperature derivative with respect to hydrostatic (but not\nuniaxial) pressure,\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 08:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}
