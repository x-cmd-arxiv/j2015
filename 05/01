A key example is\nthe tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state\npreparation in ion trap experiments \\cite{Haffner2005}. Since full tomography\nbecomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to\ninvestigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior\ninformation about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such\nmodels. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient\nestimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist\nin first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to\nan appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues\nbelow a certain \"noise level\" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or\nnormalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the\nspace dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as\n$r\\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples. Furthermore we establish a\nlower bound for the asymptotic minimax risk which shows that the above scaling\nis optimal. The performance of the estimators is analysed in an extensive\nsimulations study, with emphasis on the dependence on the state rank, and the\nnumber of measurement repetitions. We find that all estimators perform\nsignificantly better that the least squares, with the \"physical estimator\"\n(which is a bona fide density matrix) slightly outperforming the other\nestimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 16:31:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The power-spectral\ndensity (PSD) of GRO J1655-40 shows a bending power-law shape, similar to that\nof canonical soft states albeit with larger fractional rms.

Instead, we suggest that the PSD shape is intrinsic to the\nvariability process and may be linked to the evolution of the scale-height in a\nslim disc.

The multi-band observations span from the\nnear-ultraviolet through the optical (F275W, F336W, F438W, F555W, and F814W).\nThe apparent brightness of the echo at the time was ~21--22 mag in all of these\nbands. The echo appears circular, although less obviously as a ring, with an\ninhomogeneous surface brightness, in particular, a prominent enhanced\nbrightness to the southeast. The SN itself was still detectable, particularly\nin the redder bands. We are able to model the light echo as the time-integrated\nSN light scattered off of diffuse interstellar dust in the SN environment. We\nhave assumed that this dust is analogous to that in the Milky Way with R_V=3.1.\nThe SN light curves that we consider also include models of the unobserved\nearly burst of light from the SN shock breakout. Our analysis of the echo\nsuggests that the distance from the SN to the scattering dust elements along\nthe echo is ~45 pc. The implied visual extinction for the echo-producing dust\nis consistent with estimates made previously from the SN itself. Finally, our\nestimate of the SN brightness in F814W is fainter than that measured for the\nred supergiant star at the precise SN location in pre-SN images, possibly\nindicating that the star has vanished and confirming it as the likely SN\nprogenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-01"}

We concentrate on the first ionization potential (FIP)\neffect observed in the solar corona and slow-speed wind, and in the coronae of\nsolar-like dwarf stars, and the \"inverse FIP\" effect seen in the corona of\nstars of later spectral type; specifically M dwarfs. These effects relate to\nthe enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect\nto photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV. They are\ninterpreted in terms of the ponderomotive force due to the propagation and/or\nreflection of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the chromosphere. This acts on\nchromospheric ions, but not neutrals, and so can lead to ion-neutral\nfractionation.\n  A detailed description of the model applied to closed magnetic loops, and to\nopen field regions is given, accounting for the observed difference in solar\nFIP fractionation between the slow and fast wind. It is shown that such a model\ncan also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind. The\nhelium depletion is sensitive to the chromospheric altitude where ion-neutral\nseparation occurs, and the behavior of the helium abundance in the closed\nmagnetic loop strongly suggests that the waves have a coronal origin. This, and\nother similar inferences may be expected to have a strong bearing on theories\nof solar coronal heating.\n  Chromospheric waves originating from below as acoustic waves mode convert,\nmainly to fast mode waves, can also give rise to ion-neutral separation.\nDepending on the geometry of the magnetic field, this can result in FIP or\nInverse FIP effects. We argue that such configurations are more likely to occur\nin later-type stars (known to have stronger field in any case), and that this\nexplains the occurrence of the Inverse FIP effect in M dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

We study\nthe relationship between the weight function, bidders' private values, number\nof bidders, and the seller's revenue in equilibrium. It has been shown that if\none bidder has a much higher private value than the others, then a nearly flat\nweight function maximizes revenue. Essentially, threatening the bidder who has\nthe highest valuation with having to share the allocation maximizes the\nrevenue.

In this paper we show that if $X$ is a $G$-like\ncontinuum for some finite graph $G$ and $f:X \\rightarrow X$ is any map with\npositive topological entropy, then $\\varprojlim (X,f)$ contains an\nindecomposable continuum. As a corollary, we obtain that in the case that $f$\nis a homeomorphism, $X$ contains an indecomposable continuum. Moreover, if $f$\nhas uniformly positive upper entropy, then $X$ is an indecomposable continuum.\nOur results answer some questions raised by Mouron and generalize the above\nmentioned work of Mouron and also that of Barge and Diamond. We also introduce\na new concept called zigzag pair which attempts to capture the complexity of a\ndynamical systems from the continuum theoretic perspective and facilitates the\nproof of the main result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 18:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-01"}

For all the above problems, we\nimprove upon the previous best algorithm (by Henzinger et. al.

The\nclassical algorithm of Even and Shiloach (JACM 81) solved this problem in\n$O(1)$ query time and $O(mn)$ total update time. Recently, Henzinger,\nKrinninger and Nanongkai (STOC 2014) designed a randomized algorithm which\nachieves an update time of $\\tilde{O}(m n^{0.98})$ and broke the long-standing\n$O(mn)$ bound of Even and Shiloach. However, they designed four algorithms $A_i\n(1\\le i \\le 4)$ such that for graphs having total number of edges between $m_i$\nand $m_{i+1}$ ($m_{i+1} > m_i$), $A_i$ outperforms other three algorithms. That\nis, one of the four algorithms may be faster for a particular density range of\nedges, but it may be too slow asymptotically for the other ranges.

IP protocols have applications in areas such as verifiable computation\noutsourcing, computation delegation, cloud computing. In these applications,\nthe verifier may pay the prover based on the quality of his work. Rational\ninteractive proofs (RIP), introduced by Azar and Micali (2012), are an\ninteractive-proof system with payments, in which the prover is rational rather\nthan untrustworthy---he may lie, but only to increase his payment. Rational\nproofs leverage the provers' rationality to obtain simple and efficient\nprotocols. Azar and Micali show that RIP=IP(=PSAPCE). They leave the question\nof whether multiple provers are more powerful than a single prover for rational\nand classical proofs as an open problem.\n  In this paper, we introduce multi-prover rational interactive proofs (MRIP).\nHere, a verifier cross-checks the provers' answers with each other and pays\nthem according to the messages exchanged. The provers are cooperative and\nmaximize their total expected payment if and only if the verifier learns the\ncorrect answer to the problem. We further refine the model of MRIP to\nincorporate utility gap, which is the loss in payment suffered by provers who\nmislead the verifier to the wrong answer.\n  We define the class of MRIP protocols with constant, noticeable and\nnegligible utility gaps. We give tight characterization for all three MRIP\nclasses. We show that under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions, MRIP is\nmore powerful than both RIP and MIP ; and this is true even the utility gap is\nrequired to be constant. Furthermore the full power of each MRIP class can be\nachieved using only two provers and three rounds. (A preliminary version of\nthis paper appeared at ITCS 2016.

Recently,\nseveral new classes of quantum phases of matter, such as topological orders and\nsymmetry protected topological (SPT) orders, were discovered. In an attempt to\naddress the transitions between all those phases of quantum matter under the\nsame framework, we introduced an analogous yet very simple picture for phase\ntransitions in the context of tensor-networks. Using a very simple iteration\nprocess, we found that both symmetry breaking and some topological phase\ntransitions (for topological orders described by gauge theory and 1D SPT\norders) could be marked by a sudden change in the symmetry structure of the\nso-called \"environment matrix\". In this process, the environment matrix serves\nas an \"order parameter\" that captures patterns of entanglement in topological\nphases. The symmetry change in the environment matrix is very much like the\nsymmetry breaking of conventional order parameters. We applied this method to\nboth the transverse Ising model (1D and 2D honeycomb), spin-1 model (1D), and\nthe Toric Code model in a magnetic field (2D honeycomb), and explored the\ncorresponding symmetry structure changes in their environment matrices in\ndetails.

Perhaps the most promising model associates the QPO with\nLense-Thirring precession of the inner accretion flow, with the changes in\nviewing angle and Doppler boosting modulating the flux over the course of a\nprecession cycle. Here, we consider the polarization signature of a precessing\ninner accretion flow. We use simple assumptions about the Comptonization\nprocess generating the emitted spectrum and take all relativistic effects into\naccount, parallel transporting polarization vectors towards the observer along\nnull geodesics in the Kerr metric. We find that both the degree of linear\npolarization and the polarization angle should be modulated on the QPO\nfrequency. We calculate the predicted absolute rms variability amplitude of the\npolarization degree and angle for a specific model geometry. We find that it\nshould be possible to detect these modulations for a reasonable fraction of\nparameter space with a future X-ray polarimeter such as NASA's Polarization\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array (PolSTAR: the satellite incarnation of the recent\nballoon experiment X-Calibur).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 20:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

Such algorithms\nare probabilistic in that they compute a path by connecting independently and\nidentically distributed random points in the configuration space. Their\nrandomization aspect, however, makes several tasks challenging, including\ncertification for safety-critical applications and use of offline computation\nto improve real-time execution. Hence, an important open question is whether\nsimilar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be\nobtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random sampling sequences.\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question.\nSpecifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning\nparameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is\ndeterministically asymptotically optimal. Second, we characterize the\nconvergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very\nexplicitly upper-bounded in terms of the l2-dispersion of the sampling sequence\nand the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal\nversion of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close\nto O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the\nsequence. This is in stark contrast to the O(n logn) complexity results for\nexisting asymptotically-optimal probabilistic planners. Finally, through\nnumerical experiments, we show that planning with deterministic low-dispersion\nsampling generally provides superior performance in terms of path cost and\nsuccess rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 20:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 06:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

However, the dynamics of these flames is still not\nwell-understood. RT unstable flames are affected by both the RT instability of\nthe flame front and by RT-generated turbulence. The coexistence of these\nfactors complicates the choice of flame speed subgrid models for full-star Type\nIa simulations. Both processes can stretch and wrinkle the flame surface,\nincreasing its area and, therefore, the burning rate. In past research, subgrid\nmodels have been based on either the RT instability or turbulence setting the\nflame speed. We evaluate both models, checking their assumptions and their\nability to correctly predict the turbulent flame speed. Specifically, we\nanalyze a large parameter study of 3D direct numerical simulations of RT\nunstable model flames. This study varies both the simulation domain width and\nthe gravity in order to probe a wide range of flame behaviors. We show that RT\nunstable flames are different from traditional turbulent flames: they are\nthinner, rather than thicker when turbulence is stronger. We also show that\nnone of several different types of turbulent flame speed models accurately\npredicts measured flame speeds. In addition, we find that the RT flame speed\nmodel only correctly predicts the measured flame speed in a certain parameter\nregime.

On phase diagrams, stochastic dynamical systems (DSs)\nexhibiting this type of dynamics belong to the finite-width phase (N-phase for\nbrevity) that precedes ordinary chaotic behavior and that is known under such\nnames as noise-induced chaos, self-organized criticality, dynamical complexity\n\\emph{etc.} Within the recently formulated approximation-free supersymemtric\ntheory of stochastics, the N-phase can be roughly interpreted as the\nnoise-induced \"overlap\" between integrable and chaotic deterministic dynamics.\nAs a result, the N-phase dynamics inherits the properties of the both. Here, we\nanalyze this unique set of properties and conclude that the N-phase DSs must\nnaturally be the most efficient optimizers: on one hand, N-phase DSs have\nintegrable flows with well-defined attractors that can be associated with\ncandidate solutions and, on the other hand, the noise-induced\nattractor-to-attractor dynamics in the N-phase is effectively chaotic or\na-periodic so that a DS must avoid revisiting solutions/attractors thus\naccelerating the search for the best solution. Based on this understanding, we\npropose a method for stochastic dynamical optimization using the N-phase DSs.\nThis method can be viewed as a hybrid of the simulated and chaotic annealing\nmethods.

This popular approach has two major shortcomings. First,\nalthough the PPP model may be a fitting one for the BS locations, it is less\nadequate for the UE locations mainly due to the fact that the model is not\nadjustable (tunable) to represent the severity of the heterogeneity\n(non-uniformity) in the UE locations. Besides, the independence assumption\nbetween the two PPPs does not capture the often-observed correlation between\nthe UE and BS locations.\n  This paper presents a novel heterogeneous spatial traffic modeling which\nallows statistical adjustment. Simple and non-parameterized, yet sufficiently\naccurate, measures for capturing the traffic characteristics in space are\nintroduced. Only two statistical parameters related to the UE distribution,\nnamely, the coefficient of variation (the normalized second-moment), of an\nappropriately defined inter-UE distance measure, and correlation coefficient\n(the normalized cross-moment) between UE and BS locations, are adjusted to\ncontrol the degree of heterogeneity and the bias towards the BS locations,\nrespectively. This model is used in heterogeneous wireless cellular networks\n(HetNets) to demonstrate the impact of heterogeneous and BS-correlated traffic\non the network performance. This network is called HetHetNet since it has two\ntypes of heterogeneity: heterogeneity in the infrastructure (supply), and\nheterogeneity in the spatial traffic distribution (demand).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 02:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

Given the sheer size of such social networks, many\nexisting studies resort to sampling techniques that draw random nodes from an\nonline social network through its restrictive web/API interface. Almost all of\nthem use the exact same underlying technique of random walk - a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo based method which iteratively transits from one node to its random\nneighbor.\n  Random walk fits naturally with this problem because, for most online social\nnetworks, the only query we can issue through the interface is to retrieve the\nneighbors of a given node (i.e., no access to the full graph topology). A\nproblem with random walks, however, is the \"burn-in\" period which requires a\nlarge number of transitions/queries before the sampling distribution converges\nto a stationary value that enables the drawing of samples in a statistically\nvalid manner.\n  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of speeding up the fundamental\ndesign of random walks (i.e., reducing the number of queries it requires)\nwithout changing the stationary distribution it achieves - thereby enabling a\nmore efficient \"drop-in\" replacement for existing sampling-based analytics\ntechniques over online social networks. Our main idea is to leverage the\nhistory of random walks to construct a higher-ordered Markov chain. We develop\ntwo algorithms, Circulated Neighbors and Groupby Neighbors Random Walk (CNRW\nand GNRW) and prove that, no matter what the social network topology is, CNRW\nand GNRW offer better efficiency than baseline random walks while achieving the\nsame stationary distribution.

To realize the potential advantage of OFDM-IDMA, two\nchallenges must be addressed. The first challenge is the estimation of multiple\nchannel parameters. An issue is how to contain the estimation errors of the\nchannel parameters of the multiple users, considering that the overall\nestimation errors may increase with the number of users because the estimations\nof their channel parameters are intertwined with each other. The second\nchallenge is that the transmitters of the multiple users may be driven by\ndifferent RF oscillators. The associated frequency asynchrony may cause\nmultiple CFOs at the receiver. Compared with a single-user receiver where the\nsingle CFO can be compensated away, a particular difficulty for a multiuser\nreceiver is that it is not possible to compensate for all the multiple CFOs\nsimultaneously. To tackle the two challenges, we put forth a framework to solve\nthe problems of multiuser channel-parameter estimation, CFO compensation, and\nchannel decoding jointly and iteratively. The framework employs the space\nalternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algortihm to decompose\nthe multisuser problem into multiple single-user problems, and the\nexpectation-conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to tackle each of the\nsingle-user subproblems.

This allows one to directly probe the interlayer\ninteractions in multilayer samples. Graphene and other two-dimensional (2d)\ncrystals can be combined to form various hybrids and heterostructures, creating\nmaterials on demand with properties determined by the interlayer interaction.\nThis is the case even for a single material, where multilayer stacks with\ndifferent relative orientation have different optical and electronic\nproperties. In twisted multilayer graphene samples there is a significant\nenhancement of the C modes due to resonance with new optically allowed\nelectronic transitions, determined by the relative orientation of the layers.\nHere we show that this applies also to the LBMs, that can be now directly\nmeasured at room temperature. We find that twisting does not affect LBMs, quite\ndifferent from the case of the C modes. This implies that the periodicity\nmismatch between two twisted layers mostly affects shear interactions.

In a cellular network, D2D allows not only direct communication between\nusers, but also device relaying. In this paper, a simple instance of\ndevice-relaying is investigated, and the impact of D2D on fairness among users\nis studied. Namely, a cellular network consisting of two D2D-enabled users and\na base-station (BS) is considered. Thus, the users who want to establish\ncommunication with the BS can act as relays for each other's signals. While\nthis problem is traditionally considered in the literature as a multiple-access\nchannel with cooperation in the uplink, and a broadcast channel with\ncooperation in the downlink, we propose a different treatment of the problem as\na multi-way channel. A simple communication scheme is proposed, and is shown to\nachieve significant gain in terms of fairness (measured by the symmetric rate\nsupported) in comparison to the aforementioned traditional treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 08:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

This paper re-examines the experiment\nresults according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting\nkappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement, always in the range\n0.09-0.42 has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor\nor, in a few cases, as, at most, fair.

The theory\nimproves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the\nlanguage, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results.\nThe proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models that find\nintuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. Secondly, I\npropose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which\nexplicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work\nwith Pulman). A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of\nvector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. Extensive\nexperimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more\naccurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al. in\nparticular and every other class of compositional models in general. As a last\ncontribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the\ncontext of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum\nmechanics (joint work with Coecke). In the proposed extension, the concept of a\ndistributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which\ncompactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different\nmeanings of the specific word. Composition takes the form of quantum\nmeasurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and\nlinguistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 10:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

Since this rescaling applies equally to all the\nphysical quantities, physics must be invariant under a disformal\ntransformation, that is, neither causal structure, propagation speed nor any\nother property of the fields are affected by a disformal transformation itself.\nThis fact is presented at the action level for gravitational and matter fields\nand it is illustrated with some examples of observable quantities. We also find\nthe physical invariance for cosmological perturbations at linear and high\norders in perturbation, extending previous studies. Finally, a comparison with\nHorndeski and beyond Horndeski theories under a disformal transformation is\nmade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 13:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 06:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

We provide an explicit relation between the\nparameters of our model at the frontier between these states.

The illumination of a cantilever end causes an asymmetric\ndiffraction pattern at the photodetector that significantly affects the\ncalibration of the signal in the popular optical beam deflection technique\n(OBDT). Conditions for optimized linear signals that avoid detection artifacts\nconflict with small numerical aperture illumination and narrow cantilevers\nwhich are softer and therefore more sensitive.

In\nsuch approaches, the source is reconstructed analytically, using a subset of a\ncomplete and orthonormal set of basis functions, known as shapelets. To\ncalculate the flux in an image plane pixel, the pixel is split into two or more\ntriangles (depending on the local magnification), and each shapelet basis\nfunction is integrated over the source plane. Source regularization\n(enforcement of priors on the source) can also be performed analytically.

In\nprevious work, we have introduced a clustering algorithm referred to as\n\"seedless clustering,\" and shown that it is a powerful tool for detecting weak\nlong-lived (10-1000s) signals in background. However, as the algorithm is\ncurrently conceived, in order to carry out an all-sky search on a $\\approx$\nyear of data, significant computational resources may be required in order to\ncarry out background estimation. Alternatively, some of the sensitivity of the\nsearch must be sacrificed to control computational costs. The sensitivity of\nthe algorithm is limited by the amount of computing resources due to the\nrequirement of performing background studies to assign significance in\ngravitational-wave searches.
