It is found\nthat a perturbation which is anchored at r=0.9R has a profound effect on the\ndynamo process, producing a transient magnetic cycle of the axisymmetric\nmagnetic field, if it is initiated at the growing phase of the cycle. The\nnon-symmetric with respect to the equator perturbation results in a hemispheric\nasymmetry of the magnetic activity. The evolution of the axisymmetric and\nnon-axisymmetric field depends on the turbulent magnetic Reynolds number R_m.\nIn the range of R_m=10^{4-6} the evolution returns to the normal course in the\nnext cycle, in which the non-axisymmetric field is generated due to a\nnon-linear alpha-effect and magnetic buoyancy.

In\nthis paper, we consider derivations in certain monoidal categories, called\ncodifferential categories. Differential categories were introduced as the\ncategorical framework for modelling differential linear logic. The deriving\ntransform of a differential category, which models the differentiation\ninference rule, is a derivation in the dual category. We here explore that\nderivation's universality.\n  One of the key structures associated to a codifferential category is an\nalgebra modality. This is a monad $T$ such that each object of the form $TC$ is\ncanonically an associative, commutative algebra. Consequently, every\n$T$-algebra has a canonical commutative algebra structure, and we show that\nuniversal derivations for these algebras can be constructed quite generally.\n  It is a standard result that there is a bijection between derivations from an\nassociative algebra $A$ to an $A$-module $M$ and algebra homomorphisms over $A$\nfrom $A$ to $A\\oplus M$, with $A\\oplus M$ being considered as an infinitesimal\nextension of $A$.

One of the\npathways to their formation includes direct collapse of gas, forming a\nsupermassive star, precursor of the black hole seed. The conditions for direct\ncollapse are more easily achievable in metal-free haloes, where atomic hydrogen\ncooling operates and molecular hydrogen (H2) formation is inhibited by a strong\nexternal UV flux. Above a certain value of UV flux (J_crit), the gas in a halo\ncollapses isothermally at ~$10^4$ K and provides the conditions for\nsupermassive star formation. However, H2 can self-shield, reducing the effect\nof photodissociation. So far, most numerical studies used the local Jeans\nlength to calculate the column densities for self-shielding. We implement an\nimproved method for the determination of column densities in 3D simulations and\nanalyse its effect on the value of J_crit. This new method captures the gas\ngeometry and velocity field and enables us to properly determine the\ndirection-dependent self-shielding factor of H2 against photodissociating\nradiation. We find a value of J_crit that is a factor of two smaller than with\nthe Jeans approach (~2000 J_21 vs. ~4000 J_21). The main reason for this\ndifference is the strong directional dependence of the H2 column density. With\nthis lower value of J_crit, the number of haloes exposed to a flux >J_crit is\nlarger by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous studies.

Unlike neutral hydrogen surveys, where the 21 cm line is the only\nbright line, surveys of red-shifted fine-structure lines suffer from confusion\ngenerated by line broadening, spectral overlap of different lines, and the\ncrowding of sources with redshift.

In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that\nhelium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and\nevolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion. We find that ultra-stripped SNe are possible for both EC SNe and Fe\nCCSNe, and that the amount of helium ejected is correlated with P_orb - the\ntightest systems even having donors being stripped down to envelopes of less\nthan 0.01 M_sun. We estimate the rise time of ultra-stripped SNe to be in the\nrange 12 hr - 8 days, and light curve decay times between 1 and 50 days.\nUltra-stripped SNe may produce NSs in the mass range 1.10 - 1.80 M_sun and are\nhighly relevant for LIGO/VIRGO since most (possibly all) merging double NS\nsystems have evolved through this phase. Finally, we discuss the low-velocity\nkicks which might be imparted on these resulting NSs at birth.

The\nabundances of the radioactive elements Th and U are key components of a\nplanet's energy budget, making up 30% to 50% of the Earth's (Korenaga 2008;\nAll\\`egre et al. 2001; Schubert et al. 1980; Lyubetskaya & Korenaga 2007; The\nKamLAND Collaboration 2011; Huang et al. 2013). Radiogenic heat drives interior\nmantle convection and surface plate tectonics, which sustains a deep carbon and\nwater cycle and thereby aides in creating Earth's habitable surface. Unlike\nother heat sources that are dependent on the planet's specific formation\nhistory, the radiogenic heat budget is directly related to the mantle\nconcentration of these nuclides. As a refractory element, the stellar abundance\nof Th is faithfully reflected in the terrestrial planet's concentration. We\nfind that log eps Th varies from 59% to 251% that of Solar, suggesting\nextrasolar planetary systems may possess a greater energy budget with which to\nsupport surface to interior dynamics and thus increase their likelihood to be\nhabitable compared to our Solar System.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 20:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

Acting online requires 'fast'\nresponses, in terms of rapid convergence, especially when the task instance has\na short duration, such as in applications involving interactions with humans.\nThese requirements can be problematic for many established methods for learning\nto act. In domains where the agent knows that the task instance is drawn from a\nfamily of related tasks, albeit without access to the label of any given\ninstance, it can choose to act through a process of policy reuse from a\nlibrary, rather than policy learning from scratch. In policy reuse, the agent\nhas prior knowledge of the class of tasks in the form of a library of policies\nthat were learnt from sample task instances during an offline training phase.\nWe formalise the problem of policy reuse, and present an algorithm for\nefficiently responding to a novel task instance by reusing a policy from the\nlibrary of existing policies, where the choice is based on observed 'signals'\nwhich correlate to policy performance. We achieve this by posing the problem as\na Bayesian choice problem with a corresponding notion of an optimal response,\nbut the computation of that response is in many cases intractable. Therefore,\nto reduce the computation cost of the posterior, we follow a Bayesian\noptimisation approach and define a set of policy selection functions, which\nbalance exploration in the policy library against exploitation of previously\ntried policies, together with a model of expected performance of the policy\nlibrary on their corresponding task instances.

Due to the existence of friction between the system and the third\ndimension in the previous studies, it is unclear whether such fragile state\nwould still exist on the route to shear jamming if the friction with the third\ndimension were completely eliminated and the background noise level were\ngreatly reduced. Using a novel apparatus, we have completely eliminated the\nfriction between particles and the third dimension by floating the particles on\nthe surface of a shallow water layer thus revealing more details of the route\nof shear-jamming. We are able to measure weak boundary pressure of three orders\nof magnitude below the resolution of the photo-elastic method through the\ncombination force-gauges of high sensitivity and a cantilever-like simple-beam\napparatus. In a system with weak cohesion, we have indeed observed the bulk\nfragile states before the shear jamming; in addition, we have also discovered\nthe boundary fragile states and regimes of negligible shear modus compared to\nbulk modulus. Most importantly, we now have a much better understanding of the\nbulk fragile state: its existence requires an auxiliary in some form, e.g. the\nweak cohesion in this experiment. By constructing a way to freely tune down the\ncohesion to more than six orders of magnitude smaller, to our surprise, we have\ndiscovered the complete vanishing of the bulk fragile states, which thus allows\nus to determine the plausible origin of the bulk fragile state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2015 01:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 01:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

A natural application of antenna arrays is\nsimultaneous transmission to multiple users, which requires multi-user\nprecoding at the transmitter.

This\npaper proposes and analyzes a low complexity hybrid analog/digital beamforming\nalgorithm for downlink multi-user mmWave systems. Hybrid precoding involves a\ncombination of analog and digital processing that is motivated by the\nrequirement to reduce the power consumption of the complete radio frequency and\nmixed signal hardware. The proposed algorithm configures hybrid precoders at\nthe transmitter and analog combiners at multiple receivers with a small\ntraining and feedback overhead. For this algorithm, we derive a lower bound on\nthe achievable rate for the case of single-path channels, show its asymptotic\noptimality at large numbers of antennas, and make useful insights for more\ngeneral cases. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm offers\nhigher sum rates compared with analog-only beamforming, and approaches the\nperformance of the unconstrained digital precoding solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2015 02:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In this paper we present new software, Fireflies, which exploits\nthe power of graphical processing unit (GPU) computing to produce spectacular\ninteractive visualisations of arbitrary systems of ordinary differential\nequations. In contrast to typical phase portraits, Fireflies draws the current\nposition of trajectories (projected onto 2D or 3D space) as single points of\nlight, which move as the system is simulated. Due to the massively parallel\nnature of GPU hardware, Fireflies is able to simulate millions of trajectories\nin parallel (even on standard desktop computer hardware), producing \"swarms\" of\nparticles that move around the screen in real-time according to the equations\nof the system. Particles that move forwards in time reveal stable attractors\n(e.g. fixed points and limit cycles), while the option of integrating another\ngroup of trajectories backwards in time can reveal unstable objects\n(repellers). Fireflies allows the user to change the parameters of the system\nas it is running, in order to see the effect that they have on the dynamics and\nto observe bifurcations.

Thereinafter, we find expressions\nfor the entropy changes of these dark energy candidates. In addition,\nconsidering thermal fluctuations, thermodynamics of the dark energy component\ninteracting with a dark matter sector is addressed. {We will also find the\neffects of considering the coincidence problem on the mutual interaction\nbetween the dark sectors, and thus the equation of state parameter of dark\nenergy.} Finally, we derive a relation between the mutual interaction of the\ndark components of the universe, accelerated with the either ghost dark energy\nor its generalization, and the thermodynamic fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2015 13:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

The chains are basically designed\nwith several dielectric cubes with dimensions {\\lambda}0 along the x, y and z\naxes placed periodically along the axial z-axis and separated by an air-gap.\nBased on this, a systematic study of the focusing properties and wave guiding\nof this chain is performed when the air-gap between the dielectric cubes is\nchanged from 0.25{\\lambda}0 to 2.5{\\lambda}0 with the best performance achieved\nwith the latter design. The numerical results of focusing and transport\nproperties are carried out using Finite Integration Technique. The results here\npresented may be scaled to any frequency ranges such as millimeter,\nsub-millimeter or optical frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2015 01:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

The arguments are given that the one-loop Wegner\nresult for a space dimension d=2+\\epsilon may appear to be exact, so the\nmultifractal spectrum is strictly parabolical. The \\sigma-models are shown to\nbe deficient at the four-loop level and the possible reasons of that are\ndiscussed. The extremely slow convergence to the thermodynamic limit is\ndemonstrated. The open question on the relation between multifractality and a\nspatial dispersion of the diffusion coefficient D(\\omega,q) is resolved in the\ncompromise manner due to ambiguity of the D(\\omega,q) definition.
