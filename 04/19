This review discusses\nthe possibility of \"extreme events,\" defined as those with magnitudes greater\nthan have been seen in the existing historical record. For most quantitative\nmeasures, this direct information does not extend more than a century and a\nhalf into the recent past. The magnitude distributions (occurrence frequencies)\nof solar events (flares/CMEs) typically decrease with the parameter measured or\ninferred (peak flux, mass, energy etc. Flare radiation fluxes tend to follow a\npower law slightly flatter than $S^{-2}$, where S represents a peak flux; solar\nparticle events (SPEs) follow a still flatter power law up to a limiting\nmagnitude, and then appear to roll over to a steeper distribution, which may\ntake an exponential form or follow a broken power law. This inference comes\nfrom the terrestrial $^{14}$C record and from the depth dependence of various\nradioisotope proxies in the lunar regolith and in meteorites. Recently major\nnew observational results have impacted our use of the relatively limited\nhistorical record in new ways: the detection of actual events in the $^{14}$C\ntree-ring records, and the systematic observations of flares and \"superflares\"\nby the Kepler spacecraft.

A first step towards that larger goal is to\ndevelop information measures for individual output processes, including\ninformation generation (entropy rate), stored information (statistical\ncomplexity), predictable information (excess entropy), and active information\naccumulation (bound information rate). We calculate these for spike trains\ngenerated by a variety of noise-driven integrate-and-fire neurons as a function\nof time resolution and for alternating renewal processes. We show that their\ntime-resolution dependence reveals coarse-grained structural properties of\ninterspike interval statistics; e.g., $\\tau$-entropy rates that diverge less\nquickly than the firing rate indicate interspike interval correlations. We also\nfind evidence that the excess entropy and regularized statistical complexity of\ndifferent types of integrate-and-fire neurons are universal in the\ncontinuous-time limit in the sense that they do not depend on mechanism\ndetails. This suggests a surprising simplicity in the spike trains generated by\nthese model neurons. Interestingly, neurons with gamma-distributed ISIs and\nneurons whose spike trains are alternating renewal processes do not fall into\nthe same universality class. These results lead to two conclusions. First, the\ndependence of information measures on time resolution reveals mechanistic\ndetails about spike train generation. Second, information measures can be used\nas model selection tools for analyzing spike train processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2015 20:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

In the presence of\nhard real-time constraints it becomes a challenge to maintain enough\ninformation to produce error traces, should a property violation be observed.\nIn this paper we introduce a data structure, called tree buffer, that solves\nthis problem in the context of automata-based monitors: If the monitor itself\nrespects hard real-time constraints, then enriching it by tree buffers makes it\npossible to provide error traces, which are essential for diagnosing defects.\nWe show that tree buffers are also useful in other application domains.

The main method of using reflexia in a group of autonomous units is\nReflexive Game Theory (RGT). To embody RGT in a group of autonomous agents a\ncommunication system is employed. This communication system uses frequency\ndomain multiplexing by means of Izhikevich's resonate-and-fire neural models.\nThe result of socialization of autonomous units by means of RGT and\ncommunication system is illustrated in several examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 08:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

If dust grains are\ngrown to the size comparable to the wavelengths, the dust grains are expected\nto have a large scattering opacity and thus the continuum emission is expected\nto be polarized due to self-scattering. We perform 3D radiative transfer\ncalculations to estimate the polarization degree for the protoplanetary disks\nhaving radial Gaussian-like dust surface density distributions, which have been\nrecently discovered. The maximum grain size is set to be $100 {\\rm~\\mu m}$ and\nthe observing wavelength to be 870 ${\\rm \\mu m}$. We find that the polarization\ndegree is as high as 2.5 % with a subarcsec spatial resolution, which is likely\nto be detected with near-future ALMA observations. The emission is polarized\ndue to scattering of anisotropic continuum emission. The map of the\npolarization degree shows a double peaked distribution and the polarization\nvectors are in the radial direction in the inner ring and in the azimuthal\ndirection in the outer ring. We also find the wavelength dependence of the\npolarization degree: the polarization degree is the highest if dust grains have\na maximum size of $a_{\\rm max}\\sim\\lambda/2\\pi$, where $\\lambda$ is the\nobserving wavelength. Hence, multi-wave and spatially resolved polarization\nobservations toward protoplanetary disks enable us to put a constraint on the\ngrain size. The constraint on the grain size from polarization observations is\nindependent of or may be even stronger than that from the opacity index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 08:41:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 09:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

In our variant, Alice does not know $g$, but only\nknows some function $f$ which is an approximation of $g$. Thus, the function\nbeing computed forms the context for the communication, and knowing it\nimperfectly models (mild) uncertainty in this context.\n  A naive solution would be for Alice and Bob to first agree on some common\nfunction $h$ that is close to both $f$ and $g$ and then use a protocol for $h$\nto compute $h(x,y)$. We show that any such agreement leads to a large overhead\nin communication ruling out such a universal solution.\n  In contrast, we show that if $g$ has a one-way communication protocol with\ncomplexity $k$ in the standard setting, then it has a communication protocol\nwith complexity $O(k \\cdot (1+I))$ in the uncertain setting, where $I$ denotes\nthe mutual information between $x$ and $y$. In the particular case where the\ninput distribution is a product distribution, the protocol in the uncertain\nsetting only incurs a constant factor blow-up in communication and error.\n  Furthermore, we show that the dependence on the mutual information $I$ is\nrequired.
