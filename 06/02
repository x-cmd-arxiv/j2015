This low-metallicity population has lower\nstellar masses, bimodial specific SFRs with enhanced star formation within the\naperture and smaller half-light radii than the general sample, and is hence a\nphysically distinct population. We show that they are consistent with being\ngalaxies that are merging or have recently merged with a satellite galaxy. In\nthis scenario, low-metallicity gas flows in from large radii, diluting the\nmetallicity of star-forming regions and enhancing the specific SFR until the\ninflowing gas is processed and the metallicity has recovered. We introduce a\nsimple model in which mergers with a mass ratio larger than a minimum dilute\nthe central galaxy's metallicity by an amount that is proportional to the\nstellar mass ratio for a constant time, and show that it provides an excellent\nfit to the distribution of FMR residuals.

In this paper, we introduce the concept of\ntechnical rate of substitution (TRS) from microeconomics and study the TRS of\nspectrum in terms of BS density and antenna number per BS. Numerical results\nshow that TRS becomes higher with increasing user data rate requirement,\nsuggesting that spectrum is the most effective means of provisioning extremely\nfast mobile broadband.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 16:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

An interesting consequence is that high\nenergy excited states can exhibit quantum coherent properties, such as symmetry\nprotected topological (SPT) order, that otherwise only occur in equilibrium\nground states. Here, we ask: which types of SPT orders can be realized in\nhighly excited states of a many-body (MB) localized system? We argue that this\nquestion is equivalent to whether an SPT order can be realized in an exactly\nsolvable lattice model of commuting projectors. This perspective enables a\nsharp definition of MB localizability. Using this criterion, it is\nstraightforward to establish that whereas all bosonic SPTs in spatial\ndimensions $d=1,\\,2,\\,3$ are MB localizable, chiral phases (e.g. quantum Hall\nfluids) are not. We also show that free fermion SPTs in $d >1$ (including\ntopological insulators and superconductors) cannot be localized if interactions\nare weak. A key question is whether strong interactions can render them MB\nlocalizable, which we study in the context of a class of $d=2$ topological\nsuperconductors. Using a decorated domain wall (DDW) approach we show that some\nphases in this class are MB localizable, when they correspond to bosonic SPT\norders. However, a similar DDW approach faces a fatal obstruction to realizing\ncertain intrinsically fermionic SPT orders, an issue we argue may persist\nbeyond this specific construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 18:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

In Gofford et al. (2013) we analysed a\nsample of 51 Suzaku-observed AGN and independently detected Fe K absorption in\n~40% of the sample, and we measured the properties of the absorbing gas. In\nthis work we build upon these results to consider the properties of the\nassociated wind. On average, the fast winds (v_out>0.01c) are located\n<r>~10^{15-18} cm (typically ~10^{2-4} r_s) from their black hole, their mass\noutflow rates are of the order <M_out>~0.01-1 Msun/yr or ~(0.01-1) M_edd and\nkinetic power is constrained to <L_k> ~10^{43-45} erg/s, equivalent to\n~(0.1-10%) L_edd. We find a fundamental correlation between the source\nbolometric luminosity and the wind velocity, with v_out \\propto L_bol^{\\alpha}\nand \\alpha=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ (90% confidence), which indicates that more\nluminous AGN tend to harbour faster Fe K winds. The mass outflow rate M_out,\nkinetic power L_k and momentum flux P_out of the winds are also consequently\ncorrelated with L_bol, such that more massive and more energetic winds are\npresent in more luminous AGN. We investigate these properties in the framework\nof a continuum-driven wind, showing that the observed relationships are broadly\nconsistent with a wind being accelerated by continuum-scattering. We find that,\nglobally, a significant fraction (~85%) of the sample can plausibly exceed the\nL_k/L_bol~0.5% threshold thought necessary for feedback, while 45% may also\nexceed the less conservative ~5% of L_bol threshold as well.

For Vrot<50km/s, a major discrepancy arises between the observed and LCDM\nvelocity functions. However, the manner in which different observational\nmeasures of Vrot are associated with Vmax is not straight forward in dwarf\ngalaxies. We instead relate galaxies to DM halos using the empirical baryon-\nmass to halo-mass relation, and show that different observational measures of\nVrot result in very different velocity functions. We show how the W50 velocity\nfunction, i.e. using the HI profile line width at 50% of peak HI flux to\nmeasure Vrot, can be reconciled with a LCDM cosmology. Our semi-empirical\nmethodology allows us to determine the region of rotation curves that are\nprobed by HI measurements (RHI), and shows that the Vrot of dwarfs are\ngenerally measured at a fraction of Rmax, explaining their tendency to have\nrising rotation curves. We provide fitting formulae for relating RHI and Reff\n(the effective radius) to the virial radius of DM halos. To continue to use\nvelocity functions as a probe of LCDM cosmology, it is necessary to be precise\nabout how the different measures of rotation velocity are probing the mass of\nthe DM halos, dropping the assumption that any measure of rotational velocity\ncan be equally used as a proxy for Vmax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 20:09:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Each buyer\nacts strategically in order to maximize her utility, given by the difference\nbetween product valuation and price paid. Buyers report their valuations in\nterms of reserve prices on sets of items, and might be willing to pay prices\ndifferent than the market price in order to subsidize other buyers and to\ntrigger discounts. The resulting price discrimination can be interpreted as a\nredistribution of the total discount. We consider a notion of stability that\nlooks at unilateral deviations, and show that efficient allocations - the ones\nmaximizing the social welfare - can be stabilized by prices that enjoy\ndesirable properties of rationality and fairness. These dictate that buyers pay\nhigher prices only to subsidize others who contribute to the activation of the\ndesired discounts, and that they pay premiums over the discounted price\nproportionally to their surplus - the difference between their current utility\nand the utility of their best alternative. Therefore, the resulting price\ndiscrimination appears to be desirable to buyers. Building on this existence\nresult, and letting N, M and c be the numbers of buyers, vendors and product\ntypes, we propose a O(N^2+NM^c) algorithm that, given an efficient allocation,\ncomputes prices that are rational and fair and that stabilize the market. The\nalgorithm first determines the redistribution of the discount between groups of\nbuyers with an equal product choice, and then computes single buyers' prices.\nOur results show that if a desirable form of price discrimination is\nimplemented then social efficiency and stability can coexists in a market\npresenting subtle externalities, and computing individual prices from market\nprices is tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 21:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 15:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 16:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 05:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 03:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

A practical interferometer with active feedback\ninstead of common temperature control is developed to meet requirement of\nstability. Phase fluctuations of the laser are measured by the interferometer\nwith a photodetector, and then digitalized to raw random numbers with a rate of\n80 Gbps. The min-entropy of the raw data is evaluated by modeling the system\nand is used to quantify the quantum randomness of the raw data. The bias of the\nraw data caused by other signals, such as classical and detection noises, can\nbe removed by Toeplitz-matrix hashing randomness extraction. The final random\nnumbers can pass through the standard randomness tests.

This report explores the two\npillars of optimal control, Bellman's Dynamic Programming and Pontryagin's\nMaximum Principle, and compares implementations of both theories onto simulated\nsystems. Dynamic Programming is realized through a Differential Dynamic\nProgramming Algorithm, where utilizes a forward-backward pass to iteratively\noptimize a control sequence and trajectory.

The results of the report show that, for short time Horizons, DDP\ncan optimize quickly and can generate a trajectory that utilizes less control\neffort for the same problem formulation. On the other hand Pseudospectral\nmethods can optimize faster for longer time horizons, but require a key\nunderstanding of the problem structure. Future work involves completing an\nimplementation of DDP in a C++ code, and testing the speed of convergence for\nboth methods, as well as extended the Pseudospectral Optimal Control framework\nin to the world of stochastic optimal control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 02:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Global\nconvergence as well as the iteration complexity in the non-ergodic sense is\nestablished.Preliminary numerical experiments on some high-dimensional linear\nand convex quadratic SDP problems with a large number of linear equality and\ninequality constraints are also provided. The results show that for the vast\nmajority of the tested problems, the sGS-imsPADMM is 2 to 3 times faster than\nthe directly extended multi-block ADMM with the aggressive step-length of\n1.618, which is currently the benchmark among first-order methods for solving\nmulti-block linear and quadratic SDP problems though its convergence is not\nguaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 03:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 07:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

As the network density is expected to\ndrastically increase in order to accommodate the exponentially growing mobile\ndata traffic, performance optimization problems are entering a new era\ncharacterized by a high dimension and/or a large number of constraints, which\nposes significant design and computational challenges. In this paper, we\npresent a novel two-stage approach to solve large-scale convex optimization\nproblems for dense wireless cooperative networks, which can effectively detect\ninfeasibility and enjoy modeling flexibility. In the proposed approach, the\noriginal large-scale convex problem is transformed into a standard cone\nprogramming form in the first stage via matrix stuffing, which only needs to\ncopy the problem parameters such as channel state information (CSI) and\nquality-of-service (QoS) requirements to the pre-stored structure of the\nstandard form.

In the solving stage,\nthe operator splitting method, namely, the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM), is adopted to solve the large-scale homogeneous self-dual\nembedding. Compared with second-order methods, ADMM can solve large-scale\nproblems in parallel with modest accuracy within a reasonable amount of time.\nSimulation results will demonstrate the speedup, scalability, and reliability\nof the proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art modeling\nframeworks and solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 04:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

In\nthis scenario, the flux should symmetrically distribute between the east and\nwest on the plane with respect to Sagittarius A$^*$ because the stellar mass\ndistribution determined by infrared observations is nearly symmetric. This\nsymmetry is confirmed for the highly ionized iron line as well as the continuum\nemission. However, a clear excess of the neutral iron line in the near east of\nthe Galactic center compared to the near-west side is found. The flux\ndistribution of the excess emission well correlates with molecular column\ndensity. The X-ray spectrum of the excess emission is described by a power-law\ncontinuum plus a 6.4 keV line with the large equivalent width of $\\sim1.3$ keV,\nwhich is hardly explained by the low-energy electron bombardment scenario. The\nlongitudinal and latitudinal distribution of the excess emission disfavors the\nX-ray irradiation, neither by Sagittarius A$^*$ nor by nearby X-ray binaries.\nThen the low-energy proton bombardment is the most probable origin although the\nhigh energy density $\\sim 80$ eV cm$^{-3}$ in 0.1-1000 MeV is required and\nthere is no conventional proton source in the vicinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 05:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

If the sender knows its\nclients' requests and their side-information sets, then the number of packet\ntransmissions required to satisfy all users' demands can be greatly reduced if\nthe data is encoded before sending. The collection of side-information indices\nas well as the indices of the requested data is described as an instance of the\nindex coding with side-information (ICSI) problem. The encoding function is\ncalled the index code of the instance, and the number of transmissions employed\nby the code is referred to as its length. The main ICSI problem is to determine\nthe optimal length of an index code for and instance. As this number is hard to\ncompute, bounds approximating it are sought, as are algorithms to compute\nefficient index codes. Two interesting generalizations of the problem that have\nappeared in the literature are the subject of this work. The first of these is\nthe case of index coding with coded side information, in which linear\ncombinations of the source data are both requested by and held as users'\nside-information. The second is the introduction of error-correction in the\nproblem, in which the broadcast channel is subject to noise.\n  In this paper we characterize the optimal length of a scalar or vector linear\nindex code with coded side information (ICCSI) over a finite field in terms of\na generalized min-rank and give bounds on this number based on constructions of\nrandom codes for an arbitrary instance. We furthermore consider the length of\nan optimal error correcting code for an instance of the ICCSI problem and\nobtain bounds on this number, both for the Hamming metric and for rank-metric\nerrors.

Most of present\napproaches to addressing the ROS variation focus on the change of speech\nsignals in dynamic properties caused by ROS, and accordingly modify the dynamic\nmodel, e.g., the transition probabilities of the hidden Markov model (HMM).\nHowever, an abnormal ROS changes not only the dynamic but also the static\nproperty of speech signals, and thus can not be compensated for purely by\nmodifying the dynamic model. This paper proposes an ROS learning approach based\non deep neural networks (DNN), which involves an ROS feature as the input of\nthe DNN model and so the spectrum distortion caused by ROS can be learned and\ncompensated for. The experimental results show that this approach can deliver\nbetter performance for too slow and too fast utterances, demonstrating our\nconjecture that ROS impacts both the dynamic and the static property of speech.\nIn addition, the proposed approach can be combined with the conventional HMM\ntransition adaptation method, offering additional performance gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 08:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The financial crisis indicators that we have built deal\nwith the spectral properties of these covariance and correlation matrices and\nthey are of two kinds. The first one is based on the Hellinger distance,\ncomputed between the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical\ncovariance matrix and the distribution of the eigenvalues of a reference\ncovariance matrix representing either a calm or agitated market. The idea\nbehind this first type of indicators is that when the empirical distribution of\nthe spectrum of the covariance matrix is deviating from the reference in the\nsense of Hellinger, then a crisis may be forthcoming. The second type of\nindicators is based on the study of the spectral radius and the trace of the\ncovariance and correlation matrices as a mean to directly study the volatility\nand correlations inside the market. The idea behind the second type of\nindicators is the fact that large eigenvalues are a sign of dynamic\ninstability.

We are then able to\nshow consistency of an estimator based on the so-called flat-top tapers; most\nimportantly, the consistency holds true even when the time series dimension is\nallowed to increase with the sample size. Second, we revisit the linear process\nbootstrap (LPB) procedure proposed by McMurry and Politis [J. Time Series Anal.\n31 (2010) 471-482] for univariate time series. Based on the aforementioned\nstacked autocovariance matrix estimator, we are able to define a version of the\nLPB that is valid for multivariate time series. Under rather general\nassumptions, we show that our multivariate linear process bootstrap (MLPB) has\nasymptotic validity for the sample mean in two important cases: (a) when the\ntime series dimension is fixed and (b) when it is allowed to increase with\nsample size.

If $u$ knows the data (rumor) to be\ndisseminated, it disperses it to $v$ (known as PUSH) and if it does not, it\nrequests it from $v$ (known as PULL). While in the classic gossip model, each\nnode is only allowed to contact a single neighbor in each time unit, each node\ncan possibly be contacted by many neighboring nodes.\n  In the present paper, we consider a restricted model where at each node only\none incoming request can be served. As long as only a single piece of\ninformation needs to be disseminated, this does not make a difference for push\nrequests. It however has a significant effect on pull requests. In the paper,\nwe therefore concentrate on this weaker pull version, which we call 'restricted\npull'.\n  We distinguish two versions of the restricted pull protocol depending on\nwhether the request to be served among a set of pull requests at a given node\nis chosen adversarially or uniformly at random. As a first result, we prove an\nexponential separation between the two variants. We show that there are\ninstances where if an adversary picks the request to be served, the restricted\npull protocol requires a polynomial number of rounds whereas if the winning\nrequest is chosen uniformly at random, the restricted pull protocol only\nrequires a polylogarithmic number of rounds to inform the whole network.\nFurther, as the main technical contribution, we show that if the request to be\nserved is chosen randomly, the slowdown of using restricted pull versus using\nthe classic pull protocol can w.h.p. be upper bounded by $O(\\Delta / \\delta\n\\log n)$, where $\\Delta$ and $\\delta$ are the largest and smallest degree of\nthe network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 10:24:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 20:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

The\ntraditional frequentists' approach to quantile regression has been well\ndeveloped around asymptotic theories and efficient algorithms. However, not\nmuch work has been published under the Bayesian framework. One challenging\nproblem for Bayesian quantile regression is that the full likelihood has no\nparametric forms. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian quantile regression\nmethod, the linearly interpolated density (LID) method, which uses a linear\ninterpolation of the quantiles to approximate the likelihood. Unlike most of\nthe existing methods that aim at tackling one quantile at a time, our proposed\nmethod estimates the joint posterior distribution of multiple quantiles,\nleading to higher global efficiency for all quantiles of interest. Markov chain\nMonte Carlo algorithms are developed to carry out the proposed method. We\nprovide convergence results that justify both the algorithmic convergence and\nstatistical approximations to an integrated-likelihood-based posterior. From\nthe simulation results, we verify that LID has a clear advantage over other\nexisting methods in estimating quantities that relate to two or more quantiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 10:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Their observations in galaxies suggest strong magnetic fields already\nat high redshift as well as at present time. However, neither primordial\nmagnetic fields nor battery processes can account for such high field\nstrengths, which implies the presence of a dynamo process with rapid growth\nrates in high-redshift galaxies and subsequent maintenance against decay. We\ninvestigate the particular role played by feedback mechanisms in creating\nstrong fluid turbulence, allowing for a magnetic dynamo to emerge. Performing\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated cooling gas halos, we compare the\nmagnetic field evolution for various initial field topologies and various\nstellar feedback mechanisms. We find that feedback can indeed drive strong gas\nturbulence and dynamo action. We see typical properties of Kolmogorov\nturbulence with a $k^{-5/3}$ kinetic energy spectrum, as well as a small-scale\ndynamo, with a $k^{3/2}$ magnetic energy spectrum predicted by Kazantsev dynamo\ntheory. We also investigate simulations with a final quiescent phase. As\nturbulence decreases, the galactic fountain settles into a thin, rotationally\nsupported disk. The magnetic field develops a large-scale, well-ordered\nstructure with even symmetry, which is in good agreement with magnetic field\nobservations of nearby spirals. Our findings suggest that weak initial seed\nfields were first amplified by a small-scale dynamo during a violent,\nfeedback-dominated early phase in the galaxy formation history, followed by a\nmore quiescent evolution, where the fields have slowly decayed or were\nmaintained via large-scale dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 11:48:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

Particularly\ninteresting is the possibility of the growth of the mean magnetic field due to\nMoffatt drift, which is expected to be finite in a statistically anisotropic\nturbulence. We extend the Kraichnan-Moffatt model to explore effects of finite\nmemory of $\\alpha$ fluctuations, in a spirit similar to that of Sridhar & Singh\n(2014), hereafter SS14. Using the first-order smoothing approximation, we\nderive a linear integro-differential equation governing the dynamics of the\nlarge-scale magnetic field, which is non-perturbative in the\n$\\alpha$-correlation time $\\tau_{\\alpha}$. We recover earlier results in the\nexactly solvable white-noise (WN) limit where the Moffatt drift does not\ncontribute to the dynamo growth/decay. To study finite memory effects, we\nreduce the integro-differential equation to a partial differential equation by\nassuming that the $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ be small but nonzero and the large-scale\nmagnetic field is slowly varying. We derive the dispersion relation and provide\nexplicit expression for the growth rate as a function of four independent\nparameters. When $\\tau_{\\alpha}\\neq 0$, we find that: (i) in the absence of the\nMoffatt drift, but with finite Kraichnan diffusivity, only strong\n$\\alpha$-fluctuations can enable a mean-field dynamo; (ii) in the general case\nwhen also the Moffatt drift is nonzero, both, weak or strong $\\alpha$\nfluctuations, can lead to a large-scale dynamo; and (iii) there always exists a\nwavenumber ($k$) cutoff at some large $k$ beyond which the growth rate turns\nnegative. Thus we show that a finite Moffatt drift can always facilitate\nlarge-scale dynamo action if sufficiently strong, even in case of weak $\\alpha$\nfluctuations, and the maximum growth occurs at intermediate wavenumbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 13:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 20:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Tuning the strength of the laser driving to the intermediate level\nallows one to study the transition from a classical Kinetically Constrained\nModel to the coherent regime. For strong driving, Rydberg excitations evolve\nanalogously to defects in the One-Spin Facilitated Model, a minimal model known\nto exhibit glassy dynamics. In our setup, the constraints result from the\ninterplay between Rydberg interactions and the laser detuning from the Rydberg\nstate. The emerging heterogeneous relaxation timescales are tuneable over\nseveral orders of magnitudes. In the opposite limit of weak driving of the\nintermediate level, we find an effective cluster model which describes the\ndynamics in a reduced subspace of the allowed number and positions of Rydberg\nexcitations. This subspace is uniquely determined by the initial state and is\ncharacterized by a fixed number of clusters of Rydberg excitations.

We present a\ncomputational strategy for reverse-time migration (RTM) with accelerator-aided\nclusters. A new imaging condition computed from the pressure and velocity\nfields is introduced. The model solver is based on a high-order discontinuous\nGalerkin time-domain (DGTD) method for the pressure-velocity system with\nunstructured meshes and multi-rate local time-stepping. We adopted the MPI+X\napproach for distributed programming where X is a threaded programming model.\nIn this work we chose OCCA, a unified framework that makes use of major\nmulti-threading languages (e.g. CUDA and OpenCL) and offers the flexibility to\nrun on several hardware architectures. DGTD schemes are suitable for efficient\ncomputations with accelerators thanks to localized element-to-element coupling\nand the dense algebraic operations required for each element. Moreover,\ncompared to high-order finite-difference schemes, the thin halo inherent to\nDGTD method reduces the amount of data to be exchanged between MPI processes\nand storage requirements for RTM procedures. The amount of data to be recorded\nduring simulation is reduced by storing only boundary values in memory rather\nthan on disk and recreating the forward wavefields. Computational results are\npresented that indicate that these methods are strong scalable up to at least\n32 GPUs for a three-dimensional RTM case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 14:50:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 15:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The idea\nconsists in creating two solitons at some spatial separation from each other at\ninitial time $t_0$, and then measuring the distance between them at a later\ntime $t_1 > t_0$. Depending on whether the distance between solitons has\nincreased, decreased or remained unchanged, compared to its initial value at\n$t_0$, we conclude that soliton interaction was repulsive, attractive or\nneutral, respectively.

In Papers I and Paper\nII of this series we reported a discrepancy in the oxygen abundance derived\nfrom the 630nm and the subordinate [OI] line at 636nm in dwarf stars, including\nthe Sun. Here we analyse several, in part new, solar observations of the the\ncentre-to-limb variation of the spectral region including the blend at 630nm in\norder to separate the individual contributions of oxygen and nickel. We analyse\nintensity spectra observed at different limb angles in comparison with line\nformation computations performed on a CO5BOLD 3D hydrodynamical simulation of\nthe solar atmosphere. The oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line at\ndifferent limb angles are inconsistent if the commonly adopted nickel abundance\nof 6.25 is assumed in our local thermodynamic equilibrium computations. With a\nslightly lower nickel abundance, A(Ni)~6.1, we obtain consistent fits\nindicating an oxygen abundance of A(O)=8.73+/-0.05. At this value the\ndiscrepancy with the subordinate oxygen line remains. The derived value of the\noxygen abundance supports the notion of a rather low oxygen abundance in the\nsolar hotosphere. However, it is disconcerting that the forbidden oxygen lines\nat 630 and 636nm give noticeably different results, and that the nickel\nabundance derived here from the 630nm blend is lower than expected from other\nnickel lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 15:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}
