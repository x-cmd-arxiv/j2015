Arguably the most influential consequence of the VC\nanalysis is the fundamental theorem of statistical machine learning, stating\nthat a concept class is learnable (in some precise sense) if and only if its\nVC-dimension is finite. Furthermore, for such classes a most simple learning\nrule - empirical risk minimization (ERM) - is guaranteed to succeed.\n  The simplest non-trivial structures, in terms of the VC-dimension, are the\nclasses (i.e., sets of subsets) for which that dimension is 1.\n  In this note we show a couple of curious results concerning such classes. The\nfirst result shows that such classes share a very simple structure, and, as a\ncorollary, the labeling information contained in any sample labeled by such a\nclass can be compressed into a single instance.\n  The second result shows that due to some subtle measurability issues, in\nspite of the above mentioned fundamental theorem, there are classes of\ndimension 1 for which an ERM learning rule fails miserably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 16:55:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

The obtained nonlinear self-referencing price\ndynamics can induce, in a completely objective deterministic way, the\nappearance of periodically exploding bubbles ending in crashes. Technically,\nthe periodically explosive bubbles arise due to the proximity of two types of\nbifurcations as a function of the two key control parameters $b$ and $g$, which\nrepresent, respectively, the sensitivity of the fundamental asset price on past\nasset and bond prices and of the fundamental bond price on past asset prices.\nOne is a Hopf bifurcation, when a stable focus transforms into an unstable\nfocus and a limit cycle appears.

This \"drag\" is not surprising;\nalong track drag has previously been observed with the related LAGEOS\nsatellites (-3.4 pm/s$^2$). It is hypothesized that the drag is principally due\nto anisotropic thermal radiation from the satellite's exterior. We report the\nresults of numerical computations of the along-track orbital decay of the LARES\nsatellite during the first 126 days after launch. The results depend to a\nsignificant degree on the visual and IR absorbance $\\alpha$ and emissivity\n$\\epsilon$ of the fused silica Cube Corner Reflectors. We present results for\ntwo values of $\\alpha_{IR}$ = $\\epsilon_{IR}$: 0.82, a standard number for\n\"clean\" fused silica; and 0.60, a possible value for silica with slight surface\ncontamination subjected to the space environment. The heating and the resultant\nalong-track acceleration depend on the plane of the orbit, the sun position,\nand in particular on the occurrence of eclipses, all of which are functions of\ntime. Thus we compute the drag for specific days. We compare our model to\nobservational data, available for a 120-day period starting with the 7th day\nafter launch, which shows the average acceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$. With our\nmodel the average along-track drag over this 120-day period for CCR\n$\\alpha_{IR}$ = $\\epsilon_{IR}$ = 0.82 was computed to be -0.59 pm/s$^2$.

The lower bound $e(G) > h(n,k,t-1)$ in these results is\ntight and is smaller than Kopylov's bound $h(n,k,t)$ by a term of $n-t-O(1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 21:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 22:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

A new cascade design procedure is\nintroduced, by formulating cascade learning as the Lagrangian optimization of a\nrisk that accounts for both accuracy and complexity. A boosting algorithm,\ndenoted as complexity aware cascade training (CompACT), is then derived to\nsolve this optimization. CompACT cascades are shown to seek an optimal\ntrade-off between accuracy and complexity by pushing features of higher\ncomplexity to the later cascade stages, where only a few difficult candidate\npatches remain to be classified. This enables the use of features of vastly\ndifferent complexities in a single detector. In result, the feature pool can be\nexpanded to features previously impractical for cascade design, such as the\nresponses of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This is demonstrated\nthrough the design of a pedestrian detector with a pool of features whose\ncomplexities span orders of magnitude. The resulting cascade generalizes the\ncombination of a CNN with an object proposal mechanism: rather than a\npre-processing stage, CompACT cascades seamlessly integrate CNNs in their\nstages.

The first\nmethod is to use covariant field strengths to be the electric and magnetic\nfields. We find an invariant form of an equation of motion after performing the\nelectric-magnetic duality.

The inputs required are the current and future Through-the-Cycle\nPDs of the obligors, their last known default rates, and a measurement of the\nsystematic dependence of the obligors. Technically, the forecasts are made from\nwithin a classical asset-based credit portfolio model, with the additional\nassumption of a simple (first/second order) autoregressive process for the\nsystematic factor. This paper elaborates in detail on the practical issues of\nimplementation, especially on the parametrization alternatives.

The\nresulting PD forecasts can be used for the derivation of expected lifetime\ncredit losses as required by the newly adopted accounting standard IFRS 9. In\ndoing so, the presented approach is endogenous, as it does not require any\nexogenous macroeconomic forecasts, which are notoriously unreliable and often\nsubjective.

Direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of convection driven dynamos offer one way of\nexamining the mechanisms behind these events. In this work, we analyze a\nsolution of a solar-like DNS that has been evolved for roughly 80 magnetic\ncycles of 4.9 years, during which epochs of irregular behavior are detected.\nThe emphasis of our analysis is to find physical causes for such behavior. The\nDNS employed is a semi-global (wedge) magnetoconvection model. For data\nanalysis we use Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and phase\ndispersion ($D^2$) methods. A special property of the DNS is the existence of\nmultiple dynamo modes at different depths and latitudes. The dominant mode is\nsolar-like. This mode is accompanied by a higher frequency mode near the\nsurface and a low-frequency mode in the bottom of the convection zone. The\noverall behavior of the dynamo solution is very complex exhibiting variable\ncycle lengths, epochs of disturbed and even ceased surface activity, and strong\nshort-term hemispherical asymmetries. Surprisingly, the most prominent\nsuppressed surface activity epoch is actually a global magnetic energy maximum.\nWe interpret the overall irregular behavior to be due to the interplay of the\ndifferent dynamo modes showing different equatorial symmetries, especially the\nsmoother part of the irregular variations being related to the variations of\nthe mode strengths, evolving with different and variable cycle lengths. The\nabrupt low activity epoch in the dominant dynamo mode near the surface is\nrelated to a strong maximum of the bottom toroidal field strength, which causes\nabrupt disturbances especially in the differential rotation profile via the\nsuppression of the Reynolds stresses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 08:52:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 20:15:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 07:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

We consider two samples of galaxies: the Dwarf\nGalaxy Survey (DGS) and KINGFISH, totalling 109 galaxies, spanning almost 2 dex\nin metallicity. We collect infrared (IR) to submillimetre (submm) data for both\nsamples and present the complete data set for the DGS sample. We model the\nobserved spectral energy distributions (SED) with a physically-motivated dust\nmodel to access the dust properties. Using a different SED model (modified\nblackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage at\nsubmm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factor\ntwo to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligible\nsystematic modelling uncertainties. For eight galaxies in our sample, we find a\nrather small excess at 500 microns (< 1.5 sigma). We find that the dust SED of\nlow-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths compared\nto more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. The\nPAH mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be driven\nmostly by the specific star-formation rate, SSFR, with secondary effects from\nmetallicity. The correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-IR\nluminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.\nThe dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studied\ntrend of decreasing ratio for decreasing SSFR. The relation is more complex for\nhighly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemical\nevolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio). Dust growth\nprocesses in the ISM play a key role in the dust mass build-up with respect to\nthe stellar content at high SSFR and low metallicity.

A clear\nidentification of the physical processes behind such variations is needed for\ndeveloping and improving physics-based models of solar brightness variability\nand reconstructing solar brightness in the past. This is, in turn, important\nfor better understanding the solar-terrestrial and solar-stellar connections.\n  We estimate the relative contributions of the continuum, molecular, and\natomic lines to the solar brightness variations on different timescales.\n  Our approach is based on the assumption that variability of the solar\nbrightness on timescales greater than a day is driven by the evolution of the\nsolar surface magnetic field. We calculated the solar brightness variations\nemploying the solar disc area coverage of magnetic features deduced from the\nMDI/SOHO observations. The brightness contrasts of magnetic features relative\nto the quiet Sun were calculated with a non-LTE radiative transfer code as\nfunctions of disc position and wavelength. By consecutive elimination of\nmolecular and atomic lines from the radiative transfer calculations, we\nassessed the role of these lines in producing solar brightness variability.\n  We show that the variations in Fraunhofer lines define the amplitude of the\nsolar brightness variability on timescales greater than a day and even the\nphase of the total solar irradiance variability over the 11-year cycle. We also\ndemonstrate that molecular lines make substantial contribution to solar\nbrightness variability on the 11-year activity cycle and centennial timescales.\nIn particular, our model indicates that roughly a quarter of the total solar\nirradiance variability over the 11-year cycle originates in molecular lines.\nThe maximum of the absolute spectral brightness variability on timescales\ngreater than a day is associated with the CN violet system between 380 and 390\nnm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 10:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Therefore,\ninstead of thermal neutron detectors (or as a complement) one may use\ntraditional and inexpensive gamma detectors, such NaI, BGO, CdZnTe or any other\ngamma detectors. In this work we used D8x8 cm2 NaI scintillator to test the\nconcept.

It has a particular importance for\nnuclear safeguards and security.

By casting DL\nas a classical (or frequentist) estimation problem, the lower bounds on the\nworst case MSE are derived by following an established information-theoretic\napproach to minimax estimation. The main conceptual contribution of this paper\nis the adaption of the information-theoretic approach to minimax estimation for\nthe DL problem in order to derive lower bounds on the worst case MSE of any DL\nscheme. We derive three different lower bounds applying to different generative\nmodels for the observed signals.

By specializing this bound to the case of sparse\ncoefficient distributions, and assuming the true dictionary satisfies the\nrestricted isometry property, we obtain a lower bound on the worst case MSE of\nDL schemes in terms of a signal to noise ratio (SNR). The third bound applies\nto a more restrictive subclass of coefficient distributions by requiring the\nnon-zero coefficients to be Gaussian.

Let us\ndenote a caching node that has lost parts of its stored packets as a sick\ncaching node and a caching node that has not lost any packet as a healthy\ncaching node. In partial repair, a set of caching nodes (among sick and healthy\ncaching nodes) broadcast information to other sick caching nodes to recover the\nerased packets. The broadcast information from a caching node is assumed to be\nreceived without any error by all other caching nodes. All the sick caching\nnodes then are able to recover their erased packets, while using the broadcast\ninformation and the nonerased packets in their storage as side information.

This two-step procedure can\nbe used when the direct maximum-likelihood estimate is difficult or intractable\nto compute. One such example is the identification of stochastic Wiener\nsystems, i.e.,~linear dynamic systems with process noise where the output is\nmeasured using a non-linear sensor with additive measurement noise. It is in\nprinciple possible to evaluate the log-likelihood cost function using numerical\nintegration, but the corresponding optimization problem can be quite intricate.\nThis motivates studying consistent, but sub-optimal, identification methods for\nstochastic Wiener systems.

We study the performance and robustness guarantees of\nthis approach. We design and analyze a numerical scheme for solving a general\nclass of simulation objectives and uncertainty specifications. The key steps\ninvolve a randomized discretization of the probability spaces, a simulable\nunbiased gradient estimator using a nonparametric analog of the likelihood\nratio method, and a Frank-Wolfe (FW) variant of the stochastic approximation\n(SA) method (which we call FWSA) run on the space of input probability\ndistributions.

(2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we\ncollected times of superhump maxima for 102 SU UMa-type dwarf novae observed\nmainly during the 2014-2015 season and characterized these objects. Our project\nhas greatly improved the statistics of the distribution of orbital periods,\nwhich is a good approximation of the distribution of cataclysmic variables at\nthe terminal evolutionary stage, and confirmed the presence of a period minimum\nat a period of 0.053 d and a period spike just above this period. The number\ndensity monotonically decreased toward the longer period and there was no\nstrong indication of a period gap. We detected possible negative superhumps in\nZ Cha. It is possible that normal outbursts are also suppressed by the presence\nof a disk tilt in this system. There was no indication of enhanced orbital\nhumps just preceding the superoutburst, and this result favors the\nthermal-tidal disk instability as the origin of superoutbursts. We detected\nsuperhumps in three AM CVn-type dwarf novae. Our observations and recent other\ndetections suggest that 8% of objects showing dwarf nova-type outbursts are AM\nCVn-type objects. AM CVn-type objects and EI Psc-type object may be more\nabundant than previously recognized. OT J213806, a WZ Sge-type object,\nexhibited a remarkably different feature between the 2010 and 2014\nsuperoutbursts. Although the 2014 superoutburst was much fainter the plateau\nphase was shorter than the 2010 one, the course of the rebrightening phase was\nsimilar. This object indicates that the O-C diagrams of superhumps can be\nindeed variable at least in WZ Sge-type objects. Four deeply eclipsing SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae (ASASSN-13cx, ASASSN-14ag, ASASSN-15bu, NSV 4618) were\nidentified. We studied long-term trends in supercycles in MM Hya and CY UMa and\nfound systematic variations of supercycles of ~20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 05:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

In order to find experimental evidence supporting\nthis hypothesis, we analyze different catalogs, both real and simulated, in two\ndifferent ways. From each catalog, we obtain the law of triggered events'\nmagnitude by kernel density. The results obtained show that the distribution\ndensity of triggered events' magnitude varies with the magnitude of their\ncorresponding mother events.
