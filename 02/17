So far only rough bounds for these parameters have been\nderived for specific problems. This paper sharpens the bounds on these\nstructural parameters for a well-known open problem in the theory of preemptive\nscheduling: Instances consist of in-trees of $n$ unit-execution-time jobs with\nrelease dates, and the objective is to minimize the total completion time on\ntwo processors. This is among the current, tantalizing `threshold' problems of\nscheduling theory: Our literature survey reveals that any significant\ngeneralization leads to an NP-hard problem, but that any significant\nsimplification leads to tractable problem.\n  For the above problem, we show that the number of preemptions necessary for\noptimality need not exceed $2n-1$; that the number must be of order\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ for some instances; and that the minimum shift need not be\nless than $2^{-2n+1}$. These bounds are obtained by combinatorial analysis of\noptimal schedules rather than by the analysis of polytope corners for\nlinear-program formulations, an approach to be found in earlier papers. The\nbounds immediately follow from a fundamental structural property called\n`normality', by which minimal shifts of a job are exponentially decreasing\nfunctions. In particular, the first interval between a preempted job's start\nand its preemption is a multiple of 1/2, the second such interval is a multiple\nof 1/4, and in general, the $i$-th preemption occurs at a multiple of $2^{-i}$.\nWe expect the new structural properties to play a prominent role in finally\nsettling a vexing, still-open question of complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 16:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

Our g and z\ntransits are similar in shape to the average Kepler short-cadence profile, and\nconstitute the highest-quality extant coverage of individual transits. Our\nNight 1 transit depths are 0.85 +/- 0.04% in z; 1.00 +/- 0.03% in g; and 1.1\n+/- 0.3% in u. We employ a residual-permutation method to assess the impact of\ncorrelated noise on the depth difference between the z and g bands and\ncalculate the significance of the color dependence at 3.2{\\sigma}. The Night 1\ndepths are consistent with dust extinction as observed in the ISM, but require\ngrain sizes comparable to the largest found in the ISM: 0.25-1{\\mu}m.

First, we do not know of an explicit and\nimplemented algorithm for deciding the beta-eta-equality of terms---and this in\nspite of the first decidability results proven two decades ago. Second, it is\nnot clear how to decide when two types are essentially the same, i.e.\nisomorphic, in spite of the meta-theoretic results on decidability of the\nisomorphism.\n  In this paper, we present the exp-log normal form of types---derived from the\nrepresentation of exponential polynomials via the unary exponential and\nlogarithmic functions---that any type built from arrows, products, and sums,\ncan be isomorphically mapped to. The type normal form can be used as a simple\nheuristic for deciding type isomorphism, thanks to the fact that it is a\nsystematic application of the high-school identities.\n  We then show that the type normal form allows to reduce the standard beta-eta\nequational theory of the lambda calculus to a specialized version of itself,\nwhile preserving the completeness of equality on terms. We end by describing an\nalternative representation of normal terms of the lambda calculus with sums,\ntogether with a Coq-implemented converter into/from our new term calculus. The\ndifference with the only other previously implemented heuristic for deciding\ninteresting instances of eta-equality by Balat, Di Cosmo, and Fiore, is that we\nexploit the type information of terms substantially and this often allows us to\nobtain a canonical representation of terms without performing sophisticated\nterm analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 17:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 18:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 09:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 13:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Comparing the predicted anisotropic flow coefficients for charged\nhadrons with CMS data we find that both the Monte Carlo Glauber (MC-Glb) and\nMonte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models produce initial fluctuation\nspectra that are incompatible with the measured final anisotropic flow power\nspectrum, for any choice of the specific shear viscosity. In spite of this\nfailure, we show that the hydrodynamic model can qualitatively explain, in\nterms of event-by-event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients and\nflow angles, the breaking of flow factorization for elliptic, triangular and\nquadrangular flow measured by the CMS experiment. For elliptic flow, this\nfactorization breaking is large in ultra-central collisions. We conclude that\nthe bulk of the experimentally observed flow factorization breaking effects are\nqualitatively explained by hydrodynamic evolution of initial-state\nfluctuations, but that their quantitative description requires a better\nunderstanding of the initial fluctuation spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 17:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 14:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 12:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Solutions are characterized by a complete Riemannian\n$n$-manifold $(M,g)$ and a positive function $N$, called the lapse. We study\nthis problem on Asymptotically Poincar\\'e-Einstein $n$-manifolds, $n\\ge 3$,\nwhen the conformal boundary-at-infinity is either a round sphere, a flat torus\nor smooth quotient thereof, or a compact hyperbolic manifold. Such manifolds\nhave well-defined Wang mass, and are time-symmetric slices of static, vacuum,\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.

In consequence, we observe that either the lapse is\ntrivial and $(M,g)$ is Poincar\\'e-Einstein or the Wang mass is negative, as in\nthe case of time symmetric slices of the AdS soliton. As an application, we use\nthe mass formula to compute the renormalized volume of the warped product\n$(X,\\gamma) = (M^3,g) \\times_{N^2} (S^1,dt^2)$.\n  We also give a mass formula for the case of a metric that is static in the\nregion exterior to a horizon on which the lapse function is zero.

To deal with this problem we model\nthe situation as two games, between a Scanner and an Invader, and solve them\nsequentially. The first game is formulated to design the optimal (in maxmin\nsense) scanning algorithm, while the second one allows one to find the optimal\nvalues of the parameters for the algorithm depending on parameters of the\nnetwork. These games provide solutions for two dilemmas that the rivals face.\nThe Invader's dilemma consists of the following: the more bandwidth the Invader\nattempts to use leads to a larger payoff if he is not detected, but at the same\ntime also increases the probability of being detected and thus fined.\nSimilarly, the Scanner faces a dilemma: the wider the bandwidth scanned, the\nhigher the probability of detecting the Invader, but at the expense of\nincreasing the cost of building the scanning system. The equilibrium strategies\nare found explicitly and reveal interesting properties. In particular, we have\nfound a discontinuous dependence of the equilibrium strategies on the network\nparameters, fine and the type of the Invader's award. This discontinuity of the\nfine means that the network provider has to take into account a human/social\nfactor since some threshold values of fine could be very sensible for the\nInvader, while in other situations simply increasing the fine has minimal\ndeterrence impact. Also we show how incomplete information about the Invader's\ntechnical characteristics and reward (e.g. motivated by using different type of\napplication, say, video-streaming or downloading files) can be incorporated\ninto scanning strategy to increase its efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 19:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2015 19:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

We\ninvestigate the quantum capacitance of a heterostructure in which a sizeable\nRSOC at a metallic interface is controlled by the electric field of a surface\nelectrode.

The capacitance is related to the electronic compressibility of the\nheterostructure, but the two quantities are not equivalent. In fact, the\ntransfer of charge to the interface controls the relation between capacitance\nand compressibility.

Here we propose to\nexperimentally test the properties of vacuum energy under circumstances\ndifferent from our current vacuum. One promising avenue is to consider the\neffect of high density phases of QCD in neutron stars. Such phases have\ndifferent vacuum expectation values and a different vacuum energy from the\nnormal phase, which can contribute an order one fraction to the mass of neutron\nstars. Precise observations of the mass of neutron stars can potentially yield\ninformation about the gravitational properties of vacuum energy, which can\nsignificantly affect their mass-radius relation. A more direct test of cosmic\nevolution of vacuum energy could be inferred from a precise observation of the\nprimordial gravitational wave spectrum at frequencies corresponding to phase\ntransitions. While traditional cosmology predicts steps in the spectrum\ndetermined by the number of degrees of freedom both for the QCD and electroweak\nphase transitions, an adjustment mechanism for vacuum energy could\nsignificantly change this. In addition, there might be other phase transitions\nwhere the effect of vacuum energy could show up as a peak in the spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

For\nturbulence with mean field, as in the solar wind, Y is expected to become more\ntwo dimensional (2D), that is, to have larger perpendicular components, loosing\nthe above simple symmetry. To get the cascade rate one should compute the flux\nof Y, which is not feasible with single-spacecraft data, thus measurements rely\nupon assumptions about the unknown symmetry. We use direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence to characterize the\nanisotropy of Y.

Our photometry for this system reveals that\nboth components are less luminous than those in any known substellar binary.\nCombining a new integrated-light spectrum (T9p) and resolved YJH-band\nphotometry from Keck allows us to perform spectral decomposition and assign\ncomponent types of T9 and Y0. Many of the unusual features in the spectrum\nmight be explained by high surface gravity: Y-band peak broadened to the blue;\nJ-band peak broadened to the red; H-band peak shifted slightly to the red; and\nred Y-J colors.

A known LyC source at z=3.795 is successfully\nrecovered as a LyC emitter candidate and another convincing candidate at\nz=3.212 is reported. A detailed analysis of the two sources (including their\nvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar and\nnon-stellar (AGN) contribution in the ultraviolet. Conclusions: Classical\nbroad-band color selection of 2.5<z<4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusion\nof LyC emitters in the selected samples. Large fesc in relatively bright\ngalaxies (L>0.1L*) could be favored by the presence of a faint AGN not easily\ndetected at any wavelength. A hybrid stellar and non-stellar (AGN) ionizing\nemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found among\nthe UV excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported in\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 21:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 13:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Of issue in order to characterize galaxy formation models is to\ndetermine the relative fraction of baryons and dark matter at all radii in\ngalaxies. For disk galaxies, various measurements of the mass distribution in\ngalaxies based on vertical kinematics, strong lensing, residuals of scaling\nrelations, fluid dynamical modeling, bar strength and pattern speed, warps, and\nothers, have called for either a maximal or sub-maximal contribution of the\nbaryons in the inner parts of the disk. We propose a global picture whereby all\ngalaxies are typically baryon-dominated (maximal) at the center and dark-matter\ndominated (sub-maximal) in their outskirts. Using as a fiducial radius the peak\nof the rotation curve of a pure baryonic exponential disk at R_2.2=2.2 Rd,\nwhere Rd is the disk scale length, the transition from maximal to sub-maximal\nbaryons occurs within or near R_2.2 for low-mass disk galaxies (with V_tot <\n200 km/s) and beyond R_2.2 for more massive systems. The mass fraction's\ninverse dependence on circular velocity in disk galaxies is largely insensitive\nto the presence of a bar at R_2.2. The mean mass fractions of late- and\nearly-type galaxies are shown to be different at the same fiducial radius and\ncircular velocity, pointing to different galaxy formation mechanisms. Feedback,\ndynamical friction, size, and IMF variations are key ingredients for\nunderstanding these differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

While it\nis sometimes possible to determine the mass of the primary star, for\nsingle-lined spectroscopic binaries it is not trivial to have good estimates of\nthe mass of the secondary. If a large enough sample of such binaries is\navailable, it is possible, however, to use statistical methods to determine the\nmass ratio distribution, and thus, the secondary mass distribution. Recently,\nAndrews et al. (2014) studied the mass distribution of companions to extremely\nlow-mass white dwarfs, using a sample of binaries from the ELM WD Survey. I\nreanalyse the same sample, using two different methods: in the first one, I\nassume some functional form for the mass distribution, while in the second, I\napply an inversion method. I show that the resulting companion-mass\ndistribution can be as well approximated by either a uniform distribution or a\nGaussian distribution. The mass ratio distribution derived from the inversion\nmethod, without assuming any a priori functional form, shows some additional\nfine-grain structure, although, given the small sample, it is difficult to\nclaim that this structure is statistically significant.

Simulations include two secularly interacting Jupiter-mass\nplanets mutually inclined by 10 degrees, with the host planet either oblate or\nspherical. With a spherical host planet, moons within a critical planetocentric\ndistance experience high inclinations and in some cases high eccentricities,\nwhile more distant moons orbit stably with low inclinations and eccentricities,\nas expected. These counter-intuitive dynamical phenomena disappear with an\noblate host planet, in which case the moons' Laplace plane transitions from the\nhost planet's equatorial plane to the host planet's precessing orbital plane as\ntheir semi-major axes increase, and all moons are dynamically stable with very\nmild changes in orbits. Direct perturbation from the perturbing planet has been\ninvestigated and ruled out as an explanation for the behavior of the innermost\nsatellites, therefore leaving the central star's perturbation as the cause.\nInstability occurs while the nodal precession of the satellite and the central\nstar (as seen from the host planet's frame) approaches the 1:1 secular\nresonance. In non-coplanar systems, around a non-oblate planet, the nodal\nprecession of the moon becomes slow and comparable to that of the planet,\ngiving rise to resonant configurations.

An\nimportant issue in composite likelihood inference is the choice of the weights\nassociated with lower-dimensional data sub-sets, since the presence of\nincompatible sub-models can deteriorate the accuracy of the resulting\nestimator. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for simultaneous\nparameter estimation by tilting, or re-weighting, each sub-likelihood component\ncalled discriminative composite likelihood estimation (D-McLE). The\ndata-adaptive weights maximize the composite likelihood function, subject to\nmoving a given distance from uniform weights; then, the resulting weights can\nbe used to rank lower-dimensional likelihoods in terms of their influence in\nthe composite likelihood function. Our analytical findings and numerical\nexamples support the stability of the resulting estimator compared to\nestimators constructed using standard composition strategies based on uniform\nweights.

Chapter 2 reviews the\narousal theories of curiosity in psychology and summarizes a general two-step\nprocess model for computational curiosity. Base on the perspective of the\ntwo-step process model, Chapter 3 reviews and analyzes some of the traditional\ncomputational models of curiosity. Chapter 4 introduces a novel generic\ncomputational model of curiosity, which is developed based on the arousal\ntheories of curiosity.

We\ndivide the infection period into two stages: an infected stage, which is the\nsame as the previous model, and a seriously ill stage, in which individuals are\ninfected and cannot move to the other populations. The two infectious stages in\nour modified metapopulation SIR model produce a discontinuous final size\ndistribution. Individuals in the infected stage spread the disease like\nindividuals in the seriously ill stage and never recover directly, which makes\nan effective recovery rate smaller than the given recovery rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 06:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 10:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

Often, random\ncomplex-valued signals are considered to be proper. A proper complex random\nvariable or process is uncorrelated with its complex conjugate. This assumption\nis a good model of the underlying physics in many problems, and simplifies the\ncomputations. While linear processing and neural networks have been widely\nstudied for these signals, the development of complex-valued nonlinear kernel\napproaches remains an open problem. In this paper we propose Gaussian processes\nfor regression as a framework to develop 1) a solution for proper\ncomplex-valued kernel regression and 2) the design of the reproducing kernel\nfor complex-valued inputs, using the convolutional approach for\ncross-covariances. In this design we pay attention to preserve, in the complex\ndomain, the measure of similarity between near inputs. The hyperparameters of\nthe kernel are learned maximizing the marginal likelihood using Wirtinger\nderivatives. Besides, the approach is connected to the multiple output learning\nscenario. In the experiments included, we first solve a proper complex Gaussian\nprocess where the cross-covariance does not cancel, a challenging scenario when\ndealing with proper complex signals. Then we successfully use these novel\nresults to solve some problems previously proposed in the literature as\nbenchmarks, reporting a remarkable improvement in the estimation error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 11:59:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 09:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-19"}

The\nincrease of the number of O--H bonds leads to a reversal in adsorption energies\nsuch that Zn--H bonds become favored at sites close to existing O--H bonds,\nwhich results in a gradual extenuation of the metallization. The corresponding\nsurface potential changes are localized within a few nanometers both laterally\nand normal to the surface.

Testing the theory of a past active period of Sgr A*\nrequires X-ray polarimetry. In this paper, we show how modern imaging\npolarimeters could revolutionize our understanding of the Galactic Center.\nThrough Monte Carlo modeling, we produce a 4-8 keV polarization map of the\nGalactic Center, focusing on the polarimetric signature produced by Sgr B1, Sgr\nB2, G0.11-0.11, Bridge E, Bridge D, Bridge B2, MC2, MC1, Sgr C3, Sgr C2, and\nSgr C1. We estimate the resulting polarization, include polarized flux dilution\nby the diffuse plasma emission detected toward the GC, and simulate the\npolarization map that modern polarimetric detectors would obtain assuming the\nperformances of a mission prototype. The eleven reflection nebulae investigated\nin this paper present a variety of polarization signatures, ranging from nearly\nunpolarized to highly polarized (about 77%) fluxes. A major improvement in our\nsimulation is the addition of a diffuse, unpolarized plasma emission that\nstrongly impacts soft X-ray polarized fluxes. The dilution factor is in the\nrange 50% - 70%, making the observation of the Bridge structure unlikely even\nin the context of modern polarimetry. The best targets are the Sgr B and Sgr C\ncomplexes, and the G0.11-0.11 cloud.

In particular, by using ergodic and dynamical\nmethods, a new insight to problems concerning the asymptotic behaviour of\nmultidimensional sequences can be given, and a criterion to construct new\nmultidimensional uniformly distributed sequences is provided. The starting\npoint to do this, is to look at the orbit, i.e. the sequence of iterates, of a\nuniquely ergodic transformation T defined on [0,1]. The unique ergodicity of\nthe transformation has the following consequence: the orbit of x under T is a\nuniformly distributed sequence. We devoted the first chapter entirely on\nclassical topics in uniform distribution theory (UDT) and ergodic theory. This\nprovides the basic requirements for a complete understanding of the following\nchapters, even to a reader who is not familiar with the subject. Chapter 2\ndeals with the LS-sequences of points. In Chapter 3, the method used to\nconstruct the transformation T is the so-called cutting-stacking technique. In\nparticular, we were able to prove the ergodicity of T and that the orbit of the\norigin under this map coincides with an LS-sequence which turns out to be a\nlow-discrepancy one. In Chapter 4, another approach from ergodic theory is\nused. This approach is based on the study of dynamical systems arising from\nnumeration systems defined by linear recurrences. In this way we could not only\nprove that the transformation T defined in Chapter 3 is uniquely ergodic, but\nwe could also construct multidimensional uniformly distributed sequences. In\nChapter 5 we found bounds for integrals of two-dimensional, piecewise constant\nfunctions with respect to copulas. To solve this problem, we drew a connection\nto linear assignment problems. The approximation technique was applied to\nproblems in financial mathematics and UDT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 14:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}

The CSL model has been applied to the\ninflationary universe before and different conclusions have been obtained. In\nthis letter, we use a different approach to implement the CSL model during\ninflation. In particular, in addition to accounting for the\nquantum-to-classical transition, we use the CSL model to generate the\nprimordial perturbations, that is, the dynamical evolution provided by the CSL\nmodel is responsible for the transition from a homogeneous and isotropic\ninitial state to a final one lacking such symmetries. Our approach leads to\nresults that can be clearly distinguished from preceding works.

The lines were broader in the period immediately\nafter outburst with measured FWHM of 1800-2300 km/s for the Pa-beta and\nBr-gamma lines. These values narrowed to 1500-1600 km/s by 12 days from\noutburst.

On the other hand, a recently proposed\nscheme called unitary query was shown to be able to considerably improve the\nreliability of backscatter radio by exploiting query diversity.

Compared with the degenerate case, the cascade decays of\nscalars lead to many new, interesting signal channels. In the positive scenario\nwhere $M_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}<M_{H^\\pm}<M_{H^0/A^0}$, the four-lepton signal is still\nthe most promising discovery channel for the doubly-charged scalars\n$H^{\\pm\\pm}$. The five-lepton signal is crucial to probe the mass spectrum of\nthe scalars, for which, for example, a $5\\sigma$ reach at 14 TeV LHC for\n$M_{H^{\\pm}}=430 GeV$ with $M_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}=400 GeV$ requires an integrated\nluminosity of 76/fb. And the six-lepton signal can be used to probe the neutral\nscalars $H^0/A^0$, which are usually hard to detect in the degenerate case. In\nthe negative scenario where $M_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}>M_{H^\\pm}>M_{H^0/A^0}$, the\ndetection of $H^{\\pm\\pm}$ is more challenging, when the cascade decay\n$H^{\\pm\\pm}\\to H^{\\pm}W^{\\pm*}$ is dominant. The most important channel is the\nassociated $H^{\\pm}H^0/A^0$ production in the final state\n$\\ell^\\pm\\cancel{E}_Tb\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$, which requires a luminosity of 109/fb\nfor a $5\\sigma$ discovery, while the final state\n$\\ell^\\pm\\cancel{E}_Tb\\bar{b}\\tau^+\\tau^-$ is less promising.
