Quantum collective effects that have no\nclassical analogue are even more intriguing. In this work we show how to\nconstruct collective quantum heat machines and explore their performance boosts\nwith respect to regular machines. Without interactions between the machines the\nindividual units operate in a stochastic, non-quantum manner. The construction\nof the collective machine becomes possible by introducing two simple quantum\noperations: coherence extraction and coherence injection. Together these\noperations can harvest coherence from one engine and use it to boost the\nperformance of a slightly different engine. For weakly driven engines we show\nthat the collective work output scales quadratically with the number of engines\nrather than linearly. Eventually, the boost saturates and the scaling becomes\nlinear. Nevertheless, even in saturation, work is still significantly boosted\ncompared to individual operation. To study the reversibility of the collective\nmachine we introduce the 'entropy pollution' measure. It is shown that there is\na regime where the collective machine is N times more reversible while\nproducing N times more work, compared to the individual operation of N units.\nMoreover, the collective machine can even be more reversible than the most\nreversible unit in the collective. This high level of reversibility becomes\npossible due to a special symbiotic mechanism between engine pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 16:25:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 03:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The initial estimate is made using a Bayesian compressive\nsensing (BCS) framework and then tracked using a Bayesian compressed sensing\nKalman filter (BCSKF). The BCS framework splits the angular region into N\npotential DOAs and enforces a belief that only a few of the DOAs will have a\nnon-zero valued signal present. A BCSKF can then be used to track the change in\nthe DOA using the same framework. There can be an issue when the DOA approaches\nthe endfire of the array. In this angular region current methods can struggle\nto accurately estimate and track changes in the DOAs. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose changing the traditional sparse belief associated with BCS to a\nbelief that the estimated signals will match the predicted signals given a\nknown DOA change. This is done by modelling the difference between the expected\nsparse received signals and the estimated sparse received signals as a Gaussian\ndistribution. Example test scenarios are provided and comparisons made with the\ntraditional BCS based estimation method. They show that an improvement in\nestimation accuracy is possible without a significant increase in computational\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 16:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

Cell evolution is based on a discrete Markov chain,\nwith cells stepping along a sequence of discrete internal states from 'normal'\nto 'inactive'. Probabilistic laws are introduced for each type of event a cell\ncan undergo during its life cycle: duplication, arrest, apoptosis, senescence,\ndamage, healing. We adjust the model parameters on a series of cell irradiation\nexperiments, carried out in a clinical LINAC at 20 MV, in which the damage and\nrepair kinetics of single- and double-strand breaks are followed. Two showcase\napplications of the model are then presented. In the first one, we reconstruct\nthe cell survival curves from a number of published low- and high-dose\nirradiation experiments. We reobtain a very good description of the data\nwithout assuming the well-known linear-quadratic model, but instead including a\nvariable DSB repair probability, which is found to spontaneously saturate with\nan exponential decay at increasingly high doses. As a second test, we attempt\nto simulate the two extreme possibilities of the so-called 'bystander' effect\nin radiotherapy: the 'local' effect versus a 'global' effect, respectively\nactivated by the short-range or long-range diffusion of some factor, presumably\nsecreted by the irradiated cells. Even with an oversimplified simulation, we\ncould demonstrate a sizeable difference in the proliferation rate of\nnon-irradiated cells, the proliferation acceleration being much larger for the\nglobal than the local effect, for relatively small fractions of irradiated\ncells in the colony.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 17:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

One may\ntry to suppress the bath effects by means of dynamical control, but such\ncontrol does not always yield the desired results. We wish instead to take\nadvantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate \"quantumness\" in the\nsystem-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued\nby us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the\nbath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal\nquasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest\nby the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively). Dynamical\ncontrol methods based on the QZE are aimed not only at protecting the\nquantumness of the system, but also diagnosing the bath spectra or transferring\nquantum information via noisy media. By contrast, AZE-based control is useful\nfor fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling\nof quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom\ncoupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows\nto drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the\nmediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to\nachieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the\nconventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness. (iii)\nEngineering baths with appropriate non-flat spectra: This approach is a\nprerequisite for the construction of the simplest and most efficient quantum\nheat machines (engines and refrigerators).

The coherent component of these structures arises from cooperative\ninteraction between the coherent structures and the incoherent small-scale\nturbulence in which they are embedded. It follows that theoretical\nunderstanding of the dynamics of jets and planetary scale waves requires\nadopting the perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) which comprises\nthe dynamics of the interaction between coherent and incoherent components in\nthe turbulent state. In this work the S3T implementation of SSD for barotropic\nbeta-plane turbulence is used to develop a theory for the jet/wave coexistence\nregime by separating the coherent motions consisting of the zonal jets together\nwith a selection of large-scale waves from the smaller scale motions which\nconstitute the incoherent component. It is found that mean flow/turbulence\ninteraction gives rise to jets that coexist with large-scale coherent waves in\na synergistic manner. Large-scale waves that would only exist as damped modes\nin the laminar jet are found to be transformed into exponentially growing waves\nby interaction with the incoherent small scale turbulence which results in a\nchange in the mode structure allowing the mode to tap the energy of the mean\njet. This mechanism of destabilization differs fundamentally and serves to\naugment the more familiar S3T instabilities in which jets and waves arise from\nhomogeneous turbulence with energy source exclusively from the incoherent eddy\nfield and provides further insight into the cooperative dynamics of the\njet/waves coexistence regime in planetary turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 18:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 23:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 21:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

Given a set of\nnodes of interest, uniquely localizing failures within this set requires that\ndifferent observable path states associate with different node failure events.\nHowever, this condition is difficult to test on large networks due to the need\nto enumerate all possible node failures. Our first contribution is a set of\nsufficient/necessary conditions for identifying a bounded number of failures\nwithin an arbitrary node set that can be tested in polynomial time. In addition\nto network topology and locations of monitors, our conditions also incorporate\nconstraints imposed by the probing mechanism used. We consider three probing\nmechanisms that differ according to whether measurement paths are (i)\narbitrarily controllable, (ii) controllable but cycle-free, or (iii)\nuncontrollable (determined by the default routing protocol). Our second\ncontribution is to quantify the capability of failure localization through (1)\nthe maximum number of failures (anywhere in the network) such that failures\nwithin a given node set can be uniquely localized, and (2) the largest node set\nwithin which failures can be uniquely localized under a given bound on the\ntotal number of failures. Both measures in (1-2) can be converted into\nfunctions of a per-node property, which can be computed efficiently based on\nthe above sufficient/necessary conditions. We demonstrate how measures (1-2)\nproposed for quantifying failure localization capability can be used to\nevaluate the impact of various parameters, including topology, number of\nmonitors, and probing mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 18:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

These minimal seeds are located adjacent to the edge manifold, the\nmanifold in state space that separates trajectories which transition to\nturbulence from those which eventually decay to the laminar state. The edge\nmanifold is also the stable manifold of the system's `edge state'. The\ntrajectories from the minimal seed initial conditions spend a large amount of\ntime in the vicinity of some states: the edge state; another state contained\nwithin the edge manifold; or even in dynamically slowly varying regions of the\nedge manifold, allowing us to investigate the effects of a stable\nstratification on any coherent structures associated with such states.

In this work we present a detailed multi-frequency analysis\nof SOL2012-03-13, including observations at radio millimeter and sub-millimeter\nwavelengths, in hard X-rays (HXR), gamma-rays (GR), H-alpha, and white-light.\nHXR/GR spectral analysis shows that the event is a GR line flare and allows\nestimating the numbers of and energy contents in electrons, protons and alpha\nparticles produced during the flare. The energy spectrum of the electrons\nproducing the HXR/GR continuum is consistent with a broken power-law with an\nenergy break at ~800 keV. It is shown that the high-energy part (above ~800\nkeV) of this distribution is responsible for the high-frequency radio emission\n(> 20 GHz) detected during the flare. By comparing the 30 THz emission expected\nfrom semi-empirical and time-independent models of the quiet and flare\natmospheres, we find that most (~80%) of the observed 30 THz radiation can be\nattributed to thermal free-free emission of an optically-thin source. Using the\nF2 flare atmospheric model this thin source is found to be at temperatures\nT~8000 K and is located well above the minimum temperature region. We argue\nthat the chromospheric heating, which results in 80% of the 30 THz excess\nradiation, can be due to energy deposition by non-thermal flare accelerated\nelectrons, protons and alpha particles. The remaining 20% of the 30 THz excess\nemission is found to be radiated from an optically-thick atmospheric layer at\nT~5000 K, below the temperature minimum region, where direct heating by\nnon-thermal particles is insufficient to account for the observed infrared\nradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 18:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

Next, we\napproximate structural (Bennett's Logical Depth) complexity (LD) to assess the\namount of computation required for generating a behavioural string. We apply\nour toolbox to three landmark studies of animal behaviour of increasing\nsophistication and degree of environmental influence, including studies of\nforaging communication by ants, flight patterns of fruit flies, and tactical\ndeception and competition (e.g., predator-prey) strategies. We find that ants\nharness the environmental condition in their internal decision process,\nmodulating their behavioural complexity accordingly. Our analysis of flight\n(fruit flies) invalidated the common hypothesis that animals navigating in an\nenvironment devoid of stimuli adopt a random strategy. Fruit flies exposed to a\nfeatureless environment deviated the most from Levy flight, suggesting an\nalgorithmic bias in their attempt to devise a useful (navigation) strategy.\nSimilarly, a logical depth analysis of rats revealed that the structural\ncomplexity of the rat always ends up matching the structural complexity of the\ncompetitor, with the rats' behaviour simulating algorithmic randomness.\nFinally, we discuss how experiments on how humans perceive randomness suggest\nthe existence of an algorithmic bias in our reasoning and decision processes,\nin line with our analysis of the animal experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 18:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 11:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 08:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 12:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 09:47:26 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 29 May 2022 16:45:19 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2022 18:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2022 22:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 21:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

Atomic data is crucial for astrophysical investigations. To\nunderstand the formation and evolution of stars, we need to analyse their\nobserved spectra.

Aims. This paper investigates the spectrum of neutral scandium, Sc\ni, from laboratory measurements and improves the atomic data of Sc i lines in\nthe infrared region covering lines in R, I, J, and K bands. Especially, we\nfocus on measuring oscillator strengths for Sc i lines connecting the levels\nwith 4p and 4s configurations. Methods.

In\nthis work we outline a novel approach to probing the orbital distributions of\ninfalling satellite galaxies using the morphology of tidal debris structures.\nIt has long been understood that the destruction of satellites on near-radial\norbits tends to lead to the formation of shells of debris, while those on less\neccentric orbits produce tidal streams. We combine an understanding of the\nscaling relations governing the orbital properties of debris with a simple\nmodel of how these orbits phase-mix over time to produce a `morphology metric'\nthat more rigorously quantifies the conditions required for shells to be\napparent in debris structures as a function of the satellite's mass and orbit\nand the interaction time. Using this metric we demonstrate how differences in\norbit distributions can alter the relative frequency of shells and stream\nstructures observed around galaxies.

This appears to occur in\nluminous blue variables (LBVs), Type IIn supernovae progenitors, classical\nnovae, and X-ray bursts. We show that when the wind kinetic power exceeds\nEddington, the photons are trapped and behave like a fluid. Convection does not\nplay a significant role in the wind energy transport. The wind properties\ndepend on the ratio of a characteristic speed in the problem vc ~ (Edot\nG)^{1/5} (where Edot is the heating rate) to the stellar escape speed near the\nheating region vesc(r_h). For vc > vesc(r_h) the wind kinetic power at large\nradii Edot_w ~ Edot. For vc < vesc(r_h), most of the energy is used to unbind\nthe wind material and thus Edot_w < Edot.

Strong feedback, e.g., galactic winds,\ncaused by elevated star formation rates (SFRs) is expected to play an important\nrole in this evolution. We compare different outflow prescriptions: (i)\nconstant wind velocity (CW), (ii) variable wind scaling with galaxy properties\n(VW), and (iii) no outflows (NW). The overdensity leads to accelerated\nevolution of dark matter and baryonic structures, absent in the \"normal\"\nregion, and to shallow galaxy stellar mass functions at the low-mass end.\nAlthough CW shows little dependence on both environments, the more physically\nmotivated VW model does exhibit this effect. In addition, VW can reproduce the\nobserved specific SFR (sSFR) and the sSFR-stellar mass relation, which CW and\nNW fail to satisfy simultaneously. Winds also differ substantially in affecting\nthe state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The difference lies in\nvolume-filling factor of hot, high-metallicity gas which is near unity for CW,\nwhile it remains confined in massive filaments for VW, and locked up in\ngalaxies for NW. Such gas is nearly absent in the normal region. Although all\nwind models suffer from deficiencies, the VW model seems to be promising in\ncorrelating the outflow properties to those of host galaxies.

We find that the JCMT LR1 reduction is suitable for determining\nwhether or not compact emission is present in a given region and the GBS LR1\nreduction is tuned in a robust way to uncover more extended emission, which\nbetter serves more in-depth physical analyses of star-forming regions. Using\nthe GBS LR1 method, we find that compact sources are recovered well, even at a\npeak brightness of only 3 times the noise, whereas the reconstruction of larger\nobjects requires much care when drawing boundaries around the expected\nastronomical signal in the data reduction process. Incorrect boundaries can\nlead to false structure identification or it can cause structure to be missed.\nIn the JCMT LR1 reduction, the extent of the true structure of objects larger\nthan a point source is never fully recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 20:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

In such cases, the semantics of\ntarget queries trivialize. The aim of this paper is to introduce and explore a\nnew framework that gives meaningful semantics in such cases by using the notion\nof exchange-repairs. Informally, an exchange-repair of a source instance is\nanother source instance that differs minimally from the first, but has a\nsolution. Exchange-repairs give rise to a natural notion of exchange-repair\ncertain answers (XR-certain answers) for target queries. We show that for\nschema mappings specified by source-to-target GAV dependencies and target\nequality-generating dependencies (egds), the XR-certain answers of a target\nconjunctive query can be rewritten as the consistent answers (in the sense of\nstandard database repairs) of a union of conjunctive queries over the source\nschema with respect to a set of egds over the source schema, making it possible\nto use a consistent query-answering system to compute XR-certain answers in\ndata exchange.

The production follows three steps.\nFirst, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field and an object\ndistribution including nonlinear stochastic galaxy bias. Secondly, we run the\nhalo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON code to assign masses to the\nvarious objects. This step uses the mass distribution as a function of local\ndensity and non-local indicators (i.e., tidal field tensor eigenvalues and\nrelative halo exclusion separation for massive objects) from the reference\nsimulation applied to the corresponding PATCHY dark matter and galaxy\ndistribution.

The mass-loss characteristics can therefore offer important clues\nregarding the progenitor system. For the case of SN 2006gy, both a scattered\nand thermal light echo from circumstellar material (CSM) have been reported at\nlater epochs (day ~800), ruling out the likelihood of a pair-instability event\nand leading to constraints on the characteristics of the CSM.

To this end, we\npresent a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and\nsome of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of\nenergy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables.\nBuilding on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe\nthermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an\nexternal bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from\nstudies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench\nas a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results\nof numerical experiments on quantum quenches.

Basic\nthermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of\nthermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems,\nand the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum\nchaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian\neigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles.\nWe then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal\nenergy distributions in continuously driven systems.

However recent observations hint to high levels of ionisation\nin protostellar systems, therefore leading to an apparent contradiction that\ncould be explained by the presence of energetic particles accelerated within\nyoung protostars. Our modelling consists of a set of conditions that has to be\nsatisfied in order to have an efficient particle acceleration through the\ndiffusive shock acceleration mechanism. We find that jet shocks can be strong\naccelerators of protons which can be boosted up to relativistic energies.\nAnother possibly efficient acceleration site is located at protostellar\nsurfaces, where shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase\nare strong enough to accelerate protons. Our results demonstrate the\npossibility of accelerating particles during the early phase of a\nproto-Solar-like system and can be used as an argument to support available\nobservations. The existence of an internal source of energetic particles can\nhave a strong and unforeseen impact on the star and planet formation process as\nwell as on the formation of pre-biotic molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 22:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

The alpha-optimization (resp. beta-optimization) of the\nreassembling of G is to determine an order \\Theta for splicing the edges that\nminimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure).\n  There are different forms of reassembling. We consider only cases satisfying\nthe condition that if the an edge between disjoint components A and B is\nspliced, then all the edges between A and B are spliced at the same time. In\nthis report, we examine the particular case of linear reassembling, which\nrequires that the next edge to be spliced must be adjacent to an already\nspliced edge. We delay other forms of reassembling to follow-up reports.\n  We prove that alpha-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cutwidth\nlinear arrangment (CutWidth) are polynomially reducible to each other, and that\nbeta-optimization of linear reassembling and minimum-cost linear arrangement\n(MinArr) are polynomially reducible to each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 00:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Our methods rely on\nstochastic approximations, which are computationally efficient as they maintain\none iterate as a parameter estimate, and successively update that iterate based\non a single data point. When the update is based on a noisy gradient, the\nstochastic approximation is known as standard stochastic gradient descent,\nwhich has been fundamental in modern applications with large data sets.\nAdditionally, our methods are numerically stable because they employ implicit\nupdates of the iterates. Intuitively, an implicit update is a shrinked version\nof a standard one, where the shrinkage factor depends on the observed Fisher\ninformation at the corresponding data point. This shrinkage prevents numerical\ndivergence of the iterates, which can be caused either by excess noise or\noutliers.

We\naim to characterize the 'flaring' disk structure around the Herbig Ae/Be stars\nHD 100453 and HD 34282. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) show an\nemission excess between 15-40{\\mu}m, but very weak (HD 100453) and no (HD\n34282) signs of the 10 and 20 {\\mu}m amorphous silicate features. We\ninvestigate whether this implies the presence of large dust gaps. In this work,\nspatially resolved mid-infrared Q-band images taken with Gemini North/MICHELLE\nare investigated. We perform radiative transfer modeling and examine the radial\ndistribution of dust. We simultaneously fit the Q-band images and SEDs of HD\n100453 and HD 34282. Our solutions require that the inner-halos and outer-disks\nare likely separated by large dust gaps that are depleted wih respect to the\nouter disk by a factor of 1000 or more. The inner edges of the outer disks of\nHD 100453 and HD 34282 have temperatures of about $160 \\pm 10$ K and $60 \\pm 5$\nK respectively. Because of the high surface brightnesses of these walls, they\ndominate the emission in the Q-band. Their radii are constrained at 20+2 AU and\n92+31 AU, respectively. We conclude that, HD 100453 and HD 34282 likely have\ndisk dust gaps and the upper limit on the dust mass in each gap is estimated to\nbe about $10^{-7}$M$_{\\odot}$. We find that the locations and sizes of disk\ndust gaps are connected to the SED, as traced by the mid-infrared flux ratio\nF30/F13.5. We propose a new classification scheme for the Meeus groups (Meeus\net al. 2001) based on the F30/F13.5 ratio. The absence of amorphous silicate\nfeatures in the observed SEDs is caused by the depletion of small (smaller than\n1 {\\mu}m) silicate dust at temperatures above 160 K, which could be related to\nthe presence of a dust gap in that region of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 09:50:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 10:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

TDM is a composite made by cold forging a mix of\nrubber fibers and grains, obtained by grinding scrap tires, and polyurethane\nbinder. The mechanical properties are highly influenced by the presence of\nvoids associated with the granular composition and low tensile strength due to\nthe weak connection at the grain-matrix interface. For these reasons, TDM use\nis restricted to applications concerning a limited range of deformations.\nExperimental tests show that a central feature of the response is connected to\nhighly nonlinear behavior of the material under volumetric deformation which\nconventional hyperelastic models fail in predicting. The strain energy function\npresented here is a variant of the exponentiated Hencky strain energy proposed\nby Neff et al., which for moderate strains is as good as the quadratic Hencky\nmodel and in the large strain region improves several important features from a\nmathematical point of view. The proposed form of the exponentiated Hencky\nenergy possesses a set of parameters uniquely determined in the infinitesimal\nstrain regime and an orthogonal set of parameters to determine the nonlinear\nresponse. The hyperelastic model is additionally incorporated in a finite\ndeformation viscoelasticity framework that accounts for the two main\ndissipation mechanisms in TDMs, one at the microscale level and one at the\nmacroscale level.

Consumers with low degree (few friends) have incentives to adopt\nearly, while consumers with high degree have incentives to free ride. The\nseller can induce high-degree consumers to adopt early by offering referral\nincentives - rewards to early adopters whose friends buy in the second period.\nReferral incentives thus lead to a `double-threshold strategy' by which low and\nhigh-degree agents adopt the product early while middle-degree agents wait. We\nshow that referral incentives are optimal on certain networks while\ninter-temporal price discrimination (i.e., a first-period price discount) is\noptimal on others, and discuss welfare implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 10:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 09:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 14:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 13:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

Various methods have been\nproposed to learn data-dependent binary descriptors. However, most existing\nbinary descriptors aim overly at computational simplicity at the expense of\nsignificant information loss which causes ambiguity in similarity measure using\nHamming distance. In this paper, by considering multiple features might share\ncomplementary information, we present a novel local binary descriptor, referred\nas Ring-based Multi-Grouped Descriptor (RMGD), to successfully bridge the\nperformance gap between current binary and floated-point descriptors. Our\ncontributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new pooling configuration\nbased on spatial ring-region sampling, allowing for involving binary tests on\nthe full set of pairwise regions with different shapes, scales and distances.\nThis leads to a more meaningful description than existing methods which\nnormally apply a limited set of pooling configurations. Then, an extended\nAdaboost is proposed for efficient bit selection by emphasizing high variance\nand low correlation, achieving a highly compact representation. Secondly, the\nRMGD is computed from multiple image properties where binary strings are\nextracted. We cast multi-grouped features integration as rankSVM or sparse SVM\nlearning problem, so that different features can compensate strongly for each\nother, which is the key to discriminativeness and robustness. The performance\nof RMGD was evaluated on a number of publicly available benchmarks, where the\nRMGD outperforms the state-of-the-art binary descriptors significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 11:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The variational method\napplies to surfaces described as level sets. It is mathematically well-posed\nand an existence proof of an optimal matching deformation is given. The\nvariational model is implemented using a finite element discretization combined\nwith a narrow band approach on an efficient hierarchical grid structure. For\nthe optimization a regularized nonlinear conjugate gradient scheme and a\ncascadic multilevel strategy are used.

Among the most prominent sulphur-bearing molecules, SO, sulphur\nmonoxide radical, is one of the more ubiquitous and abundant, observed also in\nits isotopic substituted species such as $^{34}$SO and S$^{18}$O. Due to the\nimportance of this simple diatomic system and to face the challenge of modern\nradioastronomical facilities, an extension to THz range of the rare\nisotopologues of sulphur monoxide has been performed. High-resolution\nrotational molecular spectroscopy has been employed to extend the available\ndataset of four isotopic species, SO, $^{34}$SO, S$^{17}$O, and S$^{18}$O up to\nthe 1.5 THz region. The frequency coverage and the spectral resolution of our\nmeasurements allowed a better constraint of the molecular constants of the four\nspecies considered, focusing especially for the two oxygen substituted\nisotopologues. Our measurements were also employed in an isotopically invariant\nfit including all available pure rotational and ro-vibrational transitions for\nall SO isotopologues, thus enabling accurate predictions for rotational\ntransitions at higher frequencies. Comparison with recent works performed on\nthe same system are also provided, showing the quality of our experiment and\nthe improvement of the datasets for all the species here considered.

Using a sub-parsec resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, we probe these conditions to explore how\nand where bar (hydro-)dynamics favours the formation or destruction of\nmolecular clouds and stars. The interplay between the kpc-scale dynamics (gas\nflows, shear) and the parsec-scale (turbulence) is key to this problem. We find\na strong dichotomy between the leading and trailing sides of the bar, in term\nof cloud fragmentation and in the age distribution of the young stars. After\norbiting along the bar edge, these young structures slow down at the\nextremities of the bar, where orbital crowding increases the probability of\ncloud-cloud collision. We find that such events increase the Mach number of the\ncloud, leading to an enhanced star formation efficiency and finally the\nformation of massive stellar associations, in a fashion similar to\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions. We highlight the role of bar dynamics in decoupling\nyoung stars from the clouds in which they form, and discuss the implications on\nthe injection of feedback into the interstellar medium, in particular in the\ncontext of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 12:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

To make quantitative\npredictions about glass transitions in tissues, we study a self-propelled\nVoronoi (SPV) model that simultaneously captures polarized cell motility and\nmulti-body cell-cell interactions in a confluent tissue, where there are no\ngaps between cells. We demonstrate that the model exhibits a jamming transition\nfrom a solid-like state to a fluid-like state that is controlled by three\nparameters: the single-cell motile speed, the persistence time of single-cell\ntracks, and a target shape index that characterizes the competition between\ncell-cell adhesion and cortical tension. In contrast to traditional particulate\nglasses, we are able to identify an experimentally accessible structural order\nparameter that specifies the entire jamming surface as a function of model\nparameters. We demonstrate that a continuum Soft Glassy Rheology model\nprecisely captures this transition in the limit of small persistence times, and\nexplain how it fails in the limit of large persistence times. These results\nprovide a framework for understanding the collective solid-to-liquid\ntransitions that have been observed in embryonic development and cancer\nprogression, which may be associated with Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition\nin these tissues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 12:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 05:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 20:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 21:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 01:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The use of multiple transmitters\n(TXs) each with one coil can be applied to enhance the WPT performance by\nfocusing the magnetic fields from all TX coils in a beam toward the receiver\n(RX) coil, termed as \"magnetic beamforming\". In this paper, we study the\noptimal magnetic beamforming for an MRC-WPT system with multiple TXs and a\nsingle RX. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the currents\nflowing through different TXs so as to minimize the total power drawn from\ntheir voltage sources, subject to the minimum power required by the RX load as\nwell as the TXs' constraints on the peak voltage and current. For the special\ncase of identical TX resistances and neglecting all TXs' constraints on the\npeak voltage and current, we show that the optimal current magnitude of each TX\nis proportional to the mutual inductance between its TX coil and the RX coil.\nIn general, the problem is a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic\nprogramming (QCQP) problem, which is reformulated as a semidefinite programming\n(SDP) problem. We show that its semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is tight.\nNumerical results show that magnetic beamforming significantly enhances the\ndeliverable power as well as the WPT efficiency over the uncoordinated\nbenchmark scheme of equal current allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 13:41:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 11:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

For the latter, we demonstrate individually\naddressed single-qubit gates by local control of the speed of each ion. The\nfidelities we observe are consistent with operations performed using standard\nmethods involving static ions and pulsed laser fields.

New\nspectral methods based on non-backtracking random walks have recently been\nintroduced that successfully detect communities in many sparse networks.\nHowever, the spectrum of non-backtracking random walks ignores hanging trees in\nnetworks that can contain information about the community structure of\nnetworks. We introduce the reluctant backtracking operators that explicitly\naccount for hanging trees as they admit a small probability of returning to the\nimmediately previous node unlike the non-backtracking operators that forbid an\nimmediate return. We show that the reluctant backtracking operators can detect\ncommunities in certain sparse networks where the non-backtracking operators\ncannot while performing comparably on benchmark stochastic block model networks\nand real world networks. We also show that the spectrum of the reluctant\nbacktracking operator approximately optimises the standard modularity function\nsimilar to the flow matrix. Interestingly, for this family of non- and\nreluctant-backtracking operators the main determinant of performance on\nreal-world networks is whether or not they are normalised to conserve\nprobability at each node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 15:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

However,\nmodelling time-varying delays is challenging because of their dependence on\nmultiple pa-rameters such as length, contention, connected devices, protocol\nemployed, and channel loading. Further, these multiple parameters are\ninherently random and de-lays vary in a non-linear fashion with respect to\ntime. This makes estimating ran-dom delays challenging. This investigation\npresents a methodology to model de-lays in NCS using experiments and general\nregression neural network (GRNN) due to their ability to capture non-linear\nrelationship. To compute the optimal smoothing parameter that computes the best\nestimates, genetic algorithm is used. The objective of the genetic algorithm is\nto compute the optimal smoothing pa-rameter that minimizes the mean absolute\npercentage error (MAPE). Our results illustrate that the resulting GRNN is able\nto predict the delays with less than 3% error. The proposed delay model gives a\nframework to design compensation schemes for NCS subjected to time-varying\ndelays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 20:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

Although we found that the tide is p-g\nunstable early in the inspiral and rapidly drives modes to large energies, our\nanalysis only accounted for three-mode interactions. Venumadhav, Zimmerman, and\nHirata showed that four-mode interactions must also be accounted for as they\nenter into the analysis at the same order. They found a near-exact cancellation\nbetween three- and four-mode interactions and concluded that while the tide in\nbinary neutron stars can be p-g unstable, the growth rates are not fast enough\nto impact the gravitational wave signal. Their analysis assumes that the linear\ntide is incompressible, which is true of the static linear tide (the m=0\nharmonic) but not the non-static linear tide (m=+/- 2). Here we account for the\ncompressibility of the non-static linear tide and find that the three- and\nfour-mode interactions no longer cancel. As a result, we find that the\ninstability can rapidly drive modes to significant energies (there is time for\nseveral dozen e-foldings of growth before the binary merges). We also show that\nlinear damping interferes with the cancellation and may further enhance the p-g\ngrowth rates. The early onset of the instability (at gravitational wave\nfrequencies near 50 Hz), the rapid growth rates, and the large number of\nunstable modes (> 10^3), suggest that the instability could impact the phase\nevolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. Assessing its\nimpact will require an understanding of how the instability saturates and is\nleft to future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 00:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 17:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}
