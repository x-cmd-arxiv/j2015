In this paper, after reviewing the full\nnonperturbative origin of this divergence in the two-gluon sector, we discuss\nits implications for the three- and four-gluon sector, showing in particular\nthat some of the form factors characterizing the corresponding Green's\nfunctions are bound to diverge in the infrared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 16:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

We aim at finding candidates of potential survivors of high-redshift\ncompact galaxies in SDSS, as targets for more detailed follow-up observations.\n  Methods. From the virial theorem it is expected that for a given mass,\ncompact galaxies have stellar velocity dispersion higher than the mean due to\ntheir smaller sizes. Therefore velocity dispersion coupled with size (or mass)\nis an appropriate method to select relics, independent of the stellar\npopulation properties. Based on these consideration we design a set of criteria\nusing distribution of early-type galaxies from SDSS on the\nlog$_{10}$(R$_{0}$)-log$_{10}$($\\sigma_{0}$) plane to find the most extreme\nobjects on it.\n  Results.

A set of functional data with a possible change in its\nstructure may lead to a wrong conclusion if it is not taken in to account. So,\nsometimes, it is crucial to know about the existence of change point in a given\nsequence of functional data before doing any further statistical inference. We\ndevelop a new methodology to provide a test for detecting a change in the mean\nfunction of the corresponding data. To obtain the test statistic we provide an\nalternative estimator of the covariance kernel. The proposed estimator is\nasymptotically unbiased under the null hypothesis and, at the same time, has\nsmaller amount of bias than that of the existing estimator. We show here that\nunder the null hypothesis the proposed test statistic is pivotal\nasymptotically. Moreover, it is shown that under alternative hypothesis the\ntest is consistent for large enough sample size. It is also found that the\nproposed test is more powerful than the available test procedure in the\nliterature. From the extensive simulation studies we observe that the proposed\ntest outperforms the existing one with a wide margin in power for moderate\nsample size. The developed methodology performs satisfactorily for the average\ndaily temperature of central England and monthly global average anomaly of\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 17:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Such problems are typically plagued\nwith incomplete information that may enter as uncertainty in the model\nparameters, or even in the model itself. Furthermore, due to their dynamic\nnature, we need to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the transient\nand long-time behavior of the stochastic models and derive corresponding\nuncertainty bounds for observables of interest. A special class of such\nchallenges is parametric uncertainties in the model and in particular\nsensitivity analysis along with the corresponding sensitivity bounds for\nstochastic dynamics. Moreover, sensitivity analysis can be further complicated\nin models with a high number of parameters that render straightforward\napproaches, such as gradient methods, impractical.

The different versions of\nthis technique combine measurements of the linear diameter variation (from\nspectroscopy) and the angular diameter variation (from photometry or\ninterferometry) amplitudes, to retrieve the distance in a quasi-geometrical\nway. However, the linear diameter amplitude is directly proportional to the\nprojection factor (hereafter p-factor), which is used to convert spectroscopic\nradial velocities (i.e., disk integrated) into pulsating (i.e., photospheric)\nvelocities. The value of the p-factor and its possible dependence on the\npulsation period are still widely debated. Our goal is to measure an\nobservational value of the p-factor of the type-II Cepheid kappa Pavonis, whose\nparallax was measured with an accuracy of 5% using HST/FGS. We used this\nparallax as a starting point to derive the p-factor of kappa Pav, using the\nSPIPS technique, which is a robust version of the parallax-of-pulsation method\nthat employs radial velocity, interferometric and photometric data. We applied\nthis technique to a combination of new VLTI/PIONIER optical interferometric\nangular diameters, new CORALIE and HARPS radial velocities, as well as\nmulti-colour photometry and radial velocities from the literature. We obtain a\nvalue of p = 1.26 +/- 0.07 for the p-factor of kappa Pav. This result agrees\nwith several of the recently derived Period-p-factor relationships from the\nliterature, as well as previous observational determinations for Cepheids.\nIndividual estimates of the p-factor are fundamental to calibrating the\nparallax of pulsation distances of Cepheids. Together with previous\nobservational estimates, the projection factor we obtain points to a weak\ndependence of the p-factor on period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 19:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In the\npresent paper, by employing Regge phenomenology, we first express the mass of\nthe ground state ($L$=0) doubly charmed baryon $\\Omega_{cc}^{*+}$ as a function\nof masses of the well established light baryons and singly charmed baryons.\nInserting the recent experimental data, the mass of $\\Omega_{cc}^{*+}$ is given\nto be 3809$\\pm$36 MeV, which is independent of any unobservable parameters.\nThen, with the quadratic mass relations, we calculate the masses of the ground\nstate triply charmed baryon $\\Omega_{ccc}^{++}$ and doubly charmed baryons\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)++}$, $\\Xi_{cc}^{(*)+}$, and $\\Omega_{cc}^{+}$ (the mass of\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ is determined as 3520$^{+41}_{-40}$ MeV, which agrees with the\nmass of $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}(3520)$). The isospin splitting $M_{\\Xi_{cc}^{++}} -\nM_{\\Xi_{cc}^{+}} = 0.4 \\pm 0.3$ MeV. After that, masses of the orbitally\nexcited ($L$=1,2,3) doubly and triply charmed baryons are estimated. The\nresults are reasonable comparing with those extracted in many other approaches.\nWe suggest more efforts to study doubly and triply charmed baryons both\ntheoretically and experimentally, not only for the abundance of baryon spectra,\nbut also for numerically examining whether the linear mass relations or the\nquadratic mass relations are realized in nature. Our predictions are useful for\nthe discovery of unobserved doubly and triply charmed baryon states and the\n$J^P$ assignment of these states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 19:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 17:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 10:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

The kinematic properties of galaxies\nas traced by emission lines have been used to suggest the existence of a\nsignificant population of high-z star-forming galaxies consistent with isolated\nrotating disks. However, recent studies have cautioned that post-coalescence\nmergers may also display disk-like kinematics. To further investigate the\nrobustness of merger/disk classifications based on kinematic properties, we\ncarry out a systematic classification of 24 local (U)LIRGs spanning a range of\ngalaxy morphologies: from isolated spiral galaxies, ongoing interacting\nsystems, to fully merged remnants. We artificially redshift the WiFeS\nobservations of these local (U)LIRGs to z=1.5 to make a realistic comparison\nwith observations at high-z, and also to ensure that all galaxies have the same\nspatial sampling of ~900 pc. Using both kinemetry-based and visual\nclassifications, we find that the reliability of kinematic classification shows\na strong trend with the interaction stage of galaxies. Mergers with two nuclei\nand tidal tails have the most distinct kinematic properties compared to\nisolated disks, whereas a significant population of the interacting disks and\nmerger remnants are indistinguishable from isolated disks. The high fraction of\nlate-stage mergers showing disk-like kinematics reflects the complexity of the\ndynamics during galaxy interactions. However, the exact fractions of\nmisidentified disks and mergers depend on the definition of kinematic\nasymmetries and the classification threshold when using kinemetry-based\nclassifications.

Two possibilities have been put forward: either the WD grows\nin mass during CV evolution, or in a significant fraction of cases, CV\nformation is preceded by a (short) phase of thermal time-scale mass transfer\n(TTMT) in which the WD gains a sufficient amount of mass. We investigate if\neither of these two scenarios can bring theoretical predictions and\nobservations into agreement. We employed binary population synthesis models to\nsimulate the present intrinsic CV population. We incorporated aspects specific\nto CV evolution such as an appropriate mass-radius relation of the donor star\nand a more detailed prescription for the critical mass ratio for dynamically\nunstable mass transfer. We also implemented a previously suggested wind from\nthe surface of the WD during TTMT and tested the idea of WD mass growth during\nthe CV phase by arbitrarily changing the accretion efficiency. We compare the\nmodel predictions with the characteristics of CVs derived from observed\nsamples. We find that mass growth of the WDs in CVs fails to reproduce the\nobserved WD mass distribution. In the case of TTMT, we are able to produce a\nlarge number of massive WDs if we assume significant mass loss from the surface\nof the WD during the TTMT phase. However, the model still produces too many CVs\nwith helium WDs. Moreover, the donor stars are evolved in many of these\npost-TTMT CVs, which contradicts the observations.

By applying the matching condition, we\nshow massless excitations are enforced by the anomalies in a whole phase\ndiagram in sharp contrast to the case of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theory\nwhich only has massive excitations in symmetric phases. Furthermore, we find\nnon-perturbative criteria to characterize quantum phase transitions between\ncompeting orders. For example, in 4D, we show the two competing order parameter\ntheories, CP(1) and the NLSM with WZW, describe different universality class.\nPhysical realizations and experimental implication of the anomalies are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 20:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 21:22:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 00:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Because they form a relatively homogeneous\npopulation, with high stellar masses and red colors, they are expected to\noccupy halos in a relatively simple way. In this paper, we study how LRGs\noccupy massive halos via direct counts in clusters and we reveal several\nunexpected trends suggesting that the connection between LRGs and dark matter\nhalos may not be straightforward. Using the redMaPPer cluster catalog, we\nderive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness, Ncen({\\lambda}).\nAssuming no correlation between cluster mass and central galaxy luminosity at\nfixed richness, we show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of\ncentral LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function. At halo\nmasses of 10^14.5 Msun, we find Ncen=0.73, compared to Ncen of 0.89 from\ncorrelation studies. Our central occupation function for LRGs converges to 0.95\nat large halo masses. A strong anti-correlation between central luminosity and\ncluster mass at fixed richness is required to reconcile our results with those\nbased on clustering studies. We also derive P_BNC, the probability that the\nbrightest cluster member is not the central galaxy. We find P_BNC ~ 20-30%\nwhich is a factor of ~2 lower than the value found by Skibba et al. 2011.\nFinally, we study the radial offsets of bright non-central LRGs from cluster\ncenters and show that bright non-central LRGs follow a different radial\ndistribution compared to red cluster members, which follow a\nNavarro-Frank-White profile. This work demonstrates that even the most massive\nclusters do not always have an LRG at the center, and that the brightest galaxy\nin a cluster is not always the central galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 20:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 01:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$).

The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it.

Future observations (e.g. by ALMA) of disc masses and\naccretion rates onto substellar objects that have even lower masses (young\nplanets and young, low-mass brown dwarfs), where the scaling relations\npredicted by the disc fragmentation model diverge significantly from the\ncorresponding relations established for higher-mass stars, will test the\npredictions of this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 20:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We\ncan't sketch these distances easily, or embed them in better behaved spaces, or\neven reduce the dimensionality of the space while maintaining the probability\nstructure of the data.\n  In this paper, we build these tools for information distances---both for the\nHellinger distance and Jensen--Shannon divergence, as well as related measures,\nlike the $\\chi^2$ divergence. We first show that they can be sketched\nefficiently (i.e. up to multiplicative error in sublinear space) in the\naggregate streaming model. This result is exponentially stronger than known\nupper bounds for sketching these distances in the strict turnstile streaming\nmodel. Second, we show a finite dimensionality embedding result for the\nJensen-Shannon and $\\chi^2$ divergences that preserves pair wise distances.\nFinally we prove a dimensionality reduction result for the Hellinger,\nJensen--Shannon, and $\\chi^2$ divergences that preserves the information\ngeometry of the distributions (specifically, by retaining the simplex structure\nof the space). While our second result above already implies that these\ndivergences can be explicitly embedded in Euclidean space, retaining the\nsimplex structure is important because it allows us to continue doing inference\nin the reduced space.

Our new spectroscopy reveals a range of complex source\nbehavior.

Moreover, with the\nanticipated vision that mmWave networks would have a dense deployment of base\nstations, interference from strong line-of-sight base stations increases too,\nthus further increasing the probability of outage. To address the issue of\nreducing outage, this paper explores the possibility of base station\ncooperation in the downlink of a mmWave heterogenous network. The main focus of\nthis work is showing that, in a stochastic geometry framework, cooperation from\nrandomly located base stations decreases outage probability. With the presumed\nvision that less severe fading will be experienced due to highly directional\ntransmissions, one might expect that cooperation would increase the coverage\nprobability; our numerical examples suggest that is in fact the case. Coverage\nprobabilities are derived accounting for: different fading distributions,\nantenna directionality and blockage. Numerical results suggest that coverage\nwith base station cooperation in dense mmWave systems and with no small scale\nfading considerably exceeds coverage with no cooperation. In contrast, an\ninsignificant increase is reported when mmWave networks are less dense with a\nhigh probability of signal blockage and with Rayleigh fading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 02:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Therefore, there are\ntwo types of service requests to the DC, i.e., new requests (NRs) initiated in\nthe local service area and migration requests (MRs) generated when mobile users\nmove across service areas. A novel resource management scheme is proposed to\nhelp the resource manager decide whether to accept the service requests (NRs or\nMRs) or not and determine how much resources should be allocated to each\nservice (if accepted). The optimization objective is to maximize the average\nsystem reward and keep the rejection probability of service requests under a\ncertain threshold. Numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme can\nsignificantly improve the overall system utility as well as the user experience\ncompared with other resource management schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 02:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

While such\ntechniques have been applied to galaxy-scale and cluster-scale lenses, the\npaucity of intermediate-mass systems with high-quality data has precluded a\nuniform analysis of mass-dependent trends. With the aim of bridging this gap,\nwe present new observations and analyses of 10 group-scale lenses at <z>=0.36\ncharacterized by Einstein radii theta_Ein=2.5\"-5.1\" and a mean halo mass of\nM_200=10^14.0 Msol.

A very extensive literature\nexists about the assumption of a dipolar magnetic field but very little\nprogress has been made in attempts to include multipolar components in a\nself-consistent way. In this paper, we study the effect of multipolar\nelectromagnetic fields anchored in the star. We give exact analytical solutions\nin closed form for any order $l$ and apply them to the retarded point\nquadrupole ($l=2$), hexapole ($l=3$) and octopole ($l=4$), a generalization of\nthe retarded point dipole ($l=1$). We also compare the Poynting flux from each\nmultipole and show that the spin down luminosity depends on the ratio $R/r_{\\rm\nL}$, $R$ being the neutron star radius and $r_{\\rm L}$ the light-cylinder\nradius. Therefore the braking index also depends on $R/r_{\\rm L}$. As such\nmultipole fields possess very different topology, most importantly smaller\nlength scales compared to the dipolar field, especially close to the neutron\nstar, we investigate the deformation of the polar caps induced by these\nmultipolar fields. Such fields could have a strong impact on the interpretation\nof the pulsed radio emission suspected to emanate from these polar caps as well\nas on the inferred geometry deduced from the high-energy light-curve fitting\nand on the magnetic field strength. Discrepancies between the two-pole caustic\nmodel and our new multipole-caustic model are emphasized with the quadrupole\nfield.

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the\nlimits and advantages of pixel-ICA on a series of simulated datasets with\ndifferent instrument properties, and a range of jitter timescales and shapes,\nnon-stationarity, sudden change points, etc. The performances of pixel-ICA are\ncompared against the ones of other methods, in particular polynomial centroid\ndivision (PCD), and pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) method (Deming et al.\n2014). We find that in simulated cases pixel-ICA performs as well or better\nthan other methods, and it also guarantees a higher degree of objectivity,\nbecause of its purely statistical foundation with no prior information on the\ninstrument systematics. The results of this paper, together with previous\nanalyses of Spitzer/IRAC datasets, suggest that photometric precision and\nrepeatability of one part in $10^4$ can be achieved with current infrared space\ninstruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 08:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 21:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We couple a continuum source to\nfragmented equatorial scattering regions, polar outflows, and toroidal,\nobscuring dust regions and investigate a wide range of geometries. We also\nconsider different levels of fragmentation in each scattering region to\nevaluate importance of fragmentation for the net polarization of the AGN. We\nfind that, in comparison with uniform-density models, equatorial distributions\nof gas and dust clouds result in grayer spectra, and show a decrease of the net\npolarization percentage at all lines of sight. The resulting polarization\nposition angle depends on the morphology of the clumpy structure, with extended\ntori favoring parallel polarization while compact tori produce orthogonal\npolarization position angles. In the case of polar scattering regions,\nfragmentation increases the net polarization unless the cloud filling factor is\nsmall. A complete set of AGN models constructed from the individual, fragmented\nregions is investigated. Our modeling shows that the introduction of fragmented\ndusty tori significantly alters the resulting net polarization of an AGN.\nComparison of our models to polarization observations of large AGN samples\ngreatly favors geometrically compact clumpy tori over extended ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 09:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

However, reducing their energy is challenging\ndue to their tight response time requirements. A key aspect of OLDIs is that\neach user query goes to all or many of the nodes in the cluster, so that the\noverall time budget is dictated by the tail of the replies' latency\ndistribution; replies see latency variations both in the network and compute.\nPrevious work proposes to achieve load-proportional energy by slowing down the\ncomputation at lower datacenter loads based directly on response times (i.e.,\nat lower loads, the proposal exploits the average slack in the time budget\nprovisioned for the peak load). In contrast, we propose TimeTrader to reduce\nenergy by exploiting the latency slack in the sub- critical replies which\narrive before the deadline (e.g., 80% of replies are 3-4x faster than the\ntail). This slack is present at all loads and subsumes the previous work's\nload-related slack. While the previous work shifts the leaves' response time\ndistribution to consume the slack at lower loads, TimeTrader reshapes the\ndistribution at all loads by slowing down individual sub-critical nodes without\nincreasing missed deadlines. TimeTrader exploits slack in both the network and\ncompute budgets. Further, TimeTrader leverages Earliest Deadline First\nscheduling to largely decouple critical requests from the queuing delays of\nsub- critical requests which can then be slowed down without hurting critical\nrequests. A combination of real-system measurements and at-scale simulations\nshows that without adding to missed deadlines, TimeTrader saves 15-19% and\n41-49% energy at 90% and 30% loading, respectively, in a datacenter with 512\nnodes, whereas previous work saves 0% and 31-37%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 11:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Hence, the observed decay timescale of the\nquasifission or fission process of even highly excited (EX greater than 50 MeV)\ntransuranium and uraniumlike complexes should be rather long (of the order of\nattosecond) in spite of their very fast exponential decay timescale (of the\norder of zeptosecond) as measured by the nuclear techniques.

We find that the state of\nthe produced pairs is indeed strongly constrained but that the semiclassical\nmodel is consistent with all requirements. We are led to the following picture:\nInitially, the pairs are produced in a state of nearly maximal entanglement\namongst the partners, with a parametrically small entanglement between each\npositive-energy partner and the outgoing radiation, similar to Hawking's model.\nBut, as the BH evaporation progresses past the Page time, each positive-energy\npartner has a stronger entanglement with the outgoing radiation and,\nconsequently, is less strongly entangled with its negative-energy partner.

Using the multiple fluid approach we\nsolve the time-dependent equations in two dimensions considering the frictional\ncoupling between the neutral and ionized components of the magnetized plasma\nrepresentative of a solar prominence embedded in a hot coronal environment. We\ndemonstrate that given an initial density enhancement in the two fluids,\nrepresenting the body of the prominence, the system is able to relax in the\nvicinity of magnetic dips to a stationary state in which both neutrals and\nionized species are dynamically suspended above the photosphere. Two different\ncoupling processes are considered in this study, collisions between ions and\nneutrals and charge exchange interactions. We find that for realistic\nconditions ions are essentially static while neutrals have a very small\ndownflow velocity. The coupling between ions and neutrals is so strong at the\nprominence body that the behavior is similar to that of a single fluid with an\neffective density equal to the sum of the ion and neutral species. We also find\nthat the charge exchange mechanism is about three times more efficient\nsustaining neutrals than elastic scattering of ions with neutrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 11:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This paper shows how\nto obtain the period error in such measurements from a basic linear\nleast-squares fit, and how to correctly derive the timing error in the\nprediction of future transit or eclipse events. Assuming strict periodicity, a\nformula for the period error of such time series is derived: sigma_P = sigma_T\n(12/( N^3-N))^0.5, where sigma_P is the period error; sigma_T the timing error\nof a single measurement and N the number of measurements. Relative to the\niterative method for period error estimation by Mighell & Plavchan (2013), this\nmuch simpler formula leads to smaller period errors, whose correctness has been\nverified through simulations. For the prediction of times of future periodic\nevents, the usual linear ephemeris where epoch errors are quoted for the first\ntime measurement, are prone to overestimation of the error of that prediction.\nThis may be avoided by a correction for the duration of the time series. An\nalternative is the derivation of ephemerides whose reference epoch and epoch\nerror are given for the centre of the time series. For long continuous or\nnear-continuous time series whose acquisition is completed, such central epochs\nshould be the preferred way for the quotation of linear ephemerides. While this\nwork was motivated from the analysis of eclipse timing measures in space-based\nlight curves, it should be applicable to any other problem with an\nuninterrupted sequence of discrete timings for which the determination of a\nzero point, of a constant period and of the associated errors is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 12:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In\nthe combined model, where the densities are low enough that at least some part\nof the spectrum is optically thin, a model of the thermodynamics of the diffuse\nISM is more significant in setting the temperatures. Where the densities are\nhigh enough to be optically thick across the spectrum, a model of flux limited\ndiffusion is more appropriate. Previous methods either model the low-density\ninterstellar medium and ignore the thermal behaviour at high densities (e.g.\ninside collapsing molecular cloud cores), or model the thermal behaviour near\nprotostars but assume a fixed background temperature (e.g. approximately 10 K)\non large-scales.

We\ncompare our results with those from the literature, and investigate the\ndependence of the thermal behaviour of the gas on the various model parameters.\nThis new method should allow us to model the ISM across a wide range of\ndensities and, thus, develop a more complete and consistent understanding of\nthe role of thermodynamics in the star formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 12:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

In particular, it was estimated to what extent the\ncombined information from multiple detections would enable one to distinguish\nbetween different equations of state through hypothesis ranking or parameter\nestimation. Under the assumption of zero neutron star spins both in signals and\nin template waveforms and considering tidal effects to 1 post-Newtonian (1PN)\norder, it was found that O(20) sources would suffice to distinguish between a\nhard, moderate, and soft equation of state. Here we revisit these results, this\ntime including neutron star tidal effects to the highest order currently known,\ntermination of gravitational waveforms at the contact frequency, neutron star\nspins, and the resulting quadrupole-monopole interaction. We also take the\nmasses of neutron stars in simulated sources to be distributed according to a\nrelatively strongly peaked Gaussian, as hinted at by observations, but without\nassuming that the data analyst will necessarily have accurate knowledge of this\ndistribution for use as a mass prior. We find that especially the effect of the\nlatter is dramatic, necessitating many more detections to distinguish between\ndifferent EOS and causing systematic biases in parameter estimation, on top of\nbiases due to imperfect understanding of the signal model pointed out in\nearlier work. This would get mitigated if reliable prior information about the\nmass distribution could be folded into the analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 13:39:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 14:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

In this paper, we apply the method to two transiting hot Jupiter\nsystems monitored with the Kepler spacecraft, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-7. For\nKepler-13A, we find $i_\\star=81^\\circ\\pm5^\\circ$ and $\\psi=60^\\circ\\pm2^\\circ$\nadopting the spectroscopic constraint $\\lambda=58.6^\\circ\\pm2.0^\\circ$ by\nJohnson et al. (2014). In our solution, the discrepancy between the above\n$\\lambda$ and that previously reported by Barnes et al. (2011) is solved by\nfitting both of the two parameters in the quadratic limb-darkening law. We also\nreport the temporal variation in the orbital inclination of Kepler-13Ab,\n$\\mathrm{d} |\\cos i_{\\rm\norb}|/\\mathrm{d}t=(-7.0\\pm0.4)\\times10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, providing\nfurther evidence for the spin-orbit precession in this system.

The Stackelberg Pricing Game\n(SPG) is employed to obtain the optimal price and shared resource amount of\neach SP. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by\nsystem simulation and the results indicate that the SPG-based load scheduling\nalgorithm can significantly improve the time gain in mobile grid systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 02:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

In this paper, controllability of\nmulti-agent systems under directed topologies is studied, especially on leader\nselection problem and weight adjustment problem. For a given system, necessary\nand sufficient algebraic conditions for controllability with fewest leaders are\nproposed. From another perspective, when leaders are fixed, controllability\ncould be improved by adjusting edge weights, and therefore the system is\nsupposed to be structurally controllable, which holds if and only if the\ncommunication topology contains a spanning tree. It is also proved that the\nnumber of fewest edges needed to be assigned on new weights equals the rank\ndeficiency of controllability matrix. An algorithm on how to perform weight\nadjustment is presented.

Unlike gapless\ngraphene, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) has new optical\nfunctionalities for next generation ultra-compact electronic and\nopto-electronic devices. When TMDC crystals are thinned down to monolayers,\nthey undergo an indirect to direct bandgap transition, making it an outstanding\n2D semiconductor. Unique electron valley degree of freedom, strong light matter\ninteractions and excitonic effects were observed. Enhancement of spontaneous\nemission has been reported on TMDC monolayers integrated with photonic crystal\nand distributed Bragg reflector microcavities. However, the coherent light\nemission from 2D monolayer TMDC has not been demonstrated, mainly due to that\nan atomic membrane has limited material gain volume and is lack of optical mode\nconfinement. Here, we report the first realization of 2D excitonic laser by\nembedding monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) in a microdisk resonator. Using a\nwhispering gallery mode (WGM) resonator with a high quality factor and optical\nconfinement, we observed bright excitonic lasing in visible wavelength. The\nSi3N4/WS2/HSQ sandwich configuration provides a strong feedback and mode\noverlap with monolayer gain. This demonstration of 2D excitonic laser marks a\nmajor step towards 2D on-chip optoelectronics for high performance optical\ncommunication and computing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 05:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}
