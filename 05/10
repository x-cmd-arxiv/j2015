Hierarchical sky tessellation techniques enable a multi-resolution\napproach to organising data on angular scales from the full sky down to the\nindividual image pixels. Aims. We aim to show that the Hierarchical progressive\nsurvey (HiPS) scheme for describing astronomical images, source catalogues, and\nthree-dimensional data cubes is a practical solution to managing large volumes\nof heterogeneous data and that it enables a new level of scientific\ninteroperability across large collections of data of these different data\ntypes. Methods. HiPS uses the HEALPix tessellation of the sphere to define a\nhierarchical tile and pixel structure to describe and organise astronomical\ndata. HiPS is designed to conserve the scientific properties of the data\nalongside both visualisation considerations and emphasis on the ease of\nimplementation. We describe the development of HiPS to manage a large number of\ndiverse image surveys, as well as the extension of hierarchical image systems\nto cube and catalogue data.

Hierarchical progressive surveys have been\ngenerated by various data centres and groups for ~200 data collections\nincluding many wide area sky surveys, and archives of pointed observations.\nThese can be accessed and visualised in Aladin, Aladin Lite, and other\napplications.

If such a graph has finite valency,\nthen its valency is even, and greater than $2$. In 1970, Bouwer proved that\nthere exists a half-arc-transitive graph of every even valency greater than 2,\nby giving a construction for a family of graphs now known as $B(k,m,n)$,\ndefined for every triple $(k,m,n)$ of integers greater than $1$ with $2^m\n\\equiv 1 \\mod n$. In each case, $B(k,m,n)$ is a $2k$-valent vertex- and\nedge-transitive graph of order $mn^{k-1}$, and Bouwer showed that $B(k,6,9)$ is\nhalf-arc-transitive for all $k > 1$.\n  For almost 45 years the question of exactly which of Bouwer's graphs are\nhalf-arc-transitive and which are arc-transitive has remained open, despite\nmany attempts to answer it. In this paper, we use a cycle-counting argument to\nprove that almost all of the graphs constructed by Bouwer are\nhalf-arc-transitive. In fact, we prove that $B(k,m,n)$ is arc-transitive only\nwhen $n = 3$, or $(k,n) = (2,5)$, % and $m$ is a multiple of $4$, or $(k,m,n) =\n(2,3,7)$ or $(2,6,7)$ or $(2,6,21)$. In particular, $B(k,m,n)$ is\nhalf-arc-transitive whenever $m > 6$ and $n > 5$.

To study and explain this behavior, this paper focuses on general\nsingle-tier network models with nearest-base station association and studies\nthe asymptotic gain both at 0 and at infinity.\n  We show that the gain at 0 is determined by the so-called mean\ninterference-to-signal ratio (MISR) between the PPP and the network model under\nconsideration, while the gain at infinity is determined by the expected\nfading-to-interference ratio (EFIR).\n  The analysis of the MISR is based on a novel type of point process, the\nso-called relative distance process, which is a one-dimensional point process\non the unit interval [0,1] that fully determines the SIR. A comparison of the\ngains at 0 and infinity shows that the gain at 0 indeed provides an excellent\napproximation for the entire SIR distribution.

The main parameter for MUs is the \"deficiency\" k, the\ndifference between the number of clauses and the number of variables (the\ndifference between the number of elements in the covering and the dimension of\nthe hypercube), and the fundamental fact is that k >= 1 holds.\n  A \"full clause\" in an MU contains all variables (corresponding to a singleton\nin the covering).

On the arithmetical side, analysing\ncertain recursions, combining an application-specific recursion with a\nrecursion from the field of meta-Fibonacci sequences (indeed S_2 equals twice\nthe Conolly sequence).\n  A further tool is the consideration of unsatisfiable \"hitting clause-sets\"\n(UHITs), special cases of MUs, which correspond to the partitions of the\nboolean hypercube by subcubes; they are also known as orthogonal or disjoint\nDNF tautologies.

Whether it is a password for user authentication or a secret key\nfor a cryptographic primitive, picking it requires the user to trade-off\nusability costs with resistance against an adversary: a simple password is\neasier to remember but is also easier to guess; likewise, a shorter\ncryptographic key may require fewer computational and storage resources but it\nis also easier to attack. A fundamental question is how one can optimally\nresolve this trade-off. A big challenge is the fact that an adversary can also\nutilize the knowledge of such usability vs. security trade-offs to strengthen\nits attack. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for analyzing\nthe optimal trade-offs in the face of strategic adversaries. We consider two\ntypes of adversaries: those limited in their number of tries, and those that\nare ruled by the cost of making individual guesses. For each type, we derive\nthe mutually-optimal decisions as Nash Equilibria, the strategically\npessimistic decisions as maximin, and optimal commitments as Strong Stackelberg\nEquilibria of the game. We establish that when the adversaries are faced with a\ncapped number of guesses, the user's optimal trade-off is a uniform\nrandomization over a subset of the secret domain. On the other hand, when the\nattacker strategy is ruled by the cost of making individual guesses, Nash\nEquilibria may completely fail to provide the user with any level of security,\nsignifying the crucial role of credible commitment for such cases. We\nillustrate our results using numerical examples based on real-world samples and\ndiscuss some policy implications of our work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2015 22:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

We demonstrate that the application of\na uniform magnetic field B in these cloaks may not only switch on and off the\ncloaking mechanism, but also mitigate the electromagnetic (EM) absorption. We\nalso prove that the scattered field profile can be effectively controlled by\nchanging B.\n  The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of light-matter\ninteractions mediated by fluctuations of the vacuum EM field. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that the Purcell effect can be effectively suppressed for an\nexcited atom near a cloaking device. Furthermore, the decay rate of a quantum\nemitter near a graphene-coated wall under the influence of an external magnetic\nfield is studied. We show that the MO properties of graphene strongly affect\nthe atomic lifetime and that B allows for an unprecedented control of the decay\nchannels of the system. In addition, we discuss the dispersive interaction\nbetween an atom and suspended graphene in a magnetic field. For large\natom-graphene separations and low temperatures we show that the interaction\nenergy is a quantized function of B.

Our experiments show\nthat the received signal strength (RSS) at a WiFi-enabled device held on a\nperson's chest is affected by the breathing process. This effect extends to\nscenarios when the person is situated on the line-of-sight (LOS) between the\naccess point and the device, even without holding it.

The system handles various challenges such as noise\nelimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting\nabnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using\noff-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it\ncan estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute\n(bpm) error. In addition, UbiBreathe can detect apnea with more than 96%\naccuracy in both the device-on-chest and hands-free scenarios.
