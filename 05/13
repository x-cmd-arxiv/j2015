To investigate such cooperativity we study the frictional\nbinding between two flow driven surfaces that interact through a large\npopulation of activated bonds.

We find considerable\ncooperativity between both types of bonds. Under some conditions the system\nbehaves as if there were only one binding mode, corresponding to a strong and\nfast forming bond.

Not\nonly does it deliver a differential observable providing extra contrast, but\nwhen coupled with spectroscopy, it also reveals valuable information on the\nexoplanetary atmospheric composition. Nevertheless, angular separation and\ncontrast ratio to the host-star make for extremely challenging observation.\nProducing detailed predictions for exactly how the expected signals should\nappear is of critical importance for the designs and observational strategies\nof tomorrow's telescopes. We aim at accurately determining the magnitudes and\nevolution of the main observational signatures for imaging an exoplanet:\nseparation, contrast ratio to the host-star and polarization as a function of\nthe orbital geometry and the reflectance parameters of the exoplanet. These\nparameters were used to construct polarized-reflectance model based on the\ninput of orbital parameters and two albedo values. The model is able to\ncalculate a variety of observational predictions for exoplanets at any orbital\ntime. The inter-dependency of the three main observational criteria\n-separation, contrast ratio, polarization- result in a complex time-evolution\nof the system. They greatly affect the viability of planet observation by\ndirect imaging. We introduce a new generic display of the main observational\ncriteria, which enables an observer to determine whether an exoplanet is within\ndetection limits: the Separation-POlarization-Contrast diagrams (SPOC). We\nexplore the complex effect of orbital and albedo parameters on the visibility\nof an exoplanet.

With\ntime-dependent dispersion, it is possible to implement arbitrary\nsingle-particle unitaries.

We find that dark matter subhalos are typically rounder in MBII,\nand the shapes of stellar matter in low mass galaxies are more misaligned with\nthe shapes of the dark matter of the corresponding subhalos in the DMO\nsimulation. At $z=0.06$, the fractional difference in the mean misalignment\nangle between MBII and DMO simulations varies from $\\sim 28 \\% - 12 \\%$ in the\nmass range $10^{10.8} - 6.0 \\times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$.

This result highlights the importance of\nbaryonic physics in determining the alignment of the galaxy with respect to the\ninner parts of the halo.

The primary mechanism\nresponsible for quenching star formation in galaxies and transforming them into\nquiescent and passive systems is still unclear. Sudden removal of gas through\noutflows or stripping is one of the mechanisms often proposed. An alternative\nmechanism is so-called \"strangulation\", in which the supply of cold gas to the\ngalaxy is halted. Here we report that the difference between quiescent and star\nforming galaxies in terms of stellar metallicity (i.e. the fraction of metals\nheavier than helium in stellar atmospheres) can be used to discriminate\nefficiently between the two mechanisms. The analysis of the stellar metallicity\nin local galaxies, from 26,000 spectra, clearly reveals that strangulation is\nthe primary mechanism responsible for quenching star formation, with a typical\ntimescale of 4 billion years, at least for local galaxies with a stellar mass\nless than 10^11 solar masses. This result is further supported independently by\nthe stellar age difference between quiescent and star-forming galaxies, which\nindicates that quiescent galaxies of less than 10^11 solar masses are on\naverage observed four billion years after quenching due to strangulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

This uncertainty about the underlying physics has resulted\nin various different star formation laws, all having substantial intrinsic\nscatter. Extending upon previous works that define the column density of star\nformation (Sigma_SFR) by the gas column density (Sigma_gas), we develop a new\nuniversal star formation (SF) law based on the multi-freefall prescription of\ngas. This new SF law relies predominantly on the probability density function\n(PDF) and on the sonic Mach number of the turbulence in the star-forming\nclouds. By doing so we derive a relation where the star formation rate (SFR)\ncorrelates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time, whereas\nprevious models had used the average, single-freefall time. We define a new\nquantity called maximum (multi-freefall) gas consumption rate (MGCR) and show\nthat the actual SFR is only about 0.4% of this maximum possible SFR, confirming\nthe observed low efficiency of star formation. We show that placing\nobservations in this new framework (Sigma_SFR vs. MGCR) yields a significantly\nimproved correlation with 3-4 times reduced scatter compared to previous SF\nlaws and a goodness-of-fit parameter R^2=0.97.

The first belt lies\nbeyond the orbit of the outer planet, and mirrors our Solar system's\nEdgeworth-Kuiper belt. The second belt lies interior to the orbit of the inner\nplanet, HR8799e, and is analogous to our Asteroid Belt. With such a similar\narchitecture, the system is a valuable laboratory for examining exoplanet\ndynamics, and the interaction between debris disks and planets.\n  In recent years, HR8799's outer disk has been relatively well characterised,\nprimarily using the Herschel Space Observatory. In contrast, the inner disk,\ntoo close to HR8799 to be spatially resolved by Herschel, remains poorly\nunderstood. This leaves significant questions over both the location of the\nplanetesimals responsible for producing the observed dust, and the physical\nproperties of those grains.\n  We have performed extensive simulations of HR8799's inner, unresolved debris\nbelt, using UNSW Australia's supercomputing facility, Katana. Here, we present\nthe results of integrations following the evolution of a belt of dynamically\nhot debris interior to the orbit of HR8799e, for a period of 60 Myr, using an\ninitial population of 500,000 massless test particles. These simulations have\nenable the characterisation of the extent and structure of the inner belt,\nrevealing that its outer edge must lie interior to the 3:1 mean-motion\nresonance with HR8799, at approximately 7.5au, and highlighting the presence of\nfine structure analogous to the Solar system's Kirkwood gaps. In the future,\nout results will allow us to calculate a first estimate of the small-body\nimpact rate and water delivery prospects for any potential terrestrial\nplanet(s) that might lurk, undetected, in the inner system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 00:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

It generates spatially\ncoherent yet detail-preserving, pixel-accurate and fine-grained saliency, and\novercomes the limitations of previous methods which use homogeneous\nsuperpixel-based and color only treatment. PISA aggregates multiple saliency\ncues in a global context such as complementary color and structure contrast\nmeasures with their spatial priors in the image domain. The saliency confidence\nis further jointly modeled with a neighborhood consistence constraint into an\nenergy minimization formulation, in which each pixel will be evaluated with\nmultiple hypothetical saliency levels. Instead of using global discrete\noptimization methods, we employ the cost-volume filtering technique to solve\nour formulation, assigning the saliency levels smoothly while preserving the\nedge-aware structure details. In addition, a faster version of PISA is\ndeveloped using a gradient-driven image sub-sampling strategy to greatly\nimprove the runtime efficiency while keeping comparable detection accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on a number of public datasets suggest that PISA\nconvincingly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Using hybrid\ndensity functional calculations, we investigate the atomic, electronic and\nmagnetic structure of BiCoO$_3$ to elucidate the origin of the multiferroic\nstate. To begin with, we perform a qualitative trend sudy of the role of $d$\nelectrons in affecting the tendency for perovskite materials to exhibit a\nferroelectric distortion; this work initially explores a qualitative trend\nstudy in artificial cubic and tetragonal LaBO$_3$ perovskites. We choose La as\nthe A-cation so as to remove the effects of Bi $6s$ hybridization. Through\nfirst-principles calculations of the LaBO$_3$ series, where B is a $d^0 - d^8$\ncation from the $3d$-block, the trend study reveals that increasing the $d$\norbital occupation initially removes the tendency for a polar distortion, as\nexpected. However, for high spin $d^5-d^7$ and $d^8$ cations a strong\nferroelectric instability is recovered. We explained this effect in terms of\nthe pseudo Jahn-Teller theory for ferroelectricity. It is shown that, in some\ncases, unpaired electron spins actually drive ferroelectricity, rather than\ninhibit it, which represents a shift in the understanding of how\nferroelectricity and magnetism interact in perovskite oxides. It follows, that\nfor the case of BiCoO$_3$, the Co$^{3+}$ ion plays a major role in the\nferroelectric lattice instability. Importantly, the ferroelectric polarization\nis greatly enhanced when the Co$^{3+}$ ion is in the high spin state, when\ncompared to the nonmagnetic, low spin state, and a large coupling of the\nelectrical and magnetic polarization is present. Importantly, it is\ndemonstrated that the ground spin state is switched by reducing the internal\nferroelectric polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 05:27:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 08:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 21:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 00:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We present a particular second order r-mode\nsolution with vanishing secular drift, thus refuting a widely believed\nstatement that secular drift is an unavoidable feature of r-modes.

For\ngeneral second order r-mode solution the drift does not necessarily vanish, but\nthe solution can be presented as a superposition of two solutions: one\ndescribes evolution of differential rotation in nonoscillating star (which\ndescribes secular drift; for nonmagnetized star it is arbitrary stationary\nrotation stratified on cylinders; for magnetized star differential rotation\nevolves on the Alfv\\'{e}n timescale and may lead to magnetic energy\nenhancement), and another one is non-drifting r-mode solution mentioned above.\nThis representation allows us to conclude that enhancement of magnetic field\nenergy is limited by initial energy of differential rotation, which is much\nless (for a factor $\\propto \\alpha^2$, where $\\alpha$ is mode amplitude) than\nthe total energy of r-mode. Hence, magnetic field enhancement by drift cannot\nsuppress r-mode instability.

If a\ncell can store the $q$ levels $0, 1, \\dots, q-1$, we say that it is partially\nstuck-at level $s$, where $1 \\leq s \\leq q-1$, if it can only store values\nwhich are at least $s$. We follow the common setup where the encoder knows the\npositions and levels of the partially stuck-at cells whereas the decoder does\nnot.\n  Our main contribution in the paper is the study of codes for masking $u$\npartially stuck-at cells. We first derive lower and upper bounds on the\nredundancy of such codes. The upper bounds are based on two trivial\nconstructions. We then present three code constructions over an alphabet of\nsize $q$, by first considering the case where the cells are partially stuck-at\nlevel $s=1$. The first construction works for $u<q$ and is asymptotically\noptimal if $u+1$ divides $q$. The second construction uses the reduced row\nEchelon form of matrices to generate codes for the case $u\\geq q$, and the\nthird construction solves the case of arbitrary $u$ by using codes which mask\nbinary stuck-at cells. We then show how to generalize all constructions to\narbitrary stuck levels. Furthermore, we study the dual defect model in which\ncells cannot reach higher levels, and show that codes for partially stuck-at\ncells can be used to mask this type of defects as well. Lastly, we analyze the\ncapacity of the partially stuck-at memory channel and study how far our\nconstructions are from the capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 09:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The first\nspallation reactions induced with an accelerator took place in 1947 at the\nBerkeley cyclotron (University of California) with 200 MeV deuterons and 400\nMeV alpha beams. They highlighted the multiple emission of neutrons and charged\nparticles and the production of a large number of residual nuclei far different\nfrom the target nuclei. The same year R. Serber describes the reaction in two\nsteps: a first and fast one with high-energy particle emission leading to an\nexcited remnant nucleus, and a second one, much slower, the de-excitation of\nthe remnant. In 2010 IAEA organized a worskhop to present the results of the\nmost widely used spallation codes within a benchmark of spallation models. If\none of the goals was to understand the deficiencies, if any, in each code, one\nremarkable outcome points out the overall high-quality level of some models and\nso the great improvements achieved since Serber.

We aim to find\nbinary-evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long-period\norbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three\ndifferent processes are considered; tidally-enhanced wind mass-loss,\nphase-dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a\ncircumbinary disk and the binary. The binary module of the stellar-evolution\ncode MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) is extended to\ninclude the eccentricity-pumping processes. The effects of different input\nparameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are\ntested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind\nmass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,\nand invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite\nhelium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are\nformed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and\ncould help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity\ndiagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a\ncircumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well. A\nremaining problem is that these models favour a distribution of higher\neccentricities at lower periods, while the observed systems show the opposite.\nThe models presented here are potentially capable of explaining the\nperiod-eccentricity distribution of long-period sdB binaries, but further\ntheoretical work on the physical mechanisms is necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 09:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Due to the long duration of the GRB, the burst\ncould be studied in hard X-rays with high-resolution focusing detectors\n(\\emph{NuSTAR}). The blackbody temperature, as measured by the\n\\emph{Swift}/XRT, shows a decreasing trend till the late phase (Piro et al.\n2014) whereas the high-energy data reveals a significant blackbody component\nduring the late epochs at an order of magnitude higher temperature\n($\\sim5$\\,keV), as compared to the contemporaneous low energy data (Bellm et\nal. 2014). We resolve this apparent contradiction by demonstrating that a model\nwith two black bodies and a power-law (2BBPL) is consistent with the data right\nfrom the late prompt emission to the afterglow phase. Both the blackbodies show\na similar cooling behaviour upto the late time. We invoke a structured jet,\nhaving a fast spine and a slower sheath layer, to identify the location of\nthese blackbodies. Independent of the physical interpretation, we propose that\nthe 2BBPL model is a generic feature of the prompt emission of all long GRBs,\nand the thermal emission found in the afterglow phase of different GRBs\nreflects the lingering thermal component of the prompt emission with diverse\ntime-scales. We strengthen this proposal by pointing out a close similarity\nbetween the spectral evolutions of this GRB and GRB~090618, a source with\nsignificant wide band data during the early afterglow phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 09:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We use this technique to theoretically model, simulate\nand validate by experiment the measurement and precise estimation of the\nposition of a cavity mirror. In non-resonant systems, the achieved estimation\nenhancement from quantum smoothing over optimal filtering has not exceeded a\nfactor two, even when squeezed state probes were used. Using a coherent state\nprobe, we show that using quantum smoothing on a mechanically resonant\nstructure driven by a resonant forcing function can result significantly\ngreater improvement in parameter estimation than with non-resonant systems.

Using the faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) framework, Mazo showed\nthat one may transmit symbols carried by sinc pulses at a higher rate than that\ndictated by Nyquist without loosing bit error rate. However, as we will show in\nthis paper, such pulses are not necessarily well localized in time. In fact,\nassuming that signals in the FTN framework are well localized in time, one can\nconstruct a signaling scheme that violates the Shannon capacity bound. We also\nshow directly that FTN signals are in general not well localized in time.\nTherefore, the results of Mazo do not imply that one can transmit more data per\ntime unit without degrading performance in terms of error probability.\n  We also consider FTN signaling in the case of pulses that are different from\nthe sinc pulses. We show that one can use a precoding scheme of low complexity\nto remove the inter-symbol interference.

While one end of the filament\nis chemically active with single monomer (de)polymerization steps, the other\nend is grafted normally to a rigid wall to mimick a rigid network from which\nthe filament under consideration emerges. A second rigid wall, parallel to the\ngrafting wall, is fixed at distance L<<l_p from the filament seed. In\nsupercritical conditions the filament tends to grow and impinges onto the\nsecond surface which, in suitable conditions (non-escaping filament regime)\nstops the filament growth. We first establish the grand-potential and derive\nsome general properties, in particular the filament size distribution and the\nforce exerted by the living filament on the obstacle wall. We apply this\nformalism to the semi-flexible, living, discrete Wormlike chain (d-WLC) model\nwith step size d and persistence length l_p, hitting a hard wall.

The average filament force results from the product of the cumulative\nsize fraction x, where the filament is in contact with the wall, times the\nbuckling force on a filament of size L_c ~ L. We discuss several consequences\nof the L independence of the stalling force for our specific filament model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 10:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 10:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

However,\nobtaining particle size and shape information in situ during manufacturing has\nbeen a big challenge.

We study the\npossible singularities that can be expected in coronal waves and try to\nreproduce the observed dislocations in terms of localization and frequency of\nappearance. The observed dislocations can only be explained by the interference\nof a kink and a sausage wave modes propagating with different frequencies along\nthe coronal magnetic field.

Higher (flute) modes are excluded. The\nkink mode has a pressure amplitude that is smaller than the pressure amplitude\nof the sausage mode, though its observed velocity is larger. This concentrates\ndislocations on the top of the loop.

Therefore, more elaborate methods,\nsuch as ABC with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (ABC-MCMC), should be\nused. However, the elaboration of a proposal density for MCMC is a sensitive\nissue and very difficult in the ABC setting, where the likelihood is\nintractable. We discuss an automatic proposal distribution useful for ABC-MCMC\nalgorithms. This proposal is inspired by the theory of quasi-likelihood (QL)\nfunctions and is obtained by modelling the distribution of the summary\nstatistics as a function of the parameters. Essentially, given a real-valued\nvector of summary statistics, we reparametrize the model by means of a\nregression function of the statistics on parameters, obtained by sampling from\nthe original model in a pilot-run simulation study. The QL theory is well\nestablished for a scalar parameter, and it is shown that when the conditional\nvariance of the summary statistic is assumed constant, the QL has a closed-form\nnormal density. This idea of constructing proposal distributions is extended to\nnon constant variance and to real-valued parameter vectors. The method is\nillustrated by several examples and by an application to a real problem in\npopulation genetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 12:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The quality of such closures is usually difficult to asses and the\nrelationship between model assumptions and closure accuracy are often\ndifficult, if not impossible, to quantify. Here we carefully examine some\ncommonly used moment closures, in particular a new one based on the concept of\nmaximum entropy, for approximating the spread of epidemics on networks by\nreconstructing the probability distributions over triplets based on those over\npairs. We consider various models (SI, SIR, SEIR and Reed-Frost-type) under\nMarkovian and non-Markovian assumption characterising the latent and infectious\nperiods. We initially study two special networks, namely the open triplet and\nclosed triangle, for which we can obtain analytical results. We then explore\nnumerically the exactness of moment closures for a wide range of larger motifs,\nthus gaining understanding of the factors that introduce errors in the\napproximations, in particular the presence of a random duration of the\ninfectious period and the presence of overlapping triangles in a network. We\nalso derive a simpler and more intuitive proof than previously available\nconcerning the known result that pair-based moment closure is exact for the\nMarkovian SIR model on tree-like networks under pure initial conditions. We\nalso extend such a result to all infectious models, Markovian and\nnon-Markovian, in which susceptibles escape infection independently from each\ninfected neighbour and for which infectives cannot regain susceptible status,\nprovided the network is tree-like and initial conditions are pure. This works\nrepresent a valuable step in deepening understanding of the assumptions behind\nmoment closure approximations and for putting them on a more rigorous\nmathematical footing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 12:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Together, these introduce new expressiveness\nand scalability challenges that fall outside the scope of existing network\nverification mechanisms. To address these challenges, we present Armstrong, a\nsystem that enables operators to test if network with stateful data plane\nelements correctly implements a given context-dependent policy. Our design\nmakes three key contributions to address expressiveness and scalability: (1) An\nabstract I/O unit for modeling network I/O that encodes policy-relevant context\ninformation; (2) A practical representation of complex NFs via an ensemble of\nfinite state machines abstraction; and (3) A scalable application of symbolic\nexecution to tackle state space explosion.

On the other hand, they tend to be\ndiffusive and to dampen high-intensity vortical structures after a short\ndistance away from solid boundaries. The use of high order methods and fine\ngrids, although alleviating this problem, gives rise to large systems of\nequations that are expensive to solve.\n  Lagrangian solvers, as the regularized vortex particle method, have shown to\neliminate (in practice) the diffusion in the wake. As a drawback, the modelling\nof solid boundaries is less accurate, more complex and costly than with\nEulerian solvers (due to the isotropy of its computational elements).\n  Given the drawbacks and advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers\nthe combination of both methods, giving rise to a hybrid solver, is\nadvantageous. The main idea behind the hybrid solver presented is the\nfollowing. In a region close to solid boundaries the flow is solved with an\nEulerian solver, where the full Navier-Stokes equations are solved (possibly\nwith an arbitrary turbulence model or DNS, the limitations being the\ncomputational power and the physical properties of the flow), outside of that\nregion the flow is solved with a vortex particle method.\n  In this work we present this hybrid scheme and verify it numerically on known\n2D benchmark cases: dipole flow, flow around a cylinder and flow around a\nstalled airfoil. The success in modelling these flow conditions presents this\nhybrid approach as a promising alternative, bridging the gap between highly\nresolved and computationally intensive Eulerian CFD simulations and fast but\nless resolved Lagrangian simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 13:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 10:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

If the time varying gravitational field\nalso breaks spherical symmetry this mass can potentially carry angular\nmomentum. Thus starting initial configurations with zero angular momentum can\nin principle lead to a bound virialized system with non-zero angular momentum.\nWe explore here, using numerical simulations, how much angular momentum can be\ngenerated in a virialized structure in this way, starting from configurations\nof cold particles which are very close to spherically symmetric. For initial\nconfigurations in which spherical symmetry is broken only by the Poissonian\nfluctuations associated with the finite particle number $N$, with $N$ in range\n$10^3$ to $10^5$, we find that the relaxed structures have standard \"spin\"\nparameters $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-3}$, and decreasing slowly with $N$. For slightly\nellipsoidal initial conditions, in which the finite-$N$ fluctuations break the\nresidual reflection symmetries, we observe values $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-2}$, of\nthe same order of magnitude as those reported for elliptical galaxies. The net\nangular momentum vector is typically aligned close to normal to the major\nsemi-axis of the triaxial relaxed structure, and also with that of the ejected\nmass.

In this work we\nuse 2D hydrodynamical simulations to examine the evolution of a viscous\nprotoplanetary disk in which a luminous Jupiter-mass planet is embedded. We use\nan energy equation which includes the radiative heating of the planet as an\nadditional mechanism for planet formation feedback. Several models are computed\nfor planet luminosities ranging from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$ Solar luminosities.\nWe find that the planet radiative feedback enhances the disk's accretion rate\nat the planet's orbital radius, producing a hotter and more luminous\nenvironement around the planet, independently of the prescription used to model\nthe disk's turbulent viscosity. We also estimate the thermal signature of the\nplanet feedback for our range of planet luminosities, finding that the emitted\nspectrum of a purely active disk, without passive heating, is appreciably\nmodified in the infrared.

In this work the quench dynamics in the ground state\nsector of the two-dimensional Kitaev honeycomb model are studied regarding the\noccurrence of DQPTs. For general two-dimensional systems of BCS-type it is\ndemonstrated how the zeros of the Loschmidt echo coalesce to areas in the\nthermodynamic limit, implying that DQPTs occur as discontinuities in the second\nderivative. In the Kitaev honeycomb model DQPTs appear after quenches across a\nphase boundary or within the massless phase. In the 1d limit of the Kitaev\nhoneycomb model it becomes clear that the discontinuity in the higher\nderivative is intimately related to the higher dimensionality of the\nnon-degenerate model. Moreover, there is a strong connection between the\nstationary value of the rate function of the Loschmidt echo after long times\nand the occurrence of DQPTs in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 14:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}

Besides the\nintrinsic X-ray emission of individual binary members originating in their\nwinds, X-ray emission stems from the accretion on the compact companion or from\nwind collision. Since hot star winds are driven by the light absorption in the\nlines of heavier elements, wind acceleration is sensitive to the ionization\nstate. Therefore, the over-ionization induced by external X-ray source strongly\ninfluences the winds of individual components. We studied the effect of\nexternal X-ray irradiation on hot star winds. We used our kinetic equilibrium\n(NLTE) wind models to estimate the influence of external X-ray ionization for\ndifferent X-ray luminosities and source distances. The models are calculated\nfor parameters typical of O stars. The influence of X-rays is given by the\nX-ray luminosity, by the optical depth between a given point and the X-ray\nsource, and by a distance to the X-ray source. Therefore, the results can be\ninterpreted in the diagrams of X-ray luminosity vs.~the optical depth\nparameter. X-rays are negligible in binaries with low X-ray luminosities or at\nlarge distances from the X-ray source. The influence of X-rays is stronger for\nhigher X-ray luminosities and in closer proximity of the X-ray source. There is\na forbidden area with high X-ray luminosities and low optical depth parameters,\nwhere the X-ray ionization leads to wind inhibition. There is excellent\nagreement between the positions of observed stars in these diagrams and our\npredictions. All wind-powered high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) primaries lie\noutside the forbidden area.

PGO is a nonconvex problem, and currently\nno known technique can guarantee the computation of an optimal solution. In\nthis paper, we show that Lagrangian duality allows computing a globally optimal\nsolution, under certain conditions that are satisfied in many practical cases.\nOur first contribution is to frame the PGO problem in the complex domain. This\nmakes analysis easier and allows drawing connections with the recent literature\non unit gain graphs. Exploiting this connection we prove non-trival results\nabout the spectrum of the matrix underlying the problem. The second\ncontribution is to formulate and analyze the dual problem in the complex\ndomain. Our analysis shows that the duality gap is connected to the number of\neigenvalues of the penalized pose graph matrix, which arises from the solution\nof the dual. We prove that if this matrix has a single eigenvalue in zero, then\n(i) the duality gap is zero, (ii) the primal PGO problem has a unique solution,\nand (iii) the primal solution can be computed by scaling an eigenvector of the\npenalized pose graph matrix. The third contribution is algorithmic: we exploit\nthe dual problem and propose an algorithm that computes a guaranteed optimal\nsolution for PGO when the penalized pose graph matrix satisfies the Single Zero\nEigenvalue Property (SZEP). We also propose a variant that deals with the case\nin which the SZEP is not satisfied. The fourth contribution is a numerical\nanalysis. Empirical evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases (100% of\nthe tests under noise regimes of practical robotics applications) the penalized\npose graph matrix does satisfy the SZEP, hence our approach allows computing\nthe global optimal solution.

Utilising the multi-wavelength photometric data of the large\nsample of X-ray selected AGNs, we evaluate the stellar masses, M*, of the host\ngalaxies of the narrow-line AGNs. The distribution of the stellar mass is\nremarkably constant from z=0.1 to 4.0. The relation between M* and 2--10 keV\nluminosity can be explained with strong cosmological evolution of the\nrelationship between the black hole mass and M*. We also evaluate the scatter\nof the UV-MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) of the X-ray AGNs as a\nfunction of X-ray luminosity and absorption to the nucleus. The scatter is\ncompared with galaxies which have redshift and stellar mass distribution\nmatched with the X-ray AGN. The UV-NIR SEDs of obscured X-ray AGNs are similar\nto those of the galaxies in the matched sample. In the NIR-MIR range, the\nmedian SEDs of X-ray AGNs are redder, but the scatter of the SEDs of the X-ray\nAGN broadly overlaps that of the galaxies in the matched sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 01:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}
