Entering dynamic functional connectivity by applying\nsliding window techniques on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time courses emerged\nfrom this topic. We introduce frequency-resolved dynamic functional\nconnectivity (frdFC) by means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition\n(MEMD) followed up by filter-bank investigations. We develop our method on the\nmost canonical form by applying a sliding window approach to the intrinsic mode\nfunctions (IMFs) resulting from MEMD. We explore two modifications:\nuniform-amplitude frequency scales by normalizing the IMFs by their\ninstantaneous amplitude and cumulative scales. By exploiting the well\nestablished concept of scale-invariance in resting-state parameters, we compare\nour frdFC approaches. In general, we find that MEMD is capable of generating\ntime courses to perform frdFC and we discover that the structure of\nconnectivity-states is robust over frequency scales and even becomes more\nevident with decreasing frequency. This scale-stability varies with the number\nof extracted clusters when applying k-means. We find a scale-stability drop-off\nfrom k = 4 to k = 5 extracted connectivity-states, which is corroborated by\nnull-models, simulations, theoretical considerations, filter-banks, and\nscale-adjusted windows.

Moreover, we provide an\nintuitive picture of the impact of the correlations on the out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics by employing a natural orbital analysis which we show to be indeed\nexperimentally verifiable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 16:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

We moreover discuss the possible\ncounter-measures against the saturation attack and propose a new counter-\nmeasure based on Gaussian post-selection that can be implemented by classical\npost-processing and may allow to distill secret key when the raw measurement\ndata is partly saturated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 17:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We consider both the case in which\nall but $O(1)$ memory has asymmetric cost, and the case of a small cache of\nsymmetric memory. We model both cases using the $(M,\\omega)$-ARAM, in which\nthere is a small (symmetric) memory of size $M$ and a large unbounded\n(asymmetric) memory, both random access, and where reading from the large\nmemory has unit cost, but writing has cost $\\omega\\gg 1$.\n  For FFT and sorting networks we show a lower bound cost of $\\Omega(\\omega\nn\\log_{\\omega M} n)$, which indicates that it is not possible to achieve\nasymptotic improvements with cheaper reads when $\\omega$ is bounded by a\npolynomial in $M$.

In addition, what we know of as the Copenhagen\ninterpretation is a later 1950's development and some of the earlier pioneers\nlike Bohr did not talk of wave function collapse. In fact, if one takes these\nearlier ideas and mixes them with later insights of decoherence, a much more\nsatisfying version of Copenhagen quantum mechanics emerges, one for which the\ncollapse of the wave function is seen to be a harmless book keeping device.\nAlong the way, we explain why chaotic systems lead to wave functions that\nspread out quickly on macroscopic scales implying that Schrodinger cat states\nare the norm rather than curiosities generated in physicists' laboratories.

Outflow ejection events\nprobably vary in their velocity and/or in the rate of mass loss. Such\n`episodic' ejection events have been observed during the Class 0 protostellar\nphase (the early accretion stage), and continue during the subsequent class I\nphase that marks the first one million years of star formation. Previously\nobserved episodic-ejection sources were relatively isolated; however, the most\ncommon sites of star formation are clusters. Outflows link protostars with\ntheir environment and provide a viable source of turbulence that is necessary\nfor regulating star formation in clusters, but it is not known how an\naccretion-driven jet or outflow in a clustered environment manifests itself in\nits earliest stage. This early stage is important in establishing the initial\nconditions for momentum and energy transfer to the environment as the protostar\nand cluster evolve. Here we report that an outflow from a very young class 0\nprotostar, at the hub of the very active and filamentary Serpens South\nprotostellar cluster, shows unambiguous episodic events. The $^{12}$CO (J=2-1)\nemission from the protostar reveals 22 distinct features of outflow ejecta, the\nmost recent having the highest velocity. The outflow forms bipolar lobes ---\none of the first detectable signs of star formation --- which originate from\nthe peak of 1-mm continuum emission. Emission from the surrounding C$^{18}$O\nenvelope shows kinematics consistent with rotation and an infall of material\nonto the protostar. The data suggest that episodic accretion-driven outflow\nbegins in the earliest phase of protostellar evolution, and that the outflow\nremains intact in a very clustered environment, probably providing efficient\nmomentum transfer for driving turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

(The bounds match up to\n$poly(\\epsilon^{-1} \\log n)$ factors.)

The same median governs many phenomena in\nhigh-dimensional spaces, such as large-deviation bounds and the critical\ndimension in Dvoretzky's Theorem.\n  The family of symmetric norms contains several well-studied norms, such as\nall $l_p$~norms, and indeed we provide a new explanation for the disparity in\nspace complexity between $p\\le 2$ and $p>2$.

Our approach is purely\noperational: we consider an observer O interrogating a system S with binary\nquestions and define S's state as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. From\nthe rules we derive the state spaces for N elementary systems and show that (a)\nthey coincide with the set of density matrices over an N-qubit Hilbert space;\n(b) states evolve unitarily under the group $\\rm{PSU}(2^N)$ according to the\nvon Neumann evolution equation; and (c) O's binary questions correspond to\nprojective Pauli operator measurements with outcome probabilities given by the\nBorn rule. As a by-product, this results in a propositional formulation of\nquantum theory. Aside from offering an informational explanation for the\ntheory's architecture, the reconstruction also unravels new structural\ninsights. We show that, in a derived quadratic information measure, (d) qubits\nsatisfy inequalities which bound the information content in any set of mutually\ncomplementary questions to 1 bit; and (e) maximal sets of mutually\ncomplementary questions for one and two qubits must carry precisely 1 bit of\ninformation in pure states. The latter relations constitute conserved\ninformational charges which define the unitary groups and, together with their\nconservation conditions, the sets of pure quantum states. These results\nhighlight information as a `charge of quantum theory' and the benefits of this\ninformational approach. This work emphasizes the sufficiency of restricting to\nan observer's information to reconstruct the theory and completes the quantum\nreconstruction initiated in arXiv:1412.8323.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 21:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 13:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2016 16:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 14:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 09:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2017 00:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

The\nsocial welfare function, which is the standard measure of efficiency in\nauctions, is inadequate for settings with budgets, since there may be a large\ndisconnect between the value a bidder derives from obtaining an item and what\ncan be liquidated from her. The Liquid Welfare objective function has been\nsuggested as a natural alternative for settings with budgets. Simple auctions,\nlike simultaneous item auctions, are evaluated by their performance at\nequilibrium using the Price of Anarchy (PoA) measure -- the ratio of the\nobjective function value of the optimal outcome to the worst equilibrium.\nAccordingly, we evaluate the performance of simultaneous item auctions in\nbudgeted settings by the Liquid Price of Anarchy (LPoA) measure -- the ratio of\nthe optimal Liquid Welfare to the Liquid Welfare obtained in the worst\nequilibrium.\n  Our main result is that the LPoA for mixed Nash equilibria is bounded by a\nconstant when bidders are additive and items can be divided into sufficiently\nmany discrete parts. Our proofs are robust, and can be extended to achieve\nsimilar bounds for simultaneous second price auctions as well as Bayesian Nash\nequilibria. For pure Nash equilibria, we establish tight bounds on the LPoA for\nthe larger class of fractionally-subadditive valuations. To derive our results,\nwe develop a new technique in which some bidders deviate (surprisingly) toward\na non-optimal solution. In particular, this technique does not fit into the\nsmoothness framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 21:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

During the last decade, high\nresolution electron microscopy (EM) of serial sections has become the de-facto\nstandard for reconstruction of neural connectivity at ever increasing scales\n(EM connectomics).

Early galaxies dramatically\nimpacted the gas around them in the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM) by\nphotoionzing the gas during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This epoch likely\nspanned an extended stretch in cosmic time: ionized regions formed and grew\naround early generations of galaxies, gradually filling a larger and larger\nfraction of the volume of the universe. At some time -- thus far uncertain, but\nwithin the first billion years or so after the big bang -- essentially the\nentire volume of the universe became filled with ionized gas. The properties of\nthe IGM provide valuable information regarding the formation time and nature of\nearly galaxy populations, and many approaches for studying the first luminous\nsources are hence based on measurements of the surrounding intergalactic gas.\nThe prospects for improved reionization-era observations of the IGM and early\ngalaxy populations over the next decade are outstanding. Motivated by this, we\nreview the current state of models of the IGM during reionization. We focus on\na few key aspects of reionization-era phenomenology and describe: the redshift\nevolution of the volume-averaged ionization fraction, the properties of the\nsources and sinks of ionizing photons, along with models describing the spatial\nvariations in the ionization fraction, the ultraviolet radiation field, the\ntemperature of the IGM, and the gas density distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 02:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Mathematically, the dynamical process of complex resource\nallocation can be modeled as minority games in which the number of resources is\nlimited and agents tend to choose the less used resource based on available\ninformation. Spontaneous evolution of the resource allocation dynamics,\nhowever, often leads to a harmful herding behavior accompanied by strong\nfluctuations in which a large majority of agents crowd temporarily for a few\nresources, leaving many others unused. Developing effective control strategies\nto suppress and elim- inate herding is an important but open problem. Here we\ndevelop a pinning control method. That the fluctuations of the system consist\nof intrinsic and systematic components allows us to design a control scheme\nwith separated control variables. A striking finding is the universal existence\nof an optimal pinning fraction to minimize the variance of the system,\nregardless of the pinning patterns and the network topology. We carry out a\ndetailed theoretical analysis to understand the emergence of optimal pinning\nand to predict the dependence of the optimal pinning fraction on the network\ntopol- ogy.

We also devise a scheme to correct for spatially\nvarying incompleteness when X-ray data are not available. The local surface\ndensities of the YSOs range from 1 pc$^{-2}$ to over 10,000 pc$^{-2}$, with\nprotostars tending to be in higher density regions. This range of densities is\nsimilar to other surveyed molecular clouds with clusters, but broader than\nclouds without clusters. By identifying clusters and groups as continuous\nregions with surface densities $\\ge10$ pc$^{-2}$, we find that 59% of the YSOs\nare in the largest cluster, the Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC), while 13% of the\nYSOs are found in a distributed population. A lower fraction of protostars in\nthe distributed population is evidence that it is somewhat older than the\ngroups and clusters. An examination of the structural properties of the\nclusters and groups show that the peak surface densities of the clusters\nincrease approximately linearly with the number of members. Furthermore, all\nclusters with more than 70 members exhibit asymmetric and/or highly elongated\nstructures. The ONC becomes azimuthally symmetric in the inner 0.1 pc,\nsuggesting that the cluster is only $\\sim 2$ Myr in age. We find the star\nformation efficiency (SFE) of the Orion B cloud is unusually low, and that the\nSFEs of individual groups and clusters are an order of magnitude higher than\nthose of the clouds. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the young low\nmass stars in the Orion clouds and the Orion OB 1 association, and we determine\nupper limits to the fraction of disks that may be affected by UV radiation from\nOB stars or by dynamical interactions in dense, clustered regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 03:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

The detections of Sw J1644+57-like events\nsuggest that at least some TDEs can launch a relativistic jet beaming towards\nEarth. A natural expectation would be the existence of TDEs with a relativistic\njet beaming away from Earth. The nearby TDE candidate IGR J12580+0134 provides\nnew insights into the jet phenomenon. Combining several constraints, we find\nthat the event invokes a $8-40$ Jupiter mass object tidally disrupted by a $3\n\\times 10^5 - 1.8 \\times 10^7 M_\\sun$ SMBH.

Using Sw J1644+57 as a template and properly correcting\nfor its luminosity, we argue that the observed X-ray flux in early times is too\nfaint to allow an on-beam relativistic jet unless the Lorentz factor is very\nsmall.

For this model, a coding\nscheme that hierarchically utilizes polar codes is presented. In particular, on\npolarization of different binary symmetric channels over different fading\nblocks, each channel use is modeled as an appropriate binary erasure channel\nover fading blocks. Polar codes are constructed for both coding over channel\nuses for each fading block and coding over fading blocks for certain channel\nuses. In order to guarantee security, random bits are introduced at appropriate\nplaces to exhaust the observations of the eavesdropper. It is shown that this\ncoding scheme, without instantaneous CSI at the transmitter, is secrecy\ncapacity achieving for the simultaneous fading scenario. For the independent\nfading case, the capacity is achieved when the fading realizations for the\neavesdropper channel is always degraded with respect to the receiver.

Previous statistical theories considered this as a\ntwo-electron capture process which populates a pair of single-particle\norbitals, followed by 'spreading' of the two-electron states into chaotically\nmixed eigenstates. This method is similar to a configuration-average approach,\nas it neglects potentially important effects of spectator electrons and\nconservation of total angular momentum.

We apply\nthis approach to electron recombination with W$^{20+}$, considering 2 million\ndoorway states.

Our initial\nresults show how, despite of the number of virtual entities running, both kinds\nof virtualization alternatives behave similarly in idle state and in CPU/Memory\nstress test. Contrarily, the results on network performance show differences\nbetween the two technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 07:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

This justifies reassesing the\nimportance of interstellar fullerenes of various sizes with endohedral or\nexohedral inclusions and heterofullerenes (EEHFs). The phenomenology of\nfullerenes is complex. In addition to fullerene formation in shock shattering,\nfully dehydrogenated PAHs in diffuse interstellar (IS) clouds could perhaps\nefficiently transform into fullerenes including EEHFs. But it is extremely\ndifficult to assess their expected abundance, composition and size\ndistribution, except for C60+. EEHFs share many properties with C60, as regards\nstability, formation/destruction and chemical processes, and many basic\nspectral features. We address the interstellar importance of various EEHFs as\npossible DIB carriers. Specifically, we discuss IS properties and the\ncontributions of fullerenes of various sizes and charge such as C60+,\nmetallofullerenes, heterofullerenes, fulleranes, fullerene-PAH compounds,\nH2@C60. We conclude that the landscape of interstellar fullerenes is probably\nmuch richer than heretofore realized. EEHFs, together with pure fullerenes of\nvarious sizes, have properties necessary to be suitably carriers of DIBs:\ncarbonaceous nature; stability and resilience in the ISM; various heteroatoms\nand ionization states; relatively easy formation; few stable isomers; right\nspectral range; energy internal conversion; Jahn-Teller fine structure. This is\nsupported by the C60+ DIBs. But, the lack of information about optical spectra\nother than C60 and IS abundances still precludes definitive assessment of the\nimportance of fullerenes as DIB carriers.

By considering a four-dimensional spacetime as a\nhypersurface embedded in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime, we derive the\ncomplete set of field equations in the four-dimensional spacetime from the\nfive-dimensional Einstein field equation. Besides the Einstein field equation\nin the four-dimensional spacetime, an electromagnetic field equation is\nderived: $\\nabla_a F^{ab}-\\xi R^b_{\\;\\,a}A^a=-4\\pi J^b$ with $\\xi=-2$, where\n$F^{ab}$ is the antisymmetric electromagnetic field tensor defined by the\npotential vector $A^a$, $R_{ab}$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the\nhypersurface, and $J^a$ is the electric current density vector. The\nelectromagnetic field equation differs from the Einstein-Maxwell equation by a\ncurvature-coupled term $\\xi R^b_{\\;\\,a}A^a$, whose presence addresses the\nproblem of incompatibility of the Einstein-Maxwell equation with a universe\ncontaining a uniformly distributed net charge as discussed in a previous paper\nby the author [L.-X.

In the\nfour-dimensional Einstein field equation derived in the new theory, the source\nterm includes the stress-energy tensor of electromagnetic fields as well as the\nstress-energy tensor of other unidentified matter. Under some conditions the\nunidentified matter can be interpreted as a cosmological constant in the\nfour-dimensional spacetime. We argue that, the electromagnetic field equation\nand hence the unified theory presented in this paper can be tested in an\nenvironment with a high mass density, e.g., inside a neutron star or a white\ndwarf, and in the early epoch of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 09:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 09:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

An important reduction of\nthe $p$ splitting was observed, from $^{37}$S to $^{35}$Si, associated to a\nstrong modification of the spin--orbit potential in the central region of the\nnucleus $^{35}$Si. We analyze $2p$ and $1f$ neutron spin--orbit splittings in\nthe $N=20$ isotones $^{40}$Ca, $^{36}$S, and $^{34}$Si.

The observation of clear non-Markovian signatures\nin the coin space testifies the high coherence of the implementation and the\nextraordinary degree of control of all system parameters. Our work is the\nproof-of-principle experiment of a quantum walk on a dynamical percolation\ngraph, paving the way towards complex simulation of quantum transport in random\nmedia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 10:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

We consider the KG equation for a toy graviton field coupled to\na static matter current in spherical symmetry. The classical field reproduces\nthe Newtonian potential generated by the matter source, while the corresponding\nquantum state is given by a coherent superposition of scalar modes with\ncontinuous occupation number. An attractive self-interaction is needed for\nbound states to form, so that (approximately) one mode is allowed, and the\nsystem of N bosons can be self-confined in a volume of the size of the\nSchwarzschild radius. The HWF is then used to show that the radius of such a\nsystem corresponds to a proper horizon. The uncertainty in the size of the\nhorizon is related to the typical energy of Hawking modes: it decreases with\nthe increasing of the black hole mass (larger number of gravitons), in\nagreement with semiclassical calculations and different from a single very\nmassive particle. The spectrum contains a discrete ground state of energy $m$\n(the bosons forming the black hole), and a continuous spectrum with energy\n$\\omega > m$ (representing the Hawking radiation and modelled with a Planckian\ndistribution at the expected Hawking temperature). The $N$-particle state can\nbe collectively described by a single-particle wave-function given by a\nsuperposition of a total ground state with energy $M = N m$ and a Planckian\ndistribution for $E > M$ at the same Hawking temperature. The partition\nfunction is then found to yield the usual area law for the entropy, with a\nlogarithmic correction related with the Hawking component. The backreaction of\nmodes with $\\omega > m$ is also shown to reduce the Hawking flux and the\nevaporation properly stops for vanishing mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 10:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

However, in real recommendation settings only few items are\npresented to a user. This observation has recently encouraged the use of\nrank-based metrics. LambdaMART is the state-of-the-art algorithm in learning to\nrank which relies on such a metric. Despite its success it does not have a\nprincipled regularization mechanism relying in empirical approaches to control\nmodel complexity leaving it thus prone to overfitting.\n  Motivated by the fact that very often the users' and items' descriptions as\nwell as the preference behavior can be well summarized by a small number of\nhidden factors, we propose a novel algorithm, LambdaMART Matrix Factorization\n(LambdaMART-MF), that learns a low rank latent representation of users and\nitems using gradient boosted trees. The algorithm factorizes lambdaMART by\ndefining relevance scores as the inner product of the learned representations\nof the users and items. The low rank is essentially a model complexity\ncontroller; on top of it we propose additional regularizers to constraint the\nlearned latent representations that reflect the user and item manifolds as\nthese are defined by their original feature based descriptors and the\npreference behavior. Finally we also propose to use a weighted variant of NDCG\nto reduce the penalty for similar items with large rating discrepancy.\n  We experiment on two very different recommendation datasets, meta-mining and\nmovies-users, and evaluate the performance of LambdaMART-MF, with and without\nregularization, in the cold start setting as well as in the simpler matrix\ncompletion setting. In both cases it outperforms in a significant manner\ncurrent state of the art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 10:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

Conflict coloring is characterized by two\nparameters $l$ and $d$, where the former measures the amount of freedom given\nto the nodes for selecting their colors, and the latter measures the number of\nconstraints which colors of adjacent nodes are subject to.We show that, in the\nstandard LOCAL model for distributed network computing, if $l/d \\textgreater{}\n\\Delta$, then conflict coloring can be solved in $\\tilde\nO(\\sqrt{\\Delta})+\\log^*n$ rounds in $n$-node graphs with maximum degree\n$\\Delta$, where $\\tilde O$ ignores the polylog factors in $\\Delta$.

With beam\npowers already in the MW-regime attention has to be turned to target and beam\nline design to further significantly increase surface muon rates available for\nexperiments. For this reason we have explored the possibility of using a\nneutron spallation target as a source of surface muons by performing detailed\nGeant4 simulations with pion production cross sections based on a\nparametrization of existing data. While the spallation target outperforms\nstandard targets in the backward direction by more than a factor 7 it is not\nmore efficient than standard targets viewed under 90{\\deg}. Not surprisingly,\nthe geometry of the target plays a large role in the generation of surface\nmuons. Through careful optimization, a gain in surface muon rate of between 30\n- 60% over the standard \"box-like\" target used at the Paul Scherrer Institute\ncould be achieved by employing a rotated slab target. An additional 10% gain\ncould also be possible by utilizing novel target materials such as, e.g., boron\ncarbide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 11:01:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 07:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Recently, a major source of progress in 3D tracking\nhas been the study of collective behaviour in biological systems, where the\ntrajectories of individual animals moving within large and dense groups need to\nbe reconstructed to understand the behavioural interaction rules. Experimental\ndata in this field are generally noisy and at low spatial resolution, so that\nindividuals appear as small featureless objects and trajectories must be\nretrieved by making use of epipolar information only. Moreover, optical\nocclusions often occur: in a multi-camera system one or more objects become\nindistinguishable in one view, potentially jeopardizing the conservation of\nidentity over long-time trajectories. The most advanced 3D tracking algorithms\novercome optical occlusions making use of set-cover techniques, which however\nhave to solve NP-hard optimization problems.

A distinctive property of the nebular\ncomponent in these ETGs, classified i+, is a two-radial-zone structure, with\nthe inner zone displaying LINER emission with a H\\alpha equivalent width\nEW~1{\\AA}, and the outer one (3{\\AA}<EW<~20{\\AA}) showing HII-region\ncharacteristics. Using CALIFA IFS data, we empirically demonstrate that the\nconfinement of nebular emission to the galaxy periphery leads to a strong\naperture (or, redshift) bias in spectroscopic single-fiber studies of type i+\nETGs: At low redshift (<~0.45), SDSS spectroscopy is restricted to the inner\n(SF-devoid LINER) zone, thereby leading to their erroneous classification as\n\"retired\" galaxies (systems lacking SF and whose faint emission is powered by\npAGB stars). Only at higher z's the SDSS aperture can encompass the outer SF\nzone, permitting their unbiased classification as \"composite SF/LINER\". We also\ndemonstrate that the principal effect of a decreasing aperture on the\nclassification of i+ ETGs via standard BPT emission-line ratios consists in a\nmonotonic up-right shift precisely along the upper-right wing of the \"seagull\"\ndistribution. Motivated by these insights, we also investigate theoretically\nthese biases in aperture-limited studies of inside-out growing galaxies as a\nfunction of z. To this end, we devise a simple model, which involves an\noutwardly propagating SF process, that reproduces the radial extent and\ntwo-zone EW distribution of i+ ETGs.

Here, we propose a design path to control the absorption and\nscattering characteristics of a dipole nanoantenna by introducing a hollow\nregion inside the nanostructure. The resulting contour geometry can\nsignificantly suppress the scattering of the dipole nanoantenna and enhance its\nabsorption simultaneously. Both the dipole and the contour dipole nanoantenna\ncouple to equivalent amount of the incident radiation. The dipole nanoantenna\nscatters 84% of the coupled power (absorbs the remaining 16%) whereas the\ncontour dipole structure scatters only 28% of the coupled power (absorbs the\nremaining 72%). This constitutes the transformation from scatter to absorber\nnanoantenna. The scattering of a contour nanoantenna can be further suppressed\nby incorporating a lossless dielectric in the hollow region without altering\nits absorption. We also demonstrate the applicability of scattering suppression\nand absorption enhancement features of the contour design in other nanoantenna\ngeometries such as the self-assembly compatible nanoantenna structures of\nnanodisk and nanoring chains.

For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed\ndipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained.\nThe results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the\nphenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first\norder anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological\nanchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of\ndual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two\neasy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface.\nIntroduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a\nsolid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays\nrelying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental\nproblems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter\nbulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the\nso-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director\nclose to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given\ninterface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is\nwell known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose\nthe anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between\nmolecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has\nbeen analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional\ngroups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon\nsubstrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the\ninterface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but\nmodifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new\nanchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability\nhas been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric\nordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range\nterm and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can\ninduce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently,\nsurfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been\nshown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in\nseveral systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy\naxes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8].\nSimilar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two\nplanar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in\nthe same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11]\nor discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the\nmodel established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able\nto predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes\noccurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic\norigin of the easy axes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 13:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

An accurate determination of the spectrum of\nflare energized electrons over a broad energy range is crucial for our\nunderstanding of aspects such as the acceleration mechanism and the total flare\nenergy. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the kappa-distribution as\nrepresentation of the total spectrum of flare accelerated electrons. In this\nwork we present the kappa-distribution as a differential emission measure. This\nallows for inferring the electron distribution from X-ray observations and EUV\nobservations by simultaneously fitting the proposed function to RHESSI and\nSDO/AIA data. This yields the spatially integrated electron spectra of a\ncoronal source between less than 0.1 keV up to several tens of keV. The method\nis applied to a single-loop GOES C4.1 flare. The results show that the total\nenergy can only be determined accurately by combining RHESSI and AIA\nobservations. Simultaneously fitting the proposed representation of the\nkappa-distribution reduces the electron number density in the analyzed flare by\na factor of ~30 and the total flare energy by a factor of ~5 compared with the\ncommonly used fitting of RHESSI spectra. The spatially integrated electron\nspectrum of the investigated flare between 0.043 keV and 24 keV is consistent\nwith the combination of a low-temperature (~2 MK) component and a hot (~11 MK)\nkappa-like component with spectral index 4, reminiscent of solar wind\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 13:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

All cells and tissues have cell membranes and\nits capacitance is both linear and important to cell function. Measurements\nproved straightforward in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and lens of the eye.\nIn skeletal muscle, measurements provided the best estimates of the predominant\n(cell) membrane system that dominates electrical properties. In cardiac muscle,\nmeasurements showed definitively that classical microelectrode voltage clamp\ncould not control the potential of the predominant membranes, that were in the\ntubular system separated from the extracellular space by substantial\ndistributed resistance. In the lens of the eye, impedance spectroscopy changed\nthe basis of all recording and interpretation of electrical measurements and\nlaid the basis for Rae and Mathias extensive later experimental work. Many\ntissues are riddled with extracellular space as clefts and tubules, for\nexample, cardiac muscle, the lens of the eye, most epithelia, and of course\nfrog muscle. These tissues are best analyzed with a bidomain theory that arose\nfrom the work on electrical structure described here. There has been a great\ndeal of work since then on the bi-domain and this represents the most important\ncontribution to biology of the analysis of electrical structure in my view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 14:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

The interpretation\nof these measurements relies on theoretical estimates of how the observables\nchange under magnification. Here we present simulations to create multi-band\nphotometric mock catalogues of Lyman-break galaxies in a CFHTLenS-like survey\nthat include several observational effects that can change these relations,\nmaking simple theoretical estimates unusable. In particular, we show how the\nmagnification bias can be affected by photometric noise, colour selection, and\ndust extinction. We find that a simple measurement of the slope of the\nnumber-counts is not sufficient for the precise interpretation of virtually all\nobservations of magnification bias. We also explore how sensitive the shift in\nthe mean magnitude of a source sample in different photometric bands is to\nmagnification including the same observational effects. Again we find\nsignificant deviations from simple analytical estimates. We also discover a\nwavelength-dependence of the magnitude-shift effect when applied to a\ncolour-selected noisy source sample. Such an effect can mimic the reddening by\ndust in the lens. It has to be disentangled from the dust extinction before the\nmagnitude-shift/colour-excess can be used to measure the distribution of either\ndark matter or extragalactic dust. Using simulations like the ones presented\nhere these observational effects can be studied and eventually removed from\nobservations making precise measurements of flux magnification possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 14:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

We find that rapid gas supply from the Bondi radius at a\nhyper-Eddington rate can occur without being impeded by radiation feedback when\n(n/10^5 cm^-3) > (M_BH/10^4Msun)^{-1}(T/10^4 K)^{3/2}, where n and T are the\ndensity and temperature of ambient gas outside of the Bondi radius. The\nresulting accretion rate in this regime is steady, and larger than 3000 times\nthe Eddington rate. At lower Bondi rates, the accretion is episodic due to\nradiative feedback and the average rate is limited below the Eddington rate.\nFor the hyper-Eddington case, the steady solution consists of two parts: a\nradiation-dominated central core, where photon trapping due to electron\nscattering is important, and an accreting envelope which follows a Bondi\nprofile with T~8000 K. When the emergent luminosity is limited below the\nEddington luminosity because of photon trapping, radiation from the central\nregion does not affect the gas dynamics at larger scales. We apply our result\nto the rapid formation of massive BHs in protogalaxies with a virial\ntemperature of T_vir> 10^4 K. Once a seed BH forms at the center of the galaxy,\nit can grow up to a maximum ~10^5 (T_vir/10^4 K) Msun via gas accretion\nindependent of the initial BH mass.

Ageostrophic submesoscale eddies, and vorticity filaments\npopulate the continental slope, and they are stronger and more abundant in the\nsimulation at higher resolution, as to be expected. They are formed from\nhorizontal shear layers at the edges of highly intermittent,\nbottom-intensified, along-slope boundary currents and in the cores of those\ncurrents when they are confined on steep slopes. The horizontal resolution\ninfluences the representation of the lateral and vertical transport of\nneutrally buoyant tracers. This is exemplified by a passive dye deployed near\nthe Macondo Prospect, where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in 2010, and at\nthe largest known natural hydrocarbon seep in the northern Gulf, few hundred\nkilometers to the west of the rig wellhead. The first site is characterized by\nweak mean currents and, in the high resolution run, by intense submesoscale\neddies that form to the west of the Macondo Prospect. GC600, on the other hand,\nis surrounded by a complicated bathymetry, and its flow is highly variable.

The tracer released at GC600, on the other hand, is dispersed more\neffectively in the first six months in the higher resolution case due to\nenhanced near-bottom turbulent mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 20:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}
