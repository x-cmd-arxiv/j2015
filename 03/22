We first describe a method to simulate the\nevolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) based on a refined analysis\nof the Trotter-Suzuki formula that exploits the Lie algebra structure. For\ntotal evolution time $t$ and precision $\\epsilon>0$, the complexity of our\nmethod is $ O(\\exp(\\gamma \\sqrt{\\log(N/\\epsilon)}))$, where $\\gamma>0$ is a\nconstant and $N$ is the quantum number associated with an \"energy cutoff\" of\nthe initial state. Remarkably, this complexity is subpolynomial in\n$N/\\epsilon$. We also provide a method to prepare discrete versions of the\neigenstates of the QHO of complexity polynomial in $\\log(N)/\\epsilon$, where\n$N$ is the dimension or number of points in the discretization. This method may\nbe of independent interest as it provides a way to prepare, e.g., quantum\nstates with Gaussian-like amplitudes. Next, we consider a system with a quartic\npotential. Our numerical simulations suggest a method for simulating the\nevolution of sublinear complexity $\\tilde O(N^{1/3+o(1)})$, for constant $t$\nand $\\epsilon$. We also analyze complex one-dimensional systems and prove a\ncomplexity bound $\\tilde O(N)$, under fairly general assumptions. Our quantum\nalgorithms may find applications in other problems. As an example, we discuss\nthe fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform\nthat is useful for signal analysis and can be formulated in terms of the\nevolution of the QHO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 16:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 17:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

Whether this is true is\nalready unknown in the case of a (normal) threefold with rational singularities\nalong a curve $C$ except at a single point $p \\in C$. There is an analogous\nconjecture for demi-normal varieties $X$, where we must insist that $Y$ has\nonly semi-rational singularities. Our main result is that if a stronger version\nof Koll\\'ar's conjecture is true for rational (normal) singularities, then the\nanalogous conjecture is true for Gorenstein semi-rational (non-normal)\nsingularities. We illustrate this first for surfaces. As the same procedure\ndoes not carry over directly to higher dimensions, we must use a slightly\ndifferent proof for that case. We include conditions under which the\nCohen-Macaulay property (slightly weaker than that of having rational\nsingularities) is preserved when passing between a demi-normal variety and its\nnormalization. It is this condition that is automatic for surfaces and which\nmakes a proof slightly different in higher dimensions. In fact, it is not the\ncase that the normalization of a Cohen-Macaulay variety is Cohen-Macaulay (or\nvice-versa, as is already apparent with surfaces). These auxiliary results are\nneeded for the proof of the general result, but they are interesting in their\nown right. The proof of the general statement is at the end of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 17:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

Here, paths are\nembeddings of a compact interval into $M$. There are at least two types of\nsymmetries: Firstly, paths that are parts of an integral curve of a fundamental\nvector field on $M$ (continuous symmetry). Secondly, paths that can be\ndecomposed into finitely many pieces, each of which is the translate of some\nfree segment, where possibly the translate is cut at the two ends of the paths\n(discrete symmetry). Here, a free segment is a path $e$ whose $G$-translates\neither equal $e$ or intersect it in at most finitely many points. Note that all\nthe statements above are understood up to the parametrization of the paths. We\nwill show, for the category of analytic manifolds, that each path is of exactly\none of either types.\n  For the proof, we use that the overlap of a path $\\gamma$ with one of its\ntranslates is encoded uniquely in a mapping between subsets of $\\dom\\gamma$.\nRunning over all translates, these mappings form the so-called\nreparametrization set to $\\gamma$. It will turn out that, up to conjugation\nwith a diffeomorphism, any such set is given by the action of a Lie subgroup of\n$O(2)$ on $S^1$, restricted in domain and range to some compact interval on\n$S^1$.

If, in a series of closely related activated\nprocesses, these parameters exhibit a strong linear correlation, it is expected\nthat an isokinetic relation will occur, then the rates $k$ become the same at a\ncommon compensation temperature $T_c$. The reality of these two phenomena\ncontinues to be debated as they have not been explicitly demonstrated and their\nphysical origins remain poorly understood. Using kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations on a model interface, we explore how site and adsorbate\ninteractions influence the Arrhenius parameters during a typical desorption\nprocess.

The nature of metal whiskers remains a mystery after\nseveral decades of research. In addition, metal whiskers exhibit a rather\nunusual dynamic property of relatively high amplitude movements under gentle\nair flow or, according to some testimonies, without obvious stimuli.\nUnderstanding the physics behind that motion would give additional insights\ninto the nature of metal whiskers. Here, we quantitatively analyze several\npossible mechanisms potentially responsible for the observed movements: (1)\nminute air currents, (2) Brownian motion due to random bombardments with the\nair molecules, (3) mechanically caused movements, such as (a) externally\ntransmitted vibrations of the sample, and (b) torque exerted due to material\npropagation along curved whiskers responsible for the whisker growth (similar\nto the known garden hose oscillations), (4) time dependent electric fields due\nto diffusion of ions across the metal surface, and (5) nonequilibrium electric\nfield configurations making it possible for {\\it some} whiskers to move. For\nall these scenarios we provide numerical estimates. Our conclusion is that the\nobserved movements are likely due to the minor air currents, intentional or\nill-controlled, and that external mechanical vibrations could force such\nmovements in a rather harsh environment or/and for whiskers with severe\nconstrictions.

In the case that the robot needs to\nlocate an object of interest and manipulate it, it needs to perform a series of\ndecluttering actions to accurately detect the object of interest. To perform\nsuch a series of actions, the robot also needs to account for the dynamics of\nobjects in the environment and how they react to contact. This is a non trivial\nproblem since one needs to reason not only about robot-object interactions but\nalso object-object interactions in the presence of contact. In the example\nscenario of manipulation in clutter, the state vector would have to account for\nthe pose of the object of interest and the structure of the surrounding\nenvironment. The process model would have to account for all the aforementioned\nrobot-object, object-object interactions. The complexity of the process model\ngrows exponentially as the number of objects in the scene increases. This is\ncommonly the case in unstructured environments. Hence it is not reasonable to\nattempt to model all object-object and robot-object interactions explicitly.\nUnder this setting we propose a hypothesis based action selection algorithm\nwhere we construct a hypothesis set of the possible poses of an object of\ninterest given the current evidence in the scene and select actions based on\nour current set of hypothesis. This hypothesis set tends to represent the\nbelief about the structure of the environment and the number of poses the\nobject of interest can take. The agent's only stopping criterion is when the\nuncertainty regarding the pose of the object is fully resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 02:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 00:24:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 May 2015 05:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-11"}

Middlebox\nfunctionalities are usually deployed on expensive and proprietary hardware that\nrequire trained personnel for deployment and maintenance. Middleboxes\ncontribute significantly to a network's capital and operational costs. In\naddition, organizations often require their traffic to pass through a specific\nsequence of middleboxes for compliance with security and performance policies.\nThis makes the middlebox deployment and maintenance tasks even more\ncomplicated. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging and promising\ntechnology that is envisioned to overcome these challenges. It proposes to move\npacket processing from dedicated hardware middleboxes to software running on\ncommodity servers. In NFV terminology, software middleboxes are referred to as\nVirtualized Network Functions (VNFs). It is a challenging problem to determine\nthe required number and placement of VNFs that optimizes network operational\ncosts and utilization, without violating service level agreements. We call this\nthe VNF Orchestration Problem (VNF-OP) and provide an Integer Linear\nProgramming (ILP) formulation with implementation in CPLEX.

His 1964 theorem is the\nincompatibility of quantum phenomena with the joint assumptions of Locality and\nPredetermination. His 1976 theorem is their incompatibility with the single\nproperty of Local Causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later assertions,\nthat his 1964 theorem began with the assumption of Local Causality, even if not\nby that name. Although the two Bell's theorems are logically equivalent, their\nassumptions are not. Hence, the earlier and later theorems suggest quite\ndifferent conclusions, embraced by operationalists and realists, respectively.\nThe key issue is whether Locality or Local Causality is the appropriate notion\nemanating from Relativistic Causality, and this rests on one's basic notion of\ncausation. For operationalists the appropriate notion is what is here called\nthe Principle of Agent-Causation, while for realists it is Reichenbach's\nPrinciple of common cause. By breaking down the latter into even more basic\nPostulates, it is possible to obtain a version of Bell's theorem in which each\ncamp could reject one assumption, happy that the remaining assumptions reflect\nits weltanschauung. Formulating Bell's theorem in terms of causation is\nfruitful not just for attempting to reconcile the two camps, but also for\nbetter describing the ontology of different quantum interpretations and for\nmore deeply understanding the implications of Bell's marvellous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 11:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

Alternatives to construct these\ncovariance functions are the linear model of coregionalization and process\nconvolutions. Each of these methods demand the specification of the number of\nlatent Gaussian process used to build the covariance function for the outputs.\nWe propose in this paper, the use of an Indian Buffet process as a way to\nperform model selection over the number of latent Gaussian processes. This type\nof model is particularly important in the context of latent force models, where\nthe latent forces are associated to physical quantities like protein profiles\nor latent forces in mechanical systems.

Disordered hyperuniform systems\nhave been receiving recent attention because they are distinguishable exotic\nstates of matter poised between a crystal and liquid with novel properties. The\ntask of formulating an ensemble theory that yields analytical predictions for\nthe structural characteristics and other properties of stealthy degenerate\nground states in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is highly nontrivial because\nthe dimensionality of the configuration space depends on the number density\n$\\rho$ and there is a multitude of ways of sampling the ground-state manifold,\neach with its own probability measure. The purpose of this paper is to take\nsome initial steps in this direction. Specifically, we derive general exact\nrelations for thermodynamic properties that apply to any ground-state ensemble\nas a function of $\\rho$ in any $d$, and show how disordered degenerate ground\nstates arise as part of the ground-state manifold. We then specialize our\nresults to the canonical ensemble by exploiting an ansatz that stealthy states\nbehave remarkably like \"pseudo\" equilibrium hard-sphere systems in Fourier\nspace. Our theoretical predictions for the structure and thermodynamic\nproperties of the stealthy disordered ground states and associated excited\nstates are in excellent agreement with computer simulations across the first\nthree space dimensions.
