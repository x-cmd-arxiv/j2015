This characterization is sharp in the sense that\nfamilies of polygons with poor quality triangles in their constrained Delaunay\ntriangulations are shown to produce large error when interpolating a basic\nquadratic function. Non-convex polygons exhibit a similar limitation: large\nconstrained Delaunay triangles caused by vertices approaching a non-adjacent\nedge also lead to large interpolation error. While this relationship is\ngeneralized to convex polyhedra in three dimensions, the possibility of sliver\ntetrahedra in the constrained Delaunay triangulation prevent the analogous\nestimate from sharply reflecting the actual interpolation error. Non-convex\npolyhedra are shown to be fundamentally different through an example of a\nfamily of polyhedra containing vertices which are arbitrarily close to\nnon-adjacent faces yet the interpolation error remains bounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 16:01:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 23:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

If these quantities are not directly reported in the publications,\nthey need to must be estimated from other reported summary statistics, such as\nthe median, the minimum, the maximum, and quartiles. Methods: We propose a\nsimulation-based estimation approach using the Approximate Bayesian Computation\n(ABC) technique for estimating mean and standard deviation based on various\nsets of summary statistics found in published studies. We conduct a simulation\nstudy to compare the proposed ABC method with the existing methods of Hozo et\nal. (2005), Bland (2015), and Wan et al. (2014). Results: In the estimation of\nthe standard deviation, our ABC method performs best in skewed or heavy-tailed\ndistributions. The average relative error (ARE) approaches zero as sample size\nincreases. In the normal distribution, our ABC performs well. However, the Wan\net al. method is best since it is based on the normal distribution assumption.\nWhen the distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed, the ARE of Wan et al. moves\naway from zero even as sample size increases. In the estimation of the mean,\nour ABC method is best since the AREs converge to zero. Conclusion: ABC is a\nflexible method for estimating the study-specific mean and standard deviation\nfor meta-analysis, especially with underlying skewed or heavy-tailed\ndistributions. The ABC method can be applied using other reported summary\nstatistics such as the posterior mean and 95% credible interval when Bayesian\nanalysis has been employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 16:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

Firstly,\nregular vortices are detected. Further, increasing either the excitation\namplitude or modulation time results in the transition to quantum vortex\nturbulence, followed by a granular state. Numerical simulation of the\nnonequilibrium Bose-condensed system is based on the solution of the\ntime-dependent 3D nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation within the static and\ndynamical algorithms. The damped gradient step and time split-step Fourier\ntransform methods are employed.

An instance consists of a\ncapacitated graph (directed or undirected), a sink node $t$ and a set of\ndemands that we want to send to the sink. Here demand $i$ is located at a node\n$s_i$ and requests an amount $d_i$ of flow capacity in order to route\nsuccessfully. Two standard objectives are to maximise (i) the number of demands\n(cardinality) and (ii) the total demand (throughput) that can be routed subject\nto the capacity constraints. Furthermore, we examine these maximisation\nproblems for three specialised types of network flow: unsplittable, confluent\nand priority flows.\n  In the {\\em unsplittable flow} problem (UFP), we have edge capacities, and\nthe demand for $s_i$ must be routed on a single path. In the {\\em confluent\nflow} problem, we have node capacities, and the final flow must induce a tree.\nBoth of these problems have been studied extensively, primarily in the\nsingle-sink setting. However, most of this work imposed the {\\em no-bottleneck\nassumption} (that the maximum demand $d_{max}$ is at most the minimum capacity\n$u_{min}$). Given the no-bottleneck assumption (NBA), there is a factor\n$4.43$-approximation algorithm due to Dinitz et al. for the unsplittable flow\nproblem. Under the stronger assumption of uniform capacities, there is a factor\n$3$-approximation algorithm due to Chen et al. for the confluent flow problem.\nHowever, unlike the UFP, we show that a constant factor approximation algorithm\ncannot be obtained for the single-sink confluent flows even {\\bf with} the NBA.\n  Without NBA, we show that maximum cardinality single-sink UFP is hard to\napproximate to within a factor $n^{.5-\\epsilon}$ even when all demands lie in a\nsmall interval $[1,1+\\Delta]$ where $\\Delta>0$ (but has polynomial input size).\nThis is very sharp since when $\\Delta=0$, this becomes a maximum flow problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 17:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 18:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We determine the precise energy orderings and analyze the cluster\nwave functions in order to arrive at a comprehensive physical understanding of\nsinglet fission in these diverse families of materials. Our computational\napproach allows us to retain a very large number of basis states and thereby\nobtain the correct relative energy orderings of one electron$-$one hole Frenkel\nand charge-transfer excitons versus intra- and intermolecular two\nelectron$-$two hole triplet$-$triplet excited states. We show that from the\nenergy orderings it is possible to understand the occurrence of singlet fission\nin polyene and acene crystals, as well as its near total absence in the\ncovalently linked acene dimers. As in the acene crystals, singlet fission in\nthe polyenes is a multichromophoric phenomenon, with the well-known\n2$^1$A$_g^-$ playing no direct role. Intermolecular charge-transfer is\nessential for singlet fission in both acenes and polyenes, but because of\nsubtle differences in the natures and orderings of the aggregate excited\nstates, the mechanisms of singlet fission are slightly different in the two\nclasses. We are thus able to give qualitative physical reasoning for the slower\nsinglet fission in the polyenes, relative to that in crystalline pentacene. Our\nwork also gives new insight into the complex exciton dynamics in tetracene\ncrystals, which has been difficult to understand theoretically.

These\nquantum states are extremely fragile and tend to quickly decay into incoherent\nmixtures due to the environmental decoherence. Experimental setups considered\nup to date address this threat in a conceptually straightforward way -- by\neliminating the environment, i.e. by isolating an object in a sufficiently high\nvacuum. We show that another option exists: decoherence is suppressed in the\npresence of a strongly interacting environment if this environment is\nsuperfluid. Indeed, as long as an object immersed in a pure superfluid at zero\ntemperature moves with a velocity below the critical one, it does not create,\nabsorb or scatter any excitations of the superfluid. Hence, in this idealized\nsituations the decoherence is absent. In reality the decoherence will be\npresent due to thermal excitations of the superfluid and impurities\ncontaminating the superfluid. We examine various decoherence channels in the\nsuperfluid $^4$He.

Over 60% of\nNEAs have an orbital uncertainty parameter, U >= 4, making reacquisition more\nthan a year following discovery difficult; for H > 22 this fraction is over\n90%. We argue that rapid follow-up will be essential to characterize\nnewly-discovered NEAs. Most new NEAs are found within 0.5mag of peak brightness\nand fade quickly, typically by 0.5/3.5/5mag after 1/4/6 weeks. About 80% have\nsynodic periods of <3 years that bring them close to Earth several times a\ndecade. However, follow-up observations on subsequent apparitions will be near\nimpossible for the bulk of new discoveries, as these will be H > 22 NEAs that\ntend to return 100 times fainter. We show that for characterization to keep\npace with discovery would require: Visible spectroscopy within days with a\ndedicated >2m telescope; long-arc astrometry, used also for phase curves, with\na >4m telescope; and fast-cadence (<min) lightcurves obtained within days with\na >= 4m telescope. For the already-known large (H =< 22) NEAs,\nsubsequent-apparition spectroscopy, astrometry, and photometry could be done\nwith 1-2m telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 00:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Although this lensing magnification is\ndifficult to measure accurately in auto correlation, its cross correlation with\ncosmic shear and galaxy distribution in overlapping area can be measured to\nsignificantly higher accuracy.

Deformations of the Dirac\ncone often reveal intriguing properties; an example is the quantum Hall effect,\nwhere a constant magnetic field breaks the Dirac cone into isolated Landau\nlevels. A seemingly unrelated phenomenon is the exceptional point, also known\nas the parity-time symmetry breaking point, where two resonances coincide in\nboth their positions and widths. Exceptional points lead to counter-intuitive\nphenomena such as loss-induced transparency, unidirectional transmission or\nreflection, and lasers with reversed pump dependence or single-mode operation.\nThese two fields of research are in fact connected: here we discover the\nability of a Dirac cone to evolve into a ring of exceptional points, which we\ncall an \"exceptional ring.\" We experimentally demonstrate this concept in a\nphotonic crystal slab. Angle-resolved reflection measurements of the photonic\ncrystal slab reveal that the peaks of reflectivity follow the conical band\nstructure of a Dirac cone from accidental degeneracy, whereas the complex\neigenvalues of the system are deformed into a two-dimensional flat band\nenclosed by an exceptional ring.

Therefore, we face a dilemma here: one need the\ntrue structures of data to identify the informative features, and one need the\ninformative features to accurately estimate the true structures of data. To\naddress this, we propose a unified learning framework which performs structure\nlearning and feature selection simultaneously.

For the simplest spinless systems, with say $m$ particles in $N$\nsingle particle states and interacting via $k$-body interactions, we have\nEGUE($k$) and the embedding algebra is $U(N)$. A finite quantum system, induced\nby a transition operator, makes transitions from its states to the states of\nthe same system or to those of another system. Examples are electromagnetic\ntransitions (same initial and final systems), nuclear beta and double beta\ndecay (different initial and final systems), particle addition to/removal from\na given system and so on. Towards developing a complete statistical theory for\ntransition strength densities, we have derived formulas for lower order\nbivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of\ntransition operators. For a spinless fermion system, using EGUE($k$)\nrepresentation for Hamiltonian and an independent EGUE($t$) representation for\ntransition operator, finite-$N$ formulas for moments up to order four are\nderived, for the first time, for the transition strength densities. Formulas\nfor the moments up to order four are also derived for systems with two types of\nspinless fermions and a transition operator similar to beta decay and\nneutrinoless beta decay operators.

Numerical results obtained using the exact formulas for two-body\n($k=2$) Hamiltonians (in some examples for $k=3,4$) and the asymptotic formulas\nclearly establish that in general the smoothed form of the bivariate transition\nstrength densities take bivariate Gaussian form for isolated finite quantum\nsystems.

For example, in the case\nof anisotropic Heisenberg model, quasi-local conserved operators which are odd\nunder spin reversal (or spin flip) can be constructed, whereas the conserved\noperators stemming from orthodox Hermitian transfer operators (via logarithmic\ndifferentiation) are all even under spin reversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 08:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 19:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 10:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

We thus need tools to measure the energy consumption of computing\nsystems and to understand how workloads affect it. Significant recent research\neffort has targeted direct power measurements on production computing systems\nusing on-board sensors or external instruments. These direct methods have in\nturn guided studies of software techniques to reduce energy consumption via\nworkload allocation and scaling. Unfortunately, direct energy measurements are\nhampered by the low power sampling frequency of power sensors. The coarse\ngranularity of power sensing limits our understanding of how power is allocated\nin systems and our ability to optimize energy efficiency via workload\nallocation.\n  We present ALEA, a tool to measure power and energy consumption at the\ngranularity of basic blocks, using a probabilistic approach. ALEA provides\nfine-grained energy profiling via statistical sampling, which overcomes the\nlimitations of power sensing instruments. Compared to state-of-the-art energy\nmeasurement tools, ALEA provides finer granularity without sacrificing\naccuracy. ALEA achieves low overhead energy measurements with mean error rates\nbetween 1.4% and 3.5% in 14 sequential and parallel benchmarks tested on both\nIntel and ARM platforms. The sampling method caps execution time overhead at\napproximately 1%. ALEA is thus suitable for online energy monitoring and\noptimization. Finally, ALEA is a user-space tool with a portable,\nmachine-independent sampling method. We demonstrate two use cases of ALEA,\nwhere we reduce the energy consumption of a k-means computational kernel by 37%\nand an ocean modelling code by 33%, compared to high-performance execution\nbaselines, by varying the power optimization strategy between basic blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 11:57:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 22:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

As WSNs are gradually employed in time-critical applications,\nthe importance of the DCRNP problem becomes noticeable. For the NP-hard nature\nof DCRNP problem, an approximation algorithm-Set-Covering-based Relay Node\nPlacement (SCA) is proposed to solve the DCRNP problem in this paper. The\nproposed SCA algorithm deploys relay nodes iteratively from sink to the given\nsensor nodes in hops, i.e., in the $k$th iteration SCA deploys relay nodes at\nthe locations that are $k$ hops apart from the sink. Specifically, in each\niteration, SCA first finds the candidate deployment locations located within 1\nhop to the relay nodes and sensor nodes, which have already been connected to\nthe sink. Then, a subset of these candidate deployment locations, which can\nguarantee the existence of paths connecting unconnected sensor nodes to the\nsink within delay constraint, is selected to deploy relay nodes based on the\nset covering method. As the iteration of SCA algorithm, the sensor nodes are\ngradually connected to the sink with satisfying delay constraint.\n  The elaborated analysis of the approximation ratio of SCA algorithm is given\nout, and we also prove that the SCA is a polynomial time algorithm through\nrigorous time complexity analysis. To evaluate the performance of the proposed\nSCA algorithm, extensive simulations are implemented, and the simulation\nresults show that the SCA algorithm can significantly save the deployed relay\nnodes comparing to the existing algorithms, i.e., at most 31.48% deployed relay\nnodes can be saved due to SCA algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 13:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-06"}

The central gas depletion has been attributed\nto a possible head-on collision 200 Myr ago, supported by the existence of an\noffset inner ring of warm dust. We present new IRAM 30m radio telescope\nobservations of the molecular gas in the central region, and the detection of\nCO and its isotopes $^{13}$CO(2-1) and C$^{18}$O(2-1), together with the dense\ngas tracers, HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0). A systematic study of the observed peak\ntemperatures with non-LTE equilibrium simulations shows that the detected lines\ntrace dense regions with n$_{H_2}$ in the range 2.5 $10^4 - 5.6 10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$, while the gas is very clumpy with a beam filling factor of 0.5-2\n10$^{-2}$. This is compatible with the dust mass derived from the far-infrared\nemission, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 with a typical clump size\nof 2 pc. We also show that the gas is optically thin in all lines except for\n$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1), CO lines are close to their thermal\nequilibrium condition at 17.5-20 K, the molecular hydrogen density is larger\nthan critical and HCN and HCO+ lines have a subthermal excitation temperature\nof 9 K with a density smaller than critical. The average $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO\nline ratio is high (~21), and close to the $^{12}$CO/C$^{18}$O ratio (~30) that\nwas measured in the north-western region and estimated in the south-east\nstacking. The fact that the optically thin $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines have\ncomparable intensities means that the secondary element $^{13}$C is depleted\nwith respect to the primary $^{12}$C, as is expected just after a recent star\nformation.
