Using a simplified form of the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE), originally developed for electron transport, we\ndemonstrate how ballistic phonon effects and finite-velocity propagation are\neasily and naturally captured. We show how this approach compares well to the\nphonon BTE, and readily handles a full phonon dispersion and energy-dependent\nmean-free-path. This study of transient heat transport shows i) how fundamental\ntemperature jumps at the contacts depend simply on the ballistic thermal\nresistance, ii) that phonon transport at early times approach the ballistic\nlimit in samples of any length, and iii) perceived reductions in heat\nconduction, when ballistic effects are present, originate from reductions in\ntemperature gradient. Importantly, this framework can be recast exactly as the\nCattaneo and hyperbolic heat equations, and we discuss how the key to capturing\nballistic heat effects is to use the correct physical boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 16:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Current proposed schemes such as Hierarchical Mobile IPv6\n(HMIPv6) and more importantly Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) provide localized\nmobility support by electing a node within the network (topologically close to\nthe Access Routers (AR)) to act as mobility anchor. Such schemes can\nsignificantly improve handover latency, as well as the end-to-end signalling\noverhead, but might entail scalability issues, which in some instances, do not\nfit adequately with the current explosion of mobile Internet traffic, and the\nevolutionary trend towards flat network architectures. The notion of using\nDistributed Mobility Management (DMM) allows for decentralization by anchoring\nnodes at their AR. The idea is that for sessions with duration less than the\ncell residence time efficient mobility can be supported. However, DMM might be\nhighly suboptimal in instances where nodes perform multiple handovers during\nthe session lifetime. Hence, one approach cannot be effective for all types of\napplications. In this paper a hybrid mobility management solution, integrated\nwith a new routing scheme, is proposed. The scheme selects the most suitable\nmobility approach, centralized or distributed, by taking into account the\nflows' requirement, in terms of Quality of Experience (QoE), and new routing\nconstraints. The results of optimization problem show that the proposed\napproach can achieve efficient resource utilisation, ease network congestion,\nand lead to a significant improvement in the QoE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 16:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

The period ratio is 2 in longitudinally\nhomogeneous thin tubes, but it differs from 2 due to longitudinal\ninhomogeneity. In this paper we investigate the period ratio in longitudinally\ninhomogeneous prominence threads and explore its implications for prominence\nseismology. We numerically solve the two-dimensional eigenvalue problem of kink\noscillations in a model of a prominence thread. We take into account three\nnonuniform density profiles along the thread. In agreement with previous works\nthat used simple piecewise constant density profiles, we find that the period\nratio is larger than 2 in prominence threads. When the ratio of the central\ndensity to that at the footpoints is fixed, the period ratio depends strongly\non the form of the density profile along the thread. The more concentrated the\ndense prominence plasma near the center of the tube, the larger the period\nratio. However, the period ratio is found to be independent of the specific\ndensity profile when the spatially averaged density in the thread is the same\nfor all the profiles. An empirical fit of the dependence of the period ratio on\nthe average density is given and its use for prominence seismology is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 17:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

Therefore, a generic methodology has emerged\nfrom the joint effort of several industrial companies and academic\ninstitutions. EDF R&D, Airbus Group and Phimeca Engineering started a\ncollaboration at the beginning of 2005, joined by IMACS in 2014, for the\ndevelopment of an Open Source software platform dedicated to uncertainty\npropagation by probabilistic methods, named OpenTURNS for Open source Treatment\nof Uncertainty, Risk 'N Statistics. OpenTURNS addresses the specific industrial\nchallenges attached to uncertainties, which are transparency, genericity,\nmodularity and multi-accessibility. This paper focuses on OpenTURNS and\npresents its main features: openTURNS is an open source software under the LGPL\nlicense, that presents itself as a C++ library and a Python TUI, and which\nworks under Linux and Windows environment. All the methodological tools are\ndescribed in the different sections of this paper: uncertainty quantification,\nuncertainty propagation, sensitivity analysis and metamodeling. A section also\nexplains the generic wrappers way to link openTURNS to any external code. The\npaper illustrates as much as possible the methodological tools on an\neducational example that simulates the height of a river and compares it to the\nheight of a dyke that protects industrial facilities. At last, it gives an\noverview of the main developments planned for the next few years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 17:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 08:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

The\n$^{26}$Al emission is a good illustration: the only available $^{26}$Al map to\ndate has been released, more than fifteen years ago, thanks to the COMPTEL\ninstrument. However, at the present time, the SPI spectrometer aboard the\nINTEGRAL mission offers a unique opportunity to enrich this first result. In\nthis paper, 2 $\\times$ 10$^8$ s of data accumulated between 2003 and 2013 are\nused to perform a dedicated analysis, aiming to deeply investigate the spatial\nmorphology of the $^{26}$Al emission. The data are first compared with several\nsky maps based on observations at various wavelengths to model the $^{26}$Al\ndistribution throughout the Galaxy.

To get more details about this emission, an image reconstruction is\nperformed using an algorithm based on the maximum-entropy method. In addition\nto the inner Galaxy emission, several excesses suggest that some sites of\nemission are linked to the spiral arms structure. Lastly, an estimation of the\n$^{60}$Fe line flux, assuming a spatial distribution similar to $^{26}$Al line\nemission, results in a $^{60}$Fe\\ to $^{26}$Al ratio around 0.14, which agrees\nwith the most recent studies and with the SN explosion model predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 18:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Among\nthe zoo of neutron star phenomena, magnetars stand out for their bursting\nbehaviour, ranging from extremely bright, rare giant flares to numerous, less\nenergetic recurrent bursts.

In the absence of a predictive model, understanding the\nphysical processes responsible for magnetar burst variability is difficult.\nHere, we develop an empirical model that decomposes magnetar bursts into a\nsuperposition of small spike-like features with a simple functional form, where\nthe number of model components is itself part of the inference problem. The\ncascades of spikes that we model might be formed by avalanches of reconnection,\nor crust rupture aftershocks.

The\ninfluence of stellar metallicity on nebular line strength ratios, via its\neffect on the SEDs, is of similar importance as variations in the nebular\nmetallicity. We have computed a grid of model atmosphere SEDs for massive and\nvery massive O-type stars covering a range of metallicities from significantly\nsubsolar (0.1 Zsun) to supersolar (2 Zsun).

Relational databases\nare ubiquitous in software, but symbolic execution of pieces of code that\nmanipulate them remains a non-trivial problem, particularly because of the\ncomplex structure of such databases and the complex behaviour of SQL\nstatements. In this work, we define a direct symbolic execution for database\nmanipulation code and integrate it with a more traditional symbolic execution\nof normal program code. The database tables are represented by relational\nsymbols and the SQL statements by relational constraints over these symbols and\nthe symbols representing the normal variables of the program.

One of the simplest models that\nretains the relevant dynamics of turbulent self-organization is a barotropic\nflow in a beta-plane channel with turbulence sustained by random stirring.\nNon-linear integrations of this model show that as the energy input rate of the\nforcing is increased, the homogeneity of the flow is first broken by the\nemergence of non-zonal, coherent, westward propagating structures and at larger\nenergy input rates by the emergence of zonal jets. The emergence of both\nnon-zonal coherent structures and zonal jets is studied using a statistical\ntheory, Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T). S3T directly models a\nsecond-order approximation to the statistical mean turbulent state and allows\nthe identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and study of their\nstability. Using S3T, the bifurcation properties of the homogeneous state in\nbarotropic beta-plane turbulence are determined. Analytic expressions for the\nzonal and non-zonal large-scale coherent flows that emerge as a result of\nstructural instability are obtained and the equilibration of the incipient\ninstabilities is studied through numerical integrations of the S3T dynamical\nsystem. The dynamics underlying the formation of zonal jets are also\ninvestigated. It is shown that zonal jets form from the upgradient momentum\nfluxes that result from the shearing of the eddies by the emerging\ninfinitesimal large-scale flow. Finally, numerical simulations of the nonlinear\nequations confirm the characteristics (scale, amplitude and phase speed) of the\nstructures predicted by S3T, even in highly non-linear parameter regimes such\nas the regime of zonostrophic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 19:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

While these models offer valuable physical insights\nand accurate calculations of transport properties in some cases, they often\nlack sufficient accuracy -- particularly in capturing the correct trends with\ntemperature and carrier concentration. We present here a general transport\nmodel for calculating low-field electrical drift mobility and Seebeck\ncoefficient of n-type semiconductors, by explicitly considering all relevant\nphysical phenomena (i.e. elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms). We first\nrewrite expressions for the rates of elastic scattering mechanisms, in terms of\nab initio properties, such as the band structure, density of states, and polar\noptical phonon frequency. We then solve the linear BTE to obtain the\nperturbation to the electron distribution -- resulting from the dominant\nscattering mechanisms -- and use this to calculate the overall mobility and\nSeebeck coefficient. Using our model, we accurately calculate electrical\ntransport properties of the compound n-type semiconductors, GaAs and InN, over\nvarious ranges of temperature and carrier concentration. Our fully predictive\nmodel provides high accuracy when compared to experimental measurements on both\nGaAs and InN, and vastly outperforms both semi-empirical models and the\nBTE-cRTA.

Instead,\nplanetesimals appear to form top-down, with large $100-1000$ km bodies forming\nfrom the rapid gravitational collapse of dense clumps of small solid particles.\nIn this paper we investigate the conditions under which solid particles can\nform dense clumps in a protoplanetary disk. We use a hydrodynamic code to model\nthe interaction between solid particles and the gas inside a shearing box\ninside the disk, considering particle sizes from sub-millimeter-sized\nchondrules to meter-sized rocks. We find that particles down to millimeter\nsizes can form dense particle clouds through the run-away convergence of radial\ndrift known as the streaming instability. We make a map of the range of\nconditions (strength of turbulence, particle mass-loading, disk mass, and\ndistance to the star) which are prone to producing dense particle clumps.\nFinally, we estimate the distribution of collision speeds between mm-sized\nparticles. We calculate the rate of sticking collisions and obtain a robust\nupper limit on the particle growth timescale of $\\sim$$10^5$ years. This means\nthat mm-sized chondrule aggregates can grow on a timescale much smaller than\nthe disk accretion timescale ($\\sim$$10^6 - 10^7$ years). Our results suggest a\npathway from the mm-sized grains found in primitive meteorites to fully formed\nasteroids. We speculate that asteroids may form from a positive feedback loop\nin which coagualation leads to particle clumping driven by the streaming\ninstability. This clumping, in turn reduces collision speeds and enhances\ncoagulation.} Future simulations should model coagulation and the streaming\ninstability together to explore this feedback loop further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 21:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 09:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 17:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

It is also\nproved that the proposed IP-DG method is unconditionally stable with respect to\nboth frequency $\\omega$ and mesh size $h$. Sub-optimal order (with respect to\n$h$) error estimates in the broken $H^1$-norm and in the $L^2$-norm are\nobtained in all mesh regimes.

Then, an information\ncoupling approach based on information geometry is applied for dimensionality\nreduction, with a pattern recognition example to illustrate the effectiveness.\nThese initial trials suggest the potential of communication theoretic data\nanalytics for a wide range of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 03:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This formulation enables us to naturally include the\nRayleigh stable condition for the disc rotation. It is found that the\nderivation from Keplerian disc rotation promotes the radial angular momentum\ntransfer and makes the gap shallower than in the Keplerian case. For deep gaps,\nthis shallowing effect becomes significant due to the Rayleigh condition. In\nour model, we also take into account the propagation of the density waves\nexcited by the planet, which widens the range of the angular momentum\ndeposition to the disc. The effect of the wave propagation makes the gap wider\nand shallower than the case with instantaneous wave damping.

Gusev suggested and numerically investigated the doubly\nstochastic earthquake source model. The model is supposed to demonstrate the\nfollowing features in the far-field body waves: 1) the omega-square\nhigh-frequency (HF) behavior of displacement spectra; 2) lack of the\ndirectivity effect in HF radiation; and 3) a stochastic nature of the HF signal\ncomponent. The model involves two stochastic elements: the local stress drop\n(SD) on a fault and the rupture time function (RT) with a linear dominant\ncomponent. The goal of the present study is to investigate the Gusev model\ntheoretically and to find conditions for (1, 2) to be valid and stable relative\nto receiver site. The models with smooth elements SD, RT are insufficient for\nthese purposes. Therefore SD and RT are treated as realizations of stochastic\nfields of the fractal type. The local smoothness of such fields is\ncharacterized by the fractional (Hurst) exponent H, 0 < H < 1. This allows us\nto consider a wide class of stochastic functions without regard to their global\nspectral properties. We show that the omega-square behavior of the model is\nachieved approximately if the rupture time function is almost regular (H~1)\nwhile the stress drop is rough function of any index H. However, if the rupture\nfront is linear, the local stress drop has to be function of minimal smoothness\n(H~0). The situation with the directivity effect is more complicated: for\ndifferent RT models with the same fractal index, the effect may or may not\noccur. The nature of the phenomenon is purely analytical. The main controlling\nfactor for the directivity is the degree of smoothness of the two dimensional\ndistributions of RT random function. For this reason the directivity effect is\nunstable. This means that in practice the opposite conclusions relative to the\nstatistical significance of the directivity effect are possible\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 10:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These important roles of dust have not been self-consistently\nincluded in previous numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.\nWe have therefore developed a new model by which one can investigate whether\nand how galaxy formation and evolution can be influenced by dust-related\nphysical processes such as photo-electric heating, H_2 formation on dust, and\nstellar radiation pressure on dust in detail. A novel point of the model is\nthat different dust species in a galaxy are represented by `live dust'\nparticles (i.e., not test particles). Therefore, dust particles in a galaxy not\nonly interact gravitationally with all four components of the galaxy (i.e.,\ndark matter, stars, gas, and dust) but also are grown and destroyed through\nphysical processes of ISM. First we describe a way to include dust-related\nphysical processes in Nbody+hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy evolution in\ndetail. Then we show some preliminary results of dust-regulated galaxy\nevolution. The preliminary results suggest that the evolution of dust\ndistributions driven by radiation pressure of stars is very important for the\nevolution of star formation rates, chemical abundances, H_2 fractions, and gas\ndistributions in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 11:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It is shown that current filaments, which form\ndue to the Weibel instability, develop a large scale longitudinal electric\nfield in the direction opposite to the current carried by the filaments as\npredicted by theory. Fast moving ions in the current filaments decelerate due\nto this longitudinal electric field. The same longitudinal electric field,\nwhich is partially inductive and partially electrostatic, is identified as the\nmain source of acceleration of electrons in the current filaments. The\ntransverse electric field, though larger than the longitudinal one, is shown to\nplay a smaller role in heating electrons, contrary to previous claims. It is\nfound that, in 1D, the electrons become strongly magnetized and are\n\\textit{not} accelerated beyond their initial kinetic energy. Rather, the\nheating of the electrons is enhanced by the bending and break-up of the\nfilaments, which releases electrons that would otherwise be trapped within a\nsingle filament and hence slow the development of the Weibel instability (i.e.\nthe magnetic field growth) via induction as per Lenz's law. In 2D simulations\nelectrons are heated to about one quarter of the initial kinetic energy of\nions. The magnetic energy at maximum is about 4 percent, decaying to less than\n1 percent by the end of the simulation. Most of the heating of electrons takes\nplace while the longitudinal electric field is still growing while only a small\nportion of the heating is a result of subsequent magnetic field decay.

This dependence on humans to reject\nbogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys and\nsignificant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally.\nIn this paper we explore a simple machine learning approach to real-bogus\nclassification by constructing a training set from the image data of ~32000\nreal astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium\nDeep Survey. We derive our feature representation from the pixel intensity\nvalues of a 20x20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates.

Different sources of uncertainty have been\nconsidered, mainly related to the capacity and availability of generation\nfacilities and demand, and making use of adaptive robust optimization models.\nThe mathematical formulations for these models give rise to three-level\nmixed-integer optimization problems, which are solved using different\nstrategies. Although it is true that these robust methods are more efficient\nthan their stochastic counterparts, it is also correct that solution times for\nmixed-integer linear programming problems increase exponentially with respect\nto the size of the problem. Because of this, practitioners and system operators\nneed to use computationally efficient methods when solving this type of\nproblem. In this paper the issue of improving computational performance by\ntaking different features from existing algorithms is addressed. In particular,\nwe replace the lower-level problem with a dual one, and solve the resulting\nbi-level problem using a primal cutting plane algorithm within a decomposition\nscheme. By using this alternative and simple approach, the computing time for\nsolving transmission expansion planning problems has been reduced drastically.\nNumerical results in an illustrative example, the IEEE-24 and IEEE 118-bus test\nsystems demonstrate that the algorithm is superior in terms of computational\nperformance with respect to existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 12:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 08:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Several methods have\nbeen proposed for measuring $\\Omega_{\\rm b}$. The non-parametric method\nproposed by Tremaine \\& Weinberg (1984; TW) and based on stellar kinematics is\nthe most accurate. This method has been applied so far to 17 galaxies, most of\nthem SB0 and SBa types. We have applied the TW method to a new sample of 15\nstrong and bright barred galaxies, spanning a wide range of morphological types\nfrom SB0 to SBbc. Combining our analysis with previous studies, we investigate\n32 barred galaxies with their pattern speed measured by the TW method. The\nresulting total sample of barred galaxies allows us to study the dependence of\n$\\Omega_{\\rm b}$ on galaxy properties, such as the Hubble type. We measured\n$\\Omega_{\\rm b}$ using the TW method on the stellar velocity maps provided by\nthe integral-field spectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey.

We first realized in [1] that\nthis procedure, when applied to compute the entropy of a spherical black hole\nin LQG for $\\gamma=\\pm i$, allows to reproduce exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking\narea law at the semi-classical limit. The rigorous construction of the analytic\ncontinuation of spherical black hole entropy has been done in [2]. Here, we\nstart with a review of the main steps of this construction: we recall that our\nprescription turns out to be unique (under natural assumptions) and leads to\nthe right semi-classical limit with its logarithmic quantum corrections.\nFurthermore, the discrete and $\\gamma$-dependent area spectrum of the black\nhole horizon becomes continuous and obviously $\\gamma$-independent. Then, we\nreview how this analytic continuation could be interpreted in terms of an\nanalytic continuation from the compact gauge group $SU(2)$ to the non-compact\ngauge group $SU(1,1)$ relying on an analysis of three dimensional quantum\ngravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 15:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the\nenvironment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on\necosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to\nunify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from\navailable habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed\nmovement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization\ndistribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are\neasily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability\ndensity at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that\nposition. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch\nof the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that\npatch and the surrounding habitat. 2. We propose a mechanistic model where this\nnon-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement\nprocesses, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat\nwhere the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give\nstatistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and\ndemonstrate application of these techniques to GPS data of caribou in\nNewfoundland. 3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the\nmodel have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of\nthe local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat\nare used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat,\nwhereas isolated patches are used less frequently. 4. Whilst we focus on\nhabitats in this study, our modelling framework can be readily used with any\nenvironmental covariates and therefore represents a unification of mechanistic\nmodelling and step selection approaches to understanding animal space use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 15:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

Feature-oriented scanning (FOS) methodology\nis used to implement the distributed calibration, which permits to exclude in\nsitu the negative influence of thermal drift, creep and hysteresis on the\nobtained results. The sensitivity of LCCs to errors in determination of\nposition coordinates of surface features forming the local calibration\nstructure (LCS) is eliminated by performing multiple repeated measurements\nfollowed by building regression surfaces. There are no principle restrictions\non the number of repeated LCS measurements. Possessing the calibration database\nenables correcting in one procedure all the spatial distortions caused by\nnonlinearity, nonorthogonality and spurious crosstalk couplings of the\nmicroscope scanner piezomanipulators. To provide high precision of spatial\nmeasurements in nanometer range, the calibration is carried out using natural\nstandards - constants of crystal lattice. The method allows for automatic\ncharacterization of crystal surfaces. The method may be used with any scanning\nprobe instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 15:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}
