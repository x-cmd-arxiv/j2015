As opposed to a standard finite-element discretization of the\nproblem, our method seamlessly handles a complex-valued impedance function $Z$\nthat is allowed to vanish. In the case of a vanishing impedance, the proposed\nmethod reduces to the classic Nitsche method to weakly enforce continuity over\nthe interface.

In general relativity, black holes\nare uniquely described by the Kerr metric and, according to the cosmic\ncensorship conjecture, curvature singularities always have to be clothed by an\nevent horizon. Aims. In this paper, we study the effect of an external magnetic\nfield on the observed light curves of orbiting hot spots in thin accretion\ndiscs around Kerr black holes and naked singularities. Methods. We employ a\nray-tracing algorithm to calculate the light curves and power spectra of such\nhot spots as seen by a distant observer for uniform and dipolar magnetic field\nconfigurations assuming a weak coupling between the magnetic field and the disc\nmatter. Results. We show that the presence of an external dipolar magnetic\nfield leads to potentially observable modifications of these signals for both\nKerr black holes and naked singularities, while an external uniform magnetic\nfield has practically no effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the\nemission from a hot spot orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit of a\nnaked singularity in a dipolar magnetic field can be significantly harder than\nthe emission of the same hot spot in the absence of such a magnetic field.\nConclusions. The comparison of our model with observational data may allow us\nstudy the geometry of magnetic fields around compact objects and to test the\ncosmic censorship conjecture in conjunction with other observables such as\nthermal continuum spectra and iron line profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 16:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

The HD142527 system is also unique in that it has a\nstellar companion with a small mass compared to the mass of the primary star.\nThis factor of ~20 in mass ratio between the two objects makes this binary\nsystem different from any other YSO. The HD142527 system could therefore\nprovide a valuable test bed. This low-mass stellar object may be responsible\nfor both the gap and dust trapping observed by ALMA at longer distances. We\nobserved this system with the NACO and GPI instruments using the aperture\nmasking technique. Aperture masking is ideal for providing high dynamic range\neven at very small angular separations. We present the spectral energy\ndistribution for HD142527A and B. Brightness of the companion is now known from\nthe R band up to the M' band.

Generalizing a previous result, we produce\na new family of regular languages on a two-letter alphabet having arbitrary\nhigh genus. Let $L$ be a regular language. In order to understand the genus\n$g(L)$ of $L$, we introduce the topological size of $|L|_{\\rm{top}}$ to be the\nminimal size of all finite deterministic automata of genus $g(L)$ computing\n$L$. We show that the minimal finite deterministic automaton of a regular\nlanguage can be arbitrary far away from a finite deterministic automaton\nrealizing the minimal genus and computing the same language, both in terms of\nthe difference of genera and in terms of the difference in size. In particular,\nwe show that the topological size $|L|_{\\rm{top}}$ can grow at least\nexponentially in size $|L|$. We conjecture however the genus of every regular\nlanguage to be computable. This conjecture implies in particular that the\nplanarity of a regular language is decidable, a question asked in 1976 by R.V.\nBook and A.K. Chandra. We prove here the conjecture for a fairly generic class\nof regular languages having no short cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 17:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 14:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-15"}

We also study their possible directional correlations using a\nlikelihood method stacking the neutrino arrival directions and adopting\ndifferent assumptions on the size of the UHECR magnetic deflections. Finally,\nwe perform another likelihood analysis stacking the UHECR directions and using\na sample of through-going muon tracks optimized for neutrino point-source\nsearches with sub-degree angular resolution. No indications of correlations at\ndiscovery level are obtained for any of the searches performed.

We demonstrate that magnetic arcades within the\nsolar corona can trap MHD fast waves in a 3-D waveguide. This is accomplished\nthrough the construction of a cylindrically symmetric model of a magnetic\narcade with a potential magnetic field. For a magnetically dominated plasma, we\nderive a governing equation for MHD fast waves and from this equation we show\nthat the magnetic arcade forms a 3-D waveguide if the Alfv\\'en speed increases\nmonotonically beyond a fiducial radius. Both magnetic pressure and tension act\nas restoring forces, instead of just tension as is generally assumed in 1-D\nmodels. Since magnetic pressure plays an important role, the eigenmodes involve\npropagation both parallel and transverse to the magnetic field. Using an\nanalytic solution, we derive the specific eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions\nfor an arcade possessing a discontinuous density profile. The discontinuity\nseparates a diffuse cylindrical cavity and an overlying shell of denser plasma\nthat corresponds to the bright loops. We emphasize that all of the\neigenfunctions have a discontinuous axial velocity at the density interface;\nhence, the interface can give rise to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.\nFurther, we find that all modes have elliptical polarization with the degree of\npolarization changing with height. However, depending on the line of sight,\nonly one polarization may be clearly visible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 17:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the\nconstraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an\nacquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the\nindividual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and\ncall it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an\napproximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares\nfavorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic\nand real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix\nof functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require\nbalancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the\nactual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality\napproach and develop partial update for PESC which trades off accuracy against\nspeed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial\nand full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of\nPESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are\nefficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an\neffective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified\nsolution for constrained Bayesian optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 18:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 20:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

To mitigate the potential harms of model misspecification, various\nforms of distributionally robust optimization have been applied. Although many\nof these methodologies suffer from the problem of time-inconsistency, the work\nof Klabjan et al. established a general time-consistent framework for such\nproblems by connecting to the literature on robust Markov decision processes.\n  Motivated by the fact that many forecasting models exhibit special structure,\nas well as a desire to understand the impact of positing different dependency\nstructures, in this paper we formulate and solve a time-consistent\ndistributionally robust multi-stage newsvendor model which naturally unifies\nand robustifies several inventory models with forecasting. In particular, many\nsimple models of demand forecasting have the feature that demand evolves as a\nmartingale. We consider a robust variant of such models, in which the sequence\nof future demands may be any martingale with given mean and support. Under such\na model, past realizations of demand are naturally incorporated into the\nstructure of the uncertainty set going forwards.\n  We explicitly compute the minimax optimal policy (and worst-case\ndistribution) in closed form, by combining ideas from convexity, probability,\nand dynamic programming. We prove that at optimality the worst-case demand\ndistribution corresponds to the setting in which inventory may become obsolete,\na scenario of practical interest. To gain further insight, we prove weak\nconvergence (as the time horizon grows large) to a simple and intuitive\nprocess. We also compare to the analogous setting in which demand is\nindependent across periods (analyzed previously by Shapiro), and identify\ninteresting differences between these models, in the spirit of the price of\ncorrelations studied by Agrawal et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:40:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 16:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-21"}

However, giant planets are thought to undergo inward migration within\ntheir natal protoplanetary disks, suggesting that gas giants currently\noccupying their host star's habitable zone formed further out.

Whether moons survive or not is critically related to where\nthe planet began its inward migration as well as the character of inter-lunar\nperturbations. For example, a Jupiter-like planet currently residing at 1AU\ncould lose moons if it formed beyond 5AU.

In both EAGLE and L-GALAXIES there are more central passive\ngalaxies with $M_*<10^{9.5} M_{\\odot}$ than in L-GALAXIES. This difference is\nrelated to galaxies that have entered and then left a larger halo and which are\ntreated as satellites in GALFORM. In the range $0<z<1$, the slope of the\nevolution of the star formation rate density in EAGLE is a factor of $\\approx\n1.5$ steeper than for the two SA models. The median sizes for galaxies with\n$M_*>10^{9.5} M_{\\odot}$ differ in some instances by an order of magnitude,\nwhile the stellar mass-size relation in EAGLE is a factor of $\\approx 2$\ntighter than for the two SA models. Our results suggest the need for a revision\nof how SA models treat the effect of baryonic self-gravity on the underlying\ndark matter. The treatment of gas flows in the models needs to be revised based\non detailed comparison with observations to understand in particular the\nevolution of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 11:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

The properties for HH 1158 are notably similar\nto the externally irradiated HH 444 -- HH 447 jets previously identified in\nsigma Orionis. In particular, the morphology is such that the weaker jet beam\nis tilted towards the massive stars, indicating a higher extent of\nphoto-evaporation. The high value for the Halpha/[SII] ratio is also consistent\nwith the ratios measured in other irradiated jets, including HH 444 -- HH 447.\nThe presence of an extended collimated jet that is bipolar and the evidence of\nshocked emission knots make HH 1158 the first unique case of irradiated HH jets\nat the very low-luminosity end, and provides an opportunity to learn the\nphysical properties of very faint HH jet sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

As a result, bounds on naturalness\non these theories are more relaxed than in typical supersymmetric models, since\ncollider bounds on top partners are less stringent. Here we consider the lepton\nsector of these theories. We show that a natural realization in a\nfive-dimensional completion requires the existence of scalar leptons with weak\nscale masses and study their phenomenology. We derive bounds on the masses of\nthese sleptons from the LHC data at $\\sqrt{s}=8~$TeV and study the sensitivity\nof the $\\sqrt{s}=13~$TeV run for various integrated luminosities.

Steady streaming is a classical fluid\ndynamics phenomenon whereby a time-periodic forcing in the bulk or along a\nboundary is enhanced by inertia to induce a non-zero net flow. Building on\nclassical work for simple geometrical forcing and motivated by the complex\nshape oscillations of elastic capsules and bubbles, we develop the mathematical\nframework to quantify the steady streaming of a spherical body with arbitrary\naxisymmetric time-periodic boundary conditions. We compute the flow\nasymptotically for small-amplitude oscillations of the boundary in the limit\nwhere the viscous penetration length scale is much smaller than the body. In\nthat case, the flow has a boundary layer structure and the fluid motion is\nsolved by asymptotic matching. Our results, presented in the case of no-slip\nboundary conditions and extended to include the motion of vibrating free\nsurfaces, recovers classical work as particular cases. We illustrate the flow\nstructure given by our solution and propose one application of our results for\nsmall-scale force-generation and synthetic locomotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

We study the\nformation and dynamical evolution of these clusters using a combination of\nsimulations and theoretical models. Our simulations start with a turbulent\nmolecular cloud that collapses under its own gravity. The stars are assumed to\nform in the densest regions in the collapsing cloud after an initial free-fall\ntimes of the molecular cloud. The dynamical evolution of these stellar\ndistributions are continued by means of direct $N$-body simulations. The\nmolecular clouds typical for the Milky Way Galaxy tend to form embedded\nclusters which evolve to resemble open clusters. The associations were\ninitially considerably more clumpy, but lost their irregularity in about a\ndynamical time scale due to the relaxation process. The densest molecular\nclouds, which are absent in the Milky Way but are typical in starburst\ngalaxies, form massive young star clusters. They indeed are rare in the Milky\nWay. Our models indicate a distinct evolutionary path from molecular clouds to\nopen clusters and associations or to massive star clusters. The mass-radius\nrelation for both types of evolutionary tracks excellently matches the\nobservations. According to our calculations the time evolution of the half-mass\nradius for open clusters and associations follows $r_{\\rm h}/{\\rm\npc}=2.7(t_{\\rm age}/{\\rm pc})^{2/3}$, whereas for massive star clusters $r_{\\rm\nh}/{\\rm pc}=0.34(t_{\\rm age}/{\\rm Myr})^{2/3}$.

At the first step of the game, using a random\nprescription half players are assigned the cooperation and half the defection\nstate. At the bottom level the strategy choice is done on the mere basis of\nimitation according to the homo imitans principle, generating a form of\ncollective intelligence that makes the system sensitive to the criteria\ndetermining the strategy choice adopted at the top level. The units of the top\nlevel, in fact, play the prisoner's dilemma game and are allowed to update\ntheir strategy either by selecting the strategy of the most successful nearest\nneighbor, success model, or merely on the basis of the criterion of the best\nfinancial benefit, selfishness model. The intelligence emerging from\nimitation-induced criticality leads in the former case to the extinction of\ndefection and in the latter case to the extinction of cooperation.

In order to speed up the\noptimization process and improve the scalability for large graphs, Strandmark\nand Kahl introduced a splitting method to split a graph into multiple subgraphs\nfor parallel computation in both shared and distributed memory models. However,\nthis parallel algorithm (parallel BK-algorithm) does not have a polynomial\nbound on the number of iterations and is found non-convergent in some cases due\nto the possible multiple optimal solutions of its sub-problems.\n  To remedy this non-convergence problem, in this work we first introduce a\nmerging method capable of merging any number of those adjacent sub-graphs which\ncould hardly reach an agreement on their overlapped region in the parallel BK\nalgorithm. Based on the pseudo-boolean representations of graph cuts,our\nmerging method is shown able to effectively reuse all the computed flows in\nthese sub-graphs. Through both the splitting and merging, we further propose a\ndynamic parallel and distributed graph-cuts algorithm with guaranteed\nconvergence to the globally optimal solutions within a predefined number of\niterations. In essence, this work provides a general framework to allow more\nsophisticated splitting and merging strategies to be employed to further boost\nperformance.

Furthermore, if x is of dimension K, then any\n2K entries of y are sufficient to recover x. This result implies the existence\nof deterministic unlabeled sensing matrices with an oversampling factor of 2\nthat admit perfect reconstruction.

The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when\nthe mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion\nrate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to\naccretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The\nradial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of\nthe external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the\nlow/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the\nthin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so\na strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may\naccelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may\ncarry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases\nthe radial velocity of the ADAF significantly. This leads to a high critical\nmass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive.\nOur calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic\noutflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional\nADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure $\\beta\\sim 4$ in the disk.

In regular streaming services, content providers restrict the amount\nof viewable video that users can download prior to playback. This approach can\ncause inferior user experience due to bandwidth variations, especially in\nmobile networks with varying capacity. In streamloading, the video is encoded\nusing Scalable Video Coding, and users are allowed to pre-fetch enhancement\nlayers and store them on the device, while base layers are streamed in a near\nreal-time fashion ensuring that buffering constraints on viewable content are\nmet.\n  We begin by formulating the offline problem of jointly optimizing rate\nallocation and quality selection for streamloading in a wireless network. This\nmotivates our proposed online algorithms for joint scheduling at the base\nstation and segment quality selection at receivers. The results indicate that\nstreamloading outperforms state-of-the-art streaming schemes in terms of the\nnumber of additional streams we can admit for a given video quality.\nFurthermore, the quality adaptation mechanism of our proposed algorithm\nachieves a higher performance than baseline algorithms with no (or limited)\nvideo-centric optimization of the base station's allocation of resources, e.g.,\nproportional fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 04:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

An\nexpansion in terms of effective operator dimension based on powers of the heavy\nmass scale rather than operator dimension is utilized to systematically\norganize interactions within the effective theory. Vacuum states arising from\nelectroweak singlet extensions of the Higgs sector yield at leading order only\ntwo effective dimension-six operators. One of these uniformly dilutes all the\ninteractions of a single physical Higgs boson as compared with Standard Model\nexpectations, while the combination of the two operators give more general\nmodifications of all remaining interactions with two or more physical Higgs\nbosons. Vacuum states arising from an additional electroweak doublet yield\nthree types of effective dimension-six operators that modify physical Higgs\nboson couplings to fermion pairs, self-couplings, and introduce four-fermion\ninteractions. However, in this case modification of physical Higgs boson\ninteractions with massive gauge bosons arise at leading order only from three\neffective dimension-eight operators.

For\nexample, to design a machine translation system, a typical training set will\nconsist of English sentences and their translation. There is a stronger model,\nin which the algorithm can also query for labels of new examples it creates.\nE.g, in the translation task, the algorithm can create a new English sentence,\nand request its translation from the user during training. This combination of\nexamples and queries has been widely studied. Yet, despite many theoretical\nresults, query algorithms are almost never used. One of the main causes for\nthis is a report (Baum and Lang, 1992) on very disappointing empirical\nperformance of a query algorithm. These poor results were mainly attributed to\nthe fact that the algorithm queried for labels of examples that are artificial,\nand impossible to interpret by humans.\n  In this work we study a new model of local membership queries (Awasthi et\nal., 2012), which tries to resolve the problem of artificial queries.

E.g., in translation, the algorithm\ncan change individual words in a sentence it has already seen, and then ask for\nthe translation. In this model, the examples queried by the algorithm will be\nclose to natural examples and hence, hopefully, will not appear as artificial\nor random.

In addition, we also propose a phrase\ntable pruning method which takes into account both of the source and target\nphrasal coverage. Experimental result shows that our pruning method\nsignificantly outperforms the conventional one, which only considers source\nside phrasal coverage. Furthermore, by including the entries in the lexicon\nmodel, the phrase coverage increased, and we achieved improved results in\nChinese-to-Japanese translation using English as pivot language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 08:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

We solve this problem by considering the mixings between the SM\nquarks and vector-like quarks. We show explicitly that the ATLAS diboson excess\ncan be explained in the viable parameter space of our model, which is\nconsistent with all the current experimental constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 09:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The nature of such a resonance is still under debate.\n  Purpose: We intend to describe the giant and pygmy resonances in 208 Pb by\nenhancing their fragmentation with respect to the random-phase approximation.\n  Method: We adopt the equation of motion phonon method to perform a fully\nself-consistent calculation in a space spanned by one-phonon and two-phonon\nbasis states using an optimized chiral two-body potential. A phenomenological\ndensity dependent term, derived from a contact three-body force, is added in\norder to get single-particle spectra more realistic than the ones obtained by\nusing the chiral potential only. The calculation takes into full account the\nPauli principle and is free of spurious center of mass admixtures.\n  Results: We obtain a fair description of the giant resonance and obtain a\ndense low-lying spectrum in qualitative agreement with the experimental data.\nThe transition densities as well as the phonon and particle-hole composi- tion\nof the most strongly excited states support the pygmy nature of the low-lying\nresonance. Finally, we obtain realistic values for the dipole polarizability\nand the neutron skin radius.\n  Conclusions: The results emphasize the role of the two-phonon states in\nenhancing the fragmentation of the strength in the giant resonance region and\nat low energy, consistently with experiments. For a more detailed agreement\nwith the data, the calculation suggests the inclusion of the three-phonon\nstates as well as a fine tuning of the single-particle spectrum to be obtained\nby a refinement of the nuclear potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 09:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

In this work, we present a detailed\nmulti-wavelength analysis of the 2013 December flaring event. Multi-frequency\nobservations reveal the uncorrelated variability patterns with X-ray and\noptical-UV fluxes peaking after the $\\gamma$-ray maximum. The broadband\nspectral energy distribution (SED) at the peak of the $\\gamma$-ray activity\nshows a rising $\\gamma$-ray spectrum but a declining optical-UV flux. This\nobservation along with the detection of uncorrelated variability behavior rules\nout the one-zone leptonic emission scenario. We, therefore, adopt two\nindependent methodologies to explain the SED: a time dependent lepto-hadronic\nmodeling and a two-zone leptonic radiative modeling approach. In the\nlepto-hadronic modeling, a distribution of electrons and protons subjected to a\nrandomly orientated magnetic field produces synchrotron radiation. Electron\nsynchrotron is used to explain the IR to UV emission while proton synchrotron\nemission is used to explain the high energy $\\gamma$-ray emission. A\ncombination of both electron synchrotron self Compton emission and proton\nsynchrotron emission is used to explain the X-ray spectral break seen during\nthe later stage of the flare. In the two-zone modeling, we assume a large\nemission region emitting primarily in IR to X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays to come\nprimarily from a fast moving compact emission region.

In spite of the progress in\nthe past decades in highlight removal, achieving wide applicability to the\nlarge diversity of nature scenes is quite challenging. To handle this problem,\nwe propose an analytic solution to highlight removal based on an L2\nchromaticity definition and corresponding dichromatic model. Specifically, this\npaper derives a normalized dichromatic model for the pixels with identical\ndiffuse color: a unit circle equation of projection coefficients in two\nsubspaces that are orthogonal to and parallel with the illumination,\nrespectively. In the former illumination orthogonal subspace, which is\nspecular-free, we can conduct robust clustering with an explicit criterion to\ndetermine the cluster number adaptively. In the latter illumination parallel\nsubspace, a property called pure diffuse pixels distribution rule (PDDR) helps\nmap each specular-influenced pixel to its diffuse component. In terms of\nefficiency, the proposed approach involves few complex calculation, and thus\ncan remove highlight from high resolution images fast. Experiments show that\nthis method is of superior performance in various challenging cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 12:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

The public HST images and multi-band photometry over the HDFS are used to\nconstrain the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) of the galaxies and to\nperform a morphological analysis. We derive the resolved ionized gas properties\nof these galaxies from the MUSE data and model the disk (both in 2D and with\nGalPaK$^{\\rm 3D}$) to retrieve their intrinsic gas kinematics. We build a\nsample of resolved emission-line galaxies of much lower stellar mass and SFR\n(by $\\sim$1-2 orders of magnitude) than previous 3D spectroscopic surveys. Most\nof the spatially-resolved MUSE-HDFS galaxies have gas kinematics consistent\nwith disk-like rotation, but about 20% have velocity dispersions larger than\nthe rotation velocities, and 30% are part of a close pair and/or show clear\nsigns of recent gravitational interactions. In the high-mass regime, the\nMUSE-HDFS galaxies follow the Tully-Fisher relation defined from previous\nsurveys in a similar redshift range. This scaling relation extends also to\nlower masses/velocities but with a higher dispersion. The MUSE-HDFS galaxies\nfollow the scaling relations defined in the local universe between the specific\nangular momentum and the stellar mass.

Quantum memories with\nhigh storage capacities are one such example which require long-lived states\nthat can be addressed and manipulated coherently within the inhomogeneously\nbroadened ensemble. This broadening is essential for true multimode memories,\nbut induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a\ncavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time. In this work\nwe show how to overcome both of these limitations through the engineering of\nlong-lived dark states in an ensemble of electron spins hosted by\nnitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. By burning narrow spectral holes into a\nspin ensemble strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity, we\nobserve long-lived Rabi oscillations with high visibility and a decay rate that\nis a factor of forty smaller than the spin ensemble linewidth and thereby a\nfactor of more than three below the pure cavity dissipation rate. This\nsignificant reduction lives up to the promise of hybrid devices to perform\nbetter than their individual subcomponents. To demonstrate the potential of our\napproach we realise the first step towards a solid-state microwave spin\nmultiplexer by engineering multiple long-lived dark states. Our results show\nthat we can fully access the \"decoherence free\" subspace in our experiment and\nselectively prepare protected states by spectral hole burning. This technique\nopens up the way for truly long-lived quantum memories, solid-state microwave\nfrequency combs, optical to microwave quantum transducers and spin squeezed\nstates. Our approach also paves the way for a new class of cavity QED\nexperiments with dense spin ensembles, where dipole spin-spin interactions\nbecome important and many-body phenomena will be directly accessible on a chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 13:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

This essential requirement has been largely overlooked by the\nmetabolic pathway community.\n  Indeed, every flux mode can be decomposed into elementary modes without\ncancelations. The result is an immediate consequence of a theorem by\nRockafellar which states that every element of a linear subspace is a conformal\nsum (a sum without cancelations) of elementary vectors (support-minimal\nvectors).

We investigate the influence\nof an internal subsurface ocean and of tidal deformations of the solid layers\non the obliquity of Enceladus. Our Cassini state model takes into account the\nexternal torque exerted by Saturn on each layer of the satellite and the\ninternal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of the\nliquid layer. As a new feature, our model also includes additional torques that\narise because of the periodic tides experienced by the satellite. We find that\nthe upper limit for the obliquity of a solid Enceladus is 0.00045 degrees and\nis negligibly affected by elastic deformations. The presence of an internal\nocean decreases this upper limit by 13.1%, elasticity attenuating this decrease\nby only 0.5%. Since the obliquity of Enceladus cannot reach Tyler's\nrequirement, obliquity tides are unlikely to be the source of the large heat\nflow of Enceladus. More likely, the geological activity at Enceladus' south\npole results from eccentricity tides. Even in the most favorable case, the\nupper limit for the obliquity of Enceladus corresponds to about two meters at\nmost at the surface of Enceladus. This is well below the resolution of Cassini\nimages.

Specifically, the inverse of the Planck's quantum ($h_e$) and the\nrotor's energy growth rate mimic the `filling fraction' and the `longitudinal\nconductivity' in conventional IQHE, respectively, and a hidden quantum number\nis found to mimic the `quantized Hall conductivity'. We show that for an\ninfinite discrete set of critical values of $h_e$, the long-time energy growth\nrate is universal and of order of unity (`metallic' phase), but otherwise\nvanishes (`insulating' phase). Moreover, the rotor insulating phases are\ntopological, each of which is characterized by a hidden quantum number. This\nnumber exhibits universal behavior for small $h_e$, i.e., it jumps by unity\nwhenever $h_e$ decreases, passing through each critical value. This intriguing\nphenomenon is not triggered by the like of Landau band filling, well-known to\nbe the mechanism for conventional IQHE, and far beyond the canonical\nThouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs paradigm for quantum Hall transitions.\nInstead, this dynamical phenomenon is of strong chaos origin; it does not occur\nwhen the dynamics is (partially) regular.

The organ-absorbed dose\nconversion coefficients of most organs are in good agreement with the results\nin ICRP Publication 116, however, obvious discrepancies are observed for some\norgans and certain geometries. For neutrons with energies above 2 MeV, the\neffective dose conversion coefficients of Chinese reference adult are almost\nidentical to those of ICRP Publication 116 in AP, PA, ROT and ISO geometries.\nWhen energies range from 10-8 MeV to 1 MeV, differences are within 10% in AP\n(5%), PA (8%) and ROT (-4%) geometries. However, relatively large discrepancies\nare shown in lateral and ISO geometries when energies are below 1 MeV, with\ndifferences of -15% for LLAT, -20% for RLAT and -12% for ISO, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 05:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-03"}

Theoretical predictions regarding\nearly-time SN light curves in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands are thus\nquite robust. We present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $R$-band Type II\nSN light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $>5$\ndetections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrained\ntime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. We show that the energy per unit mass\n($E/M$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-time\noptical data to the model of Rabinak & Waxman (2011), while the progenitor\nradius cannot be determined based on $R$-band data alone. We find that Type II\nSN explosion energies span a range of $E/M=(0.2-20)\\times 10^{51} \\;\n\\rm{erg/(10 M}_\\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\\left\\langle\nE/M \\right\\rangle = 0.85\\times 10^{51} \\; \\rm{erg/(10 M}_\\odot$), corrected for\nMalmquist bias. Assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates a\nlarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. Moreover, $E/M$ is positively\ncorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ produced in the explosion, as\npredicted by some recent models of core-collapse SNe. We further present\nseveral empirical correlations. The peak magnitude is correlated with the\ndecline rate ($\\Delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with the\nrise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peak\nmagnitude. Faster declining SNe are more luminous and have longer rise times.\nThis limits the possible power sources for such events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

This is beneficial for studying the global\nproperties of isolated systems and unambiguously extracting their gravitational\nradiation. The present approach implements the Einstein equations as a free\nevolution, using the BSSN and Z4 formulations (standard in current codes)\nexpressed in terms of a conformally rescaled metric as suggested by Penrose,\nand with a time-independent conformal factor. The main difficulty is that the\nresulting system of PDEs includes formally divergent terms at null infinity\nthat require a special treatment. The numerical simulations in this thesis are\nrestricted to spherical symmetry, although the regularization in the radial\ndirection is expected to also apply to the full 3D case up to some extent. A\ncritical ingredient are the gauge conditions, which rely on well-chosen source\nfunctions and damping terms and control the treatment of future null infinity\nby means of the scri-fixing condition. Once the numerical implementation was\nstabilized, stable numerical evolutions of a massless scalar field coupled to\nthe Einstein equations could be performed with regular and black hole trumpet\ninitial data on a hyperboloidal slice. The signal of the scalar field has been\nsuccessfully extracted at future null infinity. Small perturbations of regular\ninitial data give stationary data that are stable forever, while larger scalar\nfield perturbations result in the formation of a black hole. Schwarzschild\ntrumpet initial data have been found to slowly drift away from the expected\nstationary values, but for small perturbations the effect is slow enough to\nallow the observation of the power-law decay tails of the scalar field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-03"}

This\npowerful and elegant approach has proven to be fruitful in a diversity of\nvariational problems with free endpoints, when the endpoints are free to slip\nalong preset curves. We illustrate the transversality condition by the study of\na heavy inextensible rope sagging both symmetrically and asymmetrically between\ntwo steering variously-shaped guide wires without friction. In this case, the\ntransversality conditions lead to the orthogonality of the rope to the wires at\nendpoints of the rope, which is confirmed experimentally. Freeing the endpoints\nof the rope yields exact and simple analytical equations predicting the tension\nof the rope. Heavy ropes whose endpoints are free to slip between\nvariously-shaped wires are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 20:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}
