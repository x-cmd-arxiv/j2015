We\ndescribe an alternative method for identifying charge sensor events using\nwavelet edge detection.

Prior literature has\nproposed methods to match profiles and showed that it is possible to do it\naccurately, but using evaluations that focused on sampled datasets only. In\nthis paper, we study the extent to which we can reliably match profiles in\npractice, across real-world social networks, by exploiting public attributes,\ni.e., information users publicly provide about themselves. Today's social\nnetworks have hundreds of millions of users, which brings completely new\nchallenges as a reliable matching scheme must identify the correct matching\nprofile out of the millions of possible profiles. We first define a set of\nproperties for profile attributes--Availability, Consistency,\nnon-Impersonability, and Discriminability (ACID)--that are both necessary and\nsufficient to determine the reliability of a matching scheme. Using these\nproperties, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of matching schemes in\nreal practical cases. Our results show that the accuracy in practice is\nsignificantly lower than the one reported in prior literature. When considering\nentire social networks, there is a non-negligible number of profiles that\nbelong to different users but have similar attributes, which leads to many\nfalse matches. Our paper sheds light on the limits of matching profiles in the\nreal world and illustrates the correct methodology to evaluate matching schemes\nin realistic scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2015 17:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

A number of those VHE SNRs exhibit a shell-type\nmorphology spatially coincident with the shock front of the SNR. The members of\nthis VHE shell SNR club are RX J1713.7-3946, Vela Jr, RCW 86, SN 1006, and HESS\nJ1731-347. The latter two objects have been poorly studied in high-energy (HE,\n0.1<E<100 GeV) gamma-rays and need to be investigated in order to draw the\nglobal picture of this class of SNRs and constrain the characteristics of the\nunderlying population of accelerated particles. Using 6 years of Fermi P7\nreprocessed data, we studied the HE counterpart of the SNRs HESS J1731-347 and\nSN 1006. The two SNRs are not detected in the data and given that there is no\nhint of detection, we do not expect any detection in the coming years from the\nSNRs. However in both cases, we derived upper limits that significantly\nconstrain the gamma-ray emission mechanism and can rule out a standard hadronic\nscenario with a confidence level > 5 sigma. With this Fermi analysis, we now\nhave a complete view of the HE to VHE gamma-ray emission of TeV shell SNRs. All\nfive sources have a hard HE photon index (<1.8) suggesting a common scenario\nwhere the bulk of the emission is produced by accelerated electrons radiating\nfrom radio to VHE gamma-rays through synchrotron and inverse Compton processes.\nIn addition when correcting for the distance, all SNRs show a surprisingly\nsimilar gamma-ray luminosity supporting the idea of a common emission\nmechanism. While the gamma-ray emission is likely to be leptonic dominated,\nthis does not rule out efficient hadron acceleration in those SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2015 20:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

Existing methods only focus on defining event-specific concepts for a\nsmall number of predefined events, but cannot handle novel unseen events. This\nmotivates us to build a large scale event-specific concept library that covers\nas many real-world events and their concepts as possible. Specifically, we\nchoose WikiHow, an online forum containing a large number of how-to articles on\nhuman daily life events. We perform a coarse-to-fine event discovery process\nand discover 500 events from WikiHow articles. Then we use each event name as\nquery to search YouTube and discover event-specific concepts from the tags of\nreturned videos. After an automatic filter process, we end up with 95,321\nvideos and 4,490 concepts. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model\non the 95,321 videos over the 500 events, and use the model to extract deep\nlearning feature from video content. With the learned deep learning feature, we\ntrain 4,490 binary SVM classifiers as the event-specific concept library. The\nconcepts and events are further organized in a hierarchical structure defined\nby WikiHow, and the resultant concept library is called EventNet. Finally, the\nEventNet concept library is used to generate concept based representation of\nevent videos. To the best of our knowledge, EventNet represents the first video\nevent ontology that organizes events and their concepts into a semantic\nstructure.

For example, if $G$ is $k$-regular then\n$\\rho=2\\sqrt{k-1}$. We show that for every $r$, there is an $r$-covering\n(a.k.a. an $r$-lift) of $G$ where all the new eigenvalues are bounded from\nabove by $\\rho$. It follows that a bipartite Ramanujan graph has a Ramanujan\n$r$-covering for every $r$. This generalizes the $r=2$ case due to Marcus,\nSpielman and Srivastava (2013).\n  Every $r$-covering of $G$ corresponds to a labeling of the edges of $G$ by\nelements of the symmetric group $S_{r}$. We generalize this notion to labeling\nthe edges by elements of various groups and present a broader scenario where\nRamanujan coverings are guaranteed to exist.\n  In particular, this shows the existence of richer families of bipartite\nRamanujan graphs than was known before. Inspired by Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava,\na crucial component of our proof is the existence of interlacing families of\npolynomials for complex reflection groups. The core argument of this component\nis taken from a recent paper of them (2015).\n  Another important ingredient of our proof is a new generalization of the\nmatching polynomial of a graph. We define the $r$-th matching polynomial of $G$\nto be the average matching polynomial of all $r$-coverings of $G$. We show this\npolynomial shares many properties with the original matching polynomial. For\nexample, it is real rooted with all its roots inside $\\left[-\\rho,\\rho\\right]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 01:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 16:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2017 11:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-05"}

For W{100} and W{110} surfaces, He atoms\ncan quickly escape out near the surface without accumulation even at a\ntemperature of 400 K. The behaviours of helium atoms can be well-described by\nthe theory of continuous diffusion of particles in a semi-infinite medium. For\na W{111} surface, the situation is complex. Different types of trap mutations\noccur within the neighbouring region of the W{111} surface. The trap mutations\nhinder the escape of He atoms, resulting in their accumulation. The probability\nof a He atom escaping into vacuum from a trap mutation depends on the type of\nthe trap mutation, and the occurrence probabilities of the different types of\ntrap mutations are dependent on the temperature. This finding suggests that the\nescape rate of He atoms on the W{111} surface does not show a monotonic\ndependence on temperature. For instance, the escape rate at T=1500 K is lower\nthan the rate at T=1100 K.

At\nthe same time it is a very promising approach, since concurrent programs are\ndifficult to get right, or to analyze with traditional verification techniques.\nThis paper gives an introduction to distributed synthesis in the setting of\nMazurkiewicz traces, and its applications to decentralized runtime monitoring.\n1 Context Modern computing systems are increasingly distributed and\nheterogeneous. Software needs to be able to exploit these advances, providing\nmeans for applications to be more performant. Traditional concurrent\nprogramming paradigms, as in Java, are based on threads, shared-memory, and\nlocking mechanisms that guard access to common data. More recent paradigms like\nthe reactive programming model of Erlang [4] and Scala [35,36] replace shared\nmemory by asynchronous message passing, where sending a message is\nnon-blocking. In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is\na serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a\nsequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a\nconcurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of\nconcurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main\nmethod for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent\nprograms. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce:\nthey may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of\ntaking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as\nmodel-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very\nlimited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large\nnumber of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal\nanalysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for\nprograms. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an\nabstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains,\nviewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major\nsimplification consists in disallowing recursion. This leads to a very robust\ncomputational model, namely finite-state automata and regular languages.\nRegular languages of words (and trees) are particularly well understood\nnotions. The deep connections between logic and automata revealed by the\nfoundational work of B\\\"uchi, Rabin, and others, are the main ingredients in\nautomata-based verification .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 07:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

An inner pressure bump must have been present since early in the\ndisk lifetime to have good agreement between the dust evolution models and the\ncontinuum observations of HD 100546. This pressure bump may have resulted from\nthe presence of a very massive planet ($\\sim20 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), which formed\nearly in the inner disk ($r\\sim$10 AU).

Among the\nvarious models which have been proposed to explain this anisotropy, one class\nof models considers the effect of the Lorentz force associated with the\nmagnetic field diffused within the inner core. In this paper we extend previous\nstudies and use analytical calculations and numerical simulations to predict\nthe geometry and strength of the flow induced by the poloidal component of the\nLorentz force in a neutrally or stably stratified growing inner core, exploring\nalso the effect of different types of boundary conditions at the inner core\nboundary (ICB). Unlike previous studies, we show that the boundary condition\nthat is most likely to produce a significant deformation and seismic anisotropy\nis impermeable, with negligible radial flow through the boundary. Exact\nanalytical solutions are found in the case of a negligible effect of buoyancy\nforces in the inner core (neutral stratification), while numerical simulations\nare used to investigate the case of stable stratification. In this situation,\nthe flow induced by the Lorentz force is found to be localized in a shear layer\nbelow the ICB, which thickness depends on the strength of the stratification,\nbut not on the magnetic field strength. We obtain scaling laws for the\nthickness of this layer, as well as for the flow velocity and strain rate in\nthis shear layer as a function of the control parameters, which include the\nmagnitude of the magnetic field, the strength of the density stratification,\nthe viscosity of the inner core, and the growth rate of the inner core. We find\nthat the resulting strain rate is probably too small to produce significant\ntexturing unless the inner core viscosity is smaller than about $10^{12}$ Pa.s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 08:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

However, the few examples that do exist\nhave shown Ly$\\alpha$ emission to be a substantial radiator of the total energy\nbudget of solar flares (on the order of 10%). It is also a known driver of\nfluctuations in earth's ionosphere. The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE)\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory now provides broadband, photometric\nLy$\\alpha$ data at 10 s cadence with its Multiple EUV Grating\nSpectrograph-Photometer (MEGS-P) component, and has observed scores of solar\nflares in the 5 years since it was launched.

Furthermore, the emission detected by MEGS-P peaks around the time of\nthe peak of thermal soft X-ray emission, rather than during the impulsive phase\nwhen energy deposition in the chromosphere - often assumed to be in the form of\nnonthermal electrons - is greatest.

Analysis of archival Chandra and RXTE observations\nrevealed the presence of an intrinsically narrow Fe Ka emission line in the\nspectrum obtained during the source's current high luminosity period. However,\nthe line was not present during an XMM-Newton observation seven years earlier,\nwhen the source was ~three times fainter. The line is resolved by the high\nenergy grating of Chandra at the 98% confidence level, and its small intrinsic\nwidth, sigma=36.4 (-/+ 11.3,15.3)eV, suggests reflection off an accretion disk\nat the radius R~7.5(-/+ 3.8,8.2)x10^8cm assuming a Keplerian disk, viewed at an\ninclination angle of 20deg. This value is consistent with the radius of the\nmagnetosphere of the pulsar, suggesting that the line originates near the inner\nedge of a disk that is truncated by the magnetic field of the neutron star.\nTiming analysis of the XMM-Newton and RXTE data revealed a major change in the\npulse profile of the source from a distinct double peaked shape during the high\nluminosity state when the line was present, to a much more complex multi-peak\nstructure during the low luminosity state. We argue that the appearance of the\nline and the change in the shape of the pulse profile are correlated and are\nthe result of a major change in the emission diagram of the accretion column,\nfrom a pencil-beam pattern at low luminosity, to a fan-beam pattern at high\nluminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 09:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 11:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

First, the rank-size rule is found not to be a standard\npower law, as in many other studies, but a doubly decreasing power law. Next,\nthe Kendall and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients which measure pair\nconcordance and the correlation between fluctuations in two rankings,\nrespectively, - as a correlation function does in thermodynamics, are\ncalculated for finding rank correlation (if any) between demography and wealth.\nResults show non only global disparities for the whole (country) set, but also\n(regional) disparities, when comparing the number of cities in regions, the\nnumber of inhabitants in cities and that in regions, as well as when comparing\nthe aggregated tax income of the cities and that of regions. Different outliers\nare pointed out and justified. Interestingly, two classes of cities in the\ncountry and two classes of regions in the country are found. \"Common sense\"\nsocial, political, and economic considerations sustain the findings. More\nimportantly, the methods show that they allow to distinguish communities, very\nclearly, when specific criteria are numerically sound. A specific modeling for\nthe findings is presented, i.e. for the doubly decreasing power law and the two\nphase system, based on statistics theory, e.g., urn filling. The model ideas\ncan be expected to hold when similar rank relationship features are observed in\nfields.

Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus\nsolely on L1-penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict\nmodel assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected\nindependently of X.\n  In this work, we study a simple hard-thresholding algorithm called TORRENT\nwhich, under mild conditions on X, can recover w* exactly even if b corrupts\nthe response variables in an adversarial manner, i.e. both the support and\nentries of b are selected adversarially after observing X and w*.

The results reveal that the\ntechniques with subgraph induction underestimate the degree and clustering\ndistribution, while overestimate average degree and density of the original\nnetworks.

Moreover, chiEFT is able to provide\nwell-founded estimates of statistical and systematic uncertainties -- although\nthis unique advantage has not yet been fully exploited. We fill this gap by\nperforming an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy\nconstants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol\ncorresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in\nthe pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing\nthe full model capabilities of chiEFT. We study the effect on other observables\nby demonstrating error-propagation methods that can easily be adopted by future\nworks. We employ mathematical optimization and implement automatic\ndifferentiation to attain efficient and machine-precise first- and second-order\nderivatives of the objective function with respect to the LECs. We use\npower-counting arguments to estimate the systematic uncertainty that is\ninherent to chiEFT and we construct chiral interactions at different orders\nwith quantified uncertainties. Statistical error propagation is compared with\nMonte Carlo sampling showing that statistical errors are in general small\ncompared to systematic ones. In conclusion, we find that a simultaneous fit to\ndifferent sets of data is critical to (i) identify the optimal set of LECs,\n(ii) capture all relevant correlations, (iii) reduce the statistical\nuncertainty, and (iv) attain order-by-order convergence in chiEFT. Furthermore,\ncertain systematic uncertainties in the few-nucleon sector are shown to get\nsubstantially magnified in the many-body sector; in particlar when varying the\ncutoff in the chiral potentials. The methodology and results presented in this\nPaper open a new frontier for uncertainty quantification in ab initio nuclear\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 12:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 14:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 15:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

We review a recent modified entropy method (for non-symmetric\nFokker-Planck equations with drift terms that are linear in the position\nvariable). Second, kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with non-quadratic\npotentials are another example of non-symmetric Fokker-Planck equations. Their\ndrift term is nonlinear in the position variable. In case of potentials with\nbounded second-order derivatives, the modified entropy method allows to prove\nexponential convergence of solutions to the steady state.

The short, coherent variations, with frequencies\nabove 1 Hz, are referred to as quasi-periodic oscillations, and are generally\nexplained by resonant effects in the black hole accretion flow. The purely\nstochastic variability that occurs due to turbulent conditions in the plasma,\nis quantified by the power density spectra and appears practically in all types\nof sources and their spectral states. The specific kind of quasi-periodic\nflares is expected, when the global structure of the accretion flow, governed\nby the nonlinear hydrodynamics, induces fluctuations around a fixed point\nsolution. These conditions, which occur at high accretion rates, lead to the\nvariability in the sense of deterministic chaos. We study the nonlinear\nbehaviour of X-ray sources using the recurrence analysis method. We estimate\nquantitatively the indications for deterministic chaos, such as the Renyi's\nentropy, for the observed time series, and we compare them with the surrogate\ndata. Using the data collected by RXTE satellite, we reveal the oscillations\npattern and the observable properties of six black hole systems. We confirm\nthat both the well known microquasar GRS 1915+105, as well as its recently\ndiscovered analogue, IGR J17091-3624, exhibit variability characteristic to\ndeterministic chaotic system.

We tested the method using the M31\nglobular cluster system and then applied to explain the observed color\nbimodality in globular cluster sets and tidal effects on it. We show that the\ncolor bimodality is an effect of a nonlinearity in the color-metallicity\nrelation caused by stellar dynamics on the Giant Branch, that colors including\nonly the UV show a weaker bimodality than those subtracting from visual bands\nand that cluster sets with a distinct bimodality are in principle older than\nthose with only a weak bimodal distribution.

Methods: In\nthe context of the incoming DAAs, we used a dynamic individual-based model\nincluding a model of the people who inject drugs (PWID) social network to\nsimulate the impact of improved testing, linkage to care, and adherence to\ntreatment, and of modified treatment recommendation on the transmission and on\nthe morbidity of HCV in PWID in France.

The core\nis capable of operating as a soft-input soft-output log-likelihood ratio (LLR)\nMIMO detector which can be used in the context of iterative detection and\ndecoding. High area-efficiency is achieved via algorithmic and architectural\noptimizations performed at two levels. First, distance computations and slicing\noperations for an optimal 2-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) MIMO detector are\noptimized to eliminate the use of multipliers and reduce the overhead of\nslicing in the presence of soft-input LLRs. We show that distances can be\neasily computed using elementary addition operations, while optimal slicing is\ndone via efficient comparisons with soft decision boundaries, resulting in a\nsimple feed-forward pipelined architecture. Second, to support more layers, an\nefficient channel decomposition scheme is presented that reduces the detection\nof multiple layers into multiple 2-layer detection subproblems, which map onto\nthe 2-layer core with a slight modification using a distance accumulation stage\nand a post-LLR processing stage.
