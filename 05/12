When used to measure the secretion of antibodies from\nhybridoma cells, a broad range of time-dependent concentrations was observed:\nfrom steady-state secretions of 230 pM near the cell surface to large\ntransients which reached as high as 56 nM over several minutes and then\ndissipated.

The local\nscaling exponents computed from the second-order structure functions exist\nplateaus for velocity and active scalar, while that for passive scalar takes\nfirst a minimum of 0.61 then a maximum of 0.73. The mixed third-order structure\nfunction of velocity and passive scalar satisfies the 4/3-law.

At large amplitudes, the p.d.f.\nof active scalar fluctuations is super-Gaussian, whereas that of passive scalar\nfluctuations is sub-Gaussian. Moreover, the p.d.f.s of the two scalar\nincrements are concave and convex shapes, respectively, which exhibit strong\nintermittency at small scales, and approach Gaussian as scale increases. The\nactive scalar has \"ramp-cliff\" structures, while the passive scalar seems to be\ndominated by rarefaction and compression. By employing a \"coarse-graining\"\napproach, we study scalar cascades. Unlike passive scalar, the cascade of\nactive scalar is mainly determined by the viscous dissipation at small scales\nand the pressure-dilatation at large scales, where the latter is substantial in\nthe vicinity of small-scale shocklets but is negligible after space averages,\nbecause of the cancelations between rarefaction and compression regions.\nFinally, in the inertial range, the p.d.f.s for the subgrid-scale fluxes of\nscalars can collapse to the same distribution, revealing the scale-invariant\nfeature for the statistics of active and passive scalars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 16:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

Among\nothers, a non-linear resonance between axisymmetric epicyclic oscillation modes\nof an accretion disc around a Kerr black hole has been considered as a model\nfor the observed high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs).\nEstimates of spin predicted by this model have been derived based on the\ngeodesic approximation of the accreted fluid motion. Here we assume accretion\nflow described by the model of a pressure-supported torus and carry out related\ncorrections to the mass-spin estimates. We find that for dimensionless black\nhole spin a<0.9, the resonant eigenfrequencies are very close to those\ncalculated for the geodesic motion. Their values slightly grow with increasing\ntorus thickness. These findings agree well with results of a previous study\ncarried out in the pseudo-Newtonian approximation. The situation becomes\ndifferent for a>0.9, in which case the resonant eigenfrequencies rapidly\ndecrease as the torus thickness increases. We conclude that the assumed\nnon-geodesic effects shift the lower limit of the spin, implied for the three\nmicroquasars by the epicyclic model and independently measured masses, from\na~0.7 to a~0.6. Their consideration furthermore confirms compatibility of the\nmodel with the rapid spin of GRS 1915+105 and provides highly testable\npredictions of the QPO frequencies. Individual sources with a moderate spin\n(a<0.9) should exhibit a smaller spread of the measured 3:2 QPO frequencies\nthan sources with a near-extreme spin (a~1). This should be further examined\nusing the large amount of high-resolution data expected to become available\nwith the next generation of X-ray instruments, such as the proposed Large\nObservatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 17:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Therefore the observation of a constant dipole anisotropy indicates\nthat a single source dominates the CR flux in the corresponding energy range.

Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning, which may result in\nexpensive query evaluation, while others apply heuristics aiming at minimizing\ninter-node communication during query evaluation. This requires an expensive\ndata preprocessing phase, leading to high startup costs for very large RDF\nknowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the query workload has also been used to\ncreate partitions, which however are static and do not adapt to workload\nchanges; hence, inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided for\nqueries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning.\n  In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system, which addresses\nthe shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash applies lightweight\npartitioning on the initial data, that distributes triples by hashing on their\nsubjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time, the\nlocality-aware query optimizer of AdHash takes full advantage of the\npartitioning to (i)support the fully parallel processing of join patterns on\nsubjects and (ii) minimize data communication for general queries by applying\nhash distribution of intermediate results instead of broadcasting, wherever\npossible. Second, AdHash monitors the data access patterns and dynamically\nredistributes and replicates the instances of the most frequent ones among\nworkers. As a result, the communication cost for future queries is drastically\nreduced or even eliminated. To control replication, AdHash implements an\neviction policy for the redistributed patterns. Our experiments with synthetic\nand real data verify that AdHash (i) starts faster than all existing systems,\n(ii) processes thousands of queries before other systems become online, and\n(iii) gracefully adapts to the query load, being able to evaluate queries on\nbillion-scale RDF data in sub-seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 18:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

We develop a novel statistical method, based on the\nHalo Occupation Distribution model (HOD), to solve for this mapping by jointly\nfitting the galaxy clustering and the galaxy-galaxy lensing measured from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The method, called the iHOD model, extracts\nmaximum information from the survey by including ~80% more galaxies than the\ntraditional HOD methods, and takes into account the incompleteness of the\nstellar mass samples in a statistically consistent manner. The derived\nstellar-to-halo mass relation not only explains the clustering and lensing of\nSDSS galaxies over almost four decades in stellar mass, but also successfully\npredicts the stellar mass functions observed in SDSS. Due to its capability of\nmodelling significantly more galaxies, the iHOD is able to break the degeneracy\nbetween the logarithmic scatter in the stellar mass at fixed halo mass and the\nslope of the stellar-to-halo mass relation at high mass end, without the need\nto assume a strong prior on the scatter and/or use the stellar mass function as\nan input.

Initial\nmass also becomes important below a \"turnoff mass,\" which varies with orbital\ndistance, with mass-radius curves being approximately flat for higher masses.\nInitial radius is the least important parameter we study, with very little\ndifference between the hot start and cold start limits after an age of 100 Myr.\nModel sets with no mass loss fail to produce results consistent with\nobservations, but a plausible range of mass loss scenarios is allowed. In\naddition, we present scenarios for the formation of the Kepler-11 planets. Our\nbest fit to observations Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c involves formation beyond\nthe snow line, after which they moved inward, circularized, and underwent a\nreduced degree mass loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 20:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 21:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The combination of these ideas makes the security proofs of quantum\ncryptography a complicated task. To prove that a quantum-cryptography protocol\nis secure, assumptions are made about the protocol and its devices. If these\nassumptions are not justified in an implementation then an eavesdropper may\nbreak the security of the protocol. Therefore, security is crucially dependent\non which assumptions are made and how justified the assumptions are in an\nimplementation of the protocol.\n  This thesis is primarily a review that analyzes and clarifies the connection\nbetween the security proofs of quantum-cryptography protocols and their\nexperimental implementations. In particular, we focus on quantum key\ndistribution: the task of distributing a secret random key between two parties.\nWe provide a comprehensive introduction to several concepts: quantum mechanics\nusing the density operator formalism, quantum cryptography, and quantum key\ndistribution. We define security for quantum key distribution and outline\nseveral mathematical techniques that can either be used to prove security or\nsimplify security proofs. In addition, we analyze the assumptions made in\nquantum cryptography and how they may or may not be justified in\nimplementations.\n  Along with the review, we propose a framework that decomposes\nquantum-key-distribution protocols and their assumptions into several classes.\nProtocol classes can be used to clarify which proof techniques apply to which\nkinds of protocols. Assumption classes can be used to specify which assumptions\nare justified in implementations and which could be exploited by an\neavesdropper.

By\nsplitting our sample by redshift, we can use the fixed size of the SDSS fiber\nto model the stellar populations at different radii within galaxies. At\n0.02<z<0.04, the SDSS fiber radius corresponds to ~1 kpc, which is the typical\nhalf-light radii of both classical bulges and disky pseudobulges. Assuming that\nthe SDSS fiber primarily covers the bulges at these redshifts, our analysis\nshows that there are no significant differences in the stellar populations,\ni.e., stellar age, [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [N/Fe], of the bulges of barred vs.\nunbarred quiescent disk galaxies. Modeling the stellar populations at different\nredshift intervals from z=0.020 to z=0.085 at fixed stellar masses produces an\nestimate of the stellar population gradients out to about half the typical\neffective radius of our sample, assuming null evolution over this ~1 Gyr epoch.\nWe find that there are no noticeable differences in the slopes of the\nazimuthally averaged gradients of barred vs. unbarred quiescent disk galaxies.\nThese results suggest that bars are not a strong influence on the chemical\nevolution of quiescent disk galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 20:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The progenitor is a tight binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) core\nand a neutron star (NS) companion, a subclass of the newly proposed\n\"ultra-stripped\" binaries. The CO-NS short-period orbit causes the NS to\naccrete appriciable matter from the SN ejecta when the CO core collapses,\nultimately causing it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and producing a GRB.\nThese tight binaries evolve through the SN explosion very differently than\ncompact binaries studied in population synthesis calculations. First, the\nhypercritical accretion onto the NS companion alters both the mass and momentum\nof the binary. Second, because the explosion timescale is on par with the\norbital period, the mass ejection can not be assumed to be instantaneous. This\ndramatically affects the post-SN fate of the binary. Finally, the bow shock\ncreated as the accreting NS plows through the SN ejecta transfers angular\nmomentum, braking the orbit. These systems remain bound even if a large\nfraction of the binary mass is lost in the explosion (well above the canonical\n50\\% limit), and even large kicks are unlikely to unbind the system.

Simulations with relatively low resolution now succeed in\ndescribing the overall galaxy population. For example, the EAGLE simulation in\nvolumes up to 100 cubic Mpc reproduces the observed local galaxy mass function\nnearly as well as semi-analytic models. It once seemed that galaxies are pretty\nsmooth, that they generally grow in size as they evolve, and that they are a\ncombination of disks and spheroids. But recent HST observations combined with\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations are showing that most star-forming\ngalaxies are very clumpy; that galaxies often undergo compaction which reduces\ntheir radius and increases their central density; and that most lower-mass\nstar-forming galaxies are not spheroids or disks but are instead elongated when\ntheir centers are dominated by dark matter. We also review LCDM challenges on\nsmaller scales: cusp-core, \"too big to fail,\" and substructure issues. Although\nstarbursts can rapidly drive gas out of galaxy centers and thereby reduce the\ndark matter density, it remains to be seen whether this or other baryonic\nphysics can explain the observed rotation curves of the entire population of\ndwarf and low surface brightness galaxies. If not, perhaps more complicated\nphysics such as self-interacting dark matter may be needed. But standard LCDM\nappears to be successful in predicting the dark matter halo substructure that\nis now observed via gravitational lensing and breaks in cold stellar streams,\nand any alternative theory must do at least as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 22:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The intermediate node connects the source and the destination nodes via a\nset of noiseless parallel channels, with sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively. A\nmessage $M$ is to be sent from S to D. The information in the network may be\neavesdropped by a set of wiretappers. The wiretappers cannot communicate with\none another. Each wiretapper can access a subset of channels, called a wiretap\nset. All the chosen wiretap sets form a wiretap pattern. A random key $K$ is\ngenerated at S and a coding scheme on $(M, K)$ is employed to protect $M$. We\ndefine two decoding classes at D: In Class-I, only $M$ is required to be\nrecovered and in Class-II, both $M$ and $K$ are required to be recovered. The\nobjective is to minimize $H(K)/H(M)$ {for a given wiretap pattern} under the\nperfect secrecy constraint. The first question we address is whether routing is\noptimal on this simple network. By enumerating all the wiretap patterns on the\nClass-I/II $(3,3)$ networks and harnessing the power of Shannon-type\ninequalities, we find that gaps exist between the bounds implied by routing and\nthe bounds implied by Shannon-type inequalities for a small fraction~($<2\\%$)\nof all the wiretap patterns. The second question we investigate is the\nfollowing: What is $\\min H(K)/H(M)$ for the remaining wiretap patterns where\ngaps exist? We study some simple wiretap patterns and find that their Shannon\nbounds (i.e., the lower bound induced by Shannon-type inequalities) can be\nachieved by linear codes, which means routing is not sufficient even for the\n($3$, $3$) network. For some complicated wiretap patterns, we study the\nstructures of linear coding schemes under the assumption that they can achieve\nthe corresponding Shannon bounds....\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 02:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 15:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 06:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

However, there are some shortcomings,\nwhich question effectiveness of MRI. Now the question arises, whether other\nhydromagnetic effects, e.g. transient growth (TG), can play important role to\nbring nonlinearity in the system, even at weak magnetic fields. Otherwise,\nwhether MRI or TG, which is primarily responsible to reveal nonlinearity to\nmake the flow turbulent? Our results prove explicitly that the flows with high\nReynolds number (Re), which is the case of realistic astrophysical accretion\ndisks, exhibit nonlinearity by TG of perturbation modes faster than that by\nmodes producing MRI. For a fixed wave vector, MRI dominates over transient\neffects, only at low Re, lower than its value expected to be in astrophysical\naccretion disks, and low magnetic fields.

In events with high multiplicity, however, the\nstandard approach to tag boosted resonances by a large-radius fat jet becomes\ndifficult because the resonances are not well-separated from other hard\nradiation. In this paper, we propose a different approach to tag and\nreconstruct boosted resonances by using the recently proposed mass-jump jet\nalgorithm. A key feature of the algorithm is the flexible radius of the jets,\nwhich results from a terminating veto that prevents the recombination of two\nhard prongs if their combined jet mass is substantially larger than the masses\nof the separate prongs. The idea of collecting jets in \"buckets\" is also used.\nAs an example, we consider the fully hadronic final state of pair-produced\nvectorlike top partners at the LHC, $pp\\to T\\bar{T}\\to t\\bar{t}HH$, and show\nthat the new approach works better than the corresponding generalized $k_T$ jet\nclustering algorithm.

Asteroids are traditionally thought to form\nin a bottom-up process by coagulation within a population of initially km-scale\nplanetesimals. However, new models challenge this idea by demonstrating that\nasteroids of sizes from 100 to 1000 km can form directly from the gravitational\ncollapse of small particles which have organised themselves in dense filaments\nand clusters in the turbulent gas. Particles concentrate passively between\neddies down to the smallest scales of the turbulent gas flow and inside\nlarge-scale pressure bumps and vortices. The streaming instability causes\nparticles to take an active role in the concentration, by piling up in dense\nfilaments whose friction on the gas reduces the radial drift compared to that\nof isolated particles. In this chapter we review new paradigms for asteroid\nformation and compare critically against the observed properties of asteroids\nas well as constraints from meteorites. Chondrules of typical sizes from 0.1 to\n1 mm are ubiquitous in primitive meteorites and likely represent the primary\nbuilding blocks of asteroids.

Atomic violations may be avoided by grouping the\ncorrelated atomic regions in a single larger atomic scope. Concurrent programs\nare particularly prone to atomicity violations when they use services provided\nby third party packages or modules, since the programmer may fail to identify\nwhich services are correlated. In this paper we propose to use contracts for\nconcurrency, where the developer of a module writes a set of contract terms\nthat specify which methods are correlated and must be executed in the same\natomic scope. These contracts are then used to verify the correctness of the\nmain program with respect to the usage of the module(s).

In\nthis paper, a modified LBGK model is developed for incompressible thermal flows\nin porous media at the representative elementary volume scale, in which the\nshear rate and temperature gradient are incorporated into the equilibrium\ndistribution functions. With two additional parameters, the relaxation times in\nthe collision process can be fixed at a proper value invariable to the\nviscosity and the effective thermal diffusivity.

In this case, the\nnear-horizon geometry is AdS_2 x H^2, where the scalar goes to the other,\nnon-supersymmetric, critical point of the potential. Our solution displays\nfall-off behaviours different from the standard one, due to the fact that the\nmass parameter $m^2=-2/\\ell^2$ at the supersymmetric vacuum lies in a\ncharacteristic range $m^2_{BF}\\le m^2\\le m^2_{\\rm BF}+\\ell^{-2}$ for which the\nslowly decaying scalar field is also normalizable. Nevertheless, we identify a\nwell-defined mass for our spacetime, following the prescription of Hertog and\nMaeda. Quite remarkably, the product of all horizon areas is not given in terms\nof the asymptotic cosmological constant alone, as one would expect in absence\nof electromagnetic charges and angular momentum. Our solution shows\nqualitatively the same thermodynamic behaviour as the Schwarzschild-AdS black\nhole, but the entropy is always smaller for a given mass and AdS curvature\nradius. We also find that our spherical black holes are unstable against radial\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 12:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 13:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-25"}

This dichotomy is a culmination of previous ones, including those\nfor Spin Systems, Holant, and #CSP. A recurring theme has been that a\nholographic reduction to FKT is a universal strategy. Surprisingly, for planar\nHolant, we discover new planar tractable problems that are not expressible by a\nholographic reduction to FKT.\n  In previous work, an important tool was a dichotomy for #CSP^d, which denotes\n#CSP where every variable appears a multiple of d times.

Broad HeII emission has been attributed to stellar\nemission from a population of evolved Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars while narrow HeII\nemission has been attributed to nebular emission excited by a population of\nvery hot PopIII stars formed in pockets of pristine gas at moderate redshifts.\nIn this work we propose an alternative scenario for the origin of the narrow\nHeII emission, namely very massive stars (VMS) at low metallicity (Z) which\nform strong but slow WR-type stellar winds due to their proximity to the\nEddington limit. We estimate the expected HeII line fluxes and equivalent\nwidths based on wind models for VMS and population synthesis models, and\ncompare the results with recent observations of star-forming galaxies at\nmoderate redshifts. The observed HeII line strengths and equivalent widths are\nin line with what is expected for a population of VMS in one or more young\nsuper-clusters located within these galaxies. In our scenario the two observed\nmodes of HeII emission originate from massive stellar populations in distinct\nevolutionary stages at low Z. If this interpretation is correct there is no\nneed to postulate the existence of PopIII stars at moderate redshifts to\nexplain the observed narrow HeII emission. An interesting possibility is the\nexistence of self-enriched VMS with similar WR-type spectra at extremely low Z.\nStellar HeII emission from such very early generations of VMS may be detectable\nin future studies of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts with the James\nWebb Space Telescope.

Both longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations\ncontribute significantly to the effective interaction potential, which creates\nCooper pairs of the quasi-particles of the antiferromagnetic metallic state. We\nfind a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave solution in both electron- and hole-doped\ncases. In the quasi-spin triplet channel, the longitudinal fluctuations give\nrise to an effective attraction supporting a $p$-wave gap, but are overcome by\nrepulsive contributions from the transverse fluctuations which disfavor\n$p$-wave pairing compared to $d_{x^2-y^2}$. The sub-leading pair instability is\nfound to be in the $g$-wave channel, but complex admixtures of $d$ and $g$ are\nnot energetically favored since their nodal structures coincide. Inclusion of\ninterband pairing, in which each fermion in the Cooper pair belongs to a\ndifferent spin-density-wave band, is considered for a range of electron dopings\nin the regime of well-developed magnetic order. We demonstrate that these\ninterband pairing gaps, which are non-zero in the magnetic state, must have the\nsame parity under inversion as the normal intraband gaps. The self-consistent\nsolution to the full system of five coupled gap equations give intraband and\ninterband pairing gaps of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ structure and similar gap magnitude. In\nconclusion, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap dominates for both hole and electron doping\ninside the spin-density-wave phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 13:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 07:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

For example, previous studies have shown that the\nfeasibility of a network design can be quickly evaluated by computing the fixed\npoint of a concave mapping that is constructed based on many environmental and\nnetwork control parameters such as the position of base stations, channel\nconditions, and antenna tilts. To address this and more general problems, given\na positive concave mapping, we show two alternative but equivalent ways to\nconstruct a matrix that is guaranteed to have spectral radius strictly smaller\nthan one if the mapping has a fixed point. This matrix is then used to build a\nnew mapping that preserves the fixed point of the original positive concave\nmapping. We show that the standard fixed point iterations using the new mapping\nconverges faster than the standard iterations applied to the original concave\nmapping.

Distance dependence\nis essential in quantum teleportation and relativistic quantum information\nconsiderations. The presence of a quantum field as the environment accords an\nindirect interaction between the two oscillators at finite separation of a\nnon-Markovian nature which competes with the direct coupling between them. The\ninterplay between these two factors results in a rich variety of interesting\nentanglement behaviors at late times. We show that the entanglement behavior\nreported in prior work assuming no separation between the detectors can at best\nbe a transient effect at very short times, and claims that such behaviors\nrepresent late time entanglement are misplaced. Entanglement between the\ndetectors with direct coupling enters in the consideration of macroscopic\nquantum phenomena and other frontline issues. We find that with direct coupling\nentanglement between the two detectors can sustain over a finite distance, in\ncontrast to the no-direct coupling case reported before, where entanglement can\nnot survive at separation more than a few inverse high frequency cutoff scales.\nThis work provides a solid platform necessary for further systematic\ninvestigations into the entanglement behavior of continuous variable quantum\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 13:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-30"}

To do this we use\na property of the so-called minimal subspaces which allows us to describe the\ntensor representation by means of a rooted tree. By using the tree structure\nand the dimensions of the associated minimal subspaces, we introduce, in the\nunderlying algebraic tensor space, the set of tensors in a tree-based format\nwith either bounded or fixed tree-based rank. This class contains the Tucker\nformat and the Hierarchical Tucker format (including the Tensor Train format).\nIn particular, we show that the set of tensors in the tree-based format with\nbounded (respectively, fixed) tree-based rank of an algebraic tensor product of\nnormed vector spaces is an analytic Banach manifold. Indeed, the manifold\ngeometry for the set of tensors with fixed tree-based rank is induced by a\nfibre bundle structure and the manifold geometry for the set of tensors with\nbounded tree-based rank is given by a finite union of connected components. In\norder to describe the relationship between these manifolds and the natural\nambient space, we introduce the definition of topological tensor spaces in the\ntree-based format. We prove under natural conditions that any tensor of the\ntopological tensor space under consideration admits best approximations in the\nmanifold of tensors in the tree-based format with bounded tree-based rank. In\nthis framework, we also show that the tangent (Banach) space at a given tensor\nis a complemented subspace in the natural ambient tensor Banach space and hence\nthe set of tensors in the tree-based format with bounded (respectively, fixed)\ntree-based rank is an immersed submanifold.

Our ground-based lightcurve aligns with the published EPOXI\nlightcurve, indicating that the lightcurve represents changing activity rather\nthan viewing geometry of structures in the coma. The EPOXI lightcurve can best\nbe phased by a triple-peaked period near 54-55 hr that increases from October\nto November.

As was recently shown by\nCr\\'{e}peau et al., the security of known two-prover commitment schemes not\nonly relies on the explicit assumption that the provers cannot communicate, but\nalso depends on their information processing capabilities. For instance, there\nexist schemes that are secure against classical provers but insecure if the\nprovers have quantum information processing capabilities, and there are schemes\nthat resist such quantum attacks but become insecure when considering general\nso-called non-signaling provers, which are restricted solely by the requirement\nthat no communication takes place.\n  This poses the natural question whether there exists a two-prover commitment\nscheme that is secure under the sole assumption that no communication takes\nplace; no such scheme is known.\n  In this work, we give strong evidence for a negative answer: we show that any\nsingle-round two-prover commitment scheme can be broken by a non-signaling\nattack. Our negative result is as bad as it can get: for any candidate scheme\nthat is (almost) perfectly hiding, there exists a strategy that allows the\ndishonest provers to open a commitment to an arbitrary bit (almost) as\nsuccessfully as the honest provers can open an honestly prepared commitment,\ni.e., with probability (almost) 1 in case of a perfectly sound scheme. In the\ncase of multi-round schemes, our impossibility result is restricted to\nperfectly hiding schemes.\n  On the positive side, we show that the impossibility result can be\ncircumvented by considering three provers instead: there exists a three-prover\ncommitment scheme that is secure against arbitrary non-signaling attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 14:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

To study possible deviations\nfrom the Hawking's prediction, the dispersive field theory models have been\nproposed, following the Unruh's hydrodynamic analogue of a black hole\nradiation. In the dispersive field theory models, the dispersion relations of\nmatter fields are modified at high energies, which leads to modifications of\nequations of motion. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to\ninvestigate the dispersive field theory models. The preferred frame is the\nstatic frame of the black hole. The dispersion relation adopted agrees with the\nrelativistic one at low energies but is modified near the Planck mass $m_{p}$.\nWe calculate the corrections to the Hawking temperature for massive and charged\nparticles to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m_{p}^{-2}\\right) $ and massless and neutral\nparticles to all orders. Our results suggest that the thermal spectrum of\nradiations near horizon is robust, e.g. corrections to the Hawking temperature\nare suppressed by $m_{p}$. After the spectrum of radiations near the horizon is\nobtained, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of a\nmassless scalar field near the horizon of a 4D spherically symmetric black\nhole.

Although it is usually assumed that the\nquasi-Newtonian approach (a combination of the quasi-static approximation and\nsub-Hubble limit) for cosmic perturbations is good enough to describe the\nevolution of large scale structure in $f(R)$ models, some studies have\nsuggested that this method is not valid for all $f(R)$ models. Here, we show\nthat in the matter-dominated era, the pressure and shear equations alone, which\ncan be recast into four first-order equations to solve for cosmological\nperturbations exactly, are sufficient to solve for the Newtonian potential,\n$\\Psi$, and the curvature potential, $\\Phi$. Based on these two equations, we\nare able to clarify how the exact linear perturbations fit into different\nlimits. We find that the Compton length controls the quasi-static behaviours in\n$f(R)$ gravity. In addition, regardless the validity of quasi-static\napproximation, a strong version of the sub-Hubble limit alone is sufficient to\nreduce the exact linear perturbations in any viable $f(R)$ gravity to second\norder.

Recently,\nseveral versions of the relativistic Burgers equations have been derived on\ndifferent geometries such as Minkowski (flat), Schwarzshild and FLRW spacetimes\nby LeFloch and his collaborators. In this paper, we consider a family member of\nthe FLRW spacetime so-called the de Sitter background, introduce some important\nfeatures of this spacetime geometry with its metric and derive the relativistic\nBurgers equation on it. The Euler system of equations on the de Sitter\nspacetime can be found by a known process by using the Christoffel symbols and\ntensors for perfect fluids. We applied the usual techniques used for the\nSchwarzshild and FLRW spacetimes in order to derive the relativistic Burgers\nequation from the vanishing pressure Euler system on the de Sitter background.\nWe observed that the model admits static solutions. In the final part, we\nexamined several numerical illustrations of the given model through a finite\nvolume approximation based on the paper by LeFloch et al. The effect of the\ncosmological constant is also numerically analysed in this part.

Unfortunately, the\nmost-developed models currently only treat pseudo-linear DNA structures, while\nmany systems being experimentally and theoretically pursued exploit a much\nbroader range of secondary structure configurations. Here, we describe a new\ndomain-level reaction enumerator that can handle arbitrary non-pseudoknotted\nsecondary structures and reaction mechanisms including association and\ndissociation, 3-way and 4-way branch migration, and direct as well as remote\ntoehold activation. To avoid polymerization that is inherent when considering\ngeneral structures, we employ a time-scale separation technique that holds in\nthe limit of low concentrations. This also allows us to \"condense\" the detailed\nreactions by eliminating fast transients, with provable guarantees of\ncorrectness for the set of reactions and their kinetics. We hope that the new\nreaction enumerator will be used in new molecular programming languages,\ncompilers, and tools for analysis and verification that treat a wider variety\nof mechanisms of interest to experimental and theoretical work.

In contrast, single-cell measurements of red blood\ncell volume and hemoglobin concentration are taken millions of times per day by\nclinical hematology analyzers and are important factors in determining the\nhealth of the hematologic system. To better understand the variability and\ndeterminants of oxygen affinity on a cellular level, we have developed a system\nthat quantifies the oxygen saturation, cell volume and hemoglobin concentration\nfor individual red blood cells in high-throughput. We find that the variability\nin single-cell saturation peaks at an oxygen partial pressure of 2.5%, which\ncorresponds to the maximum slope of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve.\nIn addition, single-cell oxygen affinity is positively correlated with\nhemoglobin concentration, but independent of osmolarity, which suggests\nvariation in the hemoglobin to 2-3 DPG ratio on a cellular level. By\nquantifying the functional behavior of a cellular population, our system adds a\nnew dimension to blood cell analysis and other measurements of single-cell\nvariability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 15:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}
