However, these systems are not perfect, and their\nquality may decrease in some specific domains. This paper examines the effects\nof different training methods when it comes to Polish - English Statistical\nMachine Translation system used for the medical data. Numerous elements of the\nEMEA parallel text corpora and not related OPUS Open Subtitles project were\nused as the ground for creation of phrase tables and different language models\nincluding the development, tuning and testing of these translation systems. The\nBLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER metrics have been used in order to evaluate the\nresults of various systems. Our experiments deal with the systems that include\nPOS tagging, factored phrase models, hierarchical models, syntactic taggers,\nand other alignment methods. We also executed a deep analysis of Polish data as\npreparatory work before automatized data processing such as true casing or\npunctuation normalization phase. Normalized metrics was used to compare\nresults. Scores lower than 15% mean that Machine Translation engine is unable\nto provide satisfying quality, scores greater than 30% mean that translations\nshould be understandable without problems and scores over 50 reflect adequate\ntranslations. The average results of Polish to English translations scores for\nBLEU, NIST, METEOR, and TER were relatively high and ranged from 70,58 to\n82,72. The lowest score was 64,38. The average results ranges for English to\nPolish translations were little lower (67,58 - 78,97). The real-life\nimplementations of presented high quality Machine Translation Systems are\nanticipated in general medical practice and telemedicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 16:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-16"}

Recently, Eric\nFossum proposed a novel concept of an image sensor with dense sub-diffraction\nlimit one-bit pixels jots, which can be considered a digital emulation of\nsilver halide photographic film. This idea has been recently embodied as the\nEPFL Gigavision camera. A major bottleneck in the design of such sensors is the\nimage reconstruction process, producing a continuous high dynamic range image\nfrom oversampled binary measurements. The extreme quantization of the Poisson\nstatistics is incompatible with the assumptions of most standard image\nprocessing and enhancement frameworks. The recently proposed maximum-likelihood\n(ML) approach addresses this difficulty, but suffers from image artifacts and\nhas impractically high computational complexity. In this work, we study a\nvariant of a sensor with binary threshold pixels and propose a reconstruction\nalgorithm combining an ML data fitting term with a sparse synthesis prior. We\nalso show an efficient hardware-friendly real-time approximation of this\ninverse operator.Promising results are shown on synthetic data as well as on\nHDR data emulated using multiple exposures of a regular CMOS sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 16:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2015 10:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

The extrapolations assume that the\nratio of internal energy of the plasma to magnetic energy, the plasma-beta is\nnegligible. Despite the widespread use of this assumption observations, models,\nand theoretical considerations show that beta is of the order of a few percent\nto more than 10%, and thus not small. We investigate what consequences this has\nfor the reliability of extrapolation results. We use basic concepts starting\nwith the force and the energy balance to infer relations between plasma-beta\nand free magnetic energy, to study the direction of currents in the corona with\nrespect to the magnetic field, and to estimate the errors in the free magnetic\nenergy by neglecting effects of the plasma (beta<<1). A comparison with a 3D\nMHD model supports our basic considerations. If plasma-beta is of the order of\nthe relative free energy (the ratio of the free magnetic energy to the total\nmagnetic energy) then the pressure gradient can balance the Lorentz force. This\nis the case in the solar corona, and therefore the currents are not properly\ndescribed. In particular the error in terms of magnetic energy by neglecting\nthe plasma is of the order of the free magnetic energy, so that the latter can\nnot be reliably determined by an extrapolation. While a force-free\nextrapolation might capture the magnetic structure and connectivity of the\ncoronal magnetic field, the derived currents and free magnetic energy are not\nreliable. Thus quantitative results of extrapolations on the location and\namount of heating in the corona (through current dissipation) and on the energy\nstorage of the magnetic field (e.g. for eruptive events) are limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 17:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

The\ncontributions are as follows: Natural comparison-optimal algorithms for\nmulti-pivot quicksort are devised and analyzed. The analysis shows that the\nbenefits of using multiple pivots with respect to the average comparison count\nare marginal and these strategies are inferior to simpler strategies such as\nthe well known median-of-$k$ approach. A substantial part of the partitioning\ncost is caused by rearranging elements. A rigorous analysis of an algorithm for\nrearranging elements in the partitioning step is carried out, observing mainly\nhow often array cells are accessed during partitioning. The algorithm behaves\nbest if 3 to 5 pivots are used. Experiments show that this translates into good\ncache behavior and is closest to predicting observed running times of\nmulti-pivot quicksort algorithms. Finally, it is studied how choosing pivots\nfrom a sample affects sorting cost. The study is theoretical in the sense that\nalthough the findings motivate design recommendations for multipivot quicksort\nalgorithms that lead to running time improvements over known algorithms in an\nexperimental setting, these improvements are small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 19:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 09:52:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 13:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

One of the\npossible explanations is based on the presence of condensations of planetary\nevaporated material located in a circumstellar cloud that absorbs the CaII H&K\nand MgII h&k resonance line emission flux, used to measure chromospheric\nactivity. A larger column density in the condensations, or equivalently a\nstronger absorption in the chromospheric lines, is obtained when the\nevaporation rate of the planet is larger, which occurs for a lower gravity of\nthe planet. We analyze here a sample of stars hosting transiting hot Jupiters\ntuned in order to minimize systematic effects (e.g., interstellar medium\nabsorption). Using a mixture model, we find that the data are best fit by a\ntwo-linear-regression model. We interpret this result in terms of the\nVaughan-Preston gap. We use a Monte Carlo approach to best take into account\nthe uncertainties, finding that the two intercepts fit the observed peaks of\nthe distribution of logR'HK for main-sequence solar-like stars. We also find\nthat the intercepts are correlated with the slopes, as predicted by the model\nbased on the condensations of planetary evaporated material. Our findings bring\nfurther support to this model, although we cannot firmly exclude different\nexplanations. A precise determination of the slopes of the two linear\ncomponents would allow one to estimate the average effective stellar flux\npowering planetary evaporation, which can then be used for theoretical\npopulation and evolution studies of close-in planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 20:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

We show that these measures outperform a state-of-the-art\nbaseline based on maximum-likelihood estimation of sound decay rates in terms\nof root-mean square error (RMSE), as well as Pearson correlation. Compared to\nthe baseline, the best proposed measure, called NSRMR_k , achieves a 23%\nrelative improvement in terms of RMSE and allows for relative correlation\nimprovements ranging from 13% to 47% for RT prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 20:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

The\ntheory is established based on spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries by treating\nthe gravitational force on the same footing as the electroweak and strong\nforces. A bi-frame space-time is initiated to describe the laws of nature. One\nframe space-time is a globally flat coordinate Minkowski space-time that acts\nas an inertial reference frame for the motions of fields, the other is a\nlocally flat non-coordinate Gravifield space-time that functions as an\ninteraction representation frame for the degrees of freedom of fields. The\nGravifield is sided on both the globally flat coordinate space-time and locally\nflat non-coordinate space-time and characterizes the gravitational force.\nInstead of the principle of general coordinate invariance in Einstein theory of\ngeneral relativity, some underlying principles with the postulates of\ncoordinate independence and gauge invariance are motivated to establish the\ntheory of quantum gravity. When transmuting the Gravifield basis into the\ncoordinate basis in Minkowski space-time, it enables us to obtain equations of\nmotion for all quantum fields and derive basic conservation laws for all\nsymmetries. When the spinnic and scaling gauge symmetries are broken down to a\nbackground structure that possesses the global Lorentz and scaling symmetries,\nwe arrive at a Lorentz invariant and conformally flat background Gravifield\nspace-time that is characterized by a cosmic vector with a non-zero\ncosmological mass scale. We also obtain the massless graviton and massive\nspinnon. We show a mechanism for quantum inflation caused by the quantum loop\ncontributions. The Einstein theory of general relativity is expected to be an\neffective low energy theory.

The future cellular network (5G) focuses on operating with the\nmillimeter-wave (mmW). In higher frequency, path loss can play a significant\nrole in degrading the link quality due to higher attenuation. In a scenario,\nwhere the operating environment is changing dynamically, sudden degradation of\noperating conditions or arrival of obstruction between transmitter and receiver\nmay result in link failure.

Concretely, we train a\nmachine learning model to predict repeatedly being over or under self-set daily\ncalories goals and then look at which features contribute to the model's\nprediction. Our findings include both expected results, such as the token\n``mcdonalds'' or the category ``dessert'' being indicative for being over the\ncalories goal, but also less obvious ones such as the difference between pork\nand poultry concerning dieting success, or the use of the ``quick added\ncalories'' functionality being indicative of over-shooting calorie-wise. This\nstudy also hints at the feasibility of using such data for more in-depth data\nmining, e.g., looking at the interaction between consumed foods such as mixing\nprotein- and carbohydrate-rich foods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst systematic study of public food diaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 07:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

The\npresent paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a\nhistory of how the laser was invented. Rather, it addresses the question: what\nare the fundamental features that distinguish laser light from thermal light?\nThe obvious answer, \"laser light is coherent\", is, I argue, so vague that it\nmust be put aside at the start, albeit to revisit later. A more specific,\nquantum theoretic, version, \"laser light is in a coherent state\", is simply\nwrong in this context: both laser light and thermal light can equally well be\ndescribed by coherent states, with amplitudes that vary stochastically in\nspace. Instead, my answer to the titular question is that four principles are\nneeded: high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable\nintensity. Combining the first three of these principles suffices to show, in a\nquantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up\nto $\\sim10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a\nlight bulb. This quantitative analysis is quite simple, and is easily relatable\nto \"coherence\", yet is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to\nmy knowledge. The fourth principle is the most subtle and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, is the only one related to coherent states in the quantum optics\nsense: it implies that the description in terms of coherent states is the only\nsimple description of a laser beam. Interestingly, this leads to the (not, as\nit turns out, entirely new) prediction that narrowly filtered laser beams are\nindistinguishable from similarly filtered thermal beams. I hope that other\neducators find this material useful, it may contain surprises even for\nresearchers who have been in the field longer than I have.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 07:46:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 12:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

The\nrestriction a receiver's demands pose on the code is represented via a\nconstraint called the \\emph{generalized exclusive law} and obtain a code using\nthe \\emph{confusion graph} constructed using these constraints. Bounds on the\nsize of an optimal code based on the parameters of the confusion graph are\npresented. Next, we consider the case of erroneous transmissions and provide a\nnecessary and sufficient condition that an FIC must satisfy for correct\ndecoding of desired functions at each receiver and obtain a lower bound on the\nlength of an error-correcting FIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 09:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 12:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

The main objective of this paper is to\nextend the probabilistic framework to directed networks, where the sampling\nbivariate distributions could be asymmetric. Our main finding is that we can\nrelax the assumption from symmetric bivariate distributions to bivariate\ndistributions that have the same marginal distributions. By using such a weaker\nassumption, we show that various notions for structural analysis in directed\nnetworks can also be defined in the same manner as before. However, since the\nbivariate distribution could be asymmetric, the community detection algorithms\nproposed in our previous work cannot be directly applied. For this, we show\nthat one can construct another sampled graph with a symmetric bivariate\ndistribution so that for any partition of the network, the modularity index\nremains the same as that of the original sampled graph. Based on this, we\npropose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm that returns a partition of\ncommunities when the algorithm converges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 10:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

We\nsolved the problem by developing an efficient optimization algorithm based on\ndynamical programming, which comprises three procedures: i, anatomizing the\nwhole spread process among all subpopulations into disjoint componential\npatches; ii, inferring the most probable invasion pathways underlying each\npatch via maximum likelihood estimation; iii, recovering the whole process by\nassembling the invasion pathways in each patch iteratively, without burdens in\nparameter calibrations and computer simulations. Based on the entropy theory,\nwe introduced an identifiability measure to assess the difficulty level that an\ninvasion pathway can be identified. Results on both artificial and empirical\nmetapopulation networks show the robust performance in identifying actual\ninvasion pathways driving pandemic spread.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 11:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Here, we extend this concept into the realm of non-Hermitian\ndynamics by showing that the stochastic competition between measurement and a\nsystem's own dynamics can be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We\nobtain an analytic solution for ultracold bosons in a lattice and show that a\ndark state of the tunnelling operator is a steady state in which the\nobservable's fluctuations are zero and tunnelling is suppressed by destructive\nmatter-wave interference. This opens a new venue of investigation beyond the\ncanonical quantum Zeno dynamics and leads to a new paradigm of competition\nbetween global measurement backaction and short-range atomic dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 12:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 14:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

We truncate the\nphonon branch of the resulting hierarchy of equations and propose the form of\ncoupling among single-phonon-assisted and higher-order phonon-assisted density\nmatrices so as to ensure the energy and particle-number conservation in a\nclosed system. Time scales relevant for the exciton formation and relaxation\nprocesses are determined from numerical investigations performed on a\none-dimensional model for the values of model parameters representative of a\ntypical organic and inorganic semiconductor. The exciton dynamics is examined\nfor different values of central frequency of the exciting field, temperature,\nand microscopic model parameters, such as the strengths of carrier-carrier and\ncarrier-phonon couplings. We find that for typical organic semiconductor\nparameters, formation of bound excitons occurs on a several-hundred-femtosecond\ntime scale, while their subsequent relaxation and equilibration takes at least\nseveral picoseconds. These time scales are consistent with recent experimental\nstudies of the exciton formation and relaxation in conjugated polymer-based\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 12:11:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 13:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-25"}

Each VA holds groups of related objects and datasets such as\nfiles, relational tables, which has similar performance and availability\ncharacteristics. We evaluate single-pass data allocation methods for HDA using\na synthetic stream of allocation requests, where each VA is characterized by\nits RAID level, disk loads and space requirements. The goal is to maximize the\nnumber of allocated VAs and maintain high disk bandwidth and capacity\nutilization, while balancing disk loads. Although only RAID1 (basic mirroring)\nand RAID5 (rotated parity arrays) are considered in the experimental study, we\ndevelop the analysis required to estimate disk loads for other RAID levels.\nSince VA loads vary significantly over time, the VA allocation is carried out\nat the peak load period, while ensuring that disk bandwidth is not exceeded at\nother high load periods. Experimental results with a synthetic stream of\nallocation requests show that allocation methods minimizing the maximum disk\nbandwidth and capacity utilization or their variance across all disks yield the\nmaximum number of allocated VAs. HDA saves disk bandwidth, since a single RAID\nlevel accommodating the most stringent availability requirements for a small\nsubset of objects would incur an unnecessarily high overhead for updating check\nblocks or data replicas for all objects. The number of allocated VAs can be\nincreased by adopting the clustered RAID5 paradigm, which exploits the tradeoff\nbetween redundancy and bandwidth utilization. Since rebuild can be carried out\nat the level of individual VAs, prioritizing rebuild of VAs with higher access\nrates can improve overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 12:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

In\nthis paper, we investigate compressed least-squares problems and propose new\nmodels and algorithms that address the issue of error and noise introduced by\ncompression. While maintaining computational efficiency, our models provide\nrobust solutions that are more accurate--relative to solutions of uncompressed\nleast-squares--than those of classical compressed variants. We introduce tools\nfrom robust optimization together with a form of partial compression to improve\nthe error-time trade-offs of compressed least-squares solvers. We develop an\nefficient solution algorithm for our Robust Partially-Compressed (RPC) model\nbased on a reduction to a one-dimensional search. We also derive the first\napproximation error bounds for Partially-Compressed least-squares solutions.\nEmpirical results comparing numerous alternatives suggest that robust and\npartially compressed solutions are effectively insulated against aggressive\nrandomized transforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 14:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

Simulations through a pseudo-dynamic\nalgorithm are performed for filling and subsequent discharge of a plane silo.\nParticles are monosized hard disks deposited in the container and subjected to\na tapping process for compaction. Then, a hole of a given size is open at the\nbottom of the silo and the discharge is triggered. After a clogging at the\nopening is produced, and equilibrium is restored, the final distribution of the\nremaining particles at the silo is analyzed by dividing the space into cells\nwith different geometrical arrangements to visualize the way in which the\ndensity depression near the opening is propagated throughout the system. The\ndifferent behavior as a function of the compaction degree is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 10:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

Recently it is found that ions produce from nuclear reactions can be\nused to study electron loss and capture processes. Hence determining the\nCoulomb barrier becomes important in both nuclear and atomic physics. The\ndifferent models depend on the nucleus-nucleus potential chosen or parameters\nused to calculate the barrier heights. In this work we plan to develop a\nparameterized formula from experimental results obtained from quasi elastic\nscattering. Since quasi elastic data spread over Z1Z2=64 to Z1Z2=2460, the\nformula is expected to work in the range of low Z1Z2 to high Z1Z2, where Z1, Z2\nare the atomic number of the projectile and the target, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 18:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}
