This method--named ESP for its three\ncomponents: encapsulation, syllabus, and pandemonium--is presented in two\ncomplementary versions: Fast ESP, which constrains later morphological changes\nto achieve linear growth in computation time as behavioral complexity is added,\nand General ESP, which allows this restriction to be removed when sufficient\ncomputational resources are available. Experiments demonstrate that the ESP\nmethod allows evolved virtual creatures to reach new levels of behavioral\ncomplexity in the co-evolution of morphology and control, approximately\ndoubling the previous state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 16:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Since an exact\ncomputation is prohibitive in large networks, several approximation algorithms\nhave been proposed. Besides that, recent years have seen the publication of\ndynamic algorithms for efficient recomputation of betweenness in networks that\nchange over time. In this paper we propose the first betweenness centrality\napproximation algorithms with a provable guarantee on the maximum approximation\nerror for dynamic networks. Several new intermediate algorithmic results\ncontribute to the respective approximation algorithms: (i) new upper bounds on\nthe vertex diameter, (ii) the first fully-dynamic algorithm for updating an\napproximation of the vertex diameter in undirected graphs, and (iii) an\nalgorithm with lower time complexity for updating single-source shortest paths\nin unweighted graphs after a batch of edge actions. Using approximation, our\nalgorithms are the first to make in-memory computation of betweenness in\ndynamic networks with millions of edges feasible. Our experiments show that our\nalgorithms can achieve substantial speedups compared to recomputation, up to\nseveral orders of magnitude. Moreover, the approximation accuracy is usually\nsignificantly better than the theoretical guarantee in terms of absolute error.\nMore importantly, for reasonably small approximation error thresholds, the rank\nof nodes is well preserved, in particular for nodes with high betweenness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 16:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Each component of the background (e.g., from\nprimordial metric perturbations, binary neutron stars, milli-second pulsars\netc.) has its own spectral shape. Many ongoing experiments aim to probe GWB at\na variety of frequency bands. In the last two decades, using data from\nground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave (GW) observatories, upper\nlimits on GWB were placed in the frequency range of ~50-1000 Hz, considering\none spectral shape at a time. However, one strong component can significantly\nenhance the estimated strength of another component. Hence, estimation of the\namplitudes of the components with different spectral shapes should be done\njointly. Here we propose a method for \"component separation\" of a statistically\nisotropic background, that can, for the first time, jointly estimate the\namplitudes of many components and place upper limits. The method is rather\nstraightforward and needs negligible amount of computation. It utilises the\nlinear relationship between the measurements and the amplitudes of the actual\ncomponents, alleviating the need for a sampling based method, e.g., Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or matched filtering, which are computationally\nintensive and cumbersome in a multi-dimensional parameter space. Using this\nformalism we could also study how many independent components can be separated\nusing a given dataset from a network of current and upcoming ground based\ninterferometric detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 17:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The\ndistance that accounts for the actual (rather than minimal) number of\nrearrangements between two genomes is often referred to as the true\nevolutionary distance.

Through its defective\nnature and small particle size the surface film composed of such material is\nincapable of creating any significant diffusion barrier. Above 160 K, cubic ice\ngradually transforms to the stable hexagonal (Ih) form on laboratory time\nscales. The annealing, coupled with a parallel decomposition of gas hydrates,\naccelerates as temperature rises but already above 190 K the first process\nprevails, transforming cubic stacking sequences in-to ordinary Ih ice within a\nfew minutes. Remaining stacking faults are removed through very slow isothermal\nannealing or after heating up above 240 K. The role of the proportion of cubic\nstacking on the decomposition rate is discussed. A better understanding of the\ndissociation kinetics at low temperatures is particularly im-portant for the\ncritical evaluation of existing hypotheses that consider clathrates as a\npotential medium that actively participate in geological processes or is able\nto store gases (e.g. CH4, CO2 or Xe) in environments like comets, icy moons (i.\ne.

To shed some light on this\nquestion we investigate Q-clouds, an extreme parametric limit in the Q-ball\nsystem. Q-clouds are classically unstable solutions which delocalize, spread\nout over all space forming an infinitely dilute gas of free quanta, and are\neven energetically unstable against tunneling to plane waves. In short, these\nextremely unstable field configurations provide an ideal candidate system for\nour purposes.

We investigate in detail their properties, and find new physical\ninterpretations by observing that Q-clouds resemble BPS Skyrmions in certain\naspects, and correspond to universal non-perturbative solutions in (complex)\n|\\Phi|^4 theory.

Even for Core Accretion models, there are\nseveral major uncertainties related to the timescale of collapse, the relative\nimportance of different processes for preventing fragmentation in massive\ncores, and the nature of disks and outflows. I end by discussing some recent\nobservational results that are helping to improve our understanding of these\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 18:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 02:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

In this paper, we examine high-resolution K band\ninfrared spectra of fifty stars hosting gas giant planets on short-period\norbits.

We use these data to place an\nupper limit on the stellar binary fraction at small projected separations, and\nshow that the observed population of candidate companions is consistent with\nthat of field stars and also with the population of wide-separation companions\ndetected in our previous AO survey.

Photometric monitoring of the variability of brown dwarfs can\nprovide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold\natmospheres. The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target\nfor such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high\nlevels of variability. Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the\nSolar system, allowing precise astrometric investigations with ground-based\nfacilities. Aims. The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and\nstudy the astrometric motion of both components. Methods. We have monitored\nLuhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on\nthe Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla, through a special i+z long-pass filter,\nwhich allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects.\nAn intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which\nwe observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 \\pm 0.02 mag and 0.34 \\pm 0.02\nmag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. Results. We used the 16-night\ntime-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. We\nfound that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 \\pm 0.1 hr, in very good\nagreement with previous measurements. For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates\nslower than its companion and, even though we were not able to get a robust\ndetermination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 hr. This\nimplies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and\nsuggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion\nprocess. The 2-year complete dataset was used to study the astrometric motion\nof Luhman 16AB. We predict a motion of the system that is not consistent with a\nprevious estimate based on two months of monitoring, but cannot confirm or\nrefute the presence of additional planetary-mass bodies in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 21:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Agents have homophilous preferences and limited capacity,\nso they maintain links with others who are learned to be similar to themselves\nand cut links to others who are learned to be dissimilar to themselves. Thus\nlearning influences the evolution of the network, but learning is imperfect so\nthe evolution is stochastic. Homophily matters. Higher levels of homophily\ndecrease the (average) number of links that agents form. However, the effect of\nhomophily is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped before\nlearning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and less\nclustering than under complete information. There may be big differences\nbetween the networks that emerge under complete and incomplete information.\nHomophily matters here as well: initially, greater levels of homophily increase\nthe difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, but\nsufficiently high levels of homophily eventually decrease the difference.\nComplete and incomplete information networks differ the most when the degree of\nhomophily is intermediate.

For decades the problem was thought to be insurmountable: the search\nspace of possible programs is far too massive to efficiently traverse. Advances\nin efficient constraint solving have overcome this barrier, enabling a new\ngeneration of effective synthesis systems. Most existing systems compile\nsynthesis tasks down to low-level SMT instances, sacrificing high-level\nsemantic information while solving only first-order problems (i.e., filling\ninteger holes). Recent work takes an alternative approach, using the\nCurry-Howard isomorphism and techniques from automated theorem proving to\nconstruct higher-order programs with algebraic datatypes.\n  My thesis involved extending this type-directed synthesis engine to handle\nproduct types, which required significant modifications to both the underlying\ntheory and the tool itself. Product types streamline other language features,\neliminating variable-arity constructors among other workarounds employed in the\noriginal synthesis system. A form of logical conjunction, products are\ninvertible, making it possible to equip the synthesis system with an efficient\ntheorem-proving technique called focusing that eliminates many of the\nnondeterministic choices inherent in proof search. These theoretical\nenhancements informed a new version of the type-directed synthesis prototype\nimplementation, which remained performance-competitive with the original\nsynthesizer. A significant advantage of the type-directed synthesis framework\nis its extensibility; this thesis is a roadmap for future such efforts to\nincrease the expressive power of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 22:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

The formation process of powerful\njets close to black holes is poorly understood, and the conditions leading to\njet formation are currently hotly debated. In this paper, we report an\nunambiguous empirical correlation between the properties of the plasma close to\nthe black hole and the particle acceleration properties within jets launched\nfrom the central regions of accreting stellar-mass and supermassive black\nholes. In these sources the emission of the plasma near the black hole is\ncharacterized by a power law at X-ray energies during times when the jets are\nproduced. We find that the photon index of this power law, which gives\ninformation on the underlying particle distribution, correlates with the\ncharacteristic break frequency in the jet spectrum, which is dependent on\nmagnetohydrodynamical processes in the outflow. The observed range in break\nfrequencies varies by five orders of magnitude, in sources that span nine\norders of magnitude in black hole mass, revealing a similarity of jet\nproperties over a large range of black hole masses powering these jets. This\ncorrelation demonstrates that the internal properties of the jet rely most\ncritically on the conditions of the plasma close to the black hole, rather than\nother parameters such as the black hole mass or spin, and will provide a\nbenchmark that should be reproduced by the jet formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 22:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

In a Landau Fermi\nLiquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin\nat low temperature $T$. The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the\ncompetition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction\nbetween two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-$1/2$\nimpurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a\nKondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one\nanother. Our holographic model is based on a $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT\ndescription of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with\nnegligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally\nanti-symmetric representation of an $SU(N)$ spin symmetry. We employ a\nlarge-$N$ limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and\nboth Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace\noperators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic\nrenormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY\ncouplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS. We numerically compute the\nphase diagram of our model in the plane of RKKY coupling versus $T$, finding\nevidence for a quantum phase transition from a trivial phase, with neither\nKondo nor inter-impurity screening, to a non-trivial phase, with both Kondo and\nanti-ferromagnetic inter-impurity screening. More generally we show, just using\n$SU(N)$ representation theory, that ferromagnetic correlations must be absent\nat leading order in the large-$N$ limit. Our holographic model may be useful\nfor studying many open problems involving strongly-interacting quantum\nimpurities, including for example the Kondo lattice, relevant for describing\nthe heavy fermion compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 23:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

The nature of the phase transition and the\nevolution of the MBL phase near the transition are the focus of intense\ntheoretical studies with open issues in the field. We develop an entanglement\ndensity matrix renormalization group (En-DMRG) algorithm to accurately target\nthe entanglement patterns of highly excited states for MBL systems. By studying\nthe one dimensional Heisenberg spin chain in a random field, we demonstrate the\nhigh accuracy of the method in obtaining statistical results of quantum states\nin the MBL phase.

Combining En-DMRG with exact diagonalization simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the transition from the MBL phase to the delocalized ergodic\nphase is driven by rare events where the locally entangled spin pairs develop\nlong-range power-law correlations. The corresponding phase diagram contains an\nintermediate regime, which has power-law spin-z correlations resulting from\ncontributions of the rare events.

We prove that for the sequences studied in the first part, the graph\nis simply the Cayley graph that we start from, and so calculations are\npossible.\n  We give applications to the study of the frequencies of letters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 01:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

The variational objective\nfunction is typically less computationally intensive to optimize than the true\nlikelihood, enabling scientists to fit rich models even with extremely large\ndatasets.

The rotation of the\ncoupled NPs close to the substrate tends to induce a long-range orientation of\nthe NLC molecular director, leading to modification in the alignment at the\ninterface of NLC and substrate which induces the orientation from homogeneous\n(planar) to homeotropic (vertical) in the bulk material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 02:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

This paper introduces multiple methods for decoding a SEE-OFDM symbol\nand shows that an iterative decoder with hard decisions gives the best\nperformance.

However, equal energy\nallocation performs 1.5 dB better than unequal energy allocation. A\nhard-decision, iterative subtraction receiver can further increase performance\nby another 1.5 dB over soft-decision subtraction and reconstruction receivers.\nSEE-OFDM consistently performs 3 dB or better and with higher spectral\nefficiency than ACO-OFDM at the same bit-error-rate (BER). Comparing other\ncombination methods at the same BER, SEE-OFDM performs up to 3 dB better than\nhybrid asymmetrically clipped optical (OFDM) (HACO-OFDM) and up to 1.5 dB\nbetter than asymmetrically and symmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ASCO-OFDM)\nand enhanced unipolar OFDM (eU-OFDM) when using hard decisions at the receiver.\nAdditionally, SEE-OFDM has the best peak-to-average-power rate (PAPR) as\ncompared to the other combination OFDM formats and ACO-OFDM, which makes it\nexcellent for any range limited optical source, such as laser diodes and\nlight-emitting diodes (LEDs).

The scale symmetry forbids the new vector\nboson decay to the 125 GeV Higgs plus W/Z boson, in sharp contrast to the\nconventional \"equivalence theorem\" which is invalidated by the conformality.\nThe HLS forbids mixing between the iso-triplet technirho's, rho_{Pi} and\nrho_{P}, of the one-family walking technicolor (with four doublets\nN_D=N_F/2=4), which, without the HLS, would be generated when switching on the\nstandard model gauging. We also present updated analyses of the walking\ntechnrho's for the diboson excesses by fully incorporating the constraints from\nthe conformal barrier and the HLS as well as possible higher order effects:\nstill characteristic of the one-family walking technirho is its smallness of\nthe decay width, roughly of order Gamma/M_rho ~ [3/N_C x 1/N_D] x\n[Gamma/M_rho]_{QCD} ~ 70 GeV/2TeV (N_D= N_C=4), in perfect agreement with the\nexpected diboson resonance with Gamma<100 GeV. The model is so sharply\ndistinguishable from other massive spin 1 models without the conformality and\nHLS that it is clearly testable at the LHC Run II. If the 2 TeV boson decay to\nWH/ZH is not observed in the ongoing Run II, then the conformality is operative\non the 125 GeV Higgs, strongly suggesting that the 2 TeV excess events are\nresponsible for the walking technirhos and the 125 GeV Higgs is the\ntechnidilaton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 04:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 05:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 06:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

KCuGaF$_6$ exhibits no long-range magnetic ordering down to 50 mK\ndespite the large exchange interaction J/k_B=103 K. At zero magnetic field,\nwell-defined spinon excitations were observed. The energy of the des Cloizeaux\nand Pearson mode of the spinon excitations is somewhat larger than that\ncalculated with the above exchange constant. This discrepancy is mostly\nascribed to the effective XY anisotropy arising from the large\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction with an alternating D vector. KCuGaF_6 in a\nmagnetic field is represented by the quantum sine-Gordon model, for which\nlow-energy elementary excitations are composed of solitons, antisolitons and\ntheir bound states called breathers.

One can\nshow the equivalence between the two concepts for convex functions having a\nmoderately flat profile near the set of minimizers (as those of functions with\nH\\\"olderian growth). A counterexample shows that the equivalence is no longer\ntrue for extremely flat functions. This fact reveals the relevance of an\napproach based on KL inequality.

A\nblack-box access to an unknown subset $S \\subseteq V$ is provided via queries\nof the form `Does $i \\in S$?'. We are interested in the minimum number of\nqueries needed in worst case in order to determine whether $G[S]$, the subgraph\nof $G$ induced on $S$, satisfies $\\mathcal{P}$.\n  Apart from being combinatorially rich, this setting allows us to initiate a\nsystematic study of breaking symmetry in the context of query complexity of\ngraph properties. In particular, we focus on hereditary graph properties. The\nmonotone functions in the node-query setting translate precisely to the\nhereditary graph properties. The famous Evasiveness Conjecture asserts that\neven with a minimal symmetry assumption on $G$, namely that of\nvertex-transitivity, the query complexity for any hereditary graph property in\nour setting is the worst possible, i.e., $n$.\n  We show that in the absence of any symmetry on $G$ it can fall as low as\n$O(n^{1/(d + 1) })$ where $d$ denotes the minimum possible degree of a minimal\nforbidden sub-graph for $\\mathcal{P}$.

Empirical data analyzed here\nindicate a certain hierarchy in local cortical composition. Specifically,\nneural wire, i.e., axons and dendrites take each about 1/3 of cortical space,\nspines and glia/astrocytes occupy each about $(1/3)^{2}$, and capillaries\naround $(1/3)^{4}$. Moreover, data analysis across species reveals that these\nfractions are roughly brain size independent, which suggests that they could be\nin some sense optimal and thus important for brain function. Is there any\nprinciple that sets them in this invariant way? This study first builds a model\nof local circuit in which neural wire, spines, astrocytes, and capillaries are\nmutually coupled elements and are treated within a single mathematical\nframework. Next, various forms of wire minimization rule (wire length, surface\narea, volume, or conduction delays) are analyzed, of which, only minimization\nof wire volume provides realistic results that are very close to the empirical\ncortical fractions. As an alternative, a new principle called \"spine economy\nmaximization\" is proposed and investigated, which is associated with\nmaximization of spine proportion in the cortex per spine size that yields\nequally good but more robust results. Additionally, a combination of wire cost\nand spine economy notions is considered as a meta-principle, and it is found\nthat this proposition gives only marginally better results than either pure\nwire volume minimization or pure spine economy maximization, but only if spine\neconomy component dominates. In sum, these results suggest that the new spine\neconomy principle may be important for brain evolutionary design in a broader\ncontext.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 13:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

Motivated by network-information theoretic results, techniques for\nfronthaul quantization and compression that improve over point-to-point\nsolutions by allowing for joint processing across multiple fronthaul links at\nthe CU have been recently proposed for both the uplink and the downlink. For\nthe downlink, a form of joint compression, known in network information theory\nas multivariate compression, was shown to be advantageous under a\nnon-constructive asymptotic information-theoretic framework.

Generally, QOC captures a very\nwide range of problems in quantum query complexity. However, relatively little\nis known about many of these problems.\n  In this work, we analyze the a subclass of the QOC problems where there is a\ngroup structure. That is, suppose the range of the unknown function A is a\ncommutative group G, which induces a commutative group law over the entire\nfunction space. Then we consider the case where A is drawn uniformly at random\nfrom some subgroup A of the function space. Moreover, there is a homomorpism f\non A, and the goal is to determine f(A). This class of problems is very\ngeneral, and covers several interesting cases, such as oracle evaluation;\npolynomial interpolation, evaluation, and extrapolation; and parity. These\nproblems are important in the study of message authentication codes in the\nquantum setting, and may have other applications.\n  We exactly characterize the quantum query complexity of every instance of QOC\nwith group structure in terms of a particular counting problem. That is, we\nprovide an algorithm for this general class of problems whose success\nprobability is determined by the solution to the counting problem, and prove\nits exact optimality. Unfortunately, solving this counting problem in general\nis a non-trivial task, and we resort to analyzing special cases. Our bounds\nunify some existing results, such as the existing oracle evaluation and parity\nbounds. In the case of polynomial interpolation and evaluation, our bounds give\nnew results for secret sharing and information theoretic message authentication\ncodes in the quantum setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 15:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

We show that they have unsatisfactory behavior in the\nultra-relativistic limit. In particular, three-dimensional acceleration of the\nparticle increases with velocity and becomes infinite in the ultra-relativistic\nlimit. The reason is that in the equation for trajectory emerges the term which\ncan be thought as an effective metric generated by the minimal spin-gravity\ncoupling. Therefore we examine the non-minimal interaction through the\ngravimagnetic moment $\\kappa$, and show that the theory with $\\kappa=1$ is free\nof the problems detected in MPTD-equations. Hence the non-minimally interacting\ntheory seem more promising candidate for description of a relativistic rotating\nbody in general relativity.\n  The Lagrangian for the particle in an arbitrary electromagnetic field in\nMinkowski space leads to generalized Frenkel and Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi\nequations. The particle with magnetic moment in electromagnetic field and the\nparticle with gravimagnetic moment in gravitational field have very similar\nstructure of equations of motion. In particular, the spin-electromagnetic\ncoupling also produces an effective metric for the particle with anomalous\nmagnetic moment. If we use the usual special-relativity notions for time and\ndistance, then the critical speed, which the particle cannot exceed during its\nevolution in electromagnetic field, is different from the speed of light. This\ncan be corrected assuming that the three-dimensional geometry should be defined\nwith respect to the effective metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 16:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 15:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 15:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

To resolve this, a new, non-baryonic\nmatter field, known as dark matter has been invoked. However, till date no\npossible constituents of the dark matter components are known. This has led to\nvarious models, by modifying gravity at large distances to explain the missing\nmass problem. The modification to gravity appears very naturally when effective\nfield theory on a lower dimensional manifold, embedded in a higher dimensional\nspacetime is considered. It has been shown that in a scenario with two lower\ndimensional manifolds separated by a finite distance is capable to address the\nmissing mass problem, which in turn determines the kinematics of the brane\nseparation. Consequences for galactic rotation curves are also described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 00:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 05:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

As the inner binary (with initially negligible eccentricity)\nundergoes orbital decay due to gravitational radiation, its eccentricity can be\nexcited by gravitational forcing from the tertiary. This excitation occurs when\nthe triple system passes through an \"apsidal precession resonance\", when the\nprecession rate of the inner binary, driven by the gravitational perturbation\nof the external companion and general relativity, matches the precession rate\nof the outer binary. The eccentricity excitation requires the outer companion\nto be on an eccentric orbit, with the mutual inclination between the inner and\nouter orbits less than $\\sim 40^\\circ$. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from\nthe inner binary can be significantly modified as the system evolves through\nthe apsidal precession resonance. For some system parameters (e.g., a white\ndwarf binary with a brown dwarf tertiary), the resonance can happen when the\nbinary emits GWs in the $10^{-4}-10^{-1}$~Hz range (the sensitivity band of\nLISA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 03:12:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 07:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 05:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 09:11:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 15:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

However, stemming is faced with the problem of ambiguity, where two or\nmore roots could be extracted from the same word.

In this paper, a distributional\nsemantics model utilizing Smoothed Pointwise Mutual Information (SPMI) is\nconstructed to investigate its effectiveness on the stemming analysis task.
