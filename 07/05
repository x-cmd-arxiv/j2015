First of all, by analyzing the structure of the\nEinstein equations in wave coordinates, we exhibit a nonlinear\nwave-Klein-Gordon model defined on a curved background, which is the focus of\nthe present paper. For this model, we prove here the existence of\nglobal-in-time solutions to the Cauchy problem, when the initial data have\nsufficiently small Sobolev norms. A major difficulty comes from the fact that\nthe class of conformal Killing fields of Minkowski space is significantly\nreduced in presence of a massive scalar field, since the scaling vector field\nis not conformal Killing for the Klein-Gordon operator. Our method relies on\nthe foliation (of the interior of the light cone) of Minkowski spacetime by\nhyperboloidal hypersurfaces and uses Lorentz-invariant energy norms. We\nintroduce a frame of vector fields adapted to the hyperboloidal foliation and\nwe establish several key properties: Sobolev and Hardy-type inequalities on\nhyperboloids, as well as sup-norm estimates which correspond to the sharp time\ndecay for the wave and the Klein-Gordon equations. These estimates allow us to\ncontrol interaction terms associated with the curved geometry and the massive\nfield, by distinguishing between two levels of regularity and energy growth and\nby a successive use of our key estimates in order to close a bootstrap\nargument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 20:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 11:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

DPPs possess desirable properties, such as exact sampling\nor analyticity of the moments, but learning the parameters of kernel $K$\nthrough likelihood-based inference is not straightforward. First, the kernel\nthat appears in the likelihood is not $K$, but another kernel $L$ related to\n$K$ through an often intractable spectral decomposition. This issue is\ntypically bypassed in machine learning by directly parametrizing the kernel\n$L$, at the price of some interpretability of the model parameters. We follow\nthis approach here. Second, the likelihood has an intractable normalizing\nconstant, which takes the form of a large determinant in the case of a DPP over\na finite set of objects, and the form of a Fredholm determinant in the case of\na DPP over a continuous domain. Our main contribution is to derive bounds on\nthe likelihood of a DPP, both for finite and continuous domains. Unlike\nprevious work, our bounds are cheap to evaluate since they do not rely on\napproximating the spectrum of a large matrix or an operator.

These\neffects can be computed from global ionosphere maps provided by GPS analysis\ncentres, namely the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE), using data\nfrom globally distributed GPS receivers. However, for the more accurate local\nionosphere estimates required for precision radio astronomy applications, data\nfrom local GPS networks needs to be incorporated into ionospheric modelling.\nFor GPS observations, the ionospheric parameters are biased by GPS receiver\ninstrument delays, among other effects, also known as receiver Differential\nCode Biases (DCBs).

Intuitively, our energy\nfunctional encourages the labeling to be parsimonious, that is, use as few\nlabels as possible.

Both computational and\nphysical aspects of the problem are considered. It is shown that from the\ncomputational point of view, when a distance between cracks is small as\ncompared with their sizes, the system becomes ill-conditioned and numerical\nresults deteriorate. The physical consequence of the interaction consists in\ndecreasing of the crack opening and even greater decrease of conductivity. Then\nthe resistance to fluid flow grows what results in the propagation of only\nthose fractures, the distance between which is large enough.\n  The research aims to suggests a means to overcome the computational\ndifficulty and to improve numerical simulation of hydraulic fractures in\nshales. Numerical experiments are carried out for a 2D problem by using the\ncomplex variable hypersingular boundary element method of higher order\naccuracy. The condition number of the main matrix of a system, the opening of\ncracks, the stress intensity factors, effective conductivity and resistance of\na cluster are calculated and analysed. The results imply that to avoid\ncomputational instability, it is possible to replace a cluster of cracks by a\nsingle properly located crack. The results also evidently confirm that the\npropagation of distant individual fractures rather than of an array of closely\nlocated cracks is to be expected in practice, what agrees with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 14:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}

We describe a simple\ncomputational model of cosmic logic suitable for analysis of, for example,\ndiscretized cosmological systems. The construction is based on a particular\nmodel of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with cosmic observers (CO),\ncosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS) described by Turing machines.\nCO machines always start with a blank tape and CM machines take CO's Turing\nnumber (also known as description number or G{\\\" o}del number) as input and\noutput the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS machines take CO's Turing\nnumber as input, but output either one if the CO machines are in the same\nequivalence class or zero otherwise. We argue that CS machines are more\nfundamental than CM machines and, thus, should be used as building blocks in\nconstructing CM machines. We prove the non-computability of a CS machine which\ndiscriminates between two classes of CO machines: mortal that halts in finite\ntime and immortal that runs forever. In context of eternal inflation this\nresult implies that it is impossible to construct CM machines to compute\nprobabilities on the set of all CO machines using cut-off prescriptions. The\ncut-off measures can still be used if the set is reduced to include only\nmachines which halt after a finite and predetermined number of steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 09:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 16:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

To deal with such challenges, basketball managers,\nscouts and coaches are increasingly turning to analytics. Objective evaluation\nof players and teams has always been the top goal of basketball analytics.\nTypical statistical analytics mainly focuses on the box score and has developed\nvarious metrics. In spite of the more and more advanced methods, metrics built\nupon box score statistics provide limited information about how players\ninteract with each other. Two players with similar box scores may deliver\ndistinct team plays. Thus professional basketball scouts have to watch real\ngames to evaluate players. Live scouting is effective, but suffers from\ninefficiency and subjectivity. In this paper, we go beyond the static box score\nand model basketball games as dynamic networks. The proposed Continuous-time\nStochastic Block Model clusters the players according to their playing style\nand performance. The model provides cluster-specific estimates of the\neffectiveness of players at scoring, rebounding, stealing, etc, and also\ncaptures player interaction patterns within and between clusters. By clustering\nsimilar players together, the model can help basketball scouts to narrow down\nthe search space. Moreover, the model is able to reveal the subtle differences\nin the offensive strategies of different teams. An application to NBA\nbasketball games illustrates the performance of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 20:14:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 10:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

The objective of the present study was to apply the nonlinear\nresponse function model of subjective well-being (RFSWB model) to evaluate the\noutcome of rhythmic movement therapy (RMT) for increasing subjective well-being\nand to analyze whether intervention-related changes in several psychological\nvariables were mechanisms underlying SWB increase in subjects participating in\nRMT group. Methods. A total of 273 subjects (54 males and 219 females, mean age\nwas 37.3(SD=10.5) years) were selected at random in nonclinical population and\nassessed with the appropriate surveys and questionnaires. The RMT program was\nproposed to the 105 subjects (24 males, 81 females, and mean age 37.6(SD=11.7)\nyears) with very low, low and medium SWB level. Control group was included.\nFindings. Results revealed that: a) substantial changes in SWB and underlying\npsychological state were observed among the participants as a result of RMT\nintervention; b) RFSWB model predicts the changes in SWB after RMT intervention\nsatisfactorily and can help to identify the reliable predictors of success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 09:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

Nevertheless, with sufficient information about\nuser preferences, recommendations become accurate and an abrupt transition to\nthis accurate regime is observed for some algorithms. On the other hand, we\nfound that a high accuracy evaluated by common accuracy metrics does not\nnecessarily correspond to a high real accuracy nor a benefit for users, which\nserves as an alarm for operators and researchers of recommender systems. We\ntested our model with a real dataset and observed similar behaviors. Finally, a\nrecommendation approach with improved accuracy is suggested.
