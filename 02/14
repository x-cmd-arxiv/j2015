Cognitive femto-cells opportunistically transmit on the\nmacro-cell channels when they are free of use. Those free channels are located\nby means of spectrum sensing using energy detection. Moreover, periodic sensing\nis adopted to detect any changes of the sensing outcomes. The maximum\nattainable femto-cell downlink throughput varies with the macro-cell channel\noccupancy statistics. Therefore, the LTE macro-cell occupancy is empirically\nmodeled using exponential distributions mixture. The LTE cognitive femto-cell\ndownlink throughput is maximized by compromising the transmission efficiency,\nthe explored spectrum opportunities and the interference from the macro-cell.\nAn analytical solution for the optimal periodic sensing interval that maximizes\nthe throughput is found and verified by simulations. The obtained results show\nthat there is indeed a single periodic sensing interval value that maximizes\nthe LTE cognitive femto-cell downlink throughput. At the peak of the macro-cell\ntraffic, our framework increases the femto-cell throughput by around 15%\ncompared to the senseless case.

From a practical perspective, checking a complex\nproof can be a tedious process, often requiring experts knowledgeable in\nmechanism design. Furthermore, from a modeling perspective, if unsophisticated\nagents are unconvinced of incentive properties, they may strategize in\nunpredictable ways.\n  To address both concerns, we explore techniques from computer-aided\nverification to construct formal proofs of incentive properties. Because formal\nproofs can be automatically checked, agents do not need to manually check the\nproperties, or even understand the proof. To demonstrate, we present the\nverification of a sophisticated mechanism: the generic reduction from Bayesian\nincentive compatible mechanism design to algorithm design given by Hartline,\nKleinberg, and Malekian.

This provides a\ncritical test of the formalism for a non-factorized thermal state, and\nelucidates the roles of fluctuation, dissipation, non-Markovian effects, and\nsystem-bath coherence. Employing numerical solutions of the imaginary-time\nQHFP, we demonstrate the capability of this method to obtain thermodynamic\nquantities for any potential surface. It is shown that both types of QHFP\nequations can produce numerical results of any desired accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 18:13:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 18:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

The\nlensing is manifested by subdiffractional focusing of phonon-polaritons\nlaunched by metallic disks underneath the hBN crystal. The waveguiding is\nrevealed through the modal analysis of the periodic patterns observed around\nsuch launchers and near the sample edges. Our work opens new opportunities for\nanisotropic layered insulators in infrared nanophotonics complementing and\npotentially surpassing concurrent artificial hyperbolic materials with lower\nlosses and higher optical localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 19:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 01:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

The significant result is the existence of a\nbijective mapping between the asynchronous system and the synchronous system\nclassically used to update cellular automata. Consequently, although the CA\noutputs look qualitatively different, when surveyed on \"contours\" of real time,\nthe asynchronous CA replicates the synchronous CA. Moreover, this type of\nasynchrony is simple - it is characterised by the underlying network structure\nof the cells, and long-term behaviour is deterministic and periodic due to the\nlinearity of max-plus algebra. The findings lead us to proffer max-plus algebra\nas: (i) a more accurate and efficient underlying timing mechanism for models of\npatterns seen in nature, and (ii) a foundation for promising extensions and\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 19:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-16"}

The abrupt collapse of a massive ($\\sim 10^4 - 10^5 \\,\n\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$) and rotating object is a powerful source of gravitational\nwaves emission.

Their formation rate is\nvery high ($\\sim 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ up to $z\\sim20$), but due to a short\nduration of the collapse event ($\\sim 2-30\\, \\mathrm{s}$, depending on the DCBH\nmass) the integrated signal from these sources is characterized by a very low\nduty-cycle (${\\cal D}\\sim 10^{-3}$), i.e. a shot-noise signal.

A comprehensive model of the kinetic turbulent\ncascade is presented, with a detailed discussion of each component of the model\nand a review of supporting and conflicting theoretical, numerical, and\nobservational evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 21:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

Further, we provide a black-box\nreduction from an arbitrary multi-arm bandit algorithm to an\nincentive-compatible one, with only a constant multiplicative increase in\nregret. This reduction works for very general bandit setting that incorporate\ncontexts and arbitrary auxiliary feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 23:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 17:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 18:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 01:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 17:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2018 23:07:39 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 2 May 2019 22:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals\nare linearly mixed to form the observed signals. We propose a new algorithm,\nPEGI (for pseudo-Euclidean Gradient Iteration), for provable model recovery for\nICA with Gaussian noise. The main technical innovation of the algorithm is to\nuse a fixed point iteration in a pseudo-Euclidean (indefinite \"inner product\")\nspace. The use of this indefinite \"inner product\" resolves technical issues\ncommon to several existing algorithms for noisy ICA. This leads to an algorithm\nwhich is conceptually simple, efficient and accurate in testing.\n  Our second contribution is combining PEGI with the analysis of objectives for\noptimal recovery in the noisy ICA model. It has been observed that the direct\napproach of demixing with the inverse of the mixing matrix is suboptimal for\nsignal recovery in terms of the natural Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio\n(SINR) criterion. There have been several partial solutions proposed in the ICA\nliterature. It turns out that any solution to the mixing matrix reconstruction\nproblem can be used to construct an SINR-optimal ICA demixing, despite the fact\nthat SINR itself cannot be computed from data.

Motivated by the exponentially increasing wireless data demand,\ncellular networks are evolving towards a heterogeneous and small cell network\narchitecture, wherein small cells are expected to provide very high capacity.\nHowever, due to the limited licensed spectrum for cellular networks, any effort\nto achieve capacity growth through network densification will face the\nchallenge of severe inter-cell interference. In view of this, recent\nstandardization developments have started to consider the opportunities for\ncellular networks to use the unlicensed spectrum bands, including the 2.4 GHz\nand 5 GHz bands that are currently used by Wi-Fi, Zigbee and some other\ncommunication systems. In this article, we look into the coexistence of Wi-Fi\nand 4G cellular networks sharing the unlicensed spectrum.

We\npresent an almost blank subframe (ABS) scheme without priority to mitigate the\nco-channel interference from small cells to Wi-Fi systems, and propose an\ninterference avoidance scheme based on small cells estimating the density of\nnearby Wi-Fi access points to facilitate their coexistence while sharing the\nsame unlicensed spectrum.

Ideally, the operators should negotiate about the amount of spectrum\nto contribute, without revealing proprietary information to each other and/or\nto other parties. One possible way to do that is to use the sequence of\noperators' best responses, i.e., the operators make offers about the amount of\nspectrum to contribute using a sequential updating procedure until reaching\nconsensus. Besides spectrum allocation, we need a mode selection scheme for the\nmulti-operator D2D users. We use a stochastic geometry framework to capture the\nimpact of mode selection on the distribution of D2D users and assess the\nperformance of the best response iteration algorithm. With the performance\nmetrics considered in the paper, we show that the best response iteration has a\nunique Nash equilibrium that can be reached from any initial strategy. In\ngeneral, asymmetric operators would contribute unequal amounts of spectrum for\nmulti-operator D2D communication. Provided that the multi-operator D2D density\nis not negligible, we show that both operators may experience significant\nperformance gains as compared to the scheme without spectrum sharing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2015 10:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Due to that the\nattackers or malicious nodes are easily affected that kind of network and\nresponsible for the routing misbehavior. The routing is network is mandatory to\ndeliver data in between source and destination. In this research we work on\nsecurity field in MANET and proposed a novel security scheme against routing\nmisbehavior through Black hole attack. The Ad hoc On demand Multipath Routing\n(AOMDV) protocol is consider for routing and also to improves the routing\nquality as compare to single path routing protocol. The attacker is affected\nall the possible paths that is selected by sender for sending data in network.\nThe malicious nodes are forward optimistic reply at the time of routing by that\ntheir identification is also a complex procedure. The proposed Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS) scheme is identified the attacker information through\nhop count mechanism. The routing information of actual data is reached to which\nintermediate node and the next hop information is exist at that node is confirm\nby IDS scheme. The black hole attacker node Identification (ID) is forward in\nnetwork by that in future attacker is not participating in routing procedure.\nThe proposed security scheme detects and provides the deterrence against\nrouting misbehavior through malicious attack. Here we compare the routing\nperformance of AOMDV, Attack and IDS scheme. The performance of normal\nmultipath routing and proposed IDS scheme is almost equal. The attacker has\ndegrades the whole routing performance but observed that in presence of\nattacker, routing misbehavior is completely block by the proposed IDS scheme\nand recovers 95 % of data as compare to normal routing.

The MWA, located at\nthe Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia, consists\nof 128 dual-polarized aperture-array elements (tiles) operating between 80 and\n300\\,MHz, with a total processed bandwidth of 30.72 MHz for each polarization.\nRadio-frequency signals from the tiles are amplified and band limited using\nanalog signal conditioning units; sampled and channelized by digital-receivers.\nThe signals from eight tiles are processed by a single digital-receiver, thus\nrequiring 16 digital-receivers for the MWA. The main function of the\ndigital-receivers is to digitize the broad-band signals from each tile,\nchannelize them to form the sky-band, and transport it through optical fibers\nto a centrally located correlator for further processing. The digital-receiver\nfirmware also implements functions to measure the signal power, perform power\nequalization across the band, detect interference-like events, and invoke\ndiagnostic modes. The digital-receiver is controlled by high-level programs\nrunning on a single-board-computer. This paper presents the digital-receiver\ndesign, implementation, current status, and plans for future enhancements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2015 00:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}

Moreover, some of\nthe limitations for a higher density of entangled photon emitters are\naddressed. Among these issues are (1) a remaining small fine-structure\nsplitting and (2) an effective QD charging under non-resonant excitation\nconditions, which strongly reduce the number of useful biexciton-exciton\nrecombination events. A possible solution of the charging problem is\ninvestigated exploiting a dual-wavelength excitation technique, which allows a\ngradual QD charge tuning from strongly negative to positive and, eventually,\nefficient detection of entangled photons from QDs, which would be otherwise\nineffective under a single-wavelength (non-resonant) excitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 22:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Yet as an area of\nstudy, emerging technologies lacks key foundational elements, namely a\nconsensus on what classifies a technology as 'emergent' and strong research\ndesigns that operationalize central theoretical concepts. The present paper\naims to fill this gap by developing a definition of 'emerging technologies' and\nlinking this conceptual effort with the development of a framework for the\noperationalisation of technological emergence. The definition is developed by\ncombining a basic understanding of the term and in particular the concept of\n'emergence' with a review of key innovation studies dealing with definitional\nissues of technological emergence. The resulting definition identifies five\nattributes that feature in the emergence of novel technologies. These are: (i)\nradical novelty, (ii) relatively fast growth, (iii) coherence, (iv) prominent\nimpact, and (v) uncertainty and ambiguity. The framework for operationalising\nemerging technologies is then elaborated on the basis of the proposed\nattributes. To do so, we identify and review major empirical approaches (mainly\nin, although not limited to, the scientometric domain) for the detection and\nstudy of emerging technologies (these include indicators and trend analysis,\ncitation analysis, co-word analysis, overlay mapping, and combinations thereof)\nand elaborate on how these can be used to operationalise the different\nattributes of emergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 17:28:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 13:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 09:33:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 13:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}
