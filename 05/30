The algorithm is blocked, to allow\nit to be implemented efficiently. The need for single vector pivoting in\nclassical algorithms for computing QR factorizations is avoided by the use of\nrandomized sampling to find blocks of pivot vectors at once. The advantage of\nblocking becomes particularly pronounced when $A$ is very large, and possibly\nstored out-of-core, or on a distributed memory machine. The manuscript also\ndescribes a generalization of the QR factorization that allows $P$ to be a\ngeneral orthonormal matrix. In this setting, one can at moderate cost compute a\n\\textit{rank-revealing} factorization where the mass of $R$ is concentrated to\nthe diagonal entries. Moreover, the diagonal entries of $R$ closely approximate\nthe singular values of $A$.

Recently, systematic trends\nwithin avian clades have been uncovered. The trends show that the disparity is\nmuch larger for mitochondrial DNA than for nuclear DNA, also that it is larger\nfor crown fossil dates than stem fossil dates. It has been argued that this\npattern is largely inconsistent with incompleteness of the fossil record as the\nprincipal driver of the disparity. A case is presented that given the expected\nmutations from a fluctuating background of astrophysical radiation from such\nsources as supernovae, the rate of molecular clocks is variable and should\nincrease back to a few Ma, before returning to the long-term average rate. This\nis a possible explanation for the disparity. One test of this hypothesis is to\nlook for an acceleration of molecular clocks 2 to 2.5 Ma due to one or more\nmoderately nearby supernovae known to have happened at that time. Another is to\nlook for reduced disparity in benthic organisms of the deep ocean. In addition,\ndue to the importance of highly penetrating muon irradiation, the disparity\nshould be magnified for megafauna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 17:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 18:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 15:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 21:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

Different linear\ntransformations are used to facilitate the formation control task in a\ndifferent way. For example Jacobi transformation is used to separate the shape\ncontrol and trajectory control. The inverse of the transformation must have\nnonzero eigenvalues with both positive and negative real parts which may lead\nthe system to instability. If the inverse of the transformation appears in\nclosed loop then a diagonal stabilizing matrix is required to reassign the\neigenvalues of the inverse of transformation in the right half of complex\nplane. The algorithm to find such stabilizing matrix is provided. We then\ndefine a matrix of potential in the actual domain which is the stepping stone\nto find a matrix of potential in the transformed domain.

We measure the position angles of\nthe galaxies using three distinct methods - the integrated light method,\nquadrupole moments of surface brightness, and using model-based ellipticity\nmeasurements provided by IM3SHAPE. A weighting scheme is adopted to address\nbiases in the position angle measurements which arise in the presence of an\nanisotropic PSF. Biases on the shear estimates, due to measurement errors on\nthe position angles and correlations between the measurement errors and the\ntrue position angles, are corrected for using simulated galaxy images and an\niterative procedure. The properties of the simulations are estimated using the\ndeep field images provided as part of the challenge. A method is developed to\nmatch the distributions of galaxy fluxes and half-light radii from the deep\nfields to the corresponding distributions in the field of interest.

Such estimation\ntherefore tends to overrate the amount of leaked information in practice, leads\nto a fundamental threshold of the bit error rate. The threshold becomes a\nbottleneck of the development of practical QKD systems. In classical\ncommunication, according to Shannon's communication theory, information can\ntransform through a noisy channel even if the background noise is very strong\ncompare to the signal and hence the threshold of the bit error rate tends to\n50%. One might wonder whether a QKD scheme can also tolerate error rate as high\nas 50%. The question is answered affirmatively with the recent work of\nround-robin differential phase-shift (RRDPS) protocol, which breaks through the\nfundamental threshold of the bit error rate and indicates another potential\ndirection in the field of quantum cryptography. The key challenge to realize\nthe RRDPS scheme lies on the measurement device, which requires a\nvariable-delay interferometer. The delay needs to be chosen from a set of\npredetermined values randomly. Such measurement can be realized by switching\nbetween many interferometers with different delays at a high speed in\naccordance with the system repetition rate. The more delay values can be chosen\nfrom, the higher error rate can be tolerated. By designing an optical system\nwith multiple switches and employing an active phase stabilization technology,\nwe successfully construct a variable-delay interferometer with 128 actively\nselectable delays. With this measurement, we experimentally demonstrate the\nRRDPS QKD protocol and obtain a final key rate of 15.54 bps via a total loss of\n18 dB and 8.9% error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 18:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Radon data is typically measured on an\nequally spaced grid in polar coordinates, and reconstructions are represented\n(as images) in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, in addition to FFT, several\nsteps of interpolation have to be conducted in order to apply the Radon\ntransform and the back-projection operator by means of convolutions.\n  Both the interpolation and the FFT operations can be efficiently implemented\non Graphical Processor Units (GPUs). For the interpolation, it is possible to\nmake use of the fact that linear interpolation is hard-wired on GPUs, meaning\nthat it has the same computational cost as direct memory access. Cubic order\ninterpolation schemes can be constructed by combining linear interpolation\nsteps which provides important computation speedup.\n  We provide details about how the Radon transform and the back-projection can\nbe implemented efficiently as convolution operators on GPUs.

A significant challenge facing\nowners of these datasets is how to share sensitive graphs with collaborators\nand authorized users, e.g. network topologies with network equipment vendors or\nFacebook's social graphs with academic collaborators. Current tools can provide\nlimited node or edge privacy, but require modifications to the graph that\nsignificantly reduce its utility.\n  In this work, we propose a new alternative in the form of graph watermarks.\nGraph watermarks are small graphs tailor-made for a given graph dataset, a\nsecure graph key, and a secure user key. To share a sensitive graph G with a\ncollaborator C, the owner generates a watermark graph W using G, the graph key,\nand C's key as input, and embeds W into G to form G'. If G' is leaked by C,its\nowner can reliably determine if the watermark W generated for C does in fact\nreside inside G', thereby proving C is responsible for the leak. Graph\nwatermarks serve both as a deterrent against data leakage and a method of\nrecourse after a leak. We provide robust schemes for creating, embedding and\nextracting watermarks, and use analysis and experiments on large, real graphs\nto show that they are unique and difficult to forge.

Identification of the satellites in the frames was done through\ntheir ephemerides as determined from the SPICE/NAIF kernels. Some procedures\nwere followed to overcome missing or incomplete information (coordinates,\ndate), mostly for the older images. We managed to obtain more than 6000\npositions for 18 irregular satellites: 12 of Jupiter, 4 of Saturn, 1 of Uranus\n(Sycorax), and 1 of Neptune (Nereid). For some satellites the number of\nobtained positions is more than 50\\% of what was used in earlier orbital\nnumerical integrations. Comparison of our positions with recent JPL ephemeris\nsuggests there are systematic errors in the orbits for some of the irregular\nsatellites. The most evident case was an error in the inclination of Carme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 22:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

Most sequence-function\nrelationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental\ntechniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The\nadvent of such \"massively parallel\" experiments presents an exciting\nopportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the\nstudy of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental\nadvances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of\nsequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments.\nSpecifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that\ninference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based\napproach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these\nmodels. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of \"diffeomorphic\nmodes\" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data\nthan likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in\nphysics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the\ninference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel\nexperiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these\nfundamental aspects of statistical inference.

The\nidea is to replace the classical irreversible attractor dynamics driven by an\nIsing model with pattern-dependent weights by the reversible rotation of an\ninput quantum state onto an output quantum state consisting of a linear\nsuperposition with probability amplitudes peaked on the stored pattern closest\nto the input in Hamming distance, resulting in a high probability of measuring\na memory pattern very similar to the input. The unitary operator implementing\nthis transformation can be formulated as a sequence of one-qubit and two-qubit\nelementary quantum gates and is thus the exponential of an ordered quantum\nIsing model with sequential operations and with pattern-dependent interactions,\nexactly as in the classical case. Probabilistic quantum memories, that make use\nof postselection of the measurement result of control qubits, overcome the\nfamed linear storage limitation of their classical counterparts because they\npermit to completely {\\it eliminate crosstalk and spurious memories}. The\nnumber of control qubits plays the role of an inverse fictitious temperature,\nthe accuracy of pattern retrieval can be tuned by lowering the fictitious\ntemperature under a critical value for quantum content association while the\ncomplexity of the retrieval algorithm remains polynomial for any number of\npatterns polynomial in the number of qubits. These models solve thus the\ncapacity shortage problem of classical associative memories, providing a {\\it\npolynomial improvement} in capacity. The price to pay is the probabilistic\nnature of information retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 13:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

A time varying deceleration parameter generating a hybrid\nscale factor is considered to simulate a cosmic transition from early\ndeceleration to late time acceleration. We found that the pressure anisotropies\nalong the $y-$ and $z-$ axes evolve dynamically and continue along with the\ncosmic expansion without being subsided even at late times. The anisotropic\npressure along the $x-$axis becomes equal to the mean fluid pressure. At a late\nphase of cosmic evolution, the model enters into a phantom region. From a state\nfinder diagnosis, it is found that the model overlaps with $\\Lambda$CDM at late\nphase of cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 16:02:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 05:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}
