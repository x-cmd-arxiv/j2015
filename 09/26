Although the bacterium is\ntransmitted vertically from infected mothers to their offspring, it can be\ndifficult to establish an endemic infection in a wild mosquito population. We\ndeveloped and analyzed an ordinary differential equation model to investigate\nthe transmission dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to\nestablish an endemic infection in a population of wild uninfected mosquitoes.\nOur transmission model for the adult and aquatic-stage mosquitoes takes into\naccount Wolbachia-induced fitness change and cytoplasmic incompatibility. We\nshowed that, for a wide range of realistic parameter values, the basic\nreproduction number is less than one. Hence, the epidemic will die out if only\na few Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are introduced into the wild population.\nEven though the basic reproduction number is less than one, an endemic\nWolbachia infection can be established if a sufficient number of infected\nmosquitoes are released. This threshold effect is created by a backward\nbifurcation with three coexisting equilibria: a stable zero-infection\nequilibrium, an intermediate-infection unstable endemic equilibrium, and a\nhigh-infection stable endemic equilibrium. We analyzed the impact of reducing\nthe wild mosquito population before introducing the infected mosquitoes and\nobserved that the most effective approach to establish the infection in the\nwild is based on reducing mosquitoes in both the adult and aquatic stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 16:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 01:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

The emission of intrinsic Cs2NaRBr3I3 with a light\nyield ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 ph/MeV is dominant by self-trapped exciton\nemission. Partial substitution of R with Ce introduces a competing emission,\nthe Ce3+ 5d to 4f radiative transition. Ab initio calculations were performed\nto investigate the electronic structures as well as the binding energies of\npolarons in Cs2NaRBr6. The calculated large self-trapped exciton binding\nenergies are consistent with the observed high light yield due to self-trapped\nexciton emission. The unique electronic structure of halide elpasolites as\ncalculated enhances the STE stability and the STE emission. The highly tunable\nscintillation properties of mixed-anion elpasolites underscore the role of\ntheir complex scintillation mechanism. Our study provides guidance for the\ndesign of new elpasolites scintillators with exceptional energy resolution and\nlight yield desirable for applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 18:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 21:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

An alternative to collecting training videos is\nto train a large semantic concept bank a priori. Given a text description of an\nevent, event retrieval is performed by selecting concepts linguistically\nrelated to the event description and fusing the concept responses on unseen\nvideos. However, defining an exhaustive concept lexicon and pre-training it\nrequires vast computational resources. Therefore, recent approaches automate\nconcept discovery and training by leveraging large amounts of weakly annotated\nweb data. Compact visually salient concepts are automatically obtained by the\nuse of concept pairs or, more generally, n-grams. However, not all visually\nsalient n-grams are necessarily useful for an event query--some combinations of\nconcepts may be visually compact but irrelevant--and this drastically affects\nperformance. We propose an event retrieval algorithm that constructs pairs of\nautomatically discovered concepts and then prunes those concepts that are\nunlikely to be helpful for retrieval. Pruning depends both on the query and on\nthe specific video instance being evaluated. Our approach also addresses\ncalibration and domain adaptation issues that arise when applying concept\ndetectors to unseen videos.

As such, this approach is of particular relevance to situations where the\ndominant quantum and classical paths are non-perturbatively far away from\none-another. A pertinent example is the decay of false vacua in\nradiatively-generated potentials, as may occur for the electroweak vacuum of\nthe Standard Model.

Of the countless number of chemical species\nterrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct spectral features and\nthe necessary atmospheric abundance to be detectable. The easiest of these\nspecies to observe in Earth's atmosphere is O$_{2}$ (and its photochemical\nbyproduct, O$_{3}$). But O$_{2}$ can also be produced abiotically by photolysis\nof CO$_{2}$, followed by recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is\nproduced in stoichiometric proportions. Whether O$_{2}$ and CO can accumulate\nto appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of far-UV to near-UV\nradiation coming from the planet's parent star and on what happens to these\ngases when they dissolve in a planet's oceans. Using a one-dimensional\nphotochemical model, we demonstrate that O$_{2}$ derived from CO$_{2}$\nphotolysis should not accumulate to measurable concentrations on planets around\nF- and G-type stars.

We measure the distribution of\nLGRB offsets from their host centers, as well as their relation to the\nunderlying host light distribution. We find that the host-normalized offsets\n(R/R_h) of LGRBs are more centrally concentrated than expected for an\nexponential disk profile, with a median of 0.67, and in particular they are\nmore concentrated than the underlying surface brightness profiles of their host\ngalaxies. The distribution of offsets is inconsistent with the distribution for\nType II supernovae (SNe) but consistent with the distribution for Type Ib/c\nSNe. The fractional flux distribution, with a median of 0.75, indicates that\nLGRBs prefer some of the brightest locations in their host galaxies but are not\nas strongly correlated as previous studies indicated. More importantly, we find\na clear correlation between the offset and fractional flux, where bursts at\nR/R_h < 0.5 exclusively occur at fractional fluxes > 0.6 while bursts at R/R_h\n> 0.5 uniformly trace the light of their hosts. This indicates that the spatial\ncorrelation of LGRB locations with bright star forming regions seen in the full\nsample is dominated by the contribution from bursts at small offset and that\nLGRBs in the outer parts of galaxies show no preference for unusually bright\nstar forming regions.

The key novelty is the introduction of physically\nmotivated, radially varying, maximum and minimum impact parameters. With these,\nour model gives an excellent match to full N-body simulations for isotropic\nbackground density distributions, both cuspy and shallow, without any\nfine-tuning of the model parameters. In particular, we are able to reproduce\nthe dramatic core-stalling effect that occurs in shallow/constant density\ncores, for the first time. This gives us new physical insight into the\ncore-stalling phenomenon. We show that core stalling occurs in the limit in\nwhich the product of the Coulomb logarithm and the local fraction of stars with\nvelocity lower than the infalling body tends to zero. For cuspy backgrounds,\nthis occurs when the infalling mass approaches the enclosed background mass.\nFor cored backgrounds, it occurs at larger distances from the centre, due to a\ncombination of a rapidly increasing minimum impact parameter and a lack of slow\nmoving stars in the core. This demonstrates that the physics of core-stalling\nis likely the same for both massive infalling objects and low-mass objects\nmoving in shallow density backgrounds. We implement our prescription for\ndynamical friction in the direct summation code NBODY6 as an analytic\ncorrection for stars that remain within the Roche volume of the infalling\nobject. This approach is computationally efficient, since only stars in the\ninspiralling system need to be evolved with direct summation.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 20:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 23:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

In particular, we find that inverse see-saw models of neutrino mass\nallow for light new physics interpretations of most precision leptonic\nobservables, such as lepton universality, lepton flavor violation, but not for\nthe electron EDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 21:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

In the open magnetic field of coronal\nholes, jets form quasi-radial spires that can extend far out into the\nheliosphere, while in closed-field regions the jet outflows are confined to the\ncorona. We explore the application of the embedded-bipole model to jets\noccurring in closed coronal loops. In this model, magnetic free energy is\ninjected slowly by footpoint motions that introduce twist within the closed\ndome of the jet source region, and is released rapidly by the onset of an ideal\nkink-like instability. Two length scales characterize the system: the width (N)\nof the jet source region and the footpoint separation (L) of the coronal loop\nthat envelops the jet source. We find that the jet characteristics are highly\nsensitive to the ratio L/N, in both the conditions for initiation and the\nsubsequent dynamics. The longest-lasting and most energetic jets occur along\nlong coronal loops with large L/N ratios, and share many features of open-field\njets, while smaller L/N ratios produce shorter-duration, less energetic jets\nthat are affected by reflections from the far-loop footpoint. We quantify the\ntransition between these behaviours and show that our model replicates key\nqualitative and quantitative aspects of both quiet-Sun and active-region loop\njets. We also find that the reconnection between the closed dome and\nsurrounding coronal loop is very extensive: the cumulative reconnected flux at\nleast matches the total flux beneath the dome for small L/N, and is more than\ndouble that value for large L/N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 21:25:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 19:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

In these experiments, the trapped electrons will co-propagate\nwith the longitudinal wakefield and the transverse laser field. In this\nscenario, the electrons can gain a significant amount of energy from both the\ndirect laser acceleration (DLA) mechanism as well as the usual LWFA mechanism.\nParticle-in-cell (PIC) codes are frequently used to discern the relative\ncontribution of these two mechanisms. However, if the longitudinal resolution\nused in the PIC simulations is inadequate, it can produce numerical heating\nthat can overestimate the transverse motion, which is important in determining\nthe energy gain due to DLA. We have therefore carried out a systematic study of\nthis LWFA regime by varying the longitudinal resolution of PIC simulations from\nthe standard, best-practice resolution of 30 points per laser wavelength to\nfour times that value and then examining the energy gain characteristics of\nboth the highest-energy electrons and the bulk electrons. By calculating the\ncontribution of DLA to the final energies of the electrons produced from the\nLWFA, we find that although the transverse momentum and oscillation radii are\nover-estimated in the lower-resolution simulations, this over-estimation does\nnot lead to artificial energy gain by DLA. Rather, the DLA contribution to the\nhighest-energy electrons is larger in the higher-resolution cases because the\nDLA resonance is better maintained. Thus, even at the highest longitudinal\nresolutions, DLA contributes a significant portion of the energy gained by the\nhighest-energy electrons and also contributes to accelerating the bulk of the\ncharge in the electron beam produced by the LWFA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 23:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Ten consecutive patients that were\npreviously treated with proton therapy to 66.6/1.8 Gy (RBE) using double\nscattering (DS) were replanned with PBS. Minimum and maximum intensity images\nfrom 4DCT were used to introduce flexible smearing in the determination of the\nbeam specific PTV (BSPTV).

The evolution of a\ndynamical system is geometrized by introducing a non-linear connection, which\nallows the construction of the KCC covariant derivative, and of the deviation\ncurvature tensor. In the KCC theory the properties of any dynamical system are\ndescribed in terms of five geometrical invariants, with the second one giving\nthe Jacobi stability of the system. Usually, the KCC theory is formulated by\nreducing the dynamical evolution equations to a set of second order\ndifferential equations.

In this paper, we study the theoretical foundations of\ninfinite population models of evolutionary algorithms on continuous\noptimization problems. First, we show that the convergence proofs in a widely\ncited study were in fact problematic and incomplete. We further show that the\nmodeling assumption of exchangeability of individuals cannot yield the\ntransition equation. Then, in order to analyze infinite population models, we\nbuild an analytical framework based on convergence in distribution of random\nelements which take values in the metric space of infinite sequences. The\nframework is concise and mathematically rigorous. It also provides an\ninfrastructure for studying the convergence of the stacking of operators and of\niterating the algorithm which previous studies failed to address.

The other is that two spectral singularities, one originating\nfrom the Brillouin zone center and the other from the Brillouin zone boundary,\ncan coalesce at some k-point in the interior of the Brillouin zone and create a\nsingularity of higher order. Furthermore, we can induce a band inversion by\ntuning the filling ratio of the photonic crystal, and we find that the\ngeometric phases of the bands before and after the inversion are independent of\nthe amount of non-Hermiticity as long as the PT-exact phase is not broken.

However, such a pure\nlow-resolution ADC architecture also complicates parameter estimation problems\nsuch as time/frequency synchronization and channel estimation. A mixed-ADC\narchitecture, where most of the antennas are equipped with low-precision ADCs\nwhile a few antennas have full-precision ADCs, can solve these issues and\nactualize the potential of the pure low-resolution ADC architecture. In this\npaper, we present a unified framework to develop a family of detectors over the\nmassive MIMO uplink system with the mixed-ADC receiver architecture by\nexploiting probabilistic Bayesian inference. As a basic setup, an optimal\ndetector is developed to provide a minimum mean-squared-error (MMSE) estimate\non data symbols.

The asymptotic performance expressions\ncan be evaluated quickly and efficiently; thus, they are useful in system\ndesign optimization. We show that in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nregime, the distortion caused by the PQN model can be ignored, whereas in the\nhigh-SNR regime, such distortion may cause 1-bit detection performance loss.\nThe performance gap resulting from the PQN model can be narrowed by a small\nfraction of high-precision ADCs in the mixed-ADC architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 09:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 11:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

While it is understood that the\nlarge binding energy is mainly due to the weak dielectric screening in two\ndimensions (2D), a systematic investigation of the role of screening on 2D\nexcitons is still lacking. Here we provide a critical assessment of a widely\nused 2D hydrogenic exciton model which assumes a dielectric function of the\nform {\\epsilon}(q) = 1 + 2{\\pi}{\\alpha}q, and we develop a quasi-2D model with\na much broader applicability. Within the quasi-2D picture, electrons and holes\nare described as in-plane point charges with a finite extension in the\nperpendicular direction and their interaction is screened by a dielectric\nfunction with a non-linear q-dependence which is computed ab-initio. The\nscreened interaction is used in a generalized Mott-Wannier model to calculate\nexciton binding energies in both isolated and supported 2D materials. For\nisolated 2D materials, the quasi-2D treatment yields results almost identical\nto those of the strict 2D model and both are in good agreement with ab-initio\nmany-body calculations. On the other hand, for more complex structures such as\nsupported layers or layers embedded in a van der Waals heterostructure, the\nsize of the exciton in reciprocal space extends well beyond the linear regime\nof the dielectric function and a quasi-2D description has to replace the 2D\none.

This resource allocation can be\nviewed as classical control problem where feedback is the amount of resource\nreceived, which controls the output i.e. the amount of resources shared back to\nthe network by the node. The motivation behind the use of control system in\nresource allocation is to exploit already existing tools in control theory to\nimprove the overall allocation process and thereby solving the problem of\nfreeriding and whitewashing in the network. At the outset, we have derived the\ntransfer function to model the P2P system. Subsequently, through the simulation\nresults we have shown that transfer function was able to provide optimal value\nof resource sharing for the peers during the normal as well as high degree of\noverloading in the network. Thereafter we verified the accuracy of the transfer\nfunction derived by comparing its output with the simulated P2P network. To\ndemonstrate how control system reduces free riding it has been shown through\nsimulations how the control systems penalizes the nodes indulging in different\nlevels of freeriding. Our proposed control system shows considerable gain over\nexisting state of art algorithm. This improvement is achieved through PI action\nof controller. Since low reputation peers usually subvert reputation system by\nwhitewashing. We propose and substantiate a technique modifying transfer\nfunction such that systems' sluggishness becomes adaptive in such a way that it\nencourage genuine new comers to enter network and discourages member peers to\nwhitewash.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 15:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 14:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-25"}

Early\nalgorithms on mining communities have focused on the global structure, and\noften run in time functional to the size of the entire graph. Nowadays, as we\noften explore networks with billions of vertices and find communities of size\nhundreds, it is crucial to shift our attention from macroscopic structure to\nmicroscopic structure in large networks. A growing body of work has been\nadopting local expansion methods in order to identify the community members\nfrom a few exemplary seed members.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for finding overlapping\ncommunities called LEMON (Local Expansion via Minimum One Norm). The algorithm\nfinds the community by seeking a sparse vector in the span of the local spectra\nsuch that the seeds are in its support. We show that LEMON can achieve the\nhighest detection accuracy among state-of-the-art proposals. The running time\ndepends on the size of the community rather than that of the entire graph. The\nalgorithm is easy to implement, and is highly parallelizable. We further\nprovide theoretical analysis on the local spectral properties, bounding the\nmeasure of tightness of extracted community in terms of the eigenvalues of\ngraph Laplacian.\n  Moreover, given that networks are not all similar in nature, a comprehensive\nanalysis on how the local expansion approach is suited for uncovering\ncommunities in different networks is still lacking. We thoroughly evaluate our\napproach using both synthetic and real-world datasets across different domains,\nand analyze the empirical variations when applying our method to inherently\ndifferent networks in practice. In addition, the heuristics on how the seed set\nquality and quantity would affect the performance are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 15:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

Despite the overwhelming evidence for dark matter from\ncosmological indications at small and large scales, a clear evidence for a\nparticle explaining these observations remains absent. This review summarises\nthe status of direct dark matter searches, focussing on the detector\ntechnologies used to directly detect a dark matter particle producing recoil\nenergies in the keV energy scale. The phenomenological signal expectations,\nmain background sources, statistical treatment of data and calibration\nstrategies are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 14:31:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 14:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

The software components of\nworkflow are interfaced in different heterogeneous environments that get\nexecuted at data processing software in automated and semi automated modes.

In this study, we propose a software\narchitecture that gives more flexible automation with very less manageable\ncode.

This is based on a set of generalized Verhulst-Lotka-Volterra\ndifferential equations. In this study, strong cooperation is allowed among\nagents having similar sizes, and weak cooperation if agent have markedly\ndifferent \"sizes\", thus establishing a peer-to-peer modulated interaction\nscheme. A rigorous analysis of the stable configurations is presented first\nexamining the fixed points of the system, next determining their stability as a\nfunction of the model parameters. It is found that the agents are\nself-organizing into clusters. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, depending\non parameter values, multiple stable configurations can coexist. It occurs that\nonly one of them always emerges with probability close to one, because its\nassociated attractor dominates over the rest. This is shown through numerical\nintegrations and simulations,after analytic developments. In contrast to the\ncompetitive case, agents are able to increase their capacity beyond the\nno-interaction case limit. In other words, when some collaborative partnership\namong a relatively small number of partners takes place, all agents act in good\nfaith prioritizing the common good, whence receiving a mutual benefit allowing\nthem to surpass their capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 19:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

The temporal divergence in cropping pattern has direct\nimplications on geospatial approach of drought assessment, in which, time\nseries NDVI data are compared for drought interpretation. It was found that,\nseasonal NDVI profiles of drought year and normal year did not show any anomaly\nwhen the cropping patterns were dissimilar and two normal years having\ndissimilar cropping pattern showed different NDVI profiles.

Gates design\nis restricted to properties and limitations of interactions and physical\nelements being involved, where Quantum Control plays a deep role. Quantum\ncomplexity of multipartite systems and their interactions requires a tight\ncontrol to manipulate their quantum states, either local and non-local ones,\nbut still a reducibility procedure should be addressed. This work shows how a\ngeneral $2d$-partite two level spin system in $SU(2d)$ could be decomposed in\n$2^{n-1}$ subsystems on $SU(2)$, letting establish control operations. In\nparticular, it is shown that Bell gems basis is a set of natural states on\nwhich decomposition happen naturally under some interaction restrictions. Thus,\nalternating the direction of local interaction terms in the Hamiltonian, this\nprocedure states a universal exchange semantics on those basis. The structure\ndeveloped could be understood as a splitting of the $2d$ information channels\ninto $2^{2d-1}$ pairs of $2$ level information subsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 22:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

However,\na complete understanding of tropical cyclones remains an open research\nchallenge although there have been numerous investigations through measurments\nwith aircrafts/satellites, as well as with numerical simulations. This article\npresents a computational model for simulating the interaction between cyclones.\nThe proposed numerical method is presented briefly, where the time integration\nis performed by projecting the discrete system onto a Krylov subspace. The\nmethod filters the large scale fluid dynamics using a multiresolution\napproximation, and the unresolved dynamics is modeled with a Smagorinsky type\nsubgrid scale parameterization scheme. Numerical experiments with Fujiwhara\ninteractions are considered to verify modeling accuracy. An excellent agreement\nbetween the present simulation and a reference simulation at Re = 5000 has been\ndemonstrated. At Re = 37440, the kinetic energy of cyclones is seen\nconsolidated into larger scales with concurrent enstrophy cascade, suggesting a\nsteady increase of energy containing scales, a phenomena that is typical in\ntwo-dimensional turbulence theory. The primary results of this article suggest\na novel avenue for addressing some of the computational challenges of mesoscale\natmospheric circulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 02:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
