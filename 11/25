The CN flux in the source\ncan be several times larger than the incident flux, due to multiple neutron\nreflections from the moderator-reflector. We show that such a source at the PIK\nreactor would provide an order of magnitude larger density and production rate\nthan an analogous source at the ILL reactor.\n  We estimate parameters of a 4He source with solid methane (CH4) or/and liquid\ndeuterium (D2) moderator-reflector.

Generally speaking, there are transverse and longitudinal\ndegrees of freedom of the memory that one can address by a proper choice of the\npump (control) field spatial pattern. Here we concentrate on the mutual\nevolution and transformation of quantum states of the longitudinal modes of\ncollective spin coherence in the cavity-based memory scheme. We assume that\nthese modes are coherently controlled by the pump waves of the on--demand\ntransverse profile, that is, by the superpositions of waves propagating in the\ndirections, close to orthogonal to the cavity axis. By the write-in, this\nallows one to couple a time sequence of the incoming quantized signals to a\ngiven set of superpositions of orthogonal spin waves. By the readout, one can\nretrieve quantum states of the collective spin waves that are controllable\nsuperpositions of the initial ones and are on demand coupled to the output\nsignal sequence. In general case, the memory is able to operate as a\ncontrollable delayed multi-port beamsplitter, capable of transformation of the\ndelays, the durations and time shapes of signals in the sequence.\n  We elaborate the theory of such light--matter interface for the spatially\nmultivariate cavity-based off--resonant Raman--type quantum memory. Since in\norder to speed up the manipulation of complex signals in multivariate memories\nit might be of interest to store relatively short light pulses of a given time\nshape, we also address some issues of the cavity-based memory operation beyond\nthe bad cavity limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 16:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The protons are then forced to follow the electrons due to the\nelectric field created by the charge displacement; the same field, following\nMaxwell's laws, eventually induces a magnetic field on cosmological scales.\nSince scalar perturbations do not generate any magnetic field as they are\ncurl-free, one has to resort to second-order perturbation theory to compute the\nmagnetic field generated by this effect.

A\ngeneral one-shot achievability bound for the precision of such an approximation\nis developed. Let $Q_{\\sf X|U}$ be a random transformation, $n$ be an integer,\nand $E\\in(0,+\\infty)$.

In this paper\nwe propose some generalized CG (GCG) methods for solving the\n$\\ell_1$-regularized (possibly not strongly) convex QP that terminate at an\noptimal solution in a finite number of iterations. At each iteration, our\nmethods first identify a face of an orthant and then either perform an exact\nline search along the direction of the negative projected minimum-norm\nsubgradient of the objective function or execute a CG subroutine that conducts\na sequence of CG iterations until a CG iterate crosses the boundary of this\nface or an approximate minimizer of over this face or a subface is found. We\ndetermine which type of step should be taken by comparing the magnitude of some\ncomponents of the minimum-norm subgradient of the objective function to that of\nits rest components. Our analysis on finite convergence of these methods makes\nuse of an error bound result and some key properties of the aforementioned\nexact line search and the CG subroutine. We also show that the proposed methods\nare capable of finding an approximate solution of the problem by allowing some\ninexactness on the execution of the CG subroutine. The overall arithmetic\noperation cost of our GCG methods for finding an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution\ndepends on $\\epsilon$ in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$, which is superior to the\naccelerated proximal gradient method [2,23] that depends on $\\epsilon$ in\n$O(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$.

This is also true for\nreactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting\nbut facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. This work\nconsiders hydrogen dissociation. Reliable molecular beam results are available\nfor this reaction at some copper surfaces. Heterogeneous catalysis by copper is\nsimulated. It was investigated in our previous work since it is in many ways a\nprototype metal presenting a close-packed surface here. These hydrogen\nmolecules are adsorbed at Cu(111) and fixed geometries on the dissociation\nreaction pathway for stretched and distant equilibrium H$_2$ are given by using\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations in a plane wave basis. The PBE\nwave-functions at these bond-lengths serve as trial input for Quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) simulations of the ground states to obtain highly accurate\ncorrelated results for the associated activation barriers indicating the\ncatalytic effect on this dissociation. This correlation varies as bonds\ndissociate, requiring its accurate evaluation. Finite size effects and\nfixed-node error are possible limitations to accuracy of this type of QMC\nstudy. We are able to limit fixed node error, using certain trial\nwave-functions. The finite size effect is considerable, although comparing two\nadsorbed geometries cancels about 90% with respect to clean surfaces.

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock\nfronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short\nadvection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing\naccretion-shock instability.

There is no indication of any\ndependence of the mass ratio on the X-ray morphology of the clusters,\nindicating that the hydrostatic masses are not strongly systematically affected\nby the dynamical state of the clusters. Overall, our results favour a small\nvalue of the so-called hydrostatic bias due to non-thermal pressure sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 15:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

However, if quantum\ngravity had a preferred reference frame, why would high energy processes enjoy\nsuch a high degree of Lorentz symmetry? While this is often considered as an\nargument against aether, here I provide three independent arguments for why\nperturbative unitarity (or weak coupling) of the Lorentz-violating effective\nfield theories put stringent constraints on possible observable violations of\nLorentz symmetry at high energies. In particular, the interaction with the\nscalar graviton in a consistent low-energy theory of gravity and a (radiatively\nand dynamically) stable cosmological framework, leads to these constraints. The\nviolation (quantified by the relative difference in maximum speed of\npropagation) is limited to $\\lesssim 10^{-10} E({\\rm eV})^{-4}$ (superseding\nall current empirical bounds), or the theory will be strongly coupled beyond\nmeV scale. The latter happens in extended Horava-Lifshitz gravities, as a\nresult of a previously ignored quantum anomaly. Finally, given that all\ncosmologically viable theories with significant Lorentz violation appear to be\nstrongly coupled beyond meV scale, we conjecture that, similar to color\nconfinement in QCD, or Vainshetin screening for massive gravity, high energy\ntheories (that interact with gravity) are shielded from Lorentz violation (at\nleast, up to the scale where gravity is UV-completed). In contrast, microwave\nor radio photons, cosmic background neutrinos, or gravitational waves may\nprovide more promising candidates for discovery of violations of Lorentz\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

These maps suggest that the field topology of tau Sco is\ncomprised of comparable contributions of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic\ncomponents. At the same time, we also found that available Stokes V\nobservations can be successfully fitted employing restricted harmonic\nexpansions, by either neglecting the toroidal field altogether or linking the\nradial and horizontal components of the poloidal field as required by the\nwidely used potential field extrapolation technique. These alternative\nmodelling approaches lead to a stronger and topologically more complex surface\nfield structure. The field distributions recovered with different ZDI options\ndiffer significantly, yielding indistinguishable Stokes V profiles but\ndifferent linear polarisation (Stokes Q and U) signatures.

In this paper, we present results demonstrating the failure of\nthese intuitive expectations. For example, we show how typical data processing\nbased on cubic expansions yields a value of \\varepsilon_0 underestimated by a\ntypical factor of about two. When compared to theoretical results of DFT\napproaches, which typically underestimate the HOMO-LUMO gap by a similar\nfactor, this may create the false impression of \"agreement\" with experiments in\nsituations where this is actually not the case. Further, such cubic expansions\nyield model parameter values dependent on the bias range width employed for\nfitting, which is unacceptable physically. Finally, we present an example\ndemonstrating that, counter-intuitively, the bias-induced change in the energy\nof an MO located much closer to an electrode can occur in a direction that is\nopposite to the change in the Fermi energy of that electrode. This is contrary\nto what one expects based on a \"lever rule\" argument, according to which the MO\n\"feels\" the local value of the electric potential, which is assumed to vary\nlinearly across the junction and is closer to the potential of the closer\nelectrode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 22:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

When a PEV needs to be charged, it\nselects a charging station by considering the charging prices, waiting times,\nand travel distances. Each charging station optimizes its charging price based\non the prediction of the PEVs' charging station selection decisions and the\nother station's pricing decision, in order to maximize its profit. To obtain\ninsights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a one-dimensional system\nwith two competing charging stations and Poisson arriving PEVs. We propose a\nmulti-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game model, in which the charging\nstations (leaders) announce their charging prices in Stage I, and the PEVs\n(followers) make their charging station selections in Stage II. We show that\nthere always exists a unique charging station selection equilibrium in Stage\nII, and such equilibrium depends on the charging stations' service capacities\nand the price difference between them. We then characterize the sufficient\nconditions for the existence and uniqueness of the pricing equilibrium in Stage\nI. We also develop a low complexity algorithm that efficiently computes the\npricing equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium of the two-stage\nStackelberg game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 22:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 01:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

Method: We have demonstrated\nthrough manufacture and testing of hybrid circuits that PWs can be used to\nproduce a variety of practical electronic circuits. A purality of different\napplications of PWs have been tested to show the universality of PWs in\nanalogue and digital electronics. Results: Voltage dividers can be produced\nusing a pair of PWs in series with an output voltage accurate to within 12%.\nPWs can also transmit analogue and digital data with a frequency of up to 19\nkHz, which with the addition of a buffer, can drive high current circuits.

Embedding the temporal\nslowness constraint in the stacked architecture makes the learned features\nrobust to complicated motion transformations, which is important for visual\nobject tracking. Then, given a target video sequence, we propose a domain\nadaptation module to online adapt the pre-learned features according to the\nspecific target object. The adaptation is conducted in both layers of the deep\nfeature learning module so as to include appearance information of the specific\ntarget object. As a result, the learned hierarchical features can be robust to\nboth complicated motion transformations and appearance changes of target\nobjects.

The higher $J_{sc}$ observed in these new dyes is explained by the\nfact that here, in contrast to N3, the excitation charge was effectively\ntransferred to the anchoring ligand. Furthermore, we have shown that the\ndifference dipole moment vectors of the ground and excited states can be used\nto determine the charge-transfer direction in an excitation process. Finally,\nthe different electron lifetimes observed in these dyes is explained by\ninvestigating the adsorption geometries and the relative orientations of iodine\nmolecules in different ``dye$\\cdots$I$_2$'' complexes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 08:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

For\nlearning only from an event's textual description, we first identify a general\nlearning framework and then study the impact of different design choices for\nvarious stages of this framework. For additionally learning from example\nvideos, when true positive training samples are scarce, we employ an extension\nof the Support Vector Machine that allows us to exploit ``related'' event\nvideos by automatically introducing different weights for subsets of the videos\nin the overall training set. Experimental evaluations performed on the\nlarge-scale TRECVID MED 2014 video dataset provide insight on the effectiveness\nof the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 12:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

The Standard Model prediction for the transverse-momentum\ndistribution in Higgs boson production through gluon fusion is augmented by\nthree new dimension-six operators, implying the modification of the top and\nbottom Yukawa couplings, and the inclusion of a point-like Higgs-gluon\ncoupling.

We reveal how\noxygen vacancies within the first atomic layer of the SrTiO3 surface (i) induce\na large antiferrodistortive motion of the oxygen octahedra at the surface, (ii)\ndrive localized magnetic moments on the Ti-3d orbitals close to the vacancies\nand (iii) form a two-dimensional electron gas localized within the first\nlayers. The analysis of the spin-texture of this system exhibits a splitting of\nthe energy bands according to the Zeeman interaction, lowering of the Ti-3dxy\nlevel in comparison with dxz and dyz and also an in-plane precession of the\nspins. No Rashba-like splitting for the ground state neither for ab-initio\nmolecular dynamics trajectory at 400K is recognized as suggested recently by A.\nF. Santander-Syro et al. [1].

A particular emphasis is given to the unique design of the CABS\nforce-field, which is largely defined using one-dimensional structural\nproperties of proteins, including protein secondary structure. This chapter\nalso presents CABS-based modeling methods, including multiscale tools for de\nnovo structure prediction, modeling of protein dynamics and prediction of\nprotein-peptide complexes.

Previous studies have\nmodelled the behaviour of strategic agents using supervised learning and\ntraditional reinforcement learning techniques, the latter using tabular\nrepresentations or learning with linear function approximation. In this study,\nwe apply DRL with a high-dimensional state space to the strategic board game of\nSettlers of Catan---where players can offer resources in exchange for others\nand they can also reply to offers made by other players. Our experimental\nresults report that the DRL-based learnt policies significantly outperformed\nseveral baselines including random, rule-based, and supervised-based\nbehaviours. The DRL-based policy has a 53% win rate versus 3 automated players\n(`bots'), whereas a supervised player trained on a dialogue corpus in this\nsetting achieved only 27%, versus the same 3 bots. This result supports the\nclaim that DRL is a promising framework for training dialogue systems, and\nstrategic agents with negotiation abilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 15:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-28"}

To\ntake the pulsar mass ranging from $1.0M_{\\odot}$ to $2.0M_{\\odot}$, we\ncalculate the central density, the core/crust radii, the core/crust mass, the\ncore/crustal thickness, the moment of inertia, and the crustal moment of\ninertia. Among them, the crustal moment of inertia could be effectively\nconstrained from the accumulated glitch observations, which has been a great\ndebate recently, known as \"glitch crisis\". Namely, superfluid neutrons\ncontained in the inner crust, which are regarded as the origin of the glitch in\nthe standard two-component model, could be largely entrained in the nuclei\nlattices, then there may not be enough superfluid neutrons ($\\sim 4/5$ less\nthan the previous value) to trigger the large glitches ($\\Delta \\nu/\\nu_0 \\sim\n10^{-6}$) in the Vela pulsar. We then provide the first analysis of the crisis\nbased on the microscopic basis, by confronting the glitch observations with the\ntheoretical calculations for the crustal moment of inertia. We find that\ndespite some recent opposition to the crisis argument, the glitch crisis is\nstill present, which means that besides the crust superfluid neutrons, core\nneutrons might be necessary for explaining the large glitches of the Vela\npulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 07:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-31"}

Taking advantage of\navailable resources, we have established a comprehensive database of black hole\n(and black hole candidate) X-ray binary (BHXB) activity between 1996 and 2015\nas revealed by all-sky instruments, scanning surveys, and select narrow-field\nX-ray instruments aboard the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\n(INTEGRAL), Monitor of All-Sky X-ray Image (MAXI), Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\n(RXTE), and Swift telescopes; the Whole-sky Alberta Time-resolved Comprehensive\nblack-Hole Database Of the Galaxy or WATCHDOG. Over the past two decades, we\nhave detected 132 transient outbursts, tracked and classified behavior\noccurring in 47 transient and 10 persistently accreting BHs, and performed a\nstatistical study on a number of outburst properties across the Galactic\npopulation. We find that outbursts undergone by BHXBs that do not reach the\nthermally dominant accretion state make up a substantial fraction ($\\sim$ 40%)\nof the Galactic transient BHXB outburst sample over the past $\\sim20$ years.\nOur findings suggest that this \"hard-only\" behavior, observed in transient and\npersistently accreting BHXBs, is neither a rare nor recent phenomenon and may\nbe indicative of an underlying physical process, relatively common among binary\nBHs, involving the mass-transfer rate onto the BH remaining at a low level\nrather than increasing as the outburst evolves. We discuss how the larger\nnumber of these \"hard-only\" outbursts and detected outbursts in general have\nsignificant implications for both the luminosity function and mass-transfer\nhistory of the Galactic BHXB population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 18:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Current algorithms lack\ncontrol of key network parameters, the ability to specify to what subgraphs a\nnode belongs to, come at a considerable complexity cost or, critically, sample\nfrom a limited ensemble of networks. To enable controlled investigations of the\nimpact and role of subgraphs, especially for epidemics, neuronal activity or\ncomplex contagion, it is essential that the generation process be versatile and\nthe generated networks as diverse as possible. In this paper, we present two\nnew network generation algorithms that use subgraphs as building blocks to\nconstruct networks preserving a given degree sequence. Additionally, these\nalgorithms provide control over clustering both at node and global level. In\nboth cases, we show that, despite being constrained by a degree sequence and\nglobal clustering, generated networks have markedly different topologies as\nevidenced by both subgraph prevalence and distribution around nodes, and\nlarge-scale network structure metrics such as path length and betweenness\nmeasures. Simulations of standard epidemic and complex contagion models on\nthose networks reveal that degree distribution and global clustering do not\nalways accurately predict the outcome of dynamical processes taking place on\nthem. We conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of both methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 11:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

This can be avoided by introducing a constraint\n$\\delta(\\sqrt{-g}) = 0$ to metric variations $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and then the\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ emerges as an integration constant. This is a\nremoval of one of the four constraints on initial conditions forced by EFE at\nthe birth of the universe, and it may imply that EFE are unnecessarily\nrestrictive about initial conditions. I then adopt a principle that the theory\nof gravity should be able to solve time evolution starting from arbitrary\ninhomogeneous initial conditions about spacetime and matter. The equations of\ngravitational fields satisfying this principle are obtained, by setting four\nauxiliary constraints on $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$ to extract six degrees of freedom\nfor gravity. The cost of achieving this is a loss of general covariance, but\nthese equations constitute a consistent theory if they hold in the special\ncoordinate systems that can be uniquely specified with respect to the initial\nspace-like hypersurface when the universe was born. This theory predicts that\ngravity is described by EFE with non-zero $\\Lambda$ in a homogeneous patch of\nthe universe created by inflation, but $\\Lambda$ changes continuously across\ndifferent patches. Then both the smallness and coincidence problems of the\ncosmological constant are solved by the anthropic argument.
