This paper is concerned with:\n(i) the global solution for this model, and, (ii) its fast adaptation limit to\nOthmer-Dunbar-Alt type model. This limit gives some insight to the molecular\norigin of the chemotaxis behaviour.\n  First, by using the Schauder fixed point theorem, the global existence of\nweak solution is proved based on detailed a priori estimates, under some quite\ngeneral assumptions on the model and the initial data. However, the Schauder\nfixed point theorem does not provide uniqueness. Therefore, additional analysis\nis required to be developed to obtain uniqueness.\n  Next, the fast adaptation limit of this model is derived by extracting a weak\nconvergence subsequence in measure space. For this limit, the first difficulty\nis to show the concentration effect on the internal state. When the small\nparameter {\\epsilon}, the adaptation time scale, goes to zero, we prove that\nthe solution converges to a Dirac mass in the internal state variable. Another\ndifficulty is the strong compactness argument on the chemical potential, which\nis essential for passing the nonlinear kinetic equation to the weak limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 16:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}

Magnetic reconnection at the computed null points cannot\nexplain all of the observed EIS upflow regions.

With the increasing availability of network\ndata that changes in time, it is important to extend such eigenvector-based\ncentrality measures to time-dependent networks. In this paper, we introduce a\nprincipled generalization of network centrality measures that is valid for any\neigenvector-based centrality. We consider a temporal network with N nodes as a\nsequence of T layers that describe the network during different time windows,\nand we couple centrality matrices for the layers into a supra-centrality matrix\nof size NTxNT whose dominant eigenvector gives the centrality of each node i at\neach time t. We refer to this eigenvector and its components as a joint\ncentrality, as it reflects the importances of both the node i and the time\nlayer t. We also introduce the concepts of marginal and conditional\ncentralities, which facilitate the study of centrality trajectories over time.\nWe find that the strength of coupling between layers is important for\ndetermining multiscale properties of centrality, such as localization phenomena\nand the time scale of centrality changes. In the strong-coupling regime, we\nderive expressions for time-averaged centralities, which are given by the\nzeroth-order terms of a singular perturbation expansion.

We leverage\nmultiple classical ML approaches, but develop 3 novel sets of features. Our\nWikipedia Vandal Behavior (WVB) approach uses a novel set of user editing\npatterns as features to classify some users as vandals. Our Wikipedia\nTransition Probability Matrix (WTPM) approach uses a set of features derived\nfrom a transition probability matrix and then reduces it via a neural net\nauto-encoder to classify some users as vandals. The VEWS approach merges the\nprevious two approaches. Without using any information (e.g. reverts) provided\nby other users, these algorithms each have over 85% classification accuracy.\nMoreover, when temporal recency is considered, accuracy goes to almost 90%. We\ncarry out detailed experiments on a new data set we have created consisting of\nabout 33K Wikipedia users (including both a black list and a white list of\neditors) and containing 770K edits. We describe specific behaviors that\ndistinguish between vandals and non-vandals. We show that VEWS beats ClueBot NG\nand STiki, the best known algorithms today for vandalism detection. Moreover,\nVEWS detects far more vandals than ClueBot NG and on average, detects them 2.39\nedits before ClueBot NG when both detect the vandal. However, we show that the\ncombination of VEWS and ClueBot NG can give a fully automated vandal early\nwarning system with even higher accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 20:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}

Our\napproach consists of augmenting the state and action space of the system with\ncontinuous-valued memory states that the policy can read from and write to.\nLearning general-purpose policies with this type of memory representation\ndirectly is difficult, because the policy must automatically figure out the\nmost salient information to memorize at each time step. We show that, by\ndecomposing this policy search problem into a trajectory optimization phase and\na supervised learning phase through a method called guided policy search, we\ncan acquire policies with effective memorization and recall strategies.\nIntuitively, the trajectory optimization phase chooses the values of the memory\nstates that will make it easier for the policy to produce the right action in\nfuture states, while the supervised learning phase encourages the policy to use\nmemorization actions to produce those memory states. We evaluate our method on\ntasks involving continuous control in manipulation and navigation settings, and\nshow that our method can learn complex policies that successfully complete a\nrange of tasks that require memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 20:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 04:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

Without assumptions on\nthe signal and the filter, BD does not admit a unique solution. In practice,\nsubspace or sparsity assumptions have shown the ability to reduce the search\nspace and yield the unique solution. However, existing theoretical analysis on\nuniqueness in BD is rather limited. In an earlier paper, we provided the first\nalgebraic sample complexities for BD that hold for almost all bases or frames.\nWe showed that for BD of a pair of vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, with subspace\nconstraints of dimensions $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, a sample complexity of\n$n\\geq m_1m_2$ is sufficient. This result is suboptimal, since the number of\ndegrees of freedom is merely $m_1+m_2-1$. We provided analogus results, with\nsimilar suboptimality, for BD with sparsity or mixed subspace and sparsity\nconstraints. In this paper, taking advantage of the recent progress on the\ninformation-theoretic limits of unique low-rank matrix recovery, we finally\nbridge this gap, and derive an optimal sample complexity result for BD with\ngeneric bases or frames. We show that for BD of an arbitrary pair (resp. all\npairs) of vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, with sparsity constraints of sparsity\nlevels $s_1$ and $s_2$, a sample complexity of $n > s_1+s_2$ (resp. $n >\n2(s_1+s_2)$) is sufficient. We also present analogous results for BD with\nsubspace constraints or mixed constraints, with the subspace dimension\nreplacing the sparsity level. Last but not least, in all the above scenarios,\nif the bases or frames follow a probabilistic distribution specified in the\npaper, the recovery is not only unique, but also stable against small\nperturbations in the measurements, under the same sample complexities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 00:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 09:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

The chemical composition of planets is an important constraint for\nplanet formation and subsequent differentiation. While theoretical studies try\nto derive the compositions of planets from planet formation models in order to\nlink the composition and formation process of planets, other studies assume\nthat the elemental ratios in the formed planet and in the host star are the\nsame.\n  Aims. Using a chemical model combined with a planet formation model, we aim\nto link the composition of stars with solar mass and luminosity with the\ncomposition of the hosted planets. For this purpose, we study the three most\nimportant elemental ratios that control the internal structure of a planet:\nFe/Si, Mg/Si, and C/O.\n  Methods. A set of 18 different observed stellar compositions was used to\ncover a wide range of these elemental ratios. The Gibbs energy minimization\nassumption was used to derive the composition of planets, taking stellar\nabundances as proxies for nebular abundances, and to generate planets in a\nself-consistent planet formation model. We computed the elemental ratios Fe/Si,\nMg/Si and C/O in three types of planets (rocky, icy, and giant planets) formed\nin different protoplanetary discs, and compared them to stellar abundances.\n  Results. We show that the elemental ratios Mg/Si and Fe/Si in planets are\nessentially identical to those in the star. Some deviations are shown for\nplanets that formed in specific regions of the disc, but the relationship\nremains valid within the ranges encompassed in our study.

In the Milky Way, most globular clusters are highly conspicuous\nobjects that were found centuries ago. However, a few dozen of them are faint,\nsparsely populated systems that were identified largely during the second half\nof the past century. One of the faintest is ESO 37-1 (E 3) and as such it\nremains poorly studied, with no spectroscopic observations published so far,\nalthough it was discovered in 1976.\n  Aims. We investigate the globular cluster E 3 in an attempt to better\nconstrain its fundamental parameters. Spectroscopy of stars in the field of E 3\nis shown here for the first time.\n  Methods. Deep, precise VI CCD photometry of E 3 down to V=26 mag is presented\nand analysed. Low-resolution, medium signal-to-noise ratio spectra of nine\ncandidate members are studied to derive radial velocity and metallicity. Proper\nmotions from the UCAC4 catalogue are used to explore the kinematics of the\nbright members of E 3.\n  Results. Isochrone fitting indicates that E 3 is probably very old, with an\nage of about 13 Gyr; its distance from the Sun is nearly 10 kpc. It is also\nsomewhat metal rich with [Fe/H]=-0.7. Regarding its kinematics, our tentative\nestimate for the proper motions is (-7.0+/-0.8, 3.5+/-0.3) mas/yr (or a\ntangential velocity of 382+/-79 km/s) and for the radial velocity is 45+/-5\nkm/s, in the solar rest frame.\n  Conclusions. E 3 is one of the most intriguing globular clusters in the\nGalaxy. Having an old age and being metal rich is clearly a peculiar\ncombination, only seen in a handful of objects like the far more conspicuous\nNGC 104 (47 Tucanae). In addition, its low luminosity and sparse population\nmake it a unique template for the study of the final evolutionary phases in the\nlife of a star cluster. Unfortunately, E 3 is among the most elusive and\nchallenging known globular clusters because field contamination severely\nhampers spectroscopic studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 08:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 06:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

Here, we point out that topological defects may trigger pulsar\nglitches within traditional scenarios, such as vortex unpinning.

Indeed,\nthe activation energy for such a process can be very small (essentially zero\ncompared with the observed increase in the pulsar's rotational kinetic energy\nat the onset of a glitch).

Among the space instruments devoted to gamma-ray\nastrophysics, AGILE uniquely exploits an analog readout system with dedicated\nelectronics coupled with Silicon detectors. We show the results of Monte Carlo\nsimulations carried out to reproduce the gamma-ray detection by the GRID, and\nwe compare them to in-flight data. We use the Crab (pulsar + Nebula) system for\ndiscussion of real data performance, since its E^{-2} energy spectrum is\nrepresentative of the majority of gamma-ray sources. For Crab-like spectrum\nsources, the GRID angular resolution (FWHM of ~4deg at 100 MeV; ~0.8deg at 1\nGeV; ~0.9deg integrating the full energy band from 100 MeV to tens of GeV) is\nstable across a large field of view, being characterized by a flat response up\nto 30deg off-axis. A comparison of the angular resolution obtained by the two\noperational gamma-ray instruments, AGILE-GRID and Fermi-LAT, is interesting in\nview of future gamma-ray missions, that are currently under study. The two\ninstruments exploit different detector configurations affecting the angular\nresolution: the former being optimized in the readout and track reconstruction\nespecially in the low-energy band, the latter in terms of converter thickness\nand power consumption. We show that, despite these differences, the angular\nresolution of both instruments is very similar between 100 MeV and a few GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 14:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Sampling the content of an Online Social Network (OSN) plays an\nimportant role as a knowledge discovery tool.\n  It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that current\nsampling methods must cope with a lack of a full sampling frame i.e., there is\nan imposed condition determined by a limited data access. In addition, another\nkey aspect to take into account is the huge amount of data generated by users\nof social networking services. This type of conditions make especially\ndifficult to develop sampling methods to collect truly reliable data.\nTherefore, we propose a low computational cost method for sampling emerging\nglobal trends on social networking services such as Twitter.\n  The main purpose of this study, is to develop a methodology able to carry out\nan efficient collecting process via three random generators: Brownian, Illusion\nand Reservoir. These random generators will be combined with a\nMetropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW) in order to improve the sampling\nprocess. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by correctly\nproviding a descriptive statistics of the collected data. In addition, we also\nsketch the collecting procedure on real-time carried out on Twitter.

In particular, the problem of selecting the k most\ncentral nodes with respect to this measure has been deeply analyzed in the last\ndecade. However, even for not very large networks, this problem is\ncomputationally intractable in practice: indeed, Abboud et al have recently\nshown that its complexity is strictly related to the complexity of the\nAll-Pairs Shortest Path (in short, APSP) problem, for which no subcubic\n\"combinatorial\" algorithm is known. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm\nfor selecting the k most closeness central nodes in a graph. In practice, this\nalgorithm significantly improves over the APSP approach, even though its\nworst-case time complexity is the same. For example, the algorithm is able to\ncompute the top k nodes in few dozens of seconds even when applied to\nreal-world networks with millions of nodes and edges.

We first describe\na number of very general classes of length equivalent manifolds, with as\nparticular cases isospectral manifolds, in each of the constructions starting\nfrom a given example that arises itself from the Gassman-Sunada method. The\nconstructions include the examples arising from the transplantation technique\n(and thus in particular the planar examples).

On the other hand, our\nproperties define physically irreducible pairs of length equivalent manifolds -\n\"atoms\" of general pairs of length equivalent manifolds, in that such a general\npair of manifolds is patched up out of irreducible pairs - and that is\nprecisely what simple groups are for general groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 11:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-09"}

We examine the evolution\nof the [Co III] 5892 A emission complex during the nebular phase for SNe Ia\nwith multiple nebular spectra and show that the line flux follows the square of\nthe mass of $^{56}$Co as a function of time. This result indicates both\nefficient local energy deposition from positrons produced in $^{56}$Co decay,\nand long-term stability of the ionization state of the nebula. We compile 77\nnebular spectra of 25 SN Ia from the literature and present 17 new nebular\nspectra of 7 SNe Ia, including SN2014J. From these we measure the flux in the\n[Co III] 5892 A line and remove its well-behaved time dependence to infer the\ninitial mass of $^{56}$Ni ($M_{Ni}$) produced in the explosion. We then examine\n$^{56}$Ni yields for different SN Ia ejected masses ($M_{ej}$ - calculated\nusing the relation between light curve width and ejected mass) and find the\n$^{56}$Ni masses of SNe Ia fall into two regimes: for narrow light curves (low\nstretch s~0.7-0.9), $M_{Ni}$ is clustered near $M_{Ni}$ ~ 0.4$M_\\odot$ and\nshows a shallow increase as $M_{ej}$ increases from ~1-1.4$M_\\odot$; at high\nstretch, $M_{ej}$ clusters at the Chandrasekhar mass (1.4$M_\\odot$) while\n$M_{Ni}$ spans a broad range from 0.6-1.2$M_\\odot$. This could constitute\nevidence for two distinct SN Ia explosion mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 00:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

The disk is considered to be\nsteady state and axi-symmetric. We define the boundary conditions at the pole\nand the equator of the disk and to avoid singularity at the rotation axis, the\ndisk is taken to be symmetric with respect to this axis. Moreover, only the $\n\\tau_{r \\phi} $ component of viscous stress tensor is assumed and we have set $\nv_{\\theta} = 0 $. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the\nvariation of dynamical quantities of the flow in the vertical direction by\nfinding an analytical solution. As a consequence, we found that the advection\nparameter, $ f^{adv} $, varies along the $ \\theta $ direction and reaches to\nits maximum near the rotation axis.
