The angelic nature of a choice\npertains to the property of avoiding failure whenever possible. As a concept,\nangelic choice first appeared in automata theory and Turing machines, where it\ncan be implemented via backtracking. It has traditionally been studied in the\nrefinement calculus, and has proved to be useful in a variety of applications\nand refinement techniques. Recently it has been studied within relational,\nmultirelational and higher-order models. It has been employed for modelling\nuser interactions, game-like scenarios, theorem proving tactics, constraint\nsatisfaction problems and control systems.\n  When the formal modelling of state-rich reactive systems is considered, it\nonly seems natural that both types of nondeterministic choice should be\nconsidered. However, despite several treatments of angelic nondeterminism in\nthe context of process algebras, namely Communicating Sequential Processes, the\ncounterpart to the angelic choice of the refinement calculus has been elusive.\n  In this thesis, we develop a semantics in the relational setting of Hoare and\nHe's Unifying Theories of Programming that enables the characterisation of\nangelic nondeterminism in CSP. Since CSP processes are given semantics in the\nUTP via designs, that is, pre and postcondition pairs, we first introduce a\ntheory of angelic designs, and an isomorphic multirelational model, that is\nsuitable for characterising processes. We then develop a theory of reactive\nangelic designs by enforcing the healthiness conditions of CSP. Finally, by\nintroducing a notion of divergence that can undo the history of events, we\nobtain a model where angelic choice avoids divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 17:21:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 11:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

In addition to Dressler's canonical\nrelations, we find that further refinements are possible when considering the\naverage local projected density of galaxies in a cluster. Firstly, the\ndistribution of ellipticals in a cluster depends on the relative local density\nof galaxies in that cluster: equivalent rises in the elliptical fraction occur\nat higher local densities for clusters with higher average local densities.\nThis is not true for the late-type fraction, where the variation with local\ndensity within a cluster is independent of the average local density of\ngalaxies in that cluster, and is as Dressler originally found. Furthermore, the\noverall ratio of ellipticals to early-types in a cluster does not depend on the\naverage density of galaxies in that cluster (unlike the ratio of lenticulars to\ndisk systems), and is fixed at around 30%. In the paradigm of fast and slow\nrotators, we show that such an elliptical fraction in the early-type population\nis consistent with a slow rotator fraction of 15% in the early-type population,\nusing the statistics of the ATLAS3D survey.

In the inner halo GCs, the star\nformation commenced and ceased earlier with relatively short formation\ntimescale between the subpopulations (~0.5 Gyr), while in the outer halo, the\nformation of G1 was delayed by ~0.8 Gyr with more extended timescale between G1\nand G2 (~1.4 Gyr).

To test the fidelity of\ngroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used\nin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic\nmanner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,\nand most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.\nHowever, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence\nof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite\ndesignation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo\ntransition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these\nerrors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct\ngalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), and\nto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red\ngalaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly\nrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as\nfunction of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic\nconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is\npresent. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from\ngroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running group\nfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on the\nHTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 20:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Traditionally,\nthe Arnason-Schwarz model has been fitted to such data where the state process\nis modeled as a first-order Markov chain, though second-order models have also\nbeen proposed and fitted to data. However, low-order Markov models may not\naccurately represent the underlying biology. For example, specifying a\n(time-independent) first-order Markov process assumes that the dwell time in\neach state (i.e., the duration of a stay in a given state) has a geometric\ndistribution, and hence that the modal dwell time is one. Specifying\ntime-dependent or higher-order processes provides additional flexibility, but\nat the expense of a potentially significant number of additional model\nparameters. We extend the Arnason-Schwarz model by specifying a semi-Markov\nmodel for the state process, where the dwell-time distribution is specified\nmore generally, using for example a shifted Poisson or negative binomial\ndistribution. A state expansion technique is applied in order to represent the\nresulting semi-Markov Arnason-Schwarz model in terms of a simpler and\ncomputationally tractable hidden Markov model. Semi-Markov Arnason-Schwarz\nmodels come with only a very modest increase in the number of parameters, yet\npermit a significantly more flexible state process. Model selection can be\nperformed using standard procedures, and in particular via the use of\ninformation criteria.

While there have been several gene signatures\nproposed in the literature to classify breast tumours, these signatures show\nvery low overlaps, different classification performance, and not much relevance\nto the underlying biology of these tumours. Here we evaluate DNA-damage\nresponse (DDR) and cell cycle pathways, which are critical pathways implicated\nin a considerable proportion of breast tumours, for their usefulness and\nability in breast tumour subtyping. We think that subtyping breast tumours\nbased on these two pathways could lead to vital insights into molecular\nmechanisms driving these tumours. Here, we performed a systematic evaluation of\nDDR and cell-cycle pathways for subtyping of breast tumours into the five known\nintrinsic subtypes. Homologous Recombination (HR) pathway showed the best\nperformance in subtyping breast tumours, indicating that HR genes are strongly\ninvolved in all breast tumours. Comparisons of pathway based signatures and two\nstandard gene signatures supported the use of known pathways for breast tumour\nsubtyping.

In distributed processing of\nfederated queries, we need methods and procedures to execute the query in an\noptimal manner. Most of the existing methods perform the optimization task\nbased on some statistical information, whereas the query processor does not\nhave precise statistical information about their properties, since the data\nsources are autonomous. When precise statistics are not available, the\npossibility of wrong estimations will highly increase, and may lead to\ninefficient execution of the query at runtime. Another problem of the existing\nmethods is that in the optimization phase, they assume that runtime conditions\nof query execution are stable, while the environment in which federated queries\nare executed over linked data is dynamic and non-predictable. By considering\nthese two problems, there is a great potential for exploiting the federated\nquery processing techniques in an adaptive manner. In this paper, an adaptive\nmethod is proposed for processing federated queries over linked data, based on\nthe concept of routing the tuples. The proposed method, named ADQUEX, is able\nto execute the query effectively without any prior statistical information.\nThis method can change the query execution plan at runtime so that less\nintermediate results are produced. It can also adapt the execution plan to new\nsituation if unpredicted network latencies arise. Extensive evaluation of our\nmethod by running real queries over well-known linked datasets shows very good\nresults especially for complex queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 05:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Random deployment is suitable for\napplications that require deployment over a wide and/or hostile area. During an\nobservation period, each sensor takes a local sample of the random field and\nreports the data to the closest data-gathering node if sufficient energy is\navailable for transmission.

Although many subsequent analyses can be performed\nwith the set of contigs, one may ask whether mapping reads on the contigs is as\ninformative as mapping them on the paths of the assembly graph. Currently, one\nlacks practical tools to perform mapping on such graphs.

We then proceed to consider the group of all automorphisms of the\ntree as a diffeological space, with respect to the functional diffeology,\nshowing that this diffeology is actually the discrete one, the fact that\ntherefore is true for its subgroups as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 09:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 12:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

The trivial path is stabilized by\nsupergravity corrections and supports a first stage of inflation with a limited\nnumber of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio can become appreciable while\nthe value of the scalar spectral index remains acceptable as a result of the\ncompetition between the relatively mild supergravity corrections and the strong\nradiative corrections to the inflationary potential.

This light ring is generated from a non-homogeneously\npolarized input light beam obtained by using a spatially inhomogeneous\npolarizer that mimics the characteristic CR polarization distribution. This\npolarizer allows modulating the relative intensity between the two CR light\ncones in accordance with the recently proposed dual--cone model of the CR\nphenomenon.

Large computer\nsystems in general, and data centers in particular, will ultimately be managed\nusing predictive computational and executable models obtained through\ndata-science tools, and at that point, the intervention of humans will be\nlimited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing\nlow-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are\nbased on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using generated\ndata, opens one possible path towards limiting the role of operators in data\ncenters. In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google\ndataset collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and\nevaluating a predictive model for node failures. We use BigQuery, the big data\nSQL platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data\nand generate a rich feature set characterizing machine state over time. We\ndescribe how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest\nclassifiers each trained on these features, to predict if machines will fail in\na future 24-hour window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive\nrates to 5%, we can achieve true positive rates between 27% and 88% with\nprecision varying between 50% and 72%.

Besides flexibility and accuracy, a key\nbenefit of these models is their interpretability: the transfer functions\nprovide visual means for inspecting the models and identifying domain-specific\nrelations between inputs and outputs. However, in large-scale problems\ninvolving the prediction of many related tasks, learning independently additive\nmodels results in a loss of model interpretability, and can cause overfitting\nwhen training data is scarce. We introduce a novel multi-task learning approach\nwhich provides a corpus of accurate and interpretable additive models for a\nlarge number of related forecasting tasks. Our key idea is to share transfer\nfunctions across models in order to reduce the model complexity and ease the\nexploration of the corpus. We establish a connection with sparse dictionary\nlearning and propose a new efficient fitting algorithm which alternates between\nsparse coding and transfer function updates. The former step is solved via an\nextension of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, whose properties are analyzed using a\nnovel recovery condition which extends existing results in the literature. The\nlatter step is addressed using a traditional dictionary update rule.\nExperiments on real-world data demonstrate that our approach compares favorably\nto baseline methods while yielding an interpretable corpus of models, revealing\nstructure among the individual tasks and being more robust when training data\nis scarce.

The\ndetected yield of photoassociated magnesium dimers was enhanced by positively\nchirped pulses which is explained theoretically by a combination of\npurification and chirp-dependent Raman transitions. The yield could be further\nenhanced by pulse optimization resulting in pulses with an effective linear\nchirp and a sub-pulse structure, where the latter allows for exploiting\nvibrational coherences.

The public goods game (PGG) is a\nparadigm for exploring cooperative behavior. In PGG, the total resulting payoff\nis divided equally among all participants. This feature still leads to the\ndominance of defection without substantially magnifying the public good by a\nmultiplying factor. Much effort has been made to explain the evolution of\ncooperative strategies, including a recent model in which only a portion of the\ntotal benefit is shared by all the players through introducing a new strategy\nnamed persistent cooperation. A persistent cooperator is a contributor who is\nwilling to pay a second cost to retrieve the remaining portion of the payoff\ncontributed by themselves. In a previous study, this model was analyzed in the\nframework of well-mixed populations. This paper focuses on discussing the\npersistent cooperation in lattice-structured populations. The evolutionary\ndynamics of the structured populations consisting of three types of competing\nplayers (pure cooperators, defectors and persistent cooperators) are revealed\nby theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In particular, the\napproximate expressions of fixation probabilities for strategies are derived on\none-dimensional lattices. The phase diagrams of stationary states, the\nevolution of frequencies and spatial patterns for strategies are illustrated on\nboth one-dimensional and square lattices by simulations. Our results are\nconsistent with the general observation that, at least in most situations, a\nstructured population facilitates the evolution of cooperation. Specifically,\nhere we find that the existence of persistent cooperators greatly suppresses\nthe spreading of defectors under more relaxed conditions in structured\npopulations compared to that obtained in well-mixed population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 13:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-15"}

To improve\non the state of the art of keyword searches from annotations, methods for\ncontent-based retrieval have been proposed. In the context of gene expression\nexperiments, most methods retrieve gene expression profiles, requiring each\nexperiment to be expressed as a single profile, typically of case vs. control.\nA more general, recently suggested alternative is to retrieve experiments whose\nmodels are good for modelling the query dataset. However, for very noisy and\nhigh-dimensional query data, this retrieval criterion turns out to be very\nnoisy as well.\n  Results: We propose doing retrieval using a denoised model of the query\ndataset, instead of the original noisy dataset itself. To this end, we\nintroduce a general probabilistic framework, where each experiment is modelled\nseparately and the retrieval is done by finding related models. For retrieval\nof gene expression experiments, we use a probabilistic model called product\npartition model, which induces a clustering of genes that show similar\nexpression patterns across a number of samples. The suggested metric for\nretrieval using clusterings is the normalized information distance. Empirical\nresults finally suggest that inference for the full probabilistic model can be\napproximated with good performance using computationally faster heuristic\nclustering approaches (e.g. $k$-means). The method is highly scalable and\nstraightforward to apply to construct a general-purpose gene expression\nexperiment retrieval method.\n  Availability: The method can be implemented using standard clustering\nalgorithms and normalized information distance, available in many statistical\nsoftware packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 14:21:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 11:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 09:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 15:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

It is known that under the property of\nquasimonotonicity time-delayed systems become monotone, and some remarkable\nproperties have been reported for such systems. These include, for example, the\nfact that for linear systems global asymptotic stability of the undelayed\nsystem implies global asymptotic stability for the delayed system under\narbitrary bounded delays. Nevertheless, extensions to nonlinear systems have\nthus far relied primarily on the conditions of homogeneity and subhomogeneity,\nand it has been conjectured that these can be relaxed. Our aim in this paper is\nto show that this is feasible for a general class of nonlinear monotone systems\nby deriving convergence results in which simple properties of the undelayed\nsystem lead to delay-independent stability. In particular, one of our results\nshows that if the undelayed system has a convergent trajectory that is\nunbounded in all components as $t \\to -\\infty$, then the system is globally\nasymptotically stable for arbitrary bounded time-varying delays. This follows\nfrom a more general result derived in the paper that allows to quantify\ndelay-independent regions of attraction, which can be used to prove global\nasymptotic stability for various classes of systems. These also recover various\nknown delay-independent stability results that are discussed within the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 14:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Many attempts to solve (or to dissolve) it have been made\nsince the inception of quantum mechanics. The form of these attempts depends on\nthe philosophical position that their authors endorse. I will review some of\nthem and analyze their relevance. The phenomenon of decoherence is often\npresented as a solution lying inside the pure quantum formalism and not\ndemanding any particular philosophical assumption. Nevertheless, a widely\ndebated question is to decide between two different interpretations. The first\none is to consider that the decoherence process has the effect to actually\nproject a superposed state into one of its classically interpretable component,\nhence doing the same job as the reduction postulate. For the second one,\ndecoherence is only a way to show why no macroscopic superposed state can be\nobserved, so explaining the classical appearance of the macroscopic world,\nwhile the quantum entanglement between the system, the apparatus and the\nenvironment never disappears. In this case, explaining why only one single\ndefinite outcome is observed remains to do. In this paper, I examine the\narguments that have been given for and against both interpretations and defend\na new position, the \"Convivial Solipsism\" , according to which the outcome that\nis observed is relative to the observer, different but in close parallel to the\nEverett's interpretation and sharing also some similarities with Rovelli's\nrelational interpretation and quantum bayesianism.

Equivalent results\nwere obtained by Musser in his 2011 thesis.\n  The authors of the above papers simply referred to the constants as the\nLaurent coefficients which explains why various electronic searches conducted\nby this author for Stieltjes constants did not readily highlight these\nparticular sources.\n  In this paper the author has employed a slightly different argument to obtain\na simpler expression for the results originally derived by Chakraborty et al.\nin 2009.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 13:51:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 10:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In other words, this paper defines and solves for geodesics directly on\nthe shape space and avoids complications resulting from the quotient operation.\nThis comprehensive framework is invariant to arbitrary parameterizations of\nsurfaces along paths, a phenomenon termed as gauge invariance.

The spacing between layers is of the order\nof the wavelength, therefore Bragg effects such as band-gaps appear. We show\nthat the interplay between strong dispersion and nonlinearity leads to new\nscenarios of wave propagation. The classical waveform distortion process\ntypical of intense acoustic waves in homogeneous media can be strongly altered\nwhen nonlinearly generated harmonics lie inside or close to band gaps. This\nallows the possibility of engineer a medium in order to get a particular\nwaveform.
