We find a complex interplay of ferroelectric, antiferroelectric\nand antiferrodistortive degrees of freedom that leads to an unusually rich\nelectrical phase diagram, which strongly departs from the paradigmatic\ndouble-well model of simpler ferroelectric materials. In particular, we show\nthat many of the structural phases that were recently reported in the\nliterature, e.g. those characterized by a giant aspect ratio, can be accessed\nvia application of an external electric field starting from the $R3c$ ground\nstate.

The overall population consists\nof two genders, however, which have different income distributions. The\ndifference between incomes earned by male and female population has been\nexperiencing dramatic changes over time. Here, we model the internal dynamics\nof men and women PIDs separately and then describe their relative contribution\nto the overall PID. Our original model is refined to match all principal\ngender-dependent observations. We found that women in the U.S. are deprived of\nhigher job positions. This is the cause of the long term income inequality\nbetween males and females in the U.S. It is unjust to women and has a negative\neffect on real economic growth. Women have been catching up since the 1960s and\nthat improves the performance of the U.S. economy. It will take decades,\nhowever, to full income equality between genders. There are no new defining\nparameters included in the model except the critical age, when people start to\nlose their incomes, was split into two critical ages for low-middle incomes and\nthe highest incomes, which obey a power law distribution. Such an extension\nbecomes necessary in order to match the observation that the female population\nin the earlier 1960s was practically not represented in the highest incomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 18:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

The XMM-Newton soft\nX-ray response allows us to detail the disc variability. At low-frequencies\n(long time scales) the disc component always leads the power law component. On\nthe other hand, a soft reverberation lag (ascribable to thermal reprocessing)\nis always detected at high-frequencies (short time scales). The intrinsic\namplitude of the reverberation lag decreases as the source luminosity and the\ndisc-fraction increase.

In this letter, I show that a combined measurement of\nthe primordial deuterium abundance and the primordial helium isotope ratio has\nthe potential to provide a complementary and reliable probe of new physics\nbeyond the standard model. Using the recent determination of the primordial\ndeuterium abundance and assuming that the measured pre-solar 3He/4He meteoritic\nabundance reflects the primordial value, a bound can be placed on the effective\nnumber of neutrino species, Neff(BBN) = 3.01 (+0.95 -0.76, with 95 per cent\nconfidence). Although this value of Neff supports the standard model, it is\npresently unclear if the pre-solar 3He/4He ratio reflects the primordial value.\nNew astrophysical measurements of the helium isotope ratio in near-pristine\nenvironments, together with updated calculations and experimental values of\nseveral important nuclear reactions (some of which are already being\nattempted), will lead to much improved limits on possible departures from the\nstandard model. To this end, I describe an analysis strategy to measure the 3He\nI flux emitted from nearby low metallicity H II regions.

In the case of BHs found in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) the\nobserved values are in agreement with some theoretical predictions based on\nbinary stellar evolution. However, using the same evolutionary models, the\ncalculated spins of BHs in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) fall short compared\nto the observations. A possible solution to this conundrum is the accretion of\nhigh-specific-angular-momentum material after the formation of the BH, although\nthis requires accretion above the Eddington limit. Another suggestion is that\nthe observed high values of the BHs spin could be the result of an asymmetry\nduring Core Collapse (CC). The only available energy to spin up the compact\nobject during CC is its binding energy. A way to convert it to rotational\nkinetic energy is by using a Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI), which\ncan develop during CC and push angular momentum into the central compact object\nthrough a spiral mode ($m = 1$). Here we study the CC-SASI scenario and\ndiscuss, in the case of LMXBs and HMXBs, the limits for the spin of a\nstellar-mass BHs. Our results predict a strong dichotomy in the maximum spin of\nlow-mass compact objects and massive BHs found in HMXBs. The maximum spin value\n($|a_\\star|$) for a compact object near the mass boundary between BHs and NSs\nis found to be somewhere between 0.27 and 0.38, depending on whether secular or\ndynamical instabilities limit the efficiency of the spin up process.

However,\nthis one-to-one mapping between transceivers and antennas will dramatically\nincrease the cost and complexity of a large phased antenna array system.\n  In this paper, firstly we propose a \\emph{partially adaptive} beamformer\narchitecture where a reduced number of transceivers with a digital beamformer\n(DBF) is connected to an increased number of antennas through an RF beamforming\nnetwork (RFBN). Then, based on the proposed architecture, we present a\nmethodology to derive the minimum number of transceivers that are required for\nmarco-cell and small-cell base stations, respectively. Subsequently, in order\nto achieve optimal beampatterns with given cellular standard requirements and\nRF operational constraints, we propose efficient algorithms to jointly design\nDBF and RFBN. Starting from the proposed algorithms, we specify generic\nmicrowave RFBNs for optimal marco-cell and small-cell networks. In order to\nverify the proposed approaches, we compare the performance of RFBN using\nsimulations and anechoic chamber measurements. Experimental measurement results\nconfirm the robustness and performance of the proposed hybrid DBF-RFBN concept\neventually ensuring that theoretical multi-antenna capacity and coverage are\nachieved at a little incremental cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 21:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

IPS join is well understood when\nvectors are normalized and some approximation of inner products is allowed.\nHowever, the general case where vectors may have any length appears much more\nchallenging. Recently, new upper bounds based on asymmetric locality-sensitive\nhashing (ALSH) and asymmetric embeddings have emerged, but little has been\nknown on the lower bound side. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of\ninner product similarity join, showing new lower and upper bounds.

How the limitation to 2D affects energy dissipation\nremains unclear. This work provides a model of comparison between two- and\nthree-dimensional (3D) plasma turbulence using gyrokinetic simulations; it also\nexplores the dynamics of distribution functions during the dissipation process.\nIt is found that both 2D and 3D nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of a low-beta\nplasma generate electron velocity-space structures with the same\ncharacteristics as that of linear Landau damping of Alfv\\'en waves in a 3D\nlinear simulation. The continual occurrence of the velocity-space structures\nthroughout the turbulence simulations suggests that the action of Landau\ndamping may be responsible for the turbulent energy transfer to electrons in\nboth 2D and 3D, and makes possible the subsequent irreversible heating of the\nplasma through collisional smoothing of the velocity-space fluctuations.\nAlthough, in the 2D case where variation along the equilibrium magnetic field\nis absent, it may be expected that Landau damping is not possible, a common\ntrigonometric factor appears in the 2D resonant denominator, leaving the\nresonance condition unchanged from the 3D case.

In the cooperative mode, the PU employs the\nSU to relay its information by providing monetary incentives and the SU splits\nits energy for forwarding the PU's information as well as transmitting its own\ninformation. Optimization problems are respectively formulated for both\noperation modes, which constitute a Stackelberg game with the PU as a leader\nand the SU as a follower. We analyze the Stackelberg game by deriving solutions\nto the optimization problems and the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) is\nsubsequently obtained. Simulation results show that the performance of the\nStackelberg game can approach that of the centralized optimization scheme when\nthe distance between the SU and its receiver is large enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 23:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

From the Bayesian point of view, Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo methods provide a way to draw inferences from these models. In\nparticular, when the number of subpopulations is considered unknown, more\nsophisticated methods are required to perform Bayesian analysis. The Reversible\nJump Markov Chain Monte Carlo is an alternative method for computing the\nposterior distribution by simulation in this case. Some problems associated\nwith the Bayesian analysis of these class of models are frequent, such as the\nso-called \"label-switching\" problem. However, as the level of heterogeneity in\nthe population increases, these problems are expected to become less frequent\nand the model's performance to improve. Thus, the aim of this work is to\nevaluate the normal mixture model fit using simulated data under different\nsettings of heterogeneity and prior information about the mixture proportions.\nA simulation study is also presented to evaluate the model's performance\nconsidering the number of components known and estimating it. Finally, the\nmodel is applied to a censored real dataset containing antibody levels of\nCytomegalovirus in individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 03:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 15:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

The current paradigm represents a\nroad network as a graph, assigns weights to the graph's edges by fragmenting\ntrajectories into small pieces that fit the underlying edges, and then applies\na routing algorithm to the resulting graph. We propose a new paradigm that\ntargets more accurate and more efficient estimation of the costs of paths by\nassociating weights with sub-paths in the road network. The paper provides a\nsolution to a foundational problem in this paradigm, namely that of computing\nthe time-varying cost distribution of a path.\n  The solution consists of several steps. We first learn a set of random\nvariables that capture the joint distributions of sub-paths that are covered by\nsufficient trajectories. Then, given a departure time and a path, we select an\noptimal subset of learned random variables such that the random variables'\ncorresponding paths together cover the path. This enables accurate joint\ndistribution estimation of the path, and by transferring the joint distribution\ninto a marginal distribution, the travel cost distribution of the path is\nobtained. The use of multiple learned random variables contends with data\nsparseness, the use of multi-dimensional histograms enables compact\nrepresentation of arbitrary joint distributions that fully capture the travel\ncost dependencies among the edges in paths. Empirical studies with substantial\ntrajectory data from two different cities offer insight into the design\nproperties of the proposed solution and suggest that the solution is effective\nin real-world settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 08:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 07:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 01:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

This is then related to the\nphotodisintegration cross section of $^{16}$N($\\gamma, n$)$^{15}$N and\nsubsequently invoking the principle of detailed balance, the $^{15}$N($n,\n\\gamma$)$^{16}$N capture cross section is calculated.\n  Results : The non-resonant capture cross section is calculated with\nspectroscopic factors from the shell model and those extracted (including\nuncertainties) from two recent experiments. The data seems to favor a more\nsingle particle nature for the low-lying states of $^{16}$N. The total neutron\ncapture rate is also calculated by summing up non-resonant and resonant\n(significant only at temperatures greater than 1 GK) contributions and\ncomparison is made with other charged particle capture rates.

We show that transverse motion results in a quartic\ndisplacement term in transverse direction as the first non-vanishing term in\nthe potential energy. This results in solution of a composite longitudinal\nmotion superimposed by a transverse motion propagating along the length\ndirection identified as a plane polarized phonons. Interestingly, solutions of\nthe quartic nonlinear equation have been expressed accurately, though\napproximately in terms of sinusoidal solutions by modifying the periodicity of\nsin function. The phonons along the transverse direction, now with a weakened\nfrequency compared to the longitudinal has interesting impact- it gives rise to\nnegative Gruneisen parameter with a value of -1 and is responsible for negative\nthermal expansion in the low temperature regime. Similar results of graphene\nsheet based on consideration of transverse (surface ripple like) modes to the\nplanar direction, provides explanation to the observed negative thermal\nexpansion in low temperature regime. The concept of plane polarized phonons\nseems new and interesting.

Some aspects of quantum decoherence for the quantum harmonic\noscillator and for the free particle limit are also quantified through the\nShannon entropy. For the gravitational quantum well, the effect of a\nmagnetic-like field on the quantum fidelity is suppressed by the linear term of\nthe gravitational potential. To conclude, one identifies a fine formal\nconnection of the quantum decoherence aspects discussed here with the\nnoncommutative quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 13:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

Up to now, many state-of-the-art Poisson denoising techniques\nmainly concentrate on achieving utmost performance, with little consideration\nfor the computation efficiency. Therefore, in this study we aim to propose an\nefficient Poisson denoising model with both high computational efficiency and\nrecovery quality. To this end, we exploit the newly-developed trainable\nnonlinear reaction diffusion model which has proven an extremely fast image\nrestoration approach with performance surpassing recent state-of-the-arts. We\nretrain the model parameters, including the linear filters and influence\nfunctions by taking into account the Poisson noise statistics, and end up with\nan optimized nonlinear diffusion model specialized for Poisson denoising. The\ntrained model provides strongly competitive results against state-of-the-art\napproaches, meanwhile bearing the properties of simple structure and high\nefficiency. Furthermore, our proposed model comes along with an additional\nadvantage, that the diffusion process is well-suited for parallel computation\non GPUs. For images of size $512 \\times 512$, our GPU implementation takes less\nthan 0.1 seconds to produce state-of-the-art Poisson denoising performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 13:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

The cytoskeleton assembly activity is provided by the binding\ncofactors GTP (guanidine triphosphate) or ATP(adenosine triphosphate) to\nmonomeric protein, and is initiated by assembling the monomeric proteins. The\nbinding GTP or ATP is hydrolyzed to GDP (guanidine diphosphate) or ADP\n(adenosine diphosphate) by the monomeric enzymatic activity. This self-limited\nassembly is characteristic of the cytoskeleton. To quantitatively evaluate the\nassembly kinetics, we propose a nonlinear and non-equilibrium kinetic model,\nwith the nonlinearity provided by the fluctuation in monomer concentrations\nduring the diffusion. Numerical simulations suggest that the assembly and\ndisassembly oscillates in a chaos-like manner. We use a kinetic analysis of the\ncenter manifold around the critical point to show that minimal increases in\nATP/GTP concentrations may lead to some attenuation in the amplification of\nthese fluctuations. The present model and our application of center manifold\ntheory illustrate a unique feature of protein assemblies, and our stability\nanalysis provides an analytical methodology for the biological reaction system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 15:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

We\nfind that the gravitational waves propagate much faster than the speed of light\nunless these models are small perturbations of cubic Galileons and the Galileon\nenergy density is sub-dominant to a dominant cosmological constant. In this\ncase, the binary pulsar bounds on the speed of gravitational waves can be\nsatisfied and the equation of state can be close to -1 when the coupling to\nmatter and the coefficient of the cubic term of the Galileon Lagrangian are\nrelated. This severely restricts the allowed cosmological behaviour of Galileon\nmodels and we are forced to conclude that Galileons with a stable Minkowski\nlimit cannot account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the\nuniverse on their own. Moreover any sub-dominant Galileon component of our\nuniverse must be dominated by the cubic term. For such models with gravitons\npropagating faster than the speed of light, the gravitons become potentially\nunstable and could decay into photon pairs. They could also emit photons by\nCerenkov radiation. We show that the decay rate of such speedy gravitons into\nphotons and the Cerenkov radiation are in fact negligible.
