Most studies of the particle diffusion presuppose a scale\nseparation between the mean and random magnetic fields (e.g., there being a\npronounced minimum in the magnetic power spectrum at intermediate scales).\nScale separation is often a good approximation in laboratory plasmas, but not\nin most astrophysical environments such as the interstellar medium (ISM).\nModern simulations of the ISM have numerical resolution of order 1 pc, so the\nLarmor radius of the cosmic rays that dominate in energy density is at least\n$10^{6}$ times smaller than the resolved scales. Large-scale simulations of\ncosmic ray propagation in the ISM thus rely on oversimplified forms of the\ndiffusion tensor. We take the first steps towards a more realistic description\nof cosmic ray diffusion for such simulations, obtaining direct estimates of the\ndiffusion tensor from test particle simulations in random magnetic fields (with\nthe Larmor radius scale being fully resolved), for a range of particle energies\ncorresponding to $10^{-2}\\lesssim R_L/l_c \\lesssim 10^{3}$, where $l_c$ is the\nmagnetic correlation length.

The amplification\noccurs upon the stimulated interlayer electron tunneling accompanied by the\nemission of a coherent plasmon. The quantum-mechanical calculations of the\nnon-local high-frequency tunnel conductivity show that a relative smallness of\nthe tunneling exponent can be compensated by a strong resonance due to the\nenhanced tunneling between electron states with collinear momenta in the\nneighboring graphene layers. With the optimal selection of the barrier layer,\nthe surface plasmon gain due to the inelastic tunneling can compensate or even\nexceed the loss due to both Drude and interband absorption. The tunneling\nemission of the surface plasmons is robust against a slight twist of the\ngraphene layers and might explain the electroluminescence from the\ntunnel-coupled graphene layers observed in the recent experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 20:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

Typically, one quantifies the success of a mutant strategy via the\nprobability that a randomly occurring mutant will fixate in the population.\nHowever, in a structured population, this fixation probability may depend on\nwhere the mutant arises. Moreover, the fixation probability is just one\nquantity by which one can measure the success of a mutant; fixation time, for\ninstance, is another. We define a notion of homogeneity for evolutionary games\nthat captures what it means for two single-mutant states, i.e. two\nconfigurations of a single mutant in an otherwise-monomorphic population, to be\n\"evolutionarily equivalent\" in the sense that all measures of evolutionary\nsuccess are the same for both configurations. Using asymmetric games, we argue\nthat the term \"homogeneous\" should apply to the evolutionary process as a whole\nrather than to just the population structure. For evolutionary matrix games in\ngraph-structured populations, we give precise conditions under which the\nresulting process is homogeneous. Finally, we show that asymmetric matrix games\ncan be reduced to symmetric games if the population structure possesses a\nsufficient degree of symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 20:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

More recently multivariate variants of these processes have\nbeen in the focus of research with attention given to methods seeking an\nefficient and economic estimation of a large number of model parameters. Due to\nthe need for estimation of many parameters, however, these models may not be\nsuitable for modeling now prevalent high-frequency volatility data. One\npotentially useful way to bypass these issues is to take a functional approach.\nIn this paper, theory is developed for a new functional version of the\ngeneralized autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic process, termed\nfGARCH. The main results are concerned with the structure of the fGARCH(1,1)\nprocess, providing criteria for the existence of a strictly stationary\nsolutions both in the space of square-integrable and continuous functions. An\nestimation procedure is introduced and its consistency verified. A small\nempirical study highlights potential applications to intraday volatility\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2015 06:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 05:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-18"}

Majority of the\nconventional video coding schemes are based on hybrid model, which requires\ncomplex operations like transform coding (DCT), motion estimation and\ndeblocking filter at the encoder. Complexity of the proposed encoder is reduced\nby replacing those complex operations by 3-D DWT and CS at the encoder. The\nproposed architecture uses 3-D DWT to enable the scalability with levels of\nwavelet decomposition and also to exploit the spatial and the temporal\nredundancies. CS provides the good error resilience and coding efficiency. At\nthe first stage of the proposed architecture for encoder, 3-D DWT has been\napplied (Lifting based 2-D DWT in spatial domain and Haar wavelet in temporal\ndomain) on each frame of the group of frames (GOF), and in the second stage CS\nmodule exploits the sparsity of the wavelet coefficients. Small set of linear\nmeasurements are extracted by projecting the sparse 3-D wavelet coefficients\nonto random Bernoulli matrix at the encoder. Compared with the best existing\n3-D DWT architectures, the proposed architecture for 3-D DWT requires less\nmemory and provide high throughput.

In the\nproposed approach, the $M$ input integer data streams are linearly superimposed\nto form $M$ numerically entangled integer data streams that are stored in-place\nof the original inputs. A series of LSB operations can then be performed\ndirectly using these entangled data streams. The output results can be\nextracted from any $M-1$ entangled output streams by additions and arithmetic\nshifts, thereby guaranteeing robustness to a fail-stop failure in any single\nstream computation.

Thick discs\nmight have formed either at high redshift on a short time-scale or might have\nbeen built slowly over time. They may have an internal or an external origin.\nHere we study in detail the kinematics and the stellar populations of the thick\ndisc of ESO533-4. ESO533-4 is a nearby bulgeless galaxy.\n  We present the first ever IFU study of an edge-on galaxy with enough depth to\nstudy the thick disc. We exposed ESO533-4 with VIMOS@VLT for 6.5hours. The FOV\ncovered an axial extent 0.1-0.7r_25 (1-7kpc). We used pPXF and the MILES\nlibrary to obtain velocity and stellar population maps. We compared our\nkinematic data with simple GADGET-2 models.\n  The apparent rotational lag of the thick disc of ESO533-4 is compatible with\nthat expected from the combinations of two effects: differential asymmetric\ndrift and the projection effects arising from studying a disc a few degrees\n(2-3) away from edge-on. Thus, ESO533-4 contains little or no retrograde\nmaterial. This is compatible with three formation scenarii: the secular heating\nof an initially thin disc, the formation of the thick disc at high redshift in\na turbulent disc phase, and its creation in a major merger event. If happening\nin all galaxies, this last mechanism would cause retrograde thick discs in half\nof them. Retrograde discs have not been observed in the five massive disc\ngalaxies (v_c>120km s^-1) for which thick disc kinematics are known. The\npopulations of the thin and the thick discs are separated in the\nAge-log(Z/Z_Sun) plane. Thus, the thin and thick discs are made of two distinct\nstellar populations. Although the stellar population results are not conclusive\ndue to the high dust extinction in ESO533-4, they do not favour a secular\nevolution origin for the thick disc.

Using a combination of classical Monte-Carlo simulation and\nspin-wave theory, we uncover behaviour reminiscent of some widely-studied\nfrustrated antiferromagnets, but with a number of new twists.

They may\njeopardize statistical inference of the model of interest, if the missing\nmechanism is nonignorable, that is, the missing mechanism depends on the\nmissing values themselves even conditional on the observed data. With a\nnonignorable missing mechanism, the model of interest is often not identifiable\nwithout imposing further assumptions. We find that even if the missing\nmechanism has a known parametric form, the model is not identifiable without\nspecifying a parametric outcome distribution. Although it is fundamental for\nvalid statistical inference, identifiability under nonignorable missing\nmechanisms is not established for many commonly-used models.
