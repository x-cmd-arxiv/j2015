For some astrophysical\nobjects we find that the corrected black-body potential is greater than the\nflat case, showing that this kind of correction can be quite relevant when\ncurved spaces are considered. Then we consider four cases: The Schwarzschild\nspacetime, the global monopole, the non-relativistic infinity cylinder and the\nstatic cosmic string.

We apply the found results to a typical neutron star and\nto the Sun. For the global monopole, the modification in the black-body\npotential is of topological nature and it is due to the central solid angle\ndeficit that occurs in the spacetime generated by that object. In the\ncylindrical case, which is locally flat, no gravitational correction to the\ntemperature exists, as in the global monopole case.

Our\nsimulations, in contrast, exhibit a stronger relationship, and show that\nprevious work was box-size limited: turbulent `eddies' were artificially\nrestricted by the numerical domain rather than by the scale height.\nZero-net-flux runs without physical diffusion coefficients yield a stress\nproportional to $P^{0.5}$, where P is pressure.

In summary, compressibility is\nimportant for the saturation of the MRI, but the exact stress-pressure\nrelationship is difficult to ascertain in local simulations because of\nnumerical convergence issues and the influence of any imposed flux.

In the case of\nnearby, bright Be star $\\beta$ CMi, these circumstances are a very stable\nlow-density disk and a late-type (B8Ve) central star. The aim is to test the\nVDD model thoroughly, exploiting the full diagnostic potential of individual\ntypes of observations, in particular, to constrain the poorly known structure\nof the outer disk if possible, and to test truncation effects caused by a\npossible binary companion using radio observations. We use the Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code HDUST to produce model observables, which we compare\nwith a very large set of multitechnique and multiwavelength observations that\ninclude ultraviolet and optical spectra, photometry covering the interval\nbetween optical and radio wavelengths, optical polarimetry, and optical and\nnear-IR (spectro)interferometry.

For the conditions\ntested, blade motion is governed primarily by two dimensionless variables: (i)\nthe Cauchy number, $Ca$, which represents the ratio of the hydrodynamic forcing\nto the restoring force due to blade stiffness, and (ii) the ratio of the blade\nlength to the wave orbital excursion, $L$. For flexible blades with $Ca \\gg 1$,\nthe relationship between drag and velocity can be described by two different\nscaling laws at the large- and small-excursion limits. For large excursions ($L\n\\ll 1$), the flow resembles a unidirectional current and the scaling laws\ndeveloped for steady-flow reconfiguration studies hold. For small excursions\n($L \\gg 1$), the beam equations may be linearized and a different scaling law\nfor drag applies. The experimental force measurements suggest that the\nsmall-excursion scaling applies even for intermediate cases with $L \\sim O(1)$.\nThe numerical model employs the well-known Morison force formulation, and\nadequately reproduces the observed blade dynamics and measured hydrodynamic\nforces without the use of any fitted parameters. For $Ca \\gg 1$, the movement\nof the flexible blades reduces the measured and modeled hydrodynamic drag\nrelative to a rigid blade of the same morphology. However, in some cases with\n$Ca \\sim O(1)$, the measured hydrodynamic forces generated by the flexible\nblades exceed those generated by rigid blades, but this is not reproduced in\nthe model. Observations of blade motion suggest that this unusual behavior is\nrelated to an unsteady vortex shedding event, which the simple numerical model\ncannot reproduce. Finally, we also discuss implications for the modeling of\nwave energy dissipation over canopies of natural aquatic vegetation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 17:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

It may happen that none of the labels of the\nnodes is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes\nto which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be\nselected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is: \"labels of\nwhich nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to provide the\nbest classification accuracy for the whole network?\". Active learning and\ninference is a practical framework to study this problem.\n  A set of methods for active learning and inference for within network\nclassification is proposed and validated. The utility score calculation for\neach node based on network structure is the first step in the process. The\nscores enable to rank the nodes. Based on the ranking, a set of nodes, for\nwhich the labels are acquired, is selected (e.g. by taking top or bottom N from\nthe ranking). The new measure-neighbour methods proposed in the paper suggest\nnot obtaining labels of nodes from the ranking but rather acquiring labels of\ntheir neighbours. The paper examines 29 distinct formulations of utility score\nand selection methods reporting their impact on the results of two collective\nclassification algorithms: Iterative Classification Algorithm and Loopy Belief\nPropagation.\n  We advocate that the accuracy of presented methods depends on the structural\nproperties of the examined network. We claim that measure-neighbour methods\nwill work better than the regular methods for networks with higher clustering\ncoefficient and worse than regular methods for networks with low clustering\ncoefficient. According to our hypothesis, based on clustering coefficient we\nare able to recommend appropriate active learning and inference method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 18:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

Chapter 1 is dedicated to the study of the conceptual implications\nof quantum nonlocality, a concept that subsumes that of entanglement in a\ncertain way. We detail the recent information-theoretic approaches to\nunderstanding the structure of nonlocal correlations, and the issues the latter\nraise concerning the ability of local observers to isolate a system from its\nenvironment. Chapter 2 reviews in what sense imposing Poincare invariance\naffects entanglement detection and quantification procedures. This invariance\nultimately forces a description of all quantum systems within the framework of\nquantum field theory, which leads to the impossibility of localized\nfinite-energy states and to the divergence of all entanglement measures for\nlocal observers. We provide a solution to these two problems by showing that\nthere exists a generic equivalence between a finite spatial resolution of the\nmeasurement apparatus and the exclusion of high-energy degrees of freedom from\nthe definition of the observed system. This equivalence allows for an epistemic\ninterpretation of the standard quantum formalism describing nonrelativistic\nlocalized systems and their correlations, hence a clarification of the origin\nof the finite measures of entanglement between such systems. Chapter 3 presents\na recent theoretical framework that predicts the existence of correlations with\nindefinite causal order.

Application of this method in two-phase,\nthree-component upwelling-column models demonstrates that it reproduces\nleading-order features of hydrated and carbonated peridotite melting; in\nparticular, it captures the production of low-degree, volatile-rich melt at\ndepths far below the volatile-free solidus. The models predict that segregation\nof volatile-rich, deep melts promotes a reactive channeling instability that\ncreates fast and chemically isolated pathways of melt extraction. Reactive\nchanneling occurs where volatile-rich melts flux the base of the silicate\nmelting region, enhancing dissolution of fusible components from the ambient\nmantle. We find this effect to be similarly expressed for models of both\nhydrated and carbonated mantle melting. These findings indicate that despite\ntheir small concentrations, water and carbon dioxide have an important control\non the extent and style of magma genesis, as well as on the dynamics of melt\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 20:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 18:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

In the case of\nreceiver cooperation, the receivers can process and share information through\nlimited capacity backhaul links. In contrast to various previously considered\ndistributed antenna architectures, where processing is utterly performed in a\ncentralized fashion, the model considered in this paper aims to capture the\nessence of decentralized processing, allowing for a more general class of\n\"interactive\" interference management strategies. Focusing on the three-user\ncase, we characterize the fundamental tradeoff between the achievable\ncommunication rates and the corresponding backhaul cooperation rate, in terms\nof degrees of freedom (DoF). Surprisingly, we show that the optimum\ncommunication-cooperation tradeoff per user remains the same when we move from\ntwo-user to three-user interference channels. In the absence of cooperation,\nthis is due to interference alignment, which keeps the fraction of\ncommunication dimensions wasted for interference unchanged. When backhaul\ncooperation is available, we develop a new idea that we call cooperation\nalignment, which guarantees that the average (per user) backhaul load remains\nthe same as we increase the number of users. In the case of transmitter\ncooperation, the transmitters can form their jointly precoded signals through\nan interactive protocol over the backhaul. In this case, we show that the\noptimal (per user) tradeoff between the achievable communication rates and the\ncorresponding backhaul cooperation rate in the three-user case is the same as\nfor receiver cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 21:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Using a maximum\nlikelihood solution for the network inference leads to a least-squares problem.\nBy solving this problem, we are able to present an efficient algorithm for\ntransforming the network to a new space which is both concise and\ndiscriminative. This new space preserves the identity of the network as much as\npossible. Our algorithm is interpretable and intuitive. Finally, by comparing\nour research against the baseline method (SVD) and against a state-of-the-art\nGraphlet algorithm, we show the strength of our algorithm in discriminating\nbetween different categories of networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 21:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

In particular,\nlateral entrainment of ambient material by high-velocity, well-collimated\nprotostellar jets may be the cause of the multiple emission-line velocity\ncomponents observed in the microjet-scale outflows driven by classical T Tauri\nstars. Intermediate-velocity outflow components may be emitted by a turbulent,\nshock- excited mixing layer along the boundaries of the jet. We present a\nformalism for describing such a mixing layer based on Reynolds decomposition of\nquantities measuring fundamental properties of the gas. In this model, the\nmolecular wind from large disc radii provides a continual supply of material\nfor entrainment. We calculate the total stress profile in the mixing layer,\nwhich allows us to estimate the dissipation of turbulent energy, and hence the\nluminosity of the layer. We utilize MAPPINGS IV shock models to determine the\nfraction of total emission that occurs in [Fe II] 1.644 {\\mu}m line emission in\norder to facilitate comparison to previous observations of the young stellar\nobject DG Tauri.

Our coupled SE-RHD calculations result\nin a wide diversity of final stellar masses covering 10 Msun $\\lesssim M_*\n\\lesssim$ 1000 Msun. The formation of very massive ($\\gtrsim$ 250 Msun) stars\nis possible under weak UV feedback, whereas ordinary massive (a few x 10 Msun)\nstars form when UV feedback can efficiently halt the accretion. This may\nexplain the peculiar abundance pattern of a Galactic metal-poor star recently\nreported by Aoki et al. (2014), possibly the observational signature of very\nmassive precursor primordial stars. Weak UV feedback occurs in cases of\nvariable accretion, in particular when repeated short accretion bursts\ntemporarily exceed 0.01 Msun/yr, causing the protostar to inflate. In the\nbloated state, the protostar has low surface temperature and UV feedback is\nsuppressed until the star eventually contracts, on a thermal adjustment\ntimescale, to create an HII region. If the delay time between successive\naccretion bursts is sufficiently short, the protostar remains bloated for\nextended periods, initiating at most only short periods of UV feedback. Disk\nfragmentation does not necessarily reduce the final stellar mass. Quite the\ncontrary, we find that disk fragmentation enhances episodic accretion as many\nfragments migrate inward and are accreted onto the star, thus allowing\ncontinued stellar mass growth under conditions of intermittent UV feedback.\nThis trend becomes more prominent as we improve the resolution of our\nsimulations. We argue that simulations with significantly higher resolution\nthan reported previously are needed to derive accurate gas mass accretion rates\nonto primordial protostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 01:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 00:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

NGC 5408 X-1 is one of the few ultraluminous X-ray sources with an\nextensive monitoring program in X-rays (a temporal baseline of 4.2 yr), making\nit one of the most suitable candidates to study the long-timescale\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).\n  Aims. Previous timing analysis of the Swift data of NGC 5408 X-1 led to\ndetection of multiple periodicities ranging from 2.6 d to 230 d. In this paper,\nwe focus on the statistical significance and the temporal evolution of these\nperiodicities.\n  Methods. A time-series analysis technique in the time-frequency domain, the\nweighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), was employed to identify the periodicities\nand trace their variations with time.\n  Results. Three periodic components were detected from the WWZ periodogram,\ncorresponding to periods of 2.65$\\pm$0.01 d, 115.4$\\pm$14.4 d and\n189.1$\\pm$15.2 d. All three have statistical significance higher than 99.74%.\nThe 2.65-d periodicity is quite stable in the majority of the light curve. The\n115-d periodicity is the most prominent but appears variable. The 189-d\nperiodicity is persistent across the whole time coverage. It shows a steadily\ndecreasing trend from the beginning (193 d period) to the end (181 d period).\n  Conclusions. The long-timescale periodicities in NGC 5408 X-1 are most likely\nof super-orbital origin, and are probably associated with the precession of a\nwarped accretion disc. The disc may have been broken into two distinct planes\nwith different precessing periods, i.e. the 189-d and 115-d periodicities\ncorresponding to the outer and inner disc, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 02:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 03:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

This survey tries to give the interested\nreader an overview of the area.\n  Erdal Arikan came up with his landmark polar coding shemes which achieve\ncapacity on symmetric channels subject to the constraint that the input\ncodewords are equiprobable. His idea is to convert any B-DMC into efficiently\nencodable-decodable channels which have rates 0 and 1, while conserving\ncapacity in this transformation. An exponentially decreasing probability of\nerror which independent of code rate is achieved for all rates lesser than the\nsymmetric capacity. These codes perform well in practice since encoding and\ndecoding complexity is O(N log N). Guruswami et al. improved the above results\nby showing that error probability can be made to decrease doubly exponentially\nin the block length.\n  We also study recent results by Urbanke et al. which show that 2-transitive\ncodes also achieve capacity on erasure channels under MAP decoding. Urbanke and\nhis group use complexity theoretic results in boolean function analysis to\nprove that EXIT functions, which capture the error probability, have a sharp\nthreshold at 1-R, thus proving that capacity is achieved. One of the oldest and\nmost widely used codes - Reed Muller codes are 2-transitive.

Sparsity prior has been\nfound to be an efficient strategy in CT reconstruction where significantly\nfewer attenuation measurements are available. Sparsity prior CT reconstruction\nrelies on iterative algorithms such as the algebraic reconstruction technique\n(ART) to produce a crude reconstruction based on which a sparse approximation\nis performed. Data driven adjustment of relaxation has been found to ensure\nbetter convergence than traditional relaxation for ART. In this paper, we study\nthe performance of such data driven relaxation on a (CS) compressed sensing\nenvironment.

Data driven relaxation seems a logical choice to more\nrapidly reach the solution. In a compressed sensing environment, especially\nwhen the data are corrupted by noise, a threshold to specify the maximum\namendments needs to be specified.

In the semiclassical picture, it is well known\nthat BOs can be explained owing to the periodic band structure of the crystal\nand the so-called 'acceleration' theorem: since in the momentum space the\nparticle wave packet drifts with a constant speed without being distorted, in\nreal space the probability distribution of the particle undergoes a periodic\nmotion following a trajectory which exactly reproduces the shape of the lattice\nband. In non-Hermitian lattices with a complex (i.e. not real) energy band,\nextension of the semiclassical model is not intuitive. Here we show that the\nacceleration theorem holds for non-Hermitian lattices with a complex energy\nband only {\\it on average}, and that the periodic wave packet motion of the\nparticle in the real space is described by a trajectory in {\\it complex} plane,\ni.e. it generally corresponds to reshaping and breathing of the wave packet in\naddition to a transverse oscillatory motion.

The predictive information and the excess entropy are such\ncomplexity measures. They measure the amount of information the past contains\nabout the future and thus quantify the nonrandom structure in the temporal\nsequence. However, when using these measures for systems with continuous states\none has to deal with the fact that their values will depend on the resolution\nwith which the systems states are observed.

The 56Sc mass\nindicates a small odd-even mass staggering in the A = 56 mass-chain towards the\nneutron drip line, significantly deviating from trends predicted by the global\nFRDM mass model and favoring trends predicted by the UNEDF0 and UNEDF1 density\nfunctional calculations.

We conclude that Urca cooling in the outer\ncrusts of accreting neutron stars that exhibit superbursts or high temperature\nsteady-state burning, which are predicted to be rich in A=56 nuclei, is\nconsiderably weaker than predicted. Urca cooling must instead be dominated by\nelectron capture on the small amounts of adjacent odd-A nuclei contained in the\nsuperburst and high temperature steady-state burning ashes.

The diffusion process determines a Laplacian, whose spectral\nproperties are related to the edge expansion properties of the hypergraph.\n  It is suggested that in the above diffusion process, within each hyperedge,\nmeasure should flow uniformly in the complete bipartite graph from nodes with\nmaximum weighted measure to those with minimum. However, we discover that this\nmethod has some technical issues. First, the diffusion process would not be\nwell-defined. Second, the resulting Laplacian would not have the claimed\nspectral properties.\n  In this paper, we show that the measure flow between the above two sets of\nnodes must be coordinated carefully over different hyperedges in order for the\ndiffusion process to be well-defined, from which a Laplacian can be uniquely\ndetermined. Since the Laplacian is non-linear, we have to exploit other\nproperties of the diffusion process to recover a spectral property concerning\nthe \"second eigenvalue\" of the resulting Laplacian. Moreover, we show that\nhigher order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 10:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

We find that the morphology of the aggregates\ndepends on the value of the charge density of the polymers. For values close to\nthe critical value, the shape of the aggregates is cylindrical with height\nequal to the length of a single polyelectrolyte chain. However, for larger\nvalues of charge, the linear extent of the aggregates increases as more and\nmore polymers aggregate.In both the cases, we show that the number of\naggregates decrease with time as power laws with exponents that are not\nnumerically distinguishable from each other, and are independent of charge\ndensity of the polymers, valency of the counterions, density, and length of the\npolyelectrolyte chain.

Shoreline and bathymetry\nsimplification methods are used to remove small scale details in the geometry,\nparticularly in areas away from the region of interest. To that end, a novel\nmethod for shoreline and bathymetry simplification is presented. Existing\nshoreline simplification methods typically remove points if the resultant\ngeometry satisfies particular geometric criteria. Bathymetry is usually\nsimplified using traditional filtering techniques, that remove unwanted Fourier\nmodes. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used in other fields to\nisolate small-scale structures from larger scale coherent features in a robust\nway, underpinned by a rigorous but simple mathematical framework. Here we\npresent a method based on principal component analysis aimed towards\nsimplification of shorelines and bathymetry. We present the algorithm in detail\nand show simplified shorelines and bathymetry in the wider region around the\nNorth Sea. Finally, the methods are used in the context of unstructured mesh\ngeneration aimed at tidal resource assessment simulations in the coastal\nregions around the UK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 13:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

KM3NeT in its final\nconfiguration will contain several hundreds of detection units. Each detection\nunit is a mechanical structure anchored to the sea floor, held vertical by a\nsubmerged buoy and supporting optical modules for the detection of Cherenkov\nlight emitted by charged secondary particles emerging from neutrino\ninteractions. This prototype string implements three optical modules with 31\nphotomultiplier tubes each. These optical modules were developed by the KM3NeT\nCollaboration to enhance the detection capability of neutrino interactions. The\nprototype detection unit was operated since its deployment in May 2014 until\nits decommissioning in July 2015. Reconstruction of the particle trajectories\nfrom the data requires a nanosecond accuracy in the time calibration. A\nprocedure for relative time calibration of the photomultiplier tubes contained\nin each optical module is described. This procedure is based on the measured\ncoincidences produced in the sea by the 40K background light and can easily be\nexpanded to a detector with several thousands of optical modules. The time\noffsets between the different optical modules are obtained using LED\nnanobeacons mounted inside them. A set of data corresponding to 600 hours of\nlivetime was analysed. The results show good agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the expected optical background and the signal from atmospheric\nmuons. An almost background-free sample of muons was selected by filtering the\ntime correlated signals on all the three optical modules. The zenith angle of\nthe selected muons was reconstructed with a precision of about 3{\\deg}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 13:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 17:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

Vocabulary mismatch corresponds to\nthe difficulty of retrieving relevant documents that do not contain exact query\nterms but semantically related terms. Term dependencies refers to the need of\nconsidering the relationship between the words of the query when estimating the\nrelevance of a document. A multitude of solutions has been proposed to solve\neach of these two problems, but no principled model solve both. In parallel, in\nthe last few years, language models based on neural networks have been used to\ncope with complex natural language processing tasks like emotion and paraphrase\ndetection. Although they present good abilities to cope with both term\ndependencies and vocabulary mismatch problems, thanks to the distributed\nrepresentation of words they are based upon, such models could not be used\nreadily in IR, where the estimation of one language model per document (or\nquery) is required. This is both computationally unfeasible and prone to\nover-fitting. Based on a recent work that proposed to learn a generic language\nmodel that can be modified through a set of document-specific parameters, we\nexplore use of new neural network models that are adapted to ad-hoc IR tasks.\nWithin the language model IR framework, we propose and study the use of a\ngeneric language model as well as a document-specific language model. Both can\nbe used as a smoothing component, but the latter is more adapted to the\ndocument at hand and has the potential of being used as a full document\nlanguage model. We experiment with such models and analyze their results on\nTREC-1 to 8 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 13:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Philae carries the Dust Impact\nMonitor (DIM) on board, which is part of the Surface Electric Sounding and\nAcoustic Monitoring Experiment (SESAME). DIM employs piezoelectric PZT sensors\nto detect impacts by sub-millimeter and millimeter-sized ice and dust particles\nthat are emitted from the nucleus and transported into the cometary coma. The\nDIM sensor measures dynamical data like flux and the directionality of the\nimpacting particles. Mass and speed of the particles can be constrained\nassuming density and elastic particle properties. DIM was operated during three\nmission phases of Philae at the comet: (1) Before Philae's separation from\nRosetta at distances of about 9.6 km, 11.8 km, and 25.3 km from the nucleus\nbarycenter. In this mission phase particles released from the nucleus on radial\ntrajectories remained undetectable because of significant obscuration by the\nstructures of Rosetta, and no dust particles were indeed detected. (2) During\nPhilae's descent to its nominal landing site Agilkia, DIM detected one\napproximately millimeter-sized particle at a distance of 5.0 km from the\nnucleus' barycenter, corresponding to an altitude of 2.4 km from the surface.\nThis is the closest ever dust detection at a cometary nucleus by a dedicated\nin-situ dust detector. (3) At Philae's final landing site, Abydos, DIM detected\nno dust impact which may be due to low cometary activity in the vicinity of\nPhilae, or due to shading by obstacles close to Philae, or both. Laboratory\ncalibration experiments showed that the material properties of the detected\nparticle are compatible with a porous particle having a bulk density of\napproximately $250\\, \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$. The particle could have been lifted\noff from the comet's surface by sublimating water ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 13:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

Further observations at\nCFHT in the optical bands (g and i) and in the near infrared (J, H and K_s),\nplus mid infrared observations with IRAC/Spitzer (at 3.6 and 4.5 microns)\nconfirm that the sub-mm red excess is associated with an over-density of\ncolour-selected galaxies.

Using numerical simulations, we examine the\nsegregation of twelve different subhalo properties with respect to both orbital\nenergy and halo-centric radius (in real space as well as in projection).\nSubhaloes are strongly segregated by accretion redshift, which is an outcome of\nthe inside-out assembly of their host haloes. Since subhaloes that were\naccreted earlier have experienced more tidal stripping, subhaloes that have\nlost a larger fraction of their mass at infall are on more bound orbits.\nSubhaloes are also strongly segregated in their masses and maximum circular\nvelocities at accretion. We demonstrate that part of this segregation is\nalready imprinted in the infall conditions. For massive subhaloes it is\nsubsequently boosted by dynamical friction, but only during their first radial\norbit. The impact of these two effects is counterbalanced, though, by the fact\nthat subhaloes with larger accretion masses are accreted later. Because of\ntidal stripping, subhaloes reveal little to no segregation by present-day mass\nor maximum circular velocity, while the corresponding torques cause subhaloes\non more bound orbits to have smaller spin. There is a weak tendency for\nsubhaloes that formed earlier to be segregated towards the center of their host\nhalo, which is an indirect consequence of the fact that (sub)halo formation\ntime is correlated with other, strongly segregated properties. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for the segregation of satellite galaxies in galaxy\ngroups and clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 14:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

These approaches come with specific hardware\nrequirements that are typically different than that of a universal gate-based\nquantum computer. We have previously proposed a non-gate-model approach called\nthe single-excitation subspace (SES) method, which requires a complete graph of\nsuperconducting qubits. Like any approach lacking error correction, the SES\nmethod is not scalable, but it often leads to algorithms with constant depth,\nallowing it to outperform the gate model in a wide variety of applications. A\nchallenge of the SES method is that it requires a physical qubit for every\nbasis state in the computer's Hilbert space. This imposes large resource costs\nfor algorithms using registers of ancillary qubits, as each ancilla would\ndouble the required graph size. Here we show how to circumvent this doubling by\nleaving the SES and reintroducing a tensor product structure in the\ncomputational subspace. Specifically, we implement the tensor product of an SES\nregister holding ``data\" with one or more ancilla qubits. This enables a hybrid\nform of quantum computation where fast SES operations are performed on the\ndata, traditional logic gates and measurements are performed on the ancillas,\nand controlled-unitaries act between.

Viscosity and resistivity are dissipative regularizations. We\npropose a minimal, local, conservative, nonlinear, dispersive regularization of\ncompressible flow and ideal MHD, in analogy with the KdV regularization of the\n1D Hopf equation. This work significantly extends earlier work on\nincompressible Euler and ideal MHD. It involves a cut-off lambda inversely\nproportional to square-root of density rho, which is like a position-dependent\nmean free path. In MHD, lambda can be taken of order the electron collisionless\nskin depth. The regularizing `twirl' term is - lambda w x curl w. Such a term\ncould be important in high speed flows with vorticity and arise in an expansion\nof kinetic equations in Knudsen number. A magnetic analogue of the twirl term -\n(B x curl B)/(rho mu_0), arises as the Lorentz force in ideal MHD. Our\nregularization preserves symmetries of the ideal systems, and with appropriate\nboundary conditions, implies associated conservation laws. Energy and enstrophy\nare subject to a priori bounds determined by initial data. A Hamiltonian and\nPoisson bracket formulation is developed and used to generalize the\nconstitutive relation to bound higher moments of w and curl w.

RPC consists of serializing the\nlocal function parameters into a memory buffer and sending that buffer to a\nremote target that in turn deserializes the parameters and executes the\ncorresponding function call, returning the result back to the caller. Building\nreusable services requires the definition of a communication model to remotely\naccess these services and for this purpose, RPC can serve as a foundation for\naccessing them.
