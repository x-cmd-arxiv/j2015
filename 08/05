The model has a single free parameter that we fit to a single\nexperimental measurement.

As the\nstatistical uncertainties on near-future measurements of photon-jet observables\nare expected to be much smaller than those in present data, with about an order\nof magnitude more photon-jet events expected, predictions for these observables\nare particularly important. We find that most of our pre- and post-dictions do\nnot depend sensitively on the form we choose for the rate of energy loss dE/dx\nof the partons in the shower. This gives our predictions considerable\nrobustness. To better discriminate between possible forms for the rate of\nenergy loss, though, we must turn to intrajet observables. Here, we focus on\nratios of fragmentation functions. We close with a suggestion for a particular\nratio, between the fragmentation functions of inclusive and associated jets\nwith the same kinematics in the same collisions, which is particularly\nsensitive to the x- and E-dependence of dE/dx, and hence may be used to learn\nwhich mechanism of parton energy loss best describes the quenching of jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 16:21:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 16:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Conventional PACT image reconstruction methods assume\na constant speed-of-sound (SOS), which can result in image artifacts when\nacoustic aberrations are significant. It has been demonstrated that\nincorporating knowledge of an object's SOS distribution into a PACT image\nreconstruction method can improve image quality. However, in many cases, the\nSOS distribution cannot be accurately and/or conveniently estimated prior to\nthe PACT experiment. Because variations in the SOS distribution induce\naberrations in the measured photoacoustic wavefields, certain information\nregarding an object's SOS distribution is encoded in the PACT measurement data.\nBased on this observation, a joint reconstruction (JR) problem has been\nproposed in which the SOS distribution is concurrently estimated along with the\nsought-after absorbed optical energy density from the photoacoustic measurement\ndata. A broad understanding of the extent to which the JR problem can be\naccurately and reliably solved has not been reported. In this work, a series of\nnumerical experiments is described that elucidate some important properties of\nthe JR problem that pertain to its practical feasibility. To accomplish this,\nan optimization-based formulation of the JR problem is developed that yields a\nnon-linear iterative algorithm that alternatingly updates the two image\nestimates.

In this paper, we provide a novel extension of the perceptron\nalgorithm to the learning to rank problem in information retrieval.

A modern perspective on perceptron for\nclassification is that it is simply an instance of online gradient descent\n(OGD), during mistake rounds, using the hinge loss function. Motivated by this\ninterpretation, we propose a novel family of listwise, large margin ranking\nsurrogates. Members of this family can be thought of as analogs of the hinge\nloss. Exploiting a certain self-bounding property of the proposed family, we\nprovide a guarantee on the cumulative NDCG (or AP) induced loss incurred by our\nperceptron-like algorithm. We show that, if there exists a perfect oracle\nranker which can correctly rank each instance in an online sequence of ranking\ndata, with some margin, the cumulative loss of perceptron algorithm on that\nsequence is bounded by a constant, irrespective of the length of the sequence.\nThis result is reminiscent of Novikoff's convergence theorem for the\nclassification perceptron.

RIAFs are typically collisionless in the sense that the Coulomb mean\nfree path is large compared to $GM/c^2$, and relativistically hot near the\nevent horizon. In this paper we develop a phenomenological model for the plasma\nin RIAFs, motivated by the application to sources such as Sgr A* and M87. The\nmodel is derived using Israel-Stewart theory, which considers deviations up to\nsecond order from thermal equilibrium, but modified for a magnetized plasma.\nThis leads to thermal conduction along magnetic field lines and a difference in\npressure, parallel and perpendicular to the field lines (which is equivalent to\nanisotrotropic viscosity). In the non-relativistic limit, our model reduces to\nthe widely used Braginskii theory of magnetized, weakly collisional plasmas. We\ncompare our model to the existing literature on dissipative relativistic\nfluids, describe the linear theory of the plasma, and elucidate the physical\nmeaning of the free parameters in the model. We also describe limits of the\nmodel when the conduction is saturated and when the viscosity implies a large\npressure anisotropy. In future work, the formalism developed in this paper will\nbe used in numerical models of RIAFs to assess the importance of non-ideal\nprocesses for the dynamics and radiative properties of slowly accreting black\nholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 19:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

In\nthe anti-aligned case, we instead find evidence for bursts of turbulent stress\nat 5-10 au, which we tentatively identify with the non-axisymmetric Hall-shear\ninstability. The presence or absence of these bursts depends upon the details\nof the adopted chemical model, which suggests that appreciable regions of\nactual protoplanetary discs might lie close to the borderline between laminar\nand turbulent behaviour. Given the number of important control parameters that\nhave already been identified in MHD models, quantitative predictions for disc\nstructure in terms of only radius and accretion rate appear to be difficult.\nInstead, we identify robust qualitative tests of magnetically driven accretion.\nThese include the presence of turbulence in the outer disc, independent of the\norientation of the vertical magnetic fields, and a Hall-mediated bi-modality in\nturbulent properties extending from the region of thermal ionization to 10 au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 20:10:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 20:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Briefly, to segment a boundary surface, two OCT volume\ndatasets are obtained by using a 3D smoothing filter and a 3D differential\nfilter. Their linear combination is then calculated to generate new volume data\nwith an enhanced boundary surface, where pixel intensity, boundary position\ninformation, and intensity changes on both sides of the boundary surface are\nused simultaneously. Next, preliminary discrete boundary points are detected\nfrom the A-Scans of the volume data. Finally, surface smoothness constraints\nand a dynamic threshold are applied to obtain a smoothed boundary surface by\ncorrecting a small number of error points.

Whether a product is selected in a market crucially relates to\nits competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of\ncompetition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model\nby Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the\n{\\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select\nseller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \\propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$\nis the buyer's satisfaction and $T$ is an effective temperature to introduce\nstochasticity. If $T$ decreases below a critical point $T_c$, the system\nundergoes a transition from a symmetric phase to an asymmetric one, in which\nonly one of the two sellers is selected. In this work, we extend the model by\nincorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to\ncontrol how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an\noscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the\n$(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field\napproximations. The analytic results show that the market preserves the\ninherent symmetry between the sellers for lower $T$ in the presence of the\nprice system, which is confirmed by our numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 05:19:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 04:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Indeed, tens of warm debris disks around\nyoung solar-type stars have been observed. Here, we quantitatively estimate the\ntotal mass of ejected materials during the giant impact stages. We found that\n$\\sim$0.4 times the Earth's mass is ejected in total throughout the giant\nimpact stage. Ejected materials are ground down by collisional cascade until\nmicron-sized grains are blown out by radiation pressure. The depletion\ntimescale of these ejected materials is determined primarily by the mass of the\nlargest body among them.

As such, considerable effort has\ngone into understanding and preventing it. Organic molecule based coatings can\nin certain circumstances act as effective corrosion inhibitors. Although they\nhave been used to great effect for more than sixty years, how they function at\nthe atomic-level is still a matter of debate. In this work, computer simulation\napproaches based on density functional theory are used to investigate\nbenzotriazole (BTAH), one of the most widely used and studied corrosion\ninhibitors for copper. In particular, the structures formed by protonated and\ndeprotonated BTAH molecules on Cu(111) have been determined and linked to their\ninhibiting properties. It is found that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals\ninteractions and steric repulsions all contribute in shaping how BTAH molecules\nadsorb, with flat-lying structures preferred at low coverage and upright\nconfigurations preferred at high coverage. The interaction of the\ndehydrogenated benzotriazole molecule (BTA) with the copper surface is instead\ndominated by strong chemisorption via the azole moiety with the aid of copper\nadatoms. Structures of dimers or chains are found to be the most stable\nstructures at all coverages, in good agreement with scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy results. Benzotriazole thus shows a complex phase behaviour in which\nvan der Waals forces play an important role and which depends on coverage and\non its protonation state and all of these factors feasibly contribute to its\neffectiveness as a corrosion inhibitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 09:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

First, structure formation requires slight inhomogeneities in the\ndensity of matter in the early universe, which then get amplified by the effect\nof gravity, leading to clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. According to\ninflation theory, quantum fluctuations form the seeds of these inhomogeneities.\nHowever, these quantum fluctuations are described by a quantum state which is\nhomogeneous and isotropic, and this raises a problem, connected to the\nfoundations of quantum theory, as the unitary evolution alone cannot break the\nsymmetry of the quantum state. Second, Boltzmann brains are random agglomerates\nof particles that, by extreme coincidence, form functioning brains. Unlikely as\nthese coincidences are, they seem to be predicted to occur in a quantum\nuniverse as vacuum fluctuations if the universe continues to exist for an\ninfinite (or just very long) time, in fact to occur over and over, even forming\nthe majority of all brains in the history of the universe. We provide a brief\nintroduction to the Bohmian version of quantum theory and explain why in this\nversion, Boltzmann brains, an undesirable kind of fluctuation, do not occur (or\nat least not often), while inhomogeneous seeds for structure formation, a\ndesirable kind of fluctuation, do.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 09:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The dependence maximization\napproach solves the supervised dimension reduction problem through maximizing a\nstatistical dependence between projected input variables and output variables.\nA well-known statistical dependence measure is mutual information (MI) which is\nbased on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, it is known that the KL\ndivergence is sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, quadratic MI (QMI) is a\nvariant of MI based on the $L_2$ distance which is more robust against outliers\nthan the KL divergence, and a computationally efficient method to estimate QMI\nfrom data, called least-squares QMI (LSQMI), has been proposed recently. For\nthese reasons, developing a supervised dimension reduction method based on\nLSQMI seems promising. However, not QMI itself, but the derivative of QMI is\nneeded for subspace search in supervised dimension reduction, and the\nderivative of an accurate QMI estimator is not necessarily a good estimator of\nthe derivative of QMI. In this paper, we propose to directly estimate the\nderivative of QMI without estimating QMI itself. We show that the direct\nestimation of the derivative of QMI is more accurate than the derivative of the\nestimated QMI. Finally, we develop a supervised dimension reduction algorithm\nwhich efficiently uses the proposed derivative estimator, and demonstrate\nthrough experiments that the proposed method is more robust against outliers\nthan existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 09:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

These results are consistent with models in which the HERGs are fuelled\nfrom accretion discs maintained from local reservoirs of gas, while LERGs are\nfuelled more directly by gas ingested from the intra-cluster medium.\n  Comparing the samples, we found that although the maximum environment\nrichness of the HERG environments is similar in both samples, there are poorer\nHERG environments in the z~0.1 sample than in the z~0.5 sample. We have\ntherefore tentative evidence of evolution of the HERG environments. We found no\ndifferences between the LERG sub-samples for the two epochs, as would be\nexpected if radio and cluster luminosity are related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 10:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 19:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Arguably, the\nmost fundamental problem in this domain is influence maximization, where the\ngoal is to identify a seed set of individuals that can trigger a large cascade\nof influence in the network. While there has been significant progress\nregarding this problem and its variants, one basic shortcoming of the models is\nthat they lack the flexibility in the way the budget is allocated to\nindividuals. Indeed, budget allocation is a critical issue in advertising and\nviral marketing. Taking the other point of view, known models allowing flexible\nbudget allocation do not take into account the influence spread in the network.\nWe introduce a generalized model that captures both budgets and influence\npropagation simultaneously.\n  For the offline setting, we identify a large family of budget-based\npropagation functions that admit tight approximation guarantee. This family\nextends most of the previously studied influence models, including the\nwell-known Triggering model. We establish that any function in this family\nimplies an instance of a monotone submodular function maximization over the\ninteger lattice subject to a knapsack constraint. This problem is known to\nadmit an optimal (1-1/e)-approximation. We also study the price of anarchy of\nthe multi-player game that extends the model and establish tight results.\n  For the online setting, in which an unknown subset of agents arrive in a\nrandom order and the algorithm needs to make an irrevocable budget allocation\nin each step, we develop a 1/(15e)-competitive algorithm. This setting extends\nthe secretary problem, and its variant, the submodular knapsack secretary\nproblem. Notably, our algorithm improves over the best known approximation for\nthe latter problem, even though it applies to a more general setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 13:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 17:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

In an appendix we offer a complete\nproof of the well-known relationship between the 2-category of monoidal\ncategories with strong monoidal functors and the 2-category of monoidal\ncategories whose object set is free with strict functors; similarly for traced\nand compact categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 13:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 13:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 16:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Aims: In this paper, we study two\ncarefully selected post-AGB stars in the LMC. The combination of favourable\natmospheric parameters for detailed abundance studies and their known distances\nmake these objects ideal probes of the internal AGB third dredge-up and\ns-process nucleosynthesis in that they provide observational constraints for\ntheoretical AGB models. Methods: We use high-resolution optical UVES spectra to\ndetermine accurate stellar parameters and perform detailed elemental abundance\nstudies. Additionally, we use available photometric data to construct SEDs for\nreddening and luminosity determinations. We then estimate initial masses from\ntheoretical post-AGB tracks. Results: Both stars show extreme s-process\nenrichment associated with relatively low C/O ratios of about 1.3. We could\nonly derive upper limits of the lead (Pb) abundance which indicate no strong Pb\noverabundances with respect to other s-elements. Comparison with theoretical\npost-AGB evolutionary tracks in the HR-diagram reveals that both stars have low\ninitial masses between 1.0 and 1.5 Msun. Conclusion: This study adds to the\nresults obtained so far on a very limited number of s-process enriched post-AGB\nstars in the Magellanic Clouds. We find an increasing discrepancy between\nobserved and predicted Pb abundances towards lower metallicities for all\nstudied Magellanic Cloud post-AGB stars found so far, as well as moderate C/O\nratios. We find that all s-process rich post-AGB stars in the LMC and SMC\nstudied so far, cluster in the same region of the HR-diagram and are associated\nwith low-mass stars with a low metallicity on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 14:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

However, all these papers focus on the singular value decomposition\nof the coefficient matrix. Our target is the decomposition of the coefficient\nmatrix which leads to the best lower rank approximation to the regression\nfunction, the signal part in the response.

Our sample includes 423 flat-spectrum radio\nsources (FSRQs), 361 BL Lac objects and candidates, and 93 blazars of uncertain\ntype. We have made an estimation of the synchrotron peak frequency\n($\\nu_{peak}^{s}$) for the 875 objects and further classified them as high,\nintermediate and low synchrotron peaked sources (HSPs/ISPs/LSPs). There are 42\nHSPs with $\\nu_{peak}^{s} > 10^{16.5}$ Hz, 222 ISPs with $10^{14.5} <\n\\nu_{peak}^{s} < 10^{16.5}$ Hz, and 611 LSPs with $\\nu_{peak}^{s} < 10^{14.5}$\nHz in our sample. We have calculated an average value of $\\nu_{peak}^{s}$ to be\n$10^{13.4 \\pm 1.0}$ Hz for FSRQs and $10^{14.6 \\pm 1.4}$ Hz for BL Lacs. We\nfound out that $\\nu_{peak}^{s}$ and the flux density at 4.8 GHz have a\ndifferent distribution (as indicated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at significance\nlevel 0.05) for the FSRQ and BL Lac blazars, and for the RBL and XBL types of\nBL Lacs. Distribution of $\\nu_{peak}^{s}$ values is broader for BL Lacs, than\nfor FSRQs. There are no ultra-high energy peaked objects (with $\\nu_{peak}^{s}\n> 10^{19}$ Hz) in our BL Lac sample according to our estimations. The\nsignificant part of FSRQs (41%) and small part of BL Lacs (9%) in our sample\ncould be considered as candidates to the very-low synchrotron peaked blazars\n(with $\\nu_{peak}^{s} < 10^{13}$ Hz). Our foundations confirm results of the\nprevious studies made on samples with significantly smaller number of objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 15:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Asymptotic optimality has been established for some of these methods\nin high dimension when there are only two classes. A major difficulty in\nproving asymptotic optimality for multiclass classification is that the\nclassification boundary is typically complicated and no explicit formula for\nclassification error generally exists when the number of classes is greater\nthan two. For the Fisher's LDA, one additional difficulty is that the\ncovariance matrix is also involved in the linear constraints. The main purpose\nof this paper is to establish asymptotic consistency and asymptotic optimality\nfor our sparse Fisher's LDA with thresholded linear constraints in the\nhigh-dimensional settings for arbitrary number of classes. To address the first\ndifficulty above, we provide asymptotic optimality and the corresponding\nconvergence rates in high-dimensional settings for a large family of linear\nclassification rules with arbitrary number of classes, and apply them to our\nmethod. To overcome the second difficulty, we propose a thresholding approach\nto avoid the estimate of the covariance matrix.

It is\nnot known whether gas giant planets on wide orbits form the same way as Jupiter\nor by fragmentation of gravitationally unstable discs. Here we show that a\ngiant planet, which has formed in the outer regions of a protostellar disc,\ninitially migrates fast towards the central star (migration timescale ~10,000\nyr) while accreting gas from the disc. However, in contrast with previous\nstudies, we find that the planet eventually opens up a gap in the disc and the\nmigration is essentially halted. At the same time, accretion-powered radiative\nfeedback from the planet, significantly limits its mass growth, keeping it\nwithin the planetary mass regime (i.e. below the deuterium burning limit) at\nleast for the initial stages of disc evolution. Giant planets may therefore be\nable to survive on wide orbits despite their initial fast inward migration,\nshaping the environment in which terrestrial planets that may harbour life\nform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 20:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

When applied to\ngeneral relativity, the formula yields the Bekenstein-Hawking result but, for\nany other gravitational action that departs from the Hilbert action, the\nresulting entropy acquires an additional multiplicative factor that depends on\nthe global geometry of the background spacetime. On the other hand, the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP) has extensively been recently used to\ninvestigate corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula, with the\nconclusion that the latter always comes multiplied by a factor that depends on\nthe area of the event horizon. We show, by considering the case of an\n$f(R)$-modified gravity, that the usual black hole entropy derivation based on\nthe GUP might be modified in such a way that the two methods yield the same\ncorrections to Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The procedure turns out to be an\ninteresting method for seeking modified gravity theories. Two different\nversions of the GUP are used and it is found that only one of them yields a\nviable modified gravity model. Conversely, it is possible to find a general\nformulation of the GUP that would reproduce Wald entropy formula for any\n$f(R)$-theory of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 21:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-24"}
