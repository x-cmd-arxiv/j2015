In particular, we consider a linear time-variant system that is\ncorrupted with process and measurement noise, and study how the selection of\nits sensors affects the estimation error of the corresponding Kalman filter\nover a finite observation interval. Our contributions are threefold: First, we\nprove that the minimum mean square error of the Kalman filter decreases only\nlinearly as the number of sensors increases. That is, adding extra sensors so\nto reduce this estimation error is ineffective, a fundamental design limit.\nSimilarly, we prove that the number of sensors grows linearly with the system's\nsize for fixed minimum mean square error and number of output measurements over\nan observation interval; this is another fundamental limit, especially for\nsystems where the system's size is large. Second, we prove that the logdet of\nthe error covariance of the Kalman filter, which captures the volume of the\ncorresponding confidence ellipsoid, with respect to the system's initial\ncondition and process noise is a supermodular and non-increasing set function\nin the choice of the sensor set. Therefore, it exhibits the diminishing returns\nproperty.

The reason for discussing it\nnow is the second scheme, the Random-Resistor-Random-Temperature (RRRT-) KLJN\nkey exchange, inspired by a recent paper of Vadai, Mingesz and Gingl, wherein\nsecurity was shown to be maintained at non-zero power flow. In the RRRT-KLJN\nsecure key exchange scheme, both the resistances and their temperatures are\ncontinuum random variables. We prove that the security of the RRRT-KLJN scheme\ncan prevail at non-zero power flow, and thus the physical law guaranteeing\nsecurity is not the Second Law of Thermodynamics but the\nFluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Alice and Bob know their own resistances and\ntemperatures and can calculate the resistance and temperature values at the\nother end of the communication channel from measured voltage, current and\npower-flow data in the wire.

In some cases, it is feasible that opportunistic agents may\ndeceptively report false state values for their own benefit, e.g., to claim a\nlarger portion of shared resources. Motivated by such cases, this paper\npresents a multi-agent coordination framework which disincentivizes\nopportunistic misreporting of state information. This paper focuses on\nmulti-agent coordination problems that can be stated as nonlinear programs,\nwith non-separable constraints coupling the agents. In this setting, an\nopportunistic agent may be tempted to skew the problem's constraints in its\nfavor to reduce its local cost, and this is exactly the behavior we seek to\ndisincentivize. The framework presented uses a primal-dual approach wherein the\nagents compute primal updates and a centralized cloud computer computes dual\nupdates. All computations performed by the cloud are carried out in a way that\nenforces joint differential privacy, which adds noise in order to dilute any\nagent's influence upon the value of its cost function in the problem. We show\nthat this dilution deters agents from intentionally misreporting their states\nto the cloud, and present bounds on the possible cost reduction an agent can\nattain through misreporting its state. This work extends our earlier work on\nincorporating ordinary differential privacy into multi-agent optimization, and\nwe show that this work can be modified to provide a disincentivize for\nmisreporting states to the cloud. Numerical results are presented to\ndemonstrate convergence of the optimization algorithm under joint differential\nprivacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2015 23:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 00:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 14:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

Therefore, it seems to be possible to investigate the spectrum\nof the Mathieu operator employing the techniques of 2d CFT. To exploit this\nstrategy, a full correspondence between the Mathieu equation and its\nrealization within 2d CFT has to be established. In our previous paper [1], we\nhave found that the expression of the Mathieu eigenvalue given in terms of the\nclassical irregular block exactly coincides with the well known weak coupling\nexpansion of this eigenvalue in the case in which the auxiliary parameter is\nthe noninteger Floquet exponent.

Not only the ratio of AT to GC\ndifferent in these molecules but also the distributions of AT and GC along the\nmolecule are different. With suitable modifications in the statistical model to\nshow the defect in a pair, we investigate the denaturation of short DNA\nmolecules in thermal as well as constant force ensemble. In the force ensemble,\nwe pulled the DNA molecule from each end (keeping other end free) and observed\nsome interesting features of opening of the molecule in the presence of defects\nin the molecule. We calculate the probability of opening of the DNA molecule in\nthe constant force ensemble to explain the opening of base pairs and hence the\ndenaturation of molecules in the presence of defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 04:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

The algorithms employed some tree\nstructures to aggregate cost and thus improved the performance and reduced the\ncoputation load of the stereo matching. However, the computational complexity\nof these tree-based algorithms is still high because they search over the\nentire disparity range. In addition, the extreme greediness of the minimum\nspanning tree (MST) causes the poor performance in large areas with similar\ncolors but varying disparities. In this paper, we propose an efficient stereo\nmatching method using a hierarchical disparity prediction (HDP) framework to\ndramatically reduce the disparity search range so as to speed up the tree-based\nnon-local stereo methods. Our disparity prediction scheme works on a graph\npyramid derived from an image whose disparity to be estimated. We utilize the\ndisparity of a upper graph to predict a small disparity range for the lower\ngraph. Some independent disparity trees (DT) are generated to form a disparity\nprediction forest (HDPF) over which the cost aggregation is made. When combined\nwith the state-of-the-art tree-based methods, our scheme not only dramatically\nspeeds up the original methods but also improves their performance by\nalleviating the second drawback of the tree-based methods. This is partially\nbecause our DTs overcome the extreme greediness of the MST. Extensive\nexperimental results on some benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of our framework. For example, the segment-tree based stereo\nmatching becomes about 25.57 times faster and 2.2% more accurate over the\nMiddlebury 2006 full-size dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 05:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

Classical communications are used to convey the measurement results. It\nis important to improve the way of conveying the measurement results so that\nEPR pairs are not affected by noises during classical communications. One\nsolution is execution in the blind mode. In the blind mode, correction\noperations of multiple ES operations and multiple EPP operations are performed\nin a lump after EPR pairs are shared between the sender and the receiver. That\nis, the following quantum operations are performed without performing\ncorrection operations of the former quantum operations. The protocol in the\nconventional blind mode uses concatenated CSS codes. Therefore, the number of\nqubits gets large as the communication distance gets long. This paper proposes\nquantum repeater protocols which can be executed in the blind mode and can be\nconstructed by using CSS codes of single encoding.

We investigated the temporal characteristics of X-ray\nemission during the early phases of the outburst. We performed a periodicity\nsearch with the spectral hardness ratio (HR), and found a coherent signal near\nthe spin period of the neutron star, but with a lag of about 3 radians.\nTherefore, the HR is strongly anti-correlated with the X-ray intensity, which\nis also seen in the giant flares.

Understanding gradual weak measurements\nrequires replacing this scenario with a dynamical evolution equation for the\ncollapse of the quantum state in individual experimental runs. We revisit the\nquantum trajectory framework that models quantum measurement as a continuous\nnonlinear stochastic process. We describe the ensemble of quantum trajectories\nas noise fluctuations on top of geodesics that attract the quantum state\ntowards the measured operator eigenstates. Investigation of the restrictions\nneeded on the ensemble of quantum trajectories, so as to reproduce projective\nmeasurement in the appropriate limit, shows that the Born rule follows when the\nmagnitudes of the noise and the attraction are precisely related, in a manner\nreminiscent of the fluctuation-dissipation relation. That implies that both the\nnoise and the attraction have a common origin in the measurement interaction\nbetween the system and the apparatus. We analyse the quantum trajectory\nensemble for the scenarios of quantum diffusion and binary quantum jump, and\nshow that the ensemble distribution is completely determined in terms of a\nsingle evolution parameter.

The growth of the entropy with the\ninter-quark distance leads to the emergent entropic force that induces\ndissociation of quarkonium states. Since the quark-gluon plasma around the\ntransition point is a strongly coupled system, we use the gauge-gravity duality\nto study the entropy of heavy quarkonium and the real-time dynamics of its\ndissociation. In particular, we employ the Improved Holographic QCD model as a\ndual description of large $N_c$ Yang Mills theory.

We also study the real-time dynamics of\nthe system by considering the holographic string falling in the black hole\nhorizon where it equilibrates.

Isotopic purification\neliminates the well-studied nuclear spin baths which usually dominate\ndecoherence. We model the coherence of electronic spin qubits in silicon near\nso called Clock Transitions (CT) where experiments have electronic $T_{2e}$\ntimes of seconds. Despite the apparent simplicity of the residual decoherence\nmechanism, this regime is not well understood: the state mixing which underpins\nCTs allows also a proliferation of contributions from usually forbidden\nchannels (direct flip-flops with non-resonant spins); in addition, the\nmagnitude and effects of the corresponding Overhauser fields and other\ndetunings is not well quantified. For purely magnetic detunings, we identify a\nregime, potentially favourable for quantum computing, where forbidden channels\nare completely suppressed but spins in resonant states are fully released from\nOverhauser fields and applied magnetic field gradients.

Here we characterize the lesion formation\nprocess on longitudinal, multi-sequence structural MRI from 34 MS patients and\nrelate the longitudinal changes we observe within lesions to therapeutic\ninterventions. In this article, we first outline a pipeline to extract voxel\nlevel, multi-sequence longitudinal profiles from four MRI sequences within\nlesion tissue. We then propose two models to relate clinical covariates to the\nlongitudinal profiles. The first model is a principal component analysis (PCA)\nregression model, which collapses the information from all four profiles into a\nscalar value.

On a quality\nscale of 1 to 4 (4 being the highest) the neuroradiologist gave the score on\nthe first PC a median rating of 4 (95% CI: [4,4]), and the neurologist gave it\na median rating of 3 (95% CI: [3,3]).

However, the number of such vectors required to capture\nproblem structure grows with problem size, and even partial SVD computation\nbecomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity it compressive\nspectral embedding algorithm, which employs random projections and finite order\npolynomial expansions to compute approximations to SVD-based embedding. For an\nm times n matrix with T non-zeros, its time complexity is O((T+m+n)log(m+n)),\nand the embedding dimension is O(log(m+n)), both of which are independent of\nthe number of singular vectors whose effect we wish to capture. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the\nnumber of singular vectors for general SVD-based embeddings. The key to\nsidestepping the SVD is the observation that, for downstream inference tasks\nsuch as clustering and classification, we are only interested in using the\nresulting embedding to evaluate pairwise similarity metrics derived from the\neuclidean norm, rather than capturing the effect of the underlying matrix on\narbitrary vectors as a partial SVD tries to do.

The maximum percentage difference\nof the beam parameters are calculated to be; 100%, 13.27%, 42.24%, 7.79% and\n65.01%, 86.81%, respectively due to which the bunching efficiency is reduced to\n54%. The simulation results are in agreement with test and are helpful to\noptimize the beam parameters by tuning the trigger timing of the gun during the\nbunching process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 04:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

As these\nsequences are used to reason over complex scenarios, a more compact\nrepresentation would aid exactness of technical cognitive reasoning\ncapabilities, which are today constrained by computational complexity issues\nand fallback to representational heuristics or human intervention. Such\nproblems need to be addressed to ensure timely and meaningful human-robot\ninteraction. Our work is towards understanding the variability of learning\ninformativeness when training on subsets of a given input dataset. This is in\nview of reducing the training size while retaining the majority of the symbolic\nlearning potential. We prove the concept on human-written texts, and conjecture\nthis work will reduce training data size of sequential instructions, while\npreserving semantic relations, when gathering information from large remote\nsources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 15:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}
