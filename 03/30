On the one hand, these DLs are tractable, but fairly\ninexpressive. On the other hand, these DLs can be used for designing different\nclasses of ontologies, most notably ontologies from the medical domain.\nUnfortunately, building ontologies is error-prone. As a result, inferable\nsubsumption relations among concepts may be unintended. In recent years, the\nproblem of axiom pinpointing has been studied with the purpose of providing\nminimal sets of axioms that explain unintended subsumption relations. For the\nconcrete case of EL and EL+, the most efficient approaches consist of encoding\nthe problem into propositional logic, specifically as a Horn formula, which is\nthen analyzed with a dedicated algorithm. This paper builds on this earlier\nwork, but exploits the important relationship between minimal axioms sets and\nminimal unsatisfiable subformulas in the propositional domain. In turn, this\nrelationship allows applying a vast body of recent work in the propositional\ndomain to the concrete case of axiom pinpointing for EL and its variants. From\na practical perspective, the algorithms described in this paper are often\nseveral orders of magnitude more efficient that the current state of the art in\naxiom pinpointing for the EL family of DLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 16:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

We then investigate a cross-validation by\nresampling the matching weights. Our asymptotic theory shows that the\ncross-validation, if rescaled properly, computes an unbiased estimate of the\nmatching error with respect to the true matching weights. Existing ideas of\ncross-validation for resampling data vectors, instead of resampling matching\nweights, are not applicable here. MCA can be used for data vectors from\nmultiple domains with different dimensions via an embarrassingly simple idea of\ncoding the data vectors. This method will be called as cross-domain matching\ncorrelation analysis (CDMCA), and an interesting connection to the classical\nassociative memory model of neural networks is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 18:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 14:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 02:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

In this era of data deluge, effective\ncoordination between the data production and the analysis phases hinges on the\navailability of metadata that describe the scientific datasets. Existing\nworkflow engines have been capturing a limited form of metadata to provide\nprovenance information about the identity and lineage of the data.

TOA errors from chromatic DMs are of order a few to\nhundreds of nanoseconds for pulsars with DM $\\lesssim 30$~pc~cm$^{-3}$ observed\nacross an octave band but increase rapidly to microseconds or larger for larger\nDMs and wider frequency ranges. Frequency-dependent DMs introduce correlated\nnoise into timing residuals whose power spectrum is `low pass' in form. The\ncorrelation time is of order the geometric mean of the refraction times for the\nhighest and lowest radio frequencies used and thus ranges from days to years,\ndepending on the pulsar. We discuss the implications for methodologies that use\nlarge frequency separations or wide bandwidth receivers for timing\nmeasurements. Chromatic DMs are partially mitigable by using an additional\nchromatic term in arrival time models. Without mitigation, our results provide\nan additional term in the noise model for pulsar timing; they also indicate\nthat in combination with measurement errors from radiometer noise, an arbitrary\nincrease in total frequency range (or bandwidth) will yield diminishing\nbenefits and may be detrimental to overall timing precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 20:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

Thus our method is able to estimate not only the\nspeed of the CME front but also the radial flow speed inside the CME. We have\napplied the method to a slow CME with an average leading edge speed about 480\nkm s$^{-1}$. In the Lagrangian frame, the speed of the individual CME mass\nelements stay almost constant within 2 and 15 R$_S$, the range over which we\nanalyzed the CME. Hence we have no evidence of net radial forces acting on\nparts of the CME in this range nor of a pile-up of mass ahead of the CME.

Therefore, in order to relax this\nassumption, we propose a nonparametric relational topic model in this paper.\nInstead of using fixed-dimensional probability distributions in its generative\nmodel, we use stochastic processes.

Despite being stable, the\nmolecular core can still collapse spontaneously as it will relax to develop a\nsufficiently large density gradient after tens of oscillations, or a few $10^7$\nyears. However, during its relaxation, the core may abruptly collapse triggered\nby the impingement of small-amplitude, long-wavelength ($\\sim$ 6 $-$ 36 pc)\nsound waves in the warm gas. This triggered collapse mechanism is similar to a\nsonoluminescence phenomenon, where underwater ultrasounds can drive air bubble\ncoalescence. The collapse configuration is found to be different from both\ninside-out and outside-in models of low-mass star formation; nonetheless the\nmass flux is close to the prediction of the inside-out model. The condition and\nthe efficiency for this core collapse mechanism are identified.

New states of positive\n(J$^{\\pi}$=3,4$^+$) and negative (J$^{\\pi}$=1-5$^-$) parity are proposed. The\nformer arise from the coupling between 0d$\\_{5/2}$ protons and a 0d$\\_{3/2}$\nneutron, while the latter are due to couplings with 1p$\\_{3/2}$ or 0f$\\_{7/2}$\nneutrons. While the relative energies between the J$^{\\pi}$=1-4$^+$ states are\nwell reproduced with the USDA interaction in the N=17 isotones, a progressive\nshift in the ground state binding energy (by about 500 keV) is observed between\n$^{26}$F and $^{30}$Al. This points to a possible change in the proton-neutron\n0d$\\_{5/2}$-0d$\\_{3/2}$ effective interaction when moving from stability to the\ndrip line. The presence of J$^{\\pi}$=1-4$^-$ negative parity states around 1.5\nMeV as well as of a candidate for a J$^{\\pi}$=5$^-$ state around 2.5 MeV give\nfurther support to the collapse of the N=20 gap and to the inversion between\nthe 0f$\\_{7/2}$ and 1p$\\_{3/2}$ levels below Z=12.

We examine in a unified framework both the L1 regularization\n(often referred to as Lasso or Basis-Pursuit) and the Continuous Basis-Pursuit\n(C-BP) methods. The Lasso is the de-facto standard for the sparse\nregularization of inverse problems in imaging. It performs a nearest neighbor\ninterpolation of the spikes locations on the sampling grid. The C-BP method,\nintroduced by Ekanadham, Tranchina and Simoncelli, uses a linear interpolation\nof the locations to perform a better approximation of the infinite-dimensional\noptimization problem, for positive measures. We show that, in the small noise\nregime, both methods estimate twice the number of spikes as the number of\noriginal spikes. Indeed, we show that they both detect two neighboring spikes\naround the locations of an original spikes. These results for deconvolution\nproblems are based on an abstract analysis of the so-called extended support of\nthe solutions of L1-type problems (including as special cases the Lasso and\nC-BP for deconvolution), which are of an independent interest. They precisely\ncharacterize the support of the solutions when the noise is small and the\nregularization parameter is selected accordingly. We illustrate these findings\nto analyze for the first time the support instability of compressed sensing\nrecovery when the number of measurements is below the critical limit (well\ndocumented in the literature) where the support is provably stable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 07:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

A CUSUM approach is\nproposed, which is used to test the \"classical\" hypothesis of the form $H_0:\n\\theta_1=\\theta_2$ vs. $H_1: \\theta_1 \\not =\\theta_2$, where $\\theta_1$ and\n$\\theta_2$ denote second order parameters of the process before and after a\nchange point.

The major problem of empirical\nstudies of this relationship is the distortion of the CME speed by the\nprojection effect in the coronagraphic measurements. We present a re-assessment\nof the statistical relationship between CME velocities and SXR parameters,\nusing the SOHO/LASCO catalog and GOES whole Sun observations during the period\n1996 to 2008. 49 events were identified where CMEs originated near the limb, at\ncentral meridian distances between 70$^\\circ$ and 85$^\\circ$, and had a\nreliably identified SXR burst, the parameters of which - peak flux and fluence\n- could be determined with some confidence. We find similar correlations\nbetween the logarithms of CME speed and of SXR peak flux and fluence as several\nearlier studies, with correlation coefficients of 0.48 and 0.58, respectively.\nCorrelations are slightly improved over an unrestricted CME sample when only\nlimb events are used. However, a broad scatter persists. We derive the\nparameters of the CME-SXR relationship and use them to predict ICME arrival\ntimes at Earth. We show that the CME speed inferred from SXR fluence\nmeasurements tends to perform better than SoHO/LASCO measurements in the\nprediction of ICME arrival times near 1 AU. The estimation of the CME speed\nfrom SXR observations can therefore make a valuable contribution to space\nweather predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 09:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

We therefore propose a novel optimization\nframework that considers both the load-dependent energy radiated by the\nantennas and the remaining forms of energy needed for operating the base\nstations. The objective is to reduce the energy consumption of mobile networks,\nwhile ensuring that the data rate requirements of the users are met throughout\nthe coverage area. Building upon sparse optimization techniques, we develop a\nmajorization-minimization algorithm with the ability to identify\nenergy-efficient network configurations. The iterative algorithm is load-aware,\nhas low computational complexity, and can be implemented in an online fashion\nto exploit load fluctuations on a short time scale. Simulations show that the\nalgorithm can find network configurations with the energy consumption similar\nto that obtained with global optimization tools, which cannot be applied to\nreal large networks. Although we consider only one currently deployed cellular\ntechnology, the optimization framework is general, potentially applicable to a\nlarge class of access technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 10:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

However, until recently at least, the\n50-year-long-sought Higgs boson had remained the only particle in the standard\nmodel not yet discovered experimentally. It is the last but very important\nmissing ingredient of the standard model. Therefore, searching for the Higgs\nboson is a crucial task and an important mission of particle physics. For this\npurpose, many theoretical works have been done and different experiments have\nbeen organized. It may be said in particular that to search for the Higgs boson\nhas been one of the ultimate goals of building and running the LHC, the world's\nlargest and most powerful particle accelerator, at CERN, which is a great\ncombination of science and technology. Recently, in the summer of 2012, ATLAS\nand CMS, the two biggest and general-purpose LHC collaborations, announced the\ndiscovery of a new boson with a mass around 125 GeV.

Observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray (VLA) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) show that the jet\nproperties changed significantly during the outburst. The VLA observations\ndetected linearly polarised emission at a level of ~1% early in the outburst,\nincreasing to ~3% as the outburst peaked.

The physics of the IHM is governed by the competition between the\nstaggered potential $\\Delta$ and the on-site Hubbard U. In both the methods we\nfind that for a finite $\\Delta$ and at zero temperature, anti-ferromagnetic\n(AFM) order sets in beyond a threshold $U=U_{AF}$ via a first order phase\ntransition below which the system is a paramagnetic band insulator.

We show that the results obtained within both the methods\nhave good qualitative and quantitative consistency in the intermediate to\nstrong coupling regime. On increasing the temperature, the AFM order is lost\nvia a first order phase transition at a transition temperature $T_{AF}(U,\n\\Delta)$ within both the methods, for weak to intermediate values of U/t.

The\nresults show that the optimization of a utility estimate such as the\ncross-validation (CV) score is liable to finding overfitted models due to\nrelatively high variance in the utility estimates when the data is scarce. This\ncan also lead to substantial selection induced bias and optimism in the\nperformance evaluation for the selected model.

If the encompassing model is too complex, it can be robustly\nsimplified by the projection method, in which the information of the full model\nis projected onto the submodels.

Overall, the projection method\nappears to outperform also the maximum a posteriori model and the selection of\nthe most probable variables.

However, further distortions are actually present owing to\nchanges in the gravitational field across the scale of the ray bundle of light\npropagating to us, resulting in the familiar arcs in lensed images. This is\nnormally called the flexion, and is approximated by Taylor expanding the shear\nand magnification across the image plane. However, the physical origin of this\neffect arises from higher-order corrections in the geodesic deviation equation\ngoverning the gravitational force between neighbouring geodesics - so involves\nderivatives of the Riemann tensor. We show that integrating the second-order\ngeodesic deviation equation results in a 'Hessian map' for gravitational\nlensing, which is a higher-order addition to the Jacobi map. We derive the\ngeneral form of the Hessian map in an arbitrary spacetime paying particular\nattention to the separate effects of local Ricci versus non-local Weyl\ncurvature. We then specialise to the case of a perturbed FLRW model, and give\nthe general form of the Hessian for the first time.

Unlike\ngames like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill\ngame' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,\nwhose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal\nwinning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a\nstrategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,\nin order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances\nof rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges. Recently,\na work on this topic revealed that rationality is a fundamental ingredient to\nsucceed in poker tournaments. In this study we analyze a simple model of poker\nchallenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the\nnature of this game. As main result we found that, under particular conditions,\nfew irrational players can turn poker into gambling. Therefore, although\nrationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of\nchallenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly\ninfluence the underlying nature of the game. The importance of our results lies\non related implications, as for instance in identifying the limits poker can be\nconsidered as a `skill game' and, as a consequence, which kind of format must\nbe chosen to devise algorithms able to face humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 14:27:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 08:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

In many situations it is desirable to\nallocate the sample, in a way which forces the precision of estimates at the\nsubpopulations level to be both: optimal and identical, while the constraints\nof the total (expected) size of the sample (or samples, in two-stage sampling)\nare imposed.

The next step determines the maintenance scheduling which can help\nto avoid this effect and to extend the system life-time in fault-tolerant mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 15:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}
