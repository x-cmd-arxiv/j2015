In case of railroad transportation systems,\nposition information of railroad vehicles can be detected by GPS, track\ncircuits, and so on. In this paper, position detection based on tags onto\nsleepers of the track is investigated. Position information stored in the tags\nis read by a reader placed at the bottom of running railroad vehicle. Due to\nlimited capacity of battery or its alternative in the tags, power required for\ntransmission of position information to the reader is harvested by the tags\nfrom the power wirelessly transferred from the reader. Basic mechanism in\nwireless power transfer is magnetic induction and power transfer efficiency\naccording to the relative location of the reader to a tag is discussed with\nsimulation results. Since power transfer efficiency is significantly affected\nby the ferromagnetic material (steel) at the bottom of the railroad vehicle and\nthe track, magnetic beam shaping by ferrite material is carried out. With the\nferrite material for magnetic beam shaping, degradation of power transfer\nefficiency due to the steel is substantially reduced. Based on the experimental\nresults, successful wireless power transfer to the tag coil is possible when\ntransmitted power from the reader coil is close to a few watts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 14:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

Both players can move in a\nstraight line to any point within unit distance during their turn. The pursuer\n$P$ wins by capturing the evader, meaning that their distance satisfies $d(P,\nE) \\leq 1$, while the evader wins by eluding capture forever. Both players have\na map of the environment, but they have different sensing capabilities. The\nevader $E$ always knows the location of $P$. Meanwhile, $P$ only has\nline-of-sight visibility: $P$ observes the evader's position only when the line\nsegment connecting them lies entirely within the polygon. Therefore $P$ must\nsearch for $E$ when the evader is hidden from view.\n  We provide a winning strategy for $P$ in two families of polygons: monotone\npolygons and scallop polygons.

In\nlinear settings, temporally growing perturbations in a non-parallel flow\nrepresent unstable eigenmodes of the linear flow operator. In nonlinear\nsettings, self-sustained periodic oscillations of finite amplitude are commonly\ndescribed as nonlinear global modes. In both cases the flow dynamics may be\nqualified as being endogenous, as opposed to the exogenous behaviour of\namplifier flows driven by external forcing. This paper introduces the\nendogeneity concept, a specific definition of the sensitivity of the global\nfrequency and growth rate with respect to variations of the flow operator. The\nendogeneity, defined both in linear and nonlinear settings, characterizes the\ncontribution of localized flow regions to the global eigendynamics. It is\ncalculated in a simple manner as the local point-wise inner product between the\ntime derivative of the direct flow state and an adjoint mode. This study\ndemonstrates for two canonical examples, the Ginzburg-Landau equation and the\nwake of a circular cylinder, how an analysis based on the endogeneity may be\nused for a physical discussion of the mechanisms that drive a global\ninstability. The results are shown to be consistent with earlier 'wavemaker'\ndefinitions found in the literature, but the present formalism enables a more\ndetailed discussion: a clear distinction is made between oscillation frequency\nand growth rate, and individual contributions from the various terms of the\nflow operator can be isolated and separately discussed.

The approach is based on the use of\na chain of single-step time-independent propagating operators. Each operator is\ntime-specific and constructed by combining the Magnus expansion of the\ntime-dependent system Hamiltonian with the Chebyshev expansion of an operator\nexponent. A construction of a unitary matrix of the Floquet operator, which\nevolves a system state over the full modulation period, is performed by\npropagating the identity matrix over the period. The independence of the\nevolutions of basis vectors makes the propagation stage suitable for\nimplementation on a parallel cluster. Once the propagation stage is completed,\na routine diagonalization of the Floquet matrix is performed. Finally, an\nadditional propagation round, now with the eigenvectors as the initial states,\nallows to resolve the time-dependence of the Floquet states and calculate their\ncharacteristics. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the algorithm\nby applying it to calculate the Floquet states of two quantum models, namely\n(i) a synthesized random-matrix Hamiltonian and (ii) a many-body Bose-Hubbard\ndimer, both of the size up to $10^4$ states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Aug 2015 19:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

However, only hints of\ncycle-to-cycle variations were found, without any strict periodicity. In this\ncontext the potential of the CoRoT exoplanetary data base was not fully\nexploited despite the wide area covered on the Galactic plane. Therefore, we\ninvestigated all the candidate Cepheids pointed out by the automatic\nclassification of the CoRoT curves. At the end we could identify seven\nbona-fide Cepheids. The light curves were investigated to remove some\ninstrumental effects. The frequency analysis was particularly delicate since\nthese small effects can be enhanced by the large amplitude, resulting in the\npresence of significant, but spurious, peaks in the power spectrum. Indeed, the\ncareful evaluation of a very attracting peak in the spectra of CoRoT\n0102618121, allowed us to certify its spurious origin. Once that the\ninstrumental effects were properly removed, no additional mode was detected. On\nthe other hand, cycle-to-cycle variations of the Fourier parameters were\nobserved, but very small and always within 3 sigma. Among the seven Cepheids,\nthere are two Pop.

With body-fixed\noptical and inertial sensor measurements, a Lagrangian is obtained as the\ndifference between a kinetic energy-like term that is quadratic in velocity\nestimation error and the sum of two artificial potential functions; one\nobtained from a generalization of Wahba's function for attitude estimation and\nanother which is quadratic in the position estimate error. An additional\ndissipation term that is linear in the velocity estimation error is introduced,\nand the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle is applied to the Lagrangian with this\ndissipation. A Lyapunov analysis shows that the state estimation scheme so\nobtained provides stable asymptotic convergence of state estimates to actual\nstates in the absence of measurement noise, with an almost global domain of\nattraction. This estimation scheme is discretized for computer implementation\nusing discrete variational mechanics, as a first order Lie group variational\nintegrator. The continuous and discrete pose estimation schemes require optical\nmeasurements of at least three inertially fixed landmarks or beacons in order\nto estimate instantaneous pose. The discrete estimation scheme can also\nestimate velocities from such optical measurements. Moreover, all states can be\nestimated during time periods when measurements of only two inertial vectors,\nthe angular velocity vector, and one feature point position vector are\navailable in body frame.

Previous works on Mkn 3, and other AGN, that assumed a reflection\ncontinuum from matter with an infinite column density could therefore lead to\nerroneous or \"puzzling\" conclusions if the matter out of the line-of-sight is\nreally Compton-thin. Whereas studies of samples of AGN have generally only\nprobed the line-of-sight column density, with simplistic, one-dimensional\nmodels, it is important now to establish the global column densities in AGN. It\nis the global properties that affect the energy budget in terms of reprocessing\nof X-rays into infrared emission, and that constrain population synthesis\nmodels of the cosmic X-ray background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 04:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Developing a\ncontinuum theory of dislocations requires the solution of two long standing\nproblems: (i) to represent dislocation kinematics in terms of a reasonable\nnumber of variables and (ii) to derive averaged descriptions of the dislocation\ndynamics (i.e. material laws) in terms of these variables. The kinematic\nproblem (i) was recently solved through the introduction of continuum\ndislocation dynamics (CDD), which provides kinematically consistent evolution\nequations of dislocation alignment tensors, presuming a given average\ndislocation velocity (Hochrainer (2015), Philos. Mag. 95 (12), 1321--1367). In\nthe current paper we demonstrate how a free energy formulation may be used to\nsolve the dynamic closure problem (ii) in CDD. We do so exemplarily for the\nlowest order CDD variant for curved dislocations in a single slip situation. In\nthis case, a thermodynamically consistent average dislocation velocity is found\nto comprise five mesoscopic shear stress contributions. For a postulated free\nenergy expression we identify among these stress contributions a back-stress\nterm and a line-tension term, both of which have already been postulated for\nCDD. A new stress contribution occurs which is missing in earlier CDD models\nincluding the statistical continuum theory of straight parallel edge\ndislocations (Groma et al. (2015), Acta Mater. 51, 1271-1281). Furthermore, two\nentirely new stress contributions arise from the curvature of dislocations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 09:58:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 11:42:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 12:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Focusing on the prediction of the ionization\npotential via the highest occupied Kohn-Sham eigenvalue, we examine a variety\nof exchange-correlation approximations: the local spin-density approximation,\nsemi-local generalized gradient approximations, and global and local hybrid\nfunctionals. Results for a test set of 26 diatomic molecules and single atoms\nare presented. We find that the aforementioned ensemble generalization\nsystematically improves the prediction of the ionization potential, for various\nsystems and exchange-correlation functionals, without compromising the accuracy\nof total energy-related properties. We specifically examine hybrid functionals.\nThese depend on a parameter controlling the ratio of semi-local to non-local\nfunctional components. The ionization potential obtained with\nensemble-generalized functionals is found to depend only weakly on the\nparameter value, contrary to common experience with non-generalized hybrids,\nthus eliminating one aspect of the so-called `parameter dilemma' of hybrid\nfunctionals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 12:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Analytical\nformulae for the disc torque have been derived assuming that the planet evolves\non a fixed circular orbit. However, recent work has shown that in isothermal\ndiscs, a migrating protoplanet may also experience dynamical corotation torques\nthat scale with the planet drift rate. The aim of this study is to examine\nwhether dynamical corotation torques can also affect the migration of low-mass\nplanets in non-isothermal discs. We performed 2D radiative hydrodynamical\nsimulations to examine the orbital evolution outcome of migrating protoplanets\nas a function of disc mass. We find that a protoplanet can enter a fast\nmigration regime when it migrates in the direction set by the entropy-related\nhorseshoe drag and when the Toomre stability parameter is less than a threshold\nvalue below which the horseshoe region contracts into a tadpole-like region. In\nthat case, an underdense trapped region appears near the planet, with an\nentropy excess compared to the ambient disc. If the viscosity and thermal\ndiffusivity are small enough so that the entropy excess is conserved during\nmigration, the planet then experiences strong corotation torques arising from\nthe material flowing across the planet orbit. During fast migration, we observe\nthat a protoplanet can pass through the zero-torque line predicted by static\ntorques. We also find that fast migration may help in disrupting the\nmean-motion resonances that are formed by convergent migration of embryos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 13:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Recently\na general technique of restoration of rhythmicity in diffusively coupled\nnetworks of nonlinear oscillators has been proposed in [Zou et al. Nature\nCommun. 6:7709, 2015], where it is shown that a proper feedback parameter that\ncontrols the rate of diffusion can effectively revive oscillation from an\noscillation suppressed state. In this paper we show that the mean-field\ndiffusive coupling, which can suppress oscillation even in a network of\nidentical oscillators, can be modified in order to revoke the cessation of\noscillation induced by it. Using a rigorous bifurcation analysis we show that,\nunlike other diffusive coupling schemes, here one has {\\it two control\nparameters}, namely the {\\it density of the mean-field} and the {\\it feedback\nparameter} that can be controlled to revive oscillation from a death state. We\ndemonstrate that an appropriate choice of density of the mean-field is capable\nof inducing rhythmicity even in the presence of complete diffusion, which is an\nunique feature of this mean-field coupling that is not available in other\ncoupling schemes.

For distributed RDF\ndata design, it is quite common to partition the RDF data into some parts,\ncalled fragments, which are then distributed. Thus, the distribution design\nconsists of two steps: fragmentation and allocation. In this paper, we propose\na method to explore the intrinsic similarities among the structures of queries\nin a workload for fragmentation and allocation, which aims to reduce the number\nof crossing matches and the communication cost during SPARQL query processing.\nSpecifically, we mine and select some frequent access patterns to reflect the\ncharacteristics of the workload.

Vertical\nfragmentation is for better throughput and horizontal fragmentation is for\nbetter performance. After fragmentation, we discuss how to allocate these\nfragments to various sites.

This paper aims at estimating\nareas of sunspots observed by Schwabe in 1825-1867 and at calculating the tilt\nangles of sunspot groups. The sunspot sizes in Schwabe's drawings are not to\nscale and need to be converted into physical sunspot areas. We employed a\nstatistical approach assuming that the area distribution of sunspots was the\nsame in the 19th century as it was in the 20th century. Umbral areas for about\n130,000 sunspots observed by Schwabe were obtained, as well as the tilt angles\nof sunspot groups assuming them to be bipolar. There is, of course, no polarity\ninformation in the observations. The annually averaged sunspot areas correlate\nreasonably with sunspot number. We derived an average tilt angle by attempting\nto exclude unipolar groups with a minimum separation of the two alleged\npolarities and an outlier rejection method which follows the evolution of each\ngroup and detects the moment it turns unipolar at its decay. As a result, the\ntilt angles, although displaying considerable scatter, place the leading\npolarity on average 5.85+-0.25 closer to the equator, in good agreement with\ntilt angles obtained from 20th-century data sets.

Two interpretational branch points are\nidentified and discussed. First, whether duals are physically equivalent or\nnot: by considering a duality of the familiar simple harmonic oscillator, I\nargue that they are. Unlike the oscillator, there are no measurements 'outside'\nstring theory that could distinguish the duals. Second, whether duals agree or\ndisagree on the radius of 'target space', the space in which strings evolve\naccording to string theory. I argue for the latter position, because the\nalternative leaves it unknown what the radius is. Since duals are physically\nequivalent yet disagree on the radius of target space, it follows that the\nradius is indeterminate between them. Using an analysis of Brandenberger and\nVafa (1989), I explain why -- even so -- space is observed to have a\ndeterminate, large radius. The conclusion is that observed, 'phenomenal' space\nis not target space, since a space cannot have both a determinate and\nindeterminate radius: instead phenomenal space must be a higher-level\nphenomenon, not fundamental.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 13:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}
