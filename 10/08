The similarity in their peak centroids and the significant positive\ncorrelation between their equivalent widths demonstrate that these transitions\ntrace the same atomic gas. The absorption lines are present towards both disk\nand diskless young stellar objects, which excludes cold gas within the\ncircumstellar disk as the absorbing material. A comparison of NaI and CO\ndetections and peak centroids demonstrates that the atomic and molecular gas\nare not co-located, the atomic gas is more extended than the molecular gas. The\nwidth of the atomic lines corroborates this finding and points to atomic gas\nabout an order of magnitude warmer than the molecular gas. The distribution of\nNaI radial velocities shows a clear spatial gradient along the length of the\nTaurus molecular cloud filaments. This suggests that absorption is associated\nwith the Taurus molecular cloud. Assuming the gradient is due to cloud\nrotation, the rotation of the atomic gas is consistent with differential\ngalactic rotation while the rotation of the molecular gas, although with the\nsame rotation axis, is retrograde. Our analysis shows that narrow NaI and KI\nabsorption resonance lines are useful tracers of the atomic envelope of\nmolecular clouds.

We study how the budget constraints of individual traders affect their\nability to impact the market price. As a concrete application of our\ncharacterization, we give sufficient conditions for a property we call budget\nadditivity: two traders with budgets B and B' and the same beliefs would have a\ncombined impact equal to a single trader with budget B+B'. That way, even if a\nsingle trader cannot move the market much, a crowd of like-minded traders can\nhave the same desired effect. When the set of payoff vectors associated with\noutcomes, with coordinates corresponding to securities, is affinely\nindependent, we obtain that a generalization of the heavily-used logarithmic\nmarket scoring rule is budget additive, but the quadratic market scoring rule\nis not.

Landauer's principle dictates that\nthis must dissipate a minimum quantity of heat, proportional to the entropy\nreduction that is incurred by the object, to the thermal reservoir. However,\nthis lower bound is only reachable for some specific physical situations, and\nit is not necessarily achievable for any given reservoir. The main task of our\nwork can be stated as the minimisation of heat dissipation given probabilistic\ninformation erasure, i.e., minimising the amount of energy transferred to the\nthermal reservoir as heat if we require that the probability of preparing the\nobject in a specific pure state $|\\varphi_1\\rangle$ be no smaller than\n$p_{\\varphi_1}^{\\max}-\\delta$.

Our results\nreveal an energetic preference for the TMs lying along the GB sites (TM/GB).\nSuch an energetic preference has been strengthened by increasing the\nconcentration of the TM adatoms; giving rise to TM nanolines on graphene ruled\nby GBs. Further diffusion barrier calculations for Fe adatoms support the\nformation of those TM nanolines. We find that the energy barriers parallel to\nthe GBs are sligthly lower in comparision with those obtained for the defect\nfree graphene; whereas, perpendicularly to the GBs the Fe adatoms face higher\nenergy barriers. Fe and Co (Mn) nanolines are ferromagnetic (ferrimagnetic), in\ncontrast the magnetic state of Ru nanolines is sensitive to the Ru/GB\nadsorption geometry. The electronic properties of those TM nanolines were\ncharacterized through extensive electronic band structure calculations. The\nformation of metallic nanolines is mediated by a strong hybridization between\nthe TM and the graphene ($\\pi$) orbitals along the GB sites. Due to the net\nmagnetization of the TM nanolines, our band structure results indicate an\nanisotropic (spin-polarized) electronic current for some TM/GB systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 19:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-12"}

In an effort to decouple the effect of risk-averse\nplayer preferences from selfish behavior on the degradation of system\nperformance, Nikolova and Stier- Moses [16] defined the concept of the price of\nrisk aversion as the worst-case ratio of the cost of an equilibrium with\nrisk-averse players and that of an equilibrium with risk-neutral users. For\nrisk-averse users who seek to minimize the mean plus variance of travel time on\na path, they proved an upper bound on the price of risk aversion, which is\nindependent of the latency functions, and grows linearly with the size of the\ngraph and players' risk-aversion. In this follow-up paper, we provide a\nmatching lower bound for graphs with number of vertices equal to powers of two,\nvia the construction of a graph family inductively generated from the Braess\ngraph. We also provide conceptually different bounds, which we call functional,\nthat depend on the class of mean latency functions and provide\ncharacterizations that are independent of the network topology (first derived,\nin a more complicated way, by Meir and Parkes [10] in a different context with\ndifferent techniques). We also supplement the upper bound with a new\nasymptotically-tight lower bound. Our third contribution is a tight bound on\nthe price of risk aversion for a family of graphs that generalize\nseries-parallel graphs which applies to users minimizing the mean plus standard\ndeviation of a path, a much more complex model of risk-aversion due to the cost\nof a path being non-additive over edge costs.

We begin with an overview of the Standard Model puzzles, followed by\na description of some classic lepton mixing patterns. Lepton mixing may be\nregarded as a deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing, with charged lepton\ncorrections leading to solar mixing sum rules, or tri-maximal lepton mixing\nleading to atmospheric mixing rules. We survey neutrino mass models, using a\nroadmap based on the open questions in neutrino physics. We then focus on the\nseesaw mechanism with right-handed neutrinos, where sequential dominance (SD)\ncan account for large lepton mixing angles and CP violation, with precise\npredictions emerging from constrained SD (CSD). We define the flavour problem\nand discuss progress towards a theory of flavour using GUTs and discrete family\nsymmetry. We classify models as direct, semidirect or indirect, according to\nthe relation between the Klein symmetry of the mass matrices and the discrete\nfamily symmetry, in all cases focussing on spontaneous CP violation. Finally we\ngive two examples of realistic and highly predictive indirect models with CSD,\nnamely an A to Z of flavour with Pati-Salam and a fairly complete $A_4\\times\nSU(5)$ SUSY GUT of flavour, where both models have interesting implications for\nleptogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 20:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 06:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

Here we propose a formation\nmechanism that skips the common-envelope scenario and relies on triple-body\ndynamics. We study the evolution of hierarchical triples, following the secular\ndynamical evolution up to the octupole-level of approximation, including\ngeneral relativity, tidal effects and post-main-sequence evolution, such as\nmass loss, changes to stellar radii and supernovae. During the dynamical\nevolution of the triple system, the \"eccentric Kozai-Lidov\" mechanism can cause\nlarge eccentricity excitations in the LMXB progenitor, resulting in three main\nBH-LMXB formation channels. Here we define BH-LMXB candidates as systems where\nthe inner BH companion star crosses its Roche limit. In the \"eccentric\" channel\n(~ 81% of the LMXBs in our simulations), the donor star crosses its Roche limit\nduring an extreme eccentricity excitation, while still on a wide orbit. Second,\nwe find a \"giant\" LMXB channel (~ 11%), where a system undergoes only moderate\neccentricity excitations, but the donor star fills its Roche lobe after\nevolving toward the giant branch. Third, we identify a \"classical\" channel\n(~8%), where tidal forces and magnetic braking shrink and circularize the orbit\nto short periods, triggering mass transfer. Finally, for the giant channel, we\npredict an eccentric ($\\sim 0.3-0.6$), preferably inclined (~40, ~140 degreed)\ntertiary, typically on a wide enough orbit (~10^4AU), to potentially become\nunbound later in the triple evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 20:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

These `planetesimals' can then\nefficiently accrete leftover pebbles and directly form the cores of giant\nplanets. This model known as `pebble accretion', theoretically, can produce 10\nM$_\\oplus$ cores in only a few thousand years. Unfortunately, full simulations\nof this process show that, rather than creating a few 10 M$_\\oplus$ cores, it\nproduces a population of hundreds of Earth-mass objects that are inconsistent\nwith the structure of the Solar System. Here we report that this difficulty can\nbe overcome if pebbles form slowly enough to allow the planetesimals to\ngravitationally interact with one another. In this situation the largest\nplanetesimals have time to scatter their smaller siblings out of the disk of\npebbles, thereby stifling their growth.

Robust detections of Zeeman\nsignatures at all observed epochs indicate a surface magnetic field, with\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths varying between 1.0-3.2 G. Radial\nvelocity variations from night to night modulate on a similar timescale to the\nlongitudinal magnetic field measurements. These variations are therefore likely\ndue to the rotational modulation of stellar active regions rather than the much\nlonger timescale of the planetary orbit (Porb=528 d). Both the longitudinal\nmagnetic field measurements and radial velocity variations are consistent with\na rotation period of 10 +/- 2 days, which are also consistent with the measured\nchromospheric activity level of the star (log R'(HK)=-4.64). Together, these\nquantities indicate a low inclination angle, i~18 degrees. We present\npreliminary magnetic field maps of the star based on the above period and find\na simple poloidal large-scale field.

Semiconducting behavior is\nobserved at low electron densities $n$, but at high values of n the resistivity\ndecreases by a factor > 7 upon cooling to 2 K and displays a metallic\n$T^2$-dependence. This indicates that the band structure of\n1T$^{\\prime}$-ReS$_2$ is quite susceptible to an electric field applied\nperpendicularly to the layers. The electric-field induced metallic state\nobserved in transition metal dichalcogenides was recently claimed to result\nfrom a percolation type of transition. Instead, through a scaling analysis of\nthe conductivity as a function of $T$ and $n$, we find that the metallic state\nof ReS$_2$ results from a second-order metal to insulator transition driven by\nelectronic correlations. This gate-induced metallic state offers an alternative\nto phase engineering for producing ohmic contacts and metallic interconnects in\ndevices based on transition metal dichalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 20:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The spectral region covered by\nCIRS focal planes (FP) 3 and 4 is rich in emissivity features, but previous\nstudies at these wavelengths have been limited by low signal to noise ratios\n(S/Rs) for individual spectra. Our approach is to average CIRS FP3 spectra to\nincrease the S/R and use emissivity spectra to constrain the composition of the\ndark material on Iapetus. We find an emissivity feature at ~855 cm-1 and a\npossible doublet at 660 and 690 cm-1 that do not correspond to any known\ninstrument artifacts. We attribute the 855 cm-1 feature to fine-grained\nsilicates, similar to those found in dust on Mars and in meteorites, which are\nnearly featureless at shorter wavelengths. Silicates on the dark terrains of\nSaturn's icy moons have been suspected for decades, but there have been no\ndefinitive detections until now. Serpentines reported in the literature at\nambient temperature and pressure have features near 855 and 660 cm-1. However,\npeaks can shift depending on temperature and pressure, so measurements at\nIapetus-like conditions are necessary for more positive feature\nidentifications. As a first investigation, we measured muscovite at 125K in a\nvacuum and found that this spectrum does match the emissivity feature near 855\ncm-1 and the location of the doublet.

These eigenvalues can be produced by strong\nheterogeneity in the underlying physics. We can improve the quality of the\nspectrum by \"deflating\" the harmful eigenvalues. In this work, deflation is\napplied to linear systems in reservoir simulation. In particular, large, sudden\ndifferences in the permeability produce extreme eigenvalues. The number and\nmagnitude of these eigenvalues is linked to the number and magnitude of the\npermeability jumps. Two deflation methods are discussed. Firstly, we state that\nharmonic Ritz eigenvector deflation, which computes the deflation vectors from\nthe information produced by the linear solver, is unfeasible in modern\nreservoir simulation due to high costs and lack of parallelism. Secondly, we\ntest a physics-based subdomain-levelset deflation algorithm that constructs the\ndeflation vectors a priori. Numerical experiments show that both methods can\nimprove the performance of the linear solver. We highlight the fact that\nsubdomain-levelset deflation is particularly suitable for a parallel\nimplementation. For cases with well-defined permeability jumps of a factor 104\nor higher, parallel physics-based deflation has potential in commercial\napplications. In particular, the good scalability of parallel\nsubdomain-levelset deflation combined with the robust parallel preconditioner\nfor deflated system suggests the use of this method as an alternative for AMG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 21:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

An observer far from a star\nis most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile that\ndecays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,\nwhich is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.\nThe presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrain\nextended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for\nslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar\ncharge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black\nhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries.

We acquired observations of\nOI emission in these comets with the ARCES echelle spectrometer mounted on the\n3.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory and observations of OH with the\nSwift observatory (PanSTARRS) and with Keck HIRES (Jager). The CO2/H2O ratios\nderived from the Spitzer images are 12.6 +/- 1.3% (PanSTARRS), 28.9 +/- 3.6%\n(LINEAR), and 31.3 +/- 4.2% (Jager). These abundances are derived under the\nassumption that contamination from CO emission is negligible. The CO2 abundance\nfor PanSTARRS is close to the average abundance measured in comets at similar\nheliocentric distance to date, while the abundances measured for LINEAR and\nJager are significantly larger than the average abundance. From the coma\nmorphology observed in PanSTARRS and the assumed gas expansion velocity, we\nderive a rotation period for the nucleus of about 9.2 hours. Comparison of H2O\nproduction rates derived from ARCES and Swift data, as well as other\nobservations, suggest the possibility of sublimation from icy grains in the\ninner coma. We evaluate the possibility that the OI emission can be employed as\na proxy for CO2 by comparing CO2/H2O ratios inferred from the OI lines to those\nmeasured directly by Spitzer. We find that for PanSTARRS we can reproduce the\nobserved CO2 abundance to an accuracy of ~20%. For LINEAR and Jager, we were\nonly able to obtain upper limits on the CO2 abundance inferred from the OI\nlines. These upper limits are consistent with the CO2 abundances measured by\nSpitzer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 23:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 23:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We discuss some of\nthe challenges for this technology, for which balancing the goal of achieving\nthe best sensitivity with that of cost effective scale-up requires optimization\nover a large parameter space. Critical for this are the precision measurements\nof the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down\nto the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a\nbenchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could\nbe used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter\nexperiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal-\nto-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The\nperformance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays,\ngamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and\nnuclear recoil tracks. Stable effective gas gains of greater than $1 \\times\n10^5$ were obtained in 100 Torr of pure CF$_4$ by a cascade of three standard\nCERN GEMs each with a 140 $\\mu$m pitch.

A better approach would be to jointly model the\neffects of all players, and any other confounding information, in order to\ninfer a partial effect for this individual: his influence on the box score\nregardless of who else is on the ice.\n  This chapter describes and illustrates a simple algorithm for recovering such\npartial effects.

First, we provide a logistic\nregression model that can predict which team has scored a given goal as a\nfunction of who was on the ice, what teams were playing, and details of the\ngame situation (e.g. full-strength or power-play).

Our\nconstruction automatically yields routing algorithms for GQ* and we empirically\ncompare GQ* (and its routing algorithms) with the established datacenter\nnetworks FiConn and DPillar (and their routing algorithms); this comparison is\nwith respect to network throughput, latency, load balancing, fault-tolerance,\nand cost to build, and is with regard to all-to-all, many all-to-all,\nbutterfly, and random traffic patterns.

Using our model parameters, we find that\nthe emission at 235 MHz peaked around day 35 which is consistent with our GMRT\nobservations. The two main results of our study are: (1) The radio emission at\na given frequency is visible sooner after the outburst in successive outbursts\nof both V745 Scorpii and RS Ophiuchi.

In this\nproblem, two processes numbered 0 and 1 can call two procedures: update and\nFscan. A parameter of the problem is a two- variable function $F(x_0,x_1)$.\nEach process $p_i$ can assign values to variable $x_i$ by calling update(v)\nwith some data value v, and compute the value: $F(x_0,x_1)$ by executing an\nFscan procedure. The problem is interesting when the domain of $F$ is infinite\nand the range of $F$ is finite. In this case, some \"access restrictions\" are\nimposed that limit the size of the registers that the Fscan procedure can\naccess. Aguilera et al. provided a non-blocking solution and asked whether a\nwait-free solution exists. A positive answer can be found in [7].\n  The natural generalization of the two-process signaling problem to an\narbitrary number of processes turns out to yield an interesting generalization\nof the fundamental snapshot problem, which we call the F-snapshot problem.

This paper studies the problem of\nsummarizing graph streams. Specifically, given a graph stream G, directed or\nundirected, the objective is to summarize G as S with much smaller (sublinear)\nspace, linear construction time and constant maintenance cost for each edge\nupdate, such that S allows many queries over G to be approximately conducted\nefficiently. Due to the sheer volume and highly dynamic nature of graph\nstreams, summarizing them remains a notoriously hard, if not impossible,\nproblem. The widely used practice of summarizing data streams is to treat each\nelement independently by e.g., hash- or sampling-based method, without keeping\ntrack of the connections between elements in a data stream, which gives these\nsummaries limited power in supporting complicated queries over graph streams.\nThis paper discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for summarizing graph\nstreams. We present gLava, a probabilistic graph model that, instead of\ntreating an edge (a stream element) as the operating unit, uses the finer\ngrained node in an element. This will naturally form a new graph sketch where\nedges capture the connections inside elements, and nodes maintain relationships\nacross elements. We discuss a wide range of supported graph queries and\nestablish theoretical error bounds for basic queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 07:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

It is actually a left-\nor right- free module, not a linear vector space.\n  This paper establishes a systematic frame work for the theory of linear QDEs,\nwhich can be applied to quantum mechanics, fluid mechanics, Frenet frame in\ndifferential geometry, kinematic modelling, attitude dynamics, Kalman filter\ndesign and spatial rigid body dynamics, etc. We prove that the algebraic\nstructure of the solutions to the QDEs is actually a left- or right- module,\nnot a linear vector space. On the non-commutativity of the quaternion algebra,\nmany concepts and properties for the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can\nnot be used. They should be redefined accordingly. A definition of Wronskian is\nintroduced under the framework of quaternions which is different from standard\none in the ordinary differential equations. Liouville formula for QDEs is\ngiven. Also, it is necessary to treat the eigenvalue problems with left- and\nright-sides, accordingly. Upon these, we studied the solutions to the linear\nQDEs.

Parallel-in-time schemes are a possible\nway to increase, on the algorithmic level, the amount of parallelism, a\nrequirement arising from the rapidly growing number of CPUs in high performance\ncomputer systems. A recently introduced modification of the \"parallel implicit\ntime-integration algorithm\" could successfully solve hyperbolic problems\narising in structural dynamics.

The present paper adapts this modified Parareal and employs it for\nthe solution of a hyperbolic flow problem, where the initial value problem\nsolved in parallel arises from the spatial discretization of a partial\ndifferential equation by a finite difference method. It is demonstrated that\nthe modified Parareal is stable and can produce reasonably accurate solutions\nwhile allowing for a noticeable reduction of the time-to-solution. The\nimplementation relies on integration schemes already widely used in NWP (RK-3,\npartially split forward Euler, forward-backward).

One of the best\nexamples of this scaling is the empirical \"Fundamental Plane of Black Hole\nAccretion\" relation linking mass, radio and X-ray luminosity over eight orders\nof magnitude in black hole mass. The currently favored theoretical\ninterpretation of this relation is that the physics governing power output in\nweakly accreting black holes depends more on relative accretion rate than on\nmass. In order to test this theory, we explore whether a mass-invariant\napproach can simultaneously explain the broadband spectral energy distributions\nfrom two black holes at opposite ends of the mass scale but at similar\nEddington accretion fractions.

The interaction between the vortex magnetic\nmoment and a spatially homogeneous in-plane magnetic field gives rise to a\ntunable periodic non-sinusoidal potential which is strongly dependent on the\nannulus aspect ratio. We study the escape of the vortex from a well in the\ntilted potential when the bias current exceeds the depinning current. The\nsmallest depinning current as well as the lowest sensitivity of the annulus to\nthe external field is achieved when the eccentricity is equal to -1. The\npresented extensive numerical results are in good agreement with the findings\nof the perturbative approach. We also probe the rectifying properties of an\nasymmetric potential implemented with an egg-shaped annulus formed by two\nsemi-elliptic arcs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 09:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In the considered scenario, multiple acoustic\nsensor nodes within communication range of a cluster head are grouped into\nclusters.

Detection by acoustic sensors can\nbe executed periodically or randomly and random detection by acoustic sensors\nis event driven. As a result, each acoustic sensor generates their packets\n(50bytes each) periodically or randomly over short time intervals\n(400ms~4seconds) and transmits directly to a cluster head (coordinator node).\nOur approach proposes to use a slotted carrier sense multiple access. All\nacoustic sensor nodes in a cluster are allocated to time slots and the number\nof allocated sensor nodes to each time slot is uniform. All sensor nodes\nallocated to a time slot listen for packet transmission from the beginning of\nthe time slot for a duration proportional to their priority. The first node\nthat detect the channel to be free for its whole window is allowed to transmit.\nThe order of packet transmissions with the acoustic sensor nodes in the time\nslot is autonomously adjusted according to the history of packet transmissions\nin the time slot.

The local\nstate of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is encoded in the spectrum of a\nbackground source (radio-loud quasars or gamma ray burst afterglow) by\nabsorption at the local 21-cm wavelength, resulting in a continuous and\nfluctuating absorption level. Small-scale structures (filaments and minihaloes)\nin the IGM are responsible for the strongest absorption features. The\nabsorption can also be modulated on large scales by inhomogeneous heating and\nWouthuysen-Field coupling.\n  We present the results from a simulation that attempts to preserve the\ncosmological environment while resolving some of the small-scale structures (a\nfew kpc resolution in a 50 Mpc/h box). The simulation couples the dynamics and\nthe ionizing radiative transfer and includes X-ray and Lyman lines radiative\ntransfer for a detailed physical modelling. As a result we find that soft X-ray\nself-shielding, Lyman-alpha self-shielding and shock heating all have an impact\non the predicted values of the 21-cm optical depth of moderately overdense\nstructures like filaments. An correct treatment of the peculiar velocities is\nalso critical. Modelling these processes seems necessary for accurate\npredictions and can be done only at high enough resolution. As a result, based\non our fiducial model, we estimate that LOFAR should be able to detect a few\n(strong) absorptions features in a frequency range of a few tens of MHz for a\n20 mJy source located at z=10, while the SKA would extract a large fraction of\nthe absorption information for the same source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 12:46:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

In the region of this extra scalar\nbeing lighter than a couple of hundreds of GeVs, we argue that the higher-loop\ncalculation is a more reliable approach than the effective field theory\ncalculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 13:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

The\nstrategy is formulated in the spirit of computational homogenization methods\n(FE$^2$) and is based on the discrete version of Hill's averaging results\nrecently derived by the authors. In particular, the traditional static\nmultiscale scheme is proved here to be equivalent to a direct homogenization of\nthe principle of minimum potential energy and to hold exactly under a finite\nelement discretization. This perspective provides a unifying variational\nframework for the FE$^2$ method, in the static setting, with Dirichlet or\nNeumann boundary conditions on the representative volume element; and it\ndirectly manifests the approximate duality of the effective strain energy\ndensity obtained with these two types of boundary conditions in the sense of\nLegendre transformation. Its generalization to arbitrary loading conditions and\nmaterial constitutive relations is then immediate through the incremental\nminimum formulation of the dynamic problem \\`a la Radovitzky and Ortiz (1999),\nwhich, in the discrete setting, is in full analogy to the static problem. These\ntheoretical developments are then translated into an efficient multiscale\nFE$^2$ computational strategy for the homogenization of a microscopic explicit\ndynamics scheme, with two noteworthy properties. Firstly, each time incremental\nproblem can be solved exactly with a single Newton-Raphson iteration with a\nconstant Hessian, regardless of the specific non-linearities or\nhistory-dependence of the micro-constituents' behavior. Secondly, the scheme\nconcurrently solves for the microscopic and macroscopic degrees of freedom, in\ncontrast to standard approaches based on sequential or nested minimizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 13:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

However, if the loci are incongruent--due to events\nsuch as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer--it can be\nmisleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions\nhave taken a mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes.\nAlternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies\nmight arise. Such \"process-agnostic\" approaches typically infer a tree for each\nlocus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree\ndistance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context\nof tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model\nselection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable\nnumber of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is\npoorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of\nphylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common\nevolutionary history.

In contrast, we learn an explicit\nhigh-order MGRF structure by considering the learning process in terms of\ngeneral exponential family distributions nested over base models, so that\npotentials added later can build on previous ones. We relatively rapidly add\nnew features by skipping over the costly optimisation of parameters.\n  We introduce the use of local binary patterns as features in MGRF texture\nmodels, and generalise them by learning offsets to the surrounding pixels.\nThese prove effective as high-order features, and are fast to compute. Several\nschemes for selecting high-order features by composition or search of a small\nsubclass are compared. Additionally we present a simple modification of the\nmaximum likelihood as a texture modelling-specific objective function which\naims to improve generalisation by local windowing of statistics.\n  The proposed method was experimentally evaluated by learning high-order MGRF\nmodels for a broad selection of complex textures and then performing texture\nsynthesis, and succeeded on much of the continuum from stochastic through\nirregularly structured to near-regular textures. Learning interaction structure\nis very beneficial for textures with large-scale structure, although those with\ncomplex irregular structure still provide difficulties. The texture models were\nalso quantitatively evaluated on two tasks and found to be competitive with\nother works: grading of synthesised textures by a panel of observers; and\ncomparison against several recent MGRF models by evaluation on a constrained\ninpainting task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 15:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

Specifically, mode one corresponds to the desired\nsignal plus noise observation mode (\\emph{valid}), and mode two corresponds to\nthe pure noise mode (\\emph{invalid}) due to node defect or damage. With no\nprior information on such local sensing modes, we introduce a learning-based\ndistributed procedure, called the mixed detection-estimation (MDE) algorithm,\nbased on iterative closed-loop interactions between mode learning (detection)\nand target estimation.
