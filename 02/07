Absorption due to neutral Hydrogen in the IGM makes quasars beyond a\nredshift of z~6.5 very faint in the optical $z$-band, thus locating quasars at\nhigher redshifts require large surveys that are sensitive above 1 micron. We\nreport the discovery of three new z>6.5 quasars, corresponding to an age of the\nuniverse of <850 Myr, selected as z-band dropouts in the Pan-STARRS1 survey.\nThis increases the number of known z>6.5 quasars from 4 to 7. The quasars have\nredshifts of z=6.50, 6.52, and 6.66, and include the brightest z-dropout quasar\nreported to date, PSO J036.5078+03.0498 with M_1450=-27.4.

This makes classical mass renormalization necessary\nand, in the special relativistic domain, leads to the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac\nequation of motion possessing unphysical run-away and pre-acceleration\nsolutions. In this paper we investigate whether the higher-order modification\nof classical vacuum electrodynamics suggested by Bopp, Lande, Thomas and\nPodolsky in the 1940s, can provide a solution to this problem. Since the theory\nis linear, Green-function techniques enable one to write the field of a charged\npoint particle on Minkowski spacetime as an integral over the particle's\nhistory. By introducing the notion of timelike worldlines that are \"bounded\naway from the backward light-cone\" we are able to prescribe criteria for the\nconvergence of such integrals. We also exhibit a timelike worldline yielding\nsingular fields on a lightlike hyperplane in spacetime. In this case the field\nis mildly singular at the event where the particle crosses the hyperplane. Even\nin the case when the Bopp-Podolsky field is bounded, it exhibits a directional\ndiscontinuity as one approaches the point particle. We describe a procedure for\nassigning a value to the field on the particle worldline which enables one to\ndefine a finite Lorentz self-force.

The dominance of aqueous\nNaCl is a feature that Enceladus' ocean shares with terrestrial seawater, but\nthe ubiquity of dissolved Na2CO3 suggests that soda lakes are more analogous to\nthe Enceladus ocean. The high pH implies that the hydroxide ion should be\nrelatively abundant, while divalent metals should be present at low\nconcentrations owing to buffering by clays and carbonates on the ocean floor.\nThe high pH is interpreted to be a key consequence of serpentinization of\nchondritic rock, as predicted by prior geochemical reaction path models;\nalthough degassing of CO2 from the ocean may also play a role depending on the\nefficiency of mixing processes in the ocean. Serpentinization leads to the\ngeneration of H2, a geochemical fuel that can support both abiotic and\nbiological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected\nin Enceladus' plume.

A state-of-the-art ultra-low threshold nanolaser has been\nsuccessfully developed though embedding quantum dots into photonic crystal\ncavity (PhCC). However, several core challenges impede the practical\napplications of this architecture, including the random positions and\ncompositional fluctuations of the dots, extreme difficulty in current\ninjection, and lack of compatibility with electronic circuits. Here, we report\na new strategy to lase, where atomically thin crystalline semiconductor, i.e.,\na tungsten-diselenide (WSe2) monolayer, is nondestructively and\ndeterministically introduced as a gain medium at the surface of a\npre-fabricated PhCC.

Our protocol shows performance\ngains up to 46.6% in terms of average error probability over its conventional\ncounterpart, in addition to performance gains of about 48.7% in terms of\naverage energy expenditure and savings up to 50% in incurred transmission\noverhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 18:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

We carried out large-scale transcriptomic and\nmetabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of the brown algal\nmodel E. siliculosus to Cu stress, and compared these data to results known for\nother abiotic stressors. This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative\nstress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between\nCu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the\nactivation of the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways,\ntogether with the regulation of genes coding for several\ntranscription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically\nactivated a set of genes coding for orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type\nATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent\nbromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally\nwe observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic\nprocesses on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen\nassimilation on the other hand.

Here we report how, by combining a\nstatistically robust helicity rule for a CME's solar origin with a simplified\nflux rope topology the magnetic vectors within the Earth-directed segment of a\nCME can be predicted. In order to test the validity of this proof-of-concept\narchitecture for estimating the magnetic vectors within CMEs, a total of eight\nCME events (between 2010 and 2014) have been investigated.

We used deep, JHKs images from the newly commissioned\nGemini-GeMS/GSAOI instrument, complemented with Spitzer IRAC observations, in\norder to study the photometric properties of the young stellar cluster. GeMS is\nan AO instrument, delivering almost diffraction limited images over a field of\n2' across. The exquisite angular resolution allows us to reach a limiting\nmagnitude of J = 22 for 98% completeness. The combination of the IRAC\nphotometry with our JHKs catalog is used to build color-color diagrams, and\nselect Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) candidates. We detect the presence of 80\nYoung Stellar Object (YSO) candidates. Those YSOs are used to infer the cluster\nage, which is found to be in the range 1 to 5 Myr. We find that 1/3 of the YSOs\nare in a range between 3 to 5 Myr, while 2/3 of the YSO are < 3 Myr. When\nlooking at the spatial distribution of these two populations, we evidence a\npotential age gradient across the field, suggesting sequential star formation.\nWe construct the IMF, and show that we can sample the mass distribution well\ninto the brown dwarf regime (down to 0.01 Msun). The logarithmic mass function\nrises to peak at 0.3 Msun, before turning over and declining into the brown\ndwarf regime. The total cluster mass derived is estimated to be 78 +/- 18 Msun,\nwhile the ratio of brown dwarfs to star derived is 18 p/- 5 %. When comparing\nwith other young clusters, we find that the IMF shape of the young cluster\nembedded within RCW 41 is consistent with those of Trapezium, IC 348 or\nChamaeleon I, except for the IMF peak, which happens to be at higher mass.

Due to this nature, crowdsourcers (or\ntask requesters) often face uncertainty about the workers' capabilities which,\nin turn, affects the quality and timeliness of the results obtained. Trust is a\nmechanism used by people to facilitate interactions in human societies where\nrisk and uncertain are common. The crucial challenge to building a robust\ncrowdsourcing system is how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to\nefficiently utilize the capacities of workers (or trustee agents) to achieve\nhigh social welfare?\n  This book presents the research addressing this challenge. It goes beyond the\nexisting trust management research framework by removing a widespread\nassumption implicitly adopted by existing research: that a trustee agent can\nprocess an unlimited number of interaction requests per discrete time unit\nwithout compromising its performance as perceived by the task requesters (or\ntruster agents). Decision support in crowdsourcing is re-formalized as a\nmulti-agent trust game based on the principles of the Congestion Game, which is\nsolved by two trust-aware interaction decision-making approaches: 1) the Social\nWelfare Optimizing approach for Reputation-aware Decision-making (SWORD)\napproach, and 2) the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair\nutilization of Trustee agents (DRAFT). SWORD is designed for centralized\nsystems, while DRAFT is designed for fully distributed systems. Theoretical\nanalyses have shown that the social welfare produced by these two approaches\ncan be made closer to optimal by adjusting only one key parameter. With these\ntwo approaches, the framework of research for crowdsourcing systems can be\nenriched to handle more realistic scenarios where workers have varied and\nlimited capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 07:23:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 02:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

Numerious experiments have been\nperformed to explore the translational properties. Diverse models have also\nbeen developed to determine the biochemical mechanism of translation. However,\nto simplify the majority of the existing models, the frameshifting of ribosome\nalong the mRNA transcript is neglected, which actually occurs in real cells and\nhas been extensively experimentally studied. The frameshifting of ribosome\nevidently influences the efficiency and speed of translation, considering that\nthe peptide chains synthesized by shifted ribosomes will not fold into\nfunctional proteins and will degrade rapidly. In this study, a theoretical\nmodel is presented to describe the translational process based on the model for\ntotally asymmetric simple exclusion process. In this model, the frameshifting\nof the ribosome along the mRNA transcript and the attachment/detachment of the\nribosome to/from the main body of mRNA codons during translation elongation\nprocess, are explicitly included. The results show that, with ribosome\nframeshifing, the speed of correctly synthesized peptide chains may increase\nfirst and then decrease with both the translation initiation rate $\\alpha$ and\nthe ribosome detachment rate $\\omega_d$. This results indicates that regulating\nthe translation process to reach maximal synthesized speed of proteins is\ntheoretically feasible. Traffic-related problems of ribosome motion along the\nmRNA transcript are also addressed theoretically. Depending on parameter\nvalues, shock wave (or domain wall) may exist for ribosome probabilities along\nthe mRNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 07:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

While phonon-electron\ncoupling has been suggested to influence the formation of CDW order in\nquasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) systems, the presumed dominant importance of\nFermi-surface nesting remains largely unquestioned in quasi-1D systems. Here we\nshow that phonon-electron coupling is also important for the CDW formation in a\nmodel quasi-1D system ZrTe$_3$. Our joint experimental and computational study\nreveals that particular lattice vibrational patterns possess exceedingly strong\ncoupling to the conduction electrons, and are directly linked to the lattice\ndistortions associated with the CDW order. The dependence of the coupling\nmatrix elements on electron momentum further dictates the opening of (partial)\nelectronic gaps in the CDW phase. Since lattice distortions and electronic gaps\nare the defining signatures of CDW order, our result demonstrates that the\nconventional wisdom based on Fermi-surface geometry needs to be substantially\nsupplemented by phonon-electron coupling even in the simplest quasi-1D case. As\nprerequisites for the CDW formation, the highly anisotropic electronic\nstructure and strong phonon-electron coupling in ZrTe$_3$ give rise to a\ndistinct Raman scattering effect, namely, measured phonon linewidths depend on\nthe direction of momentum transfer in the scattering process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 10:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

We minimize the total network power consumption by jointly\noptimizing the downlink beamformer, the uplink transmit power, and the antenna\nselection. To overcome the intractability of the resulting problem, we\nreformulate it as an optimization problem with decoupled binary selection\nvariables and non-convex constraints.

This is challenging\nsince whilst many flows are governed by a set of nonlinear, partial\ndifferential-algebraic equations (the Navier-Stokes equations), the majority of\nestablished control theory assumes models of much greater simplicity, in that\nthey are firstly: linear, secondly: described by ordinary differential\nequations, and thirdly: finite-dimensional. Linearisation, where appropriate,\novercomes the first disparity, but attempts to reconcile the remaining two have\nproved difficult. This paper addresses these two problems as follows. Firstly,\na numerical approach is used to project the governing equations onto a\ndivergence-free basis, thus converting a system of differential-algebraic\nequations into one of ordinary differential equations. This dispenses with the\nneed for analytical velocity-vorticity transformations, and thus simplifies the\nmodelling of boundary sensing and actuation. Secondly, this paper presents a\nnovel and straightforward approach for obtaining suitable low-order models of\nfluid flows, from which robust feedback controllers can be synthesised that\nprovide a priori guarantees of robust performance when connected to the\n(infinite-dimensional) linearised flow system. This approach overcomes many of\nthe problems inherent in approaches that rely upon model-reduction. To\nillustrate these methods, a perturbation shear stress controller is designed\nand applied to plane channel flow, assuming arrays of wall mounted shear-stress\nsensors and transpiration actuators. DNS results demonstrate robust attenuation\nof the perturbation shear-stresses across a wide range of Reynolds numbers with\na single, linear controller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 15:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

The topological\nproperties of the random rectangular graphs (RRGs) generated by this model are\nthen studied as a function of the rectangle sides lengths a and b=1/a, and the\nradius r used to connect the nodes. When a=1 we recover the RGG, and when\na-->infinity the very elongated rectangle generated resembles a one-dimensional\nRGG. We obtain here analytical expressions for the average degree, degree\ndistribution, connectivity, average path length and clustering coefficient for\nRRG. These results provide evidence that show that most of these properties\ndepend on the connection radius and the side length of the rectangle, usually\nin a monotonic way. The clustering coefficient, however, increases when the\nsquare is transformed into a slightly elongated rectangle, and after this\nmaximum it decays with the increase of the elongation of the rectangle.

To construct\nthe CP and TS, two centroids are required: the protein molecular centroid\n(global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid, LC). The CP is\ndefined as the plane passing through the LBS centroid (LC) and normal to the\nline passing through the LC and the protein molecular centroid (GC). The\n\"anterior side\" of the CP is the side not containing the GC (which the\n\"posterior\" side does). The TS is defined as the sphere with center at GC and\ntangent to the CP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms (a.) inside the TS,\nand (b.) on the anterior side of the CP, are two complementary measures of\nligand or LBS burial depth since the latter is directly proportional to (b.)\nand inversely proportional to (a.). We tested the CP and TS methods using a\ntest set of 67 well characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski et al.,\n1996), as well as the theoretical case of an artificial protein in the form of\na cubic lattice grid of points in the overall shape of a sphere and in which\nLBS of any depth can be specified. Results from both the CP and TS methods\nagree very well with data reported by Laskowski et al., and results from the\ntheoretical case further confirm that that both methods are suitable measures\nof ligand or LBS burial. Prior to this study, there were no such numerical\nmeasures of LBS burial available, and hence no way to directly and objectively\ncompare LBS depths in different proteins. LBS burial depth is an important\nparameter as it is usually directly related to the amount of conformational\nchange a protein undergoes upon ligand binding, and ability to quantify it\ncould allow meaningful comparison of protein dynamics and flexibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 04:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}
