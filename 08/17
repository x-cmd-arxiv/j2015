Relational learning algorithms learn the definition of a new relation\nin terms of existing relations in the database.

Unfortunately, the output of current\nrelational learning algorithms tends to vary quite substantially over the\nchoice of schema, both in terms of learning accuracy and efficiency. This\nvariation complicates their off-the-shelf application. In this paper, we\nintroduce and formalize the property of schema independence of relational\nlearning algorithms, and study both the theoretical and empirical dependence of\nexisting algorithms on the common class of (de) composition schema\ntransformations. We study both sample-based learning algorithms, which learn\nfrom sets of labeled examples, and query-based algorithms, which learn by\nasking queries to an oracle. We prove that current relational learning\nalgorithms are generally not schema independent. For query-based learning\nalgorithms we show that the (de) composition transformations influence their\nquery complexity. We propose Castor, a sample-based relational learning\nalgorithm that achieves schema independence by leveraging data dependencies.

One definition involves the three dimensional (3D) peculiar velocity,\nwhile the other is based on its radial component alone. Different methods\nattempt at inferring $\\bf B$ for either of these definitions which coincide\nonly for a constant velocity field.

Diffusion equations are simple and\ncomputationally efficient but are widely believed to break down when the\ncharacteristic length scale is similar or less than the phonon mean-free-path.\nBuilding on our prior work, we demonstrate how well-known diffusion equations,\nnamely the hyperbolic heat equation and the Cattaneo equation, can be used to\nmodel ballistic phonon effects in frequency-dependent periodic steady-state\nthermal transport. Our analytical solutions are found to compare excellently to\nrigorous numerical results of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The\ncorrect physical boundary conditions can be different from those traditionally\nused and are paramount for accurately capturing ballistic effects. To\nillustrate the technique, we consider a simple model problem using two\ndifferent, commonly-used heating conditions. We demonstrate how this framework\ncan easily handle detailed material properties, by considering the case of bulk\nsilicon using a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution.

On\nthe other hand, as it is argued in the paper, if one believes that testability\nof predictions is the most fundamental property of any physical theory, one\nneed to accept that quantum mechanics must be an effectively calculable (and\nthus mathematically constructive) theory. With that, a way to reformulate\nquantum mechanics constructively, while keeping its mathematical foundation\nunchanged, leads to hypercomputation. In contrast, the proposed in the paper\nsuperselection rule, which acts by effectively forbidding a coherent\nsuperposition of quantum states corresponding to potential and actual infinity,\ncan introduce computable constructivism in a quantum mechanical theory with no\nneed for hypercomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 23:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

The device and the method are based on an electromagnetic-mechanical\npulser (EMMP) that consists of a series of transverse deflecting cavities and\nmagnetic quadrupoles. The EMMP modulates and chops the incoming dc electron\nbeam and converts it into pico- and sub-pico-second (100 fs to 10 ps) electron\npulse sequences at >1 GHz repetition rates. Applying the EMMP to a transmission\nelectron microscope (TEM) with any dc electron source, a GHz stroboscopic\nhigh-duty-cycle TEM can be realized. Unlike in many recent developments in\ntime-resolved TEM that rely on a sample pumping laser paired with a laser\nlaunching electrons from a photocathode to probe the sample, there is no laser\nin the presented experimental set-up. This is expected to be a significant\nrelief for electron microscopists who are not familiar with laser systems. The\nEMMP and the sample are externally driven by a radiofrequency (RF) source\nsynchronized through a delay line. With no laser pumping the sample, the\nproblem of the laser induced residual heating/damaging the sample is\neliminated. As many RF-driven processes can be cycled indefinitely, sampling\nrates of 1-50 GHz become accessible. Such a GHz stroboscopic TEM would open up\na new paradigm for in situ and in operando experiments to study samples\nexternally driven electromagnetically. Complementary to the lower (MHz)\nrepetition rates experiments enabled by laser photocathode TEM, new experiments\nin the high rep-rate multi-GHz regime will be enabled by the proposed RF\ndesign.

Its\nmeasurement, especially for the case of antiferromagnetic ordering, however, is\ngenerally difficult to be achieved. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of\nmagnetic ordering detection using a noncontact and nondestructive optical\nmethod. Taking the compressive strained tetragonal BiFeO3 (BFO) as an example\nand combining density functional theory calculations with the minimal one-band\ntight-binding models, we find that when BFO changes from C1-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase to G-type AFM phase, the top of valance band\nshifts from the Z point to {\\Gamma} point, which makes the original direct band\ngap become indirect. This can be explained by the two-center Slater-Koster\nparameters using the Harrison approach. The impact of magnetic ordering on\nenergy band dispersion dramatically changes the optical properties of\ntetragonal BFO. For the linear ones, the energy shift of the optical band gap\ncould be as large as 0.4 eV. As for the nonlinear ones, the change is even\nlarger. The second-harmonic generation coefficient d33 of G-AFM becomes more\nthan 13 times smaller than that of C1-type AFM case. Finally, we propose a\npractical way to distin-guish the C1- and G-type AFM of BFO using the optical\nmethod, which might be of great importance in next-generation information\nstorage technologies and widens the potential application of BFO to optical\nswitch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 03:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

Moreover, mmWave can be easily integrated with massive MIMO for the\nimproved link reliability. In this article, we discuss the feasibility of\nmmWave massive MIMO based wireless backhaul for 5G UDN, and the benefits and\nchallenges are also addressed. Especially, we propose a digitally-controlled\nphase-shifter network (DPSN) based hybrid precoding/combining scheme for mmWave\nmassive MIMO, whereby the low-rank property of mmWave massive MIMO channel\nmatrix is leveraged to reduce the required cost and complexity of transceiver\nwith a negligible performance loss.

Our treatment is based on the\nperturbation expansion of the non-equilibrium density matrix for calculation of\nmulti-time correlation functions, and the corresponding response function, at\nfinite temperature. As a model for our study, the high-temperature\nsuperconductor MgB2 has been selected. Knowledge of the electronic structure of\nthe studied system, and of the corresponding Eliashberg function that\nrepresents pertinent electron-phonon (EP) interactions, enabled us to\ndistinguish non-equilibrium processes running over different time-periods in a\nsequence of interactions with laser pulses on a microscopic level. We have also\nderived temperature-dependent relaxation dynamics as a function of delay time\nbetween the pump and probe pulses. For the studied model system of MgB2, we\nhave shown that an abrupt increase of the relaxation time at Tc, as detected by\nexperiments, is the direct consequence of sudden changes in the character of EP\ncoupling in transition from an adiabatic to a stabilized superconducting\nanti-adiabatic state, as it predicts the anti-adiabatic theory of\nelectron-vibration interactions. The BCS model, which preserves the adiabatic\ncharacter of EP coupling also below the critical temperature of MgB2, is\nbasically unable to reflect the enormous sudden increase of the relaxation\ntime. Based on diagrammatic perturbation theory, differences in the optical\npump-optical probe and the optical pump-terahertz probe settings of MgB2 PP\nrelaxation dynamics are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 09:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 10:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

It is shown that, for a given mass flux\nthrough a discontinuity, its type depends only on the relation between inclina-\ntion angles of a magnetic field. Moreover, the conservation laws on a surface\nof discontinuity allow changing a discontinuity type with gradual (continu-\nous) changes in the conditions of plasma flow. Then there are the so-called\ntransition solutions that satisfy simultaneously two types of discontinuities.\nWe obtain all transition solutions on the basis of the complete system of\nboundary conditions for the MHD equations. We also found the expression\ndescribing a jump of internal energy of the plasma flowing through the dis-\ncontinuity. Firstly, this allows constructing a generalized scheme of possible\ncontinuous transitions between MHD discontinuities. Secondly, it enables the\nexamination of the dependence of plasma heating by plasma density and\nconfiguration of the magnetic field near the discontinuity surface, i.e., by\nthe type of the MHD discontinuity. It is shown that the best conditions for\nheating are carried out in the vicinity of a reconnecting current layer near\nthe areas of reverse currents.

This paper focuses on the\nevolution of filament cross-sections at the outboard midplane and investigates\nthe scaling of the centre of mass velocity of the filament cross-section with\nfilament width and electron temperature. By decoupling the vorticity equation\ninto even and odd parity components about the centre of the filament in the\nbi-normal direction parallel density gradients are shown to drive large\nvelocities in the bi-normal (approximately poloidal) direction which scale\nlinearly with electron temperature. In this respect increasing the electron\ntemperature causes a departure of the filament dynamics from 2D behaviours.\nDespite the strong impact of 3D effects the radial motion of the filament is\nshown to be relatively well predicted by 2D scalings. The radial velocity is\nfound to scale positively with both electron temperature and cross-sectional\nwidth, suggesting an inertially limited nature. Comparison with the two-region\nmodel [J. R.

Economic\ndispatching is a central problem in microgrid operation, which aims at\neffectively scheduling various energy sources to minimize the operating cost\nwhile satisfying the electricity demand. Designing intelligent economic\ndispatching strategies for microgrids, however, is drastically different from\nthat for conventional central grids, due to two unique challenges. First, the\nerratic renewable energy emphasizes the need for online algorithms. Second, the\nwidely-adopted peak-based pricing scheme brings out the need for new peak-aware\nstrategy design. In this paper, we tackle these critical challenges and devise\npeak-aware online economic dispatching algorithms.

(2015) have recently\nidentified more than a thousand ultra-diffuse galaxy-like objects (UDGs) in the\nComa cluster. Robustness of the UDGs to tidal disruption seems to require,\nwithin Newtonian dynamics, that they are much more massive than their observed\nstellar component. Here, I propound that a considerable fraction of the CBDM is\ninternal to UDGs, which endows them with robustness. The rest of the CBDM\nobjects formed in now-disrupted kin of the UDGs, and is dispersed in the\nintracluster medium. While the discovery of cluster UDGs is not in itself a\nresolution of the MOND cluster conundrum, it lends greater qualitative\nplausibility to CBDM as its resolution, for reasons I discuss. Alternatively,\nif the UDGs are only now falling into Coma, their large size and very low\nsurface brightness could result from the adiabatic inflation due to the MOND\nexternal-field effect, as described in Brada & Milgrom (2000). I also consider\nbriefly solutions to the conundrum that invoke more elaborate extensions of\npurist MOND, e.g., that in clusters, the MOND constant takes up\nlarger-than-canonical values of the MOND constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 12:37:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 08:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

Such configurations are usually connected to\nexceptional local stability properties of the flow which come along with an\nimproved local forecast skills during the phenomenon. It is instead extremely\nhard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)\noffer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,\nsince they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis\nwhich explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess\nwhether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine\nthe CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel\nbaroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. An\norographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We\ndetect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the\nperiodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest\ngrowing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the\ncirculation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in\nthe finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is\nattributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high\ntemperature gradients, while for low values of \\Delta T, the effect is only due\nto stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of\nthe CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during\nblocked and unblocked phases. We find that on average the variance of the CLVs\nis clustered around the center of blocking. These results show that the blocked\nflow affects all time scales and processes described by the CLVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 12:40:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 15:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The incorporation of atoms in\nthe grain boundaries is, to our opinion, the most likely mechanism, but the\nrequired driving force for it has not yet been addressed. Therefore, instead of\nsearching for a specific (atomic) incorporation process, we analyze, here, the\nentire film system using thermodynamic arguments only. We find that the\ntremendous stress levels observed in the experiments can be surprisingly\nexplained by the flux induced entropic effects in the extremely dilute adatom\ngas on the surface alone. This thermodynamic evaluation delivers not only the\nnecessary basis for the adatom incorporation models, it even shows that the\nmeasured stress values can be reached with low deposition fluxes. Finally,\nfully counterintuitive, we also show that the stress levels decrease, if the\nbarrier(s) for adatoms to reach the grain boundaries are decreased!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 15:30:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 13:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}
