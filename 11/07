In addition, the high-resolution images better than 3 meters provide\na number of new discoveries about this asteroid, such as an 800-meter\ndepression at the end of the large lobe, a sharply perpendicular silhouette\nnear the neck region, boulders, indicating that Toutatis is probably a\nrubble-pile asteroid.

The change of the harmonic phase-locking when HHG evolves from the\ncut-off to the plateau regime determines the optimal bandwidth of the spectral\nregion which should be used for attosecond pulse generation via amplitude\ngating technique. The cut-off regime is also characterized by a linear\ndependence of the harmonic phase on the fundamental intensity. The\nproportionality coefficient grows as the cube of the fundamental wavelength,\nthus this dependence becomes very important for the HHG by mid-infrared fields.\nMoreover, for every high harmonic there is a {\\it range} of laser intensities\nproviding the generation in the cut-off regime and the atomic response\nmagnitude in this regime can be greater than that in the plateau regime.

A genuine\nmultigrid method for the saddle point system using an Uzawa-type smoother\nprovides the best overall performance with respect to memory consumption and\ntime-to-solution.

Despite the matrix free and highly optimized implementation, the\nmemory requirement for the solution vector and the auxiliary vectors is about\n200 TByte. Brandt's notion of \"textbook multigrid efficiency\" is employed to\nstudy the algorithmic performance of iterative solvers. A recent extension of\nthis paradigm to \"parallel textbook multigrid efficiency\" makes it possible to\nassess also the efficiency of parallel iterative solvers for a given hardware\narchitecture in absolute terms. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated\nfor simulating incompressible fluid flow in a pipe filled with spherical\nobstacles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 16:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

The random number of\nimpulses was Poisson distributed. The parameters of the model were estimated\naccording to a proposal by Raschke (2013a), with the sample of random\ndifference xi=ln(Y1)-ln(Y2), in which Y1 and Y2 are the horizontal components\nof local ground-motion intensity. Any GMR element was eliminated by\nsubtraction, except the individual random components. In the estimation\nprocedure the distribution of difference xi was approximated by combining a\nlarge Monte Carlo simulated sample and Kernel smoothing. The estimated model\nsatisfactorily fitted the difference xi of the sample of peak ground\naccelerations, and the variance of the individual random components was\nconsiderably smaller than that of conventional GMRs. In addition, the\ndependence of variance on the epicentre distance was considered; however, a\ndependence of variance on the magnitude was not detected. Finally, the\ninfluence of the novel model and the corresponding approximations on PSHA was\nresearched.

In particular, using the fact that splitting may be\nunnecessary when the reliability of decoding the unfrozen bit is sufficiently\nhigh, a novel splitting rule is proposed. Based on this rule, it is conjectured\nthat, if the correct path survives at some stage, it tends to survive till\ntermination without splitting with high probability. On the other hand, the\nincorrect paths are more likely to split at the following stages. Motivated by\nthese observations, a simple counter that counts the successive number of\nstages without splitting is introduced for each decoding path to facilitate the\nidentification of correct and incorrect path. Specifically, any path with\ncounter value larger than a predefined threshold \\omega is deemed to be the\ncorrect path, which will survive at the decoding stage, while other paths with\ncounter value smaller than the threshold will be pruned, thereby reducing the\ndecoding complexity. Furthermore, it is proved that there exists a unique\nunfrozen bit u_{N-K_1+1}, after which the successive cancellation decoder\nachieves the same error performance as the maximum likelihood decoder if all\nthe prior unfrozen bits are correctly decoded, which enables further complexity\nreduction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed low complexity SCL\ndecoder attains performance similar to that of the conventional SCL decoder,\nwhile achieving substantial complexity reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 16:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

To make this scheme practically\nfeasible in MMWC, a corresponding training approach is suggested to avoid the\nchannel estimation and iterative EVD computation. As in fast fading scenario\nthe training approach may be time-consuming due to frequent training, another\nbeamforming scheme, which exploits the quasi-static steering angles in MMWC, is\nproposed to reduce the overhead and increase the system reliability by\nmultipath grouping (MPG).

Aims: We aim at investigating the spectral type evolution of\nthis star over the recent decades as well as during one pulsation cycle in more\ndetail and discuss it in connection with the period evolution. Methods: We\npresent optical, near- and mid-IR low-resolution as well as optical\nhigh-resolution spectra to determine the current spectral type. The optical\nspectrum of LX Cyg has been followed for more than one pulsation cycle. Recent\nspectra are compared to archival spectra to trace the spectral type evolution\nand a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum is analysed for the presence of molecular and\ndust features. Furthermore, the current period is derived from AAVSO data.\nResults: It is found that the spectral type of LX Cyg changed from S to C\nsometime between 1975 and 2008. Currently, the spectral type C is stable during\na pulsation cycle. It is shown that spectral features typical of C-type stars\nare present in its spectrum from ~0.5 to 14 $\\mu{\\rm{m}}$. An emission feature\nat 10.7 $\\mu{\\rm{m}}$ is attributed to SiC grains. The period of LX Cyg has\nincreased from ~460 d to ~580 d within only 20 years, and is stable now.\nConclusions: We conclude that the change in spectral type and the increase in\npulsation period happened simultaneously and are causally connected. Both a\nrecent thermal pulse (TP) and a simple surface temperature decrease appear\nunlikely to explain the observations. We therefore suggest that the underlying\nmechanism is related to a recent third dredge-up mixing event that brought up\ncarbon from the interior of the star, i.e. that a genuine abundance change\nhappened. We propose that LX Cyg is a rare transition type object that is\nuniquely suited to study the transformation from O- to C-rich stars in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 17:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 17:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

Focusing on the essential case, where the network of feeding\ninteractions is a chain, we develop an analytical approach for the computation\nof the degree distributions of colonized spatial patches for the different\nspecies in the chain. This framework allows us to address ecologically relevant\nquestions. Considering configuration model ensembles of spatial networks, we\nfind that there is an upper bound for the fraction of patches that a given\nspecies can occupy, which depends only on the networks mean degree. For a given\nmean degree there is then an optimal degree distribution that comes closest to\nthe upper bound.

However, few papers have used optimization techniques with\nguaranteed convergence in order to increase the efficiency of the passive\ncoupling of adjacent structures. In this paper, the combined problem of optimal\narrangement and mechanical properties of dampers placed between two adjacent\nbuildings is considered. A new bi-level optimization approach is presented. The\nouter-loop of the approach optimizes damper configuration and is solved using\nthe ``inserting dampers'' method, which was recently shown to be a very\neffective heuristic method. Under the assumption that the dampers have varying\ndamper coefficients, the inner-loop finds the optimal damper coefficients by\nsolving an $n$-dimensional optimization problem, where derivative information\nof the objective function is not available. Three different non-gradient\nmethods are compared for solving the inner loop: a genetic algorithm (GA), the\nmesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm, and the robust approximate\ngradient sampling (RAGS) algorithm. It is shown that by exploiting this new\nbi-level problem formulation, modern derivative free optimization techniques\nwith guaranteed convergence (such as MADS and RAGS) can be used.

While adjoint\nmethods have been proven effective for functional-based adaptation, the\npractical implementation of an adjoint method can be quite burdensome since\ncode developers constantly need to ensure and maintain a dual consistent\ndiscretization as updates are made. Also, since most engineering problems\nconsider multiple functionals, an adjoint solution must be obtained for each\nfunctional of interest which can increase the overall computational cost\nsignificantly. In this paper, an alternative to adjoints is presented which\nuses a sparse approximate inverse of the Jacobian of the residual to obtain\napproximate adjoint sensitivities for functional-based adaptation indicators.\nSince the approximate inverse need only be computed once, it can be recycled\nfor any number of functionals making the new approach more efficient than a\nconventional adjoint method. This new method for functional-based adaptation\nwill be tested using the quasi-1D nozzle problem, and results are presented for\nfunctionals of integrated pressure and entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 18:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

Some of the particles\nhave embedded cuboidal magnets. The strength of the magnetic interactions\nbetween particles are too weak to have a strong direct effect on $P$ or $Z$\nwhen the system is jammed.

Using Doppler tomography we show that the\nevolution of the Ca II triplet profile can be interpreted as the precession of\na fixed emission pattern with a period in the range 24-30 years. The Ca II line\nprofiles vary on time-scales that are broadly consistent with general\nrelativistic precession of the debris disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 20:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Initially isotropic and compact clusters with small initial\nvalues of the ratio of the half-mass to Jacobi radius, $r_h/r_J$, develop a\nstrong radial anisotropy during their long-term dynamical evolution. Many\nclusters, if formed with small values of $r_h/r_J$, should now be characterized\nby a significant radial anisotropy increasing with the distance from the\ncluster centre, reaching its maximum at a distance between 0.2 $r_J$ and 0.4\n$r_J$, and then becoming more isotropic or mildly tangentially anisotropic in\nthe outermost regions. A similar radial variation of the anisotropy can also\nresult from an early violent relaxation phase. In both cases, as a cluster\ncontinues its evolution and loses mass, the anisotropy eventually starts to\ndecrease and the system evolves toward an isotropic velocity distribution.\nHowever, in order to completely erase the strong anisotropy developed by these\ncompact systems during their evolution, they must be in the advanced stages of\ntheir evolution and lose a large fraction of their initial mass.

The charge\ndistributions in quantum chemistry are typically represented as a sums over\nproducts of Gaussian orbital basis functions. If fitted, they are also\nrepresented as a sum over single-center Gaussian fitting basis functions. With\ntwo representations of the charge distributions, the proper definition of\nenergy is ambiguous. To remedy this, we require that the variation of the\nenergy with respect to a product of orbitals generates a fitted potential. This\nmakes the quantum-mechanical energy robust, i.e. corrected to first order for\nthe error made using an incomplete fitting basis. The coupled orbital and\nfitting equations are then the result of making the energy stationary with\nrespect to two independent sets of variables. We define the potentials and\nunique energies for methods based on the Hartree Fock model and variationally\nfit the full EE interaction in DFT. We compare implementations of variational\nfitting in DFT at six different levels for three different functionals. Our\ncalculations are performed on transition metal atoms, for which first-order\nCoulomb errors, due to an incomplete fitting basis sets, are significant.\nVariational first-order exchange and correlation errors have similar magnitude\nin all cases.

This\ndynamic response of the protein's functional energy landscape enables a protein\nto modulate binding affinities and control binding sensitivity to ligand\nconcentration. In this paper, we investigate the structural origins of binding\naffinity and allosteric cooperativity of binding two calcium ions to each\ndomain of calmodulin (CaM) through simulations of a simple coarse-grained\nmodel. In this model, the protein's conformational transitions between open and\nclosed conformational ensembles are simulated explicitly and ligand binding and\nunbinding is treated implicitly within the Grand Canonical Ensemble. Ligand\nbinding is cooperative because the binding sites are coupled through a shift in\nthe dominant conformational ensemble upon binding. The classic\nMonod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery with appropriate binding free energy to\nthe open and closed ensembles accurately describes the simulated binding\nthermodynamics. The simulations predict that the two domains of CaM have\ndistinct binding affinity and cooperativity. In particular, C-terminal domain\nbinds calcium with higher affinity and greater cooperativity than the\nN-terminal domain. From a structural point of view, the affinity of an\nindividual binding loop depends sensitively on the loop's structural\ncompatibility with the ligand in the bound ensemble, as well as the\nconformational flexibility of the binding site in the unbound ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 00:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 23:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

We further\ncharacterize the enhanced multiplexing gain performance in the high SNR regime.\nIn both regimes, the performance of the proposed full-duplex strategy is\ncompared to the half-duplex counterpart to quantify spectral efficiency\nimprovement. With experimental data [1] and 3D channel model [2] from 3GPP, in\na 1.4 MHz 8X8 system LTE system with the block length of 500 symbols, the\nproposed strategy attains a spectral efficiency improvement of 130% and 8% with\nclosed and open loop training, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 02:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 18:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

Explicit numerical calculation of the gravitational correction\nto the superfluid order parameter is performed for two specific examples with\ndifferent boundary conditions. It is found that even in the weak-gravity limit,\ngravity can have a significant effect on superfluidity. The relativistic\nsuperfluids formed by various fermion pairings are also considered. Two\npossible cases are considered in the mean-field treatment: antifermion-fermion\nand fermion-fermion pairings. The effective actions and the self-consistent\nequations are derived for both cases. An analytical expression for the\nfirst-order gravitational correction to the superfluid order parameter is given\nfor the antifermion-fermion pairing; while, the analytical expressions for the\nmatrix elements of the heat kernel operator, which is useful in\ncurved-spacetime QFT calculations, is derived for the fermion-fermion pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 02:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 07:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

Our goal is to settle\nthis debate and provide reliable evolutionary classification. Integral field\nspectrograph observations with VLT MUSE of the cluster SH 2-266 are used to\nanalyze the nature of MWC 137. A collimated outflow is discovered that is\ngeometrically centered on MWC 137. The central position of MWC 137 in the\ncluster SH 2-266 within the larger nebula suggests strongly that it is a member\nof this cluster and that it is both at the origin of the nebula and the newly\ndiscovered jet. Comparison of the color-magnitude diagram of the brightest\ncluster stars with stellar evolutionary models results in a distance of about\n5.2$\\pm$1.4 kpc.

P is studied as a function\nof electron temperature T_e and electron concentration n_e. Screening is found\nto suppress P very significantly for about T_e < 0.5 K and its effect reduces\nconsiderably for about T_e > 1K in Cd_3As_2 . In Bloch-Gruniesen (BG) regime,\nfor screened (unscreened) case T_e dependence is P ~ T_e^ 9 (T_e^ 5) and ne\ndependence gives P ~ n_e ^-5/3(n_e^-1/3). The T_e dependence is characteristics\nof 3D phonons and n_e dependence is characteristics of 3D Dirac fermions. In BG\nregime, screening effect is found to enhance for larger n_e. Screening is found\nto reduce the range of validity of BG regime temperature. Plot of P / T_e^ 4 vs\nT_e shows a maximum at temperature T_e m which shifts to higher values for\nlarger n_e. Interesting observation is that maximum of P / T_e^4 is nearly same\nfor different n_e and T_em / n_e^ 1/3 appears to be nearly constant.

More specifically, our\nmain results are the following:\n  (1) We observe that set-multilinear arithmetic circuits can be transformed\ninto shallow set-multilinear circuits efficiently, similar to depth reduction\nresults of [VSBR83,RY08] for more general commutative circuits. As a\nconsequence, we note that polynomial size set-multilinear circuits have\nquasi-polynomial size set-multilinear branching programs.

This paper is devoted to\na semi-definite program algorithm for computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalue of a\nclass of tensors with sign structure called $W$-tensors. The class of\n$W$-tensors extends the well-studied nonnegative tensors and essentially\nnonnegative tensors, and covers some important tensors arising naturally from\nspectral hypergraph theory. Our algorithm is based on a new structured\nsums-of-squares (SOS) decomposition result for a nonnegative homogeneous\npolynomial induced by a $W$-tensor. This SOS decomposition enables us to show\nthat computing the maximum $H$-eigenvalue of an even order symmetric $W$-tensor\nis equivalent to solving a semi-definite program, and hence can be accomplished\nin polynomial time. Numerical examples are given to illustrate that the\nproposed algorithm can be used to find maximum $H$-eigenvalue of an even order\nsymmetric $W$-tensor with dimension up to $10,000$.

We present in full generality the steps\nneeded to describe the viscous jets around their central line, and we argue\nthat the Taylor expansion of all fields around that line is conveniently\nexpressed in terms of symmetric trace-free tensors living in the two dimensions\nof the fiber sections. We recover the standard results of axisymmetric jets and\nwe report the first and second corrections to the lowest order description,\nalso allowing for a rotational component around the axis of symmetry. When\napplied to generally curved fibers, the lowest order description corresponds to\na viscous string model with circular sections. However, when including the\nfirst corrections we find that curved jets generically develop elliptic\nsections. Several subtle effects imply that the first corrections cannot be\ndescribed by a rod model, since it amounts to selectively discard some\ncorrections. For completeness, we also recover the constitutive relations for\nforces and torques in rod models and exhibit a missing term in the lowest order\nexpression of viscous torque.

Here, parametric\nsignificance tests of conditional mutual information (CMI) of increasing order\n$m$, $I_c(m)$, on a symbol sequence are conducted for increasing orders $m$ in\norder to estimate the true order $L$ of the underlying Markov chain. CMI of\norder $m$ is the mutual information of two variables in the Markov chain being\n$m$ time steps apart, conditioning on the intermediate variables of the chain.\nThe null distribution of CMI is approximated with a normal and gamma\ndistribution deriving analytic expressions of their parameters, and a gamma\ndistribution deriving its parameters from the mean and variance of the normal\ndistribution. The accuracy of order estimation is assessed with the three\nparametric tests, and the parametric tests are compared to the randomization\nsignificance test and other known order estimation criteria using Monte Carlo\nsimulations of Markov chains with different order $L$, length of symbol\nsequence $N$ and number of symbols $K$. The parametric test using the gamma\ndistribution (with directly defined parameters) is consistently better than the\nother two parametric tests and matches well the performance of the\nrandomization test. The tests are applied to genes and intergenic regions of\nDNA sequences, and the estimated orders are interpreted in view of the results\nfrom the simulation study. The application shows the usefulness of the\nparametric gamma test for long symbol sequences where the randomization test\nbecomes prohibitively slow to compute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 11:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Our definition of the graph shift operator negates\nthe shift operators defined in the literature, such as the graph adjacency\nmatrix and Laplacian matrix based shift operators, which modify the energy of a\ngraph signal. We decouple the graph structure represented by eigengraphs and\nthe eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix.

The\nPotato Radius can be calculated from first principles based on the elastic\nproperties and gravity of the asteroid. Similarly, the tallest mountain that a\nplanet can support is also known to be based on the elastic properties and\ngravity. In this work, a simple novel method of calculating the Potato Radius\nis presented using what is known about the maximum height of mountains and\nNewtonian gravity for a spherical body. This method does not assume any\nknowledge beyond high school level mechanics, and may be appropriate for\nstudents interested in applications of physics to astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 15:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

In\nthis article the influence of a quantum gravity is shown so the Chandrasekhar\nlimits (mass and radius) depend explicitly on the central density and gravity\nparameters. A new polytropic relation between degenerate pressure of the star\nand its density is investigated. This leads to a modification in Lane-Emden\nequation and mass and radius formulas of the star. A modified Lane-Emden\nequation is solved numerically with consideration to the mass density of the\nstar depends on its radius. The solution used in calculating the mass and\nradius limit of the white dwarf. It was found that mass and radius limits\ndecrease due to increase in central density and gravity parameters in a\ncomparison with the original values. We can say that central density and\nquantum gravity constitute a new tool that can help to make the theoretical\nvalues corresponding to experimental observations apply in a better manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 16:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 13:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

This study investigates a promising\ntechnology for the heavy duty truck sector of transportation as a target for\nconversion from diesel to natural gas. The supply of natural gas is limited so\nwe also verify the available domestic supply quantities both before and after a\nfleet conversion. This paper concludes with an economic discussion regarding\nJavon's paradox and the fungibility of natural gas as compared to that of oil.\nIn order to determine if natural gas can replace diesel for the country's heavy\nduty truck transportation needs, the energy equivalent and efficiency of\nnatural gas alternatives should be compared to diesel. There are two\nalternatives for using natural gas as a replacement for diesel; compressed\nnatural gas and liquefied natural gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 22:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}
