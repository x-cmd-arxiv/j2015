That is, first virus particles diffuse randomly\noutside of host cells, then the virus genome enters the target host cell, and\nonly then do intracellular dynamics and regulation of virus and host cell fate\nunfold. Intracellular dynamics may lead to the death of the host cell and\nrelease of viruses, to the elimination of the virus genome through cellular\ndefense mechanisms, or the integration of the virus genome with the host as a\nchromosomal or extra-chromosomal element. Here we revisit this canonical view,\ninspired by recent experimental findings of Bautista and colleagues (mBio,\n2015) in which the majority of target host cells can be induced into a dormant\nstate when exposed to either active or de-activated viruses, even when viruses\nare present at low relative titer.

We\ndevelop a biophysical model of contact-mediated dynamics involving virus\nparticles and target cells.

In this paper we learn about the\nrooted-tree version of the graph, known as the rSPR graph, by calculating the\nRicci-Ollivier curvature for pairs of vertices in the rSPR graph with respect\nto two simple random walks on the rSPR graph. By proving theorems and direct\ncalculation with novel algorithms, we find a remarkable diversity of different\ncurvatures on the rSPR graph for pairs of vertices separated by the same\ndistance. We confirm using simulation that degree and curvature have the\nexpected impact on mean access time distributions, demonstrating relevance of\nthese curvature results to stochastic tree search.

A\nrecently-proposed method of obtaining rigorous bounds of long-time average cost\nis first outlined for the uncontrolled system with polynomials of system state\non the right-hand side. In this method the polynomial constraints are relaxed\nto be sum-of-squares and formulated as semi-definite programs. It was proposed\nto use the upper bound of long-time average cost as the objective function\ninstead of the time-average cost itself in controller design. In the present\npaper this suggestion is implemented for a particular system and is shown to\ngive good results. Designing the optimal controller by this method requires\noptimising simultaneously both the control law and a tunable function similar\nto the Lyapunov function. The new approach proposed and implemented in this\npaper for overcoming the inherent non-convexity of this optimisation is based\non a formal assumption that the amplitude of control is small. By expanding the\ntunable function and the bound in the small parameter, the long-time average\ncost is reduced by minimizing the respective bound in each term of the series.\nThe derivation of all the polynomial coefficients in controller is given in\nterms of the solvability conditions of state-dependent linear and bilinear\ninequalities. The resultant sum-of-squares problems are solved in sequence,\nthus avoiding the non-convexity in optimization.

We simulate the IGM using smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics, and find that, at z < 6, the gas density power spectrum\ndoes not exhibit the expected Jeans filtering cutoff, because dense gas in\ncollapsed halos dominates the small-scale power masking pressure smoothing\neffects.

This inter-application interference degrades overall system\nperformance and unfairly slows down applications. Prior works have developed\napplication-aware memory schedulers to tackle this problem. State-of-the-art\napplication-aware memory schedulers prioritize requests of applications that\nare vulnerable to interference, by ranking individual applications based on\ntheir memory access characteristics and enforcing a total rank order.\n  In this paper, we observe that state-of-the-art application-aware memory\nschedulers have two major shortcomings. First, such schedulers trade off\nhardware complexity in order to achieve high performance or fairness, since\nranking applications with a total order leads to high hardware complexity.\nSecond, ranking can unfairly slow down applications that are at the bottom of\nthe ranking stack. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the Blacklisting\nMemory Scheduler (BLISS), which achieves high system performance and fairness\nwhile incurring low hardware complexity, based on two observations. First, we\nfind that, to mitigate interference, it is sufficient to separate applications\ninto only two groups.

Accurate estimates of\nCHA are critical for understanding hydration effects ubiquitous in chemistry\nand biology. However, measuring hydration energies of charged species is\nfraught with significant difficulties, which lead to unacceptably large (up to\n300%) variation in the available estimates of the CHA effect. We circumvent\nthese difficulties by developing a framework which allows us to extract and\naccurately estimate the intrinsic propensity of water to exhibit CHA from\naccurate experimental hydration free energies of neutral polar molecules.\nSpecifically, from a set of 504 small molecules we identify two pairs that are\nanalogous, with respect to CHA, to the K+/F- pair--a classical probe for the\neffect. We use these \"CHA-conjugate\" molecule pairs to quantify the intrinsic\ncharge-asymmetric response of water to the microscopic charge perturbations:\nthe asymmetry of the response is strong, ~50% of the average hydration free\nenergy of these molecules. The ability of widely used classical water models to\npredict hydration energies of small molecules correlates with their ability to\npredict CHA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 23:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 15:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

This problem leads\nto comparatively low recommendation accuracy because these networks are also\nreflections of the nature of the nodes, such as the preferences of users in a\nsocial network. Also, social networks, as complex networks, have many different\nstructures. Each structure is a composition of links between nodes and reflects\nthe nature of nodes, so retaining the different network structures will lead to\ndifferences in recommendation performance. To investigate the impact of these\nnetwork structures on the factorization, this paper proposes four multi-level\nnetwork factorization algorithms based on the standard NMF, which integrates\nthe vertical network (e.g., rating matrix) with the structures of horizontal\nnetwork (e.g., user social network). These algorithms are carefully designed\nwith corresponding convergence proofs to retain four desired network\nstructures. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed algorithms are\nable to preserve the desired network structures as designed. Experiments on\nreal-world data show that considering the horizontal networks improves the\naccuracy of document clustering and recommendation with standard NMF, and\nvarious structures show their differences in performance on these two tasks.\nThese results can be directly used in document clustering and recommendation\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 23:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-03"}

Existing work\nassumes that privacy level is determined by the system designer as a fixed\nvalue before sensitive data is released. For certain applications, however,\nusers may wish to relax the privacy level for subsequent releases of the same\ndata after either a re-evaluation of the privacy concerns or the need for\nbetter accuracy. Specifically, given a database containing sensitive data, we\nassume that a response $y_1$ that preserves $\\epsilon_{1}$-differential privacy\nhas already been published. Then, the privacy level is relaxed to $\\epsilon_2$,\nwith $\\epsilon_2 > \\epsilon_1$, and we wish to publish a more accurate response\n$y_2$ while the joint response $(y_1, y_2)$ preserves $\\epsilon_2$-differential\nprivacy. How much accuracy is lost in the scenario of gradually releasing two\nresponses $y_1$ and $y_2$ compared to the scenario of releasing a single\nresponse that is $\\epsilon_{2}$-differentially private? Our results show that\nthere exists a composite mechanism that achieves \\textit{no loss} in accuracy.\nWe consider the case in which the private data lies within $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$\nwith an adjacency relation induced by the $\\ell_{1}$-norm, and we focus on\nmechanisms that approximate identity queries. We show that the same accuracy\ncan be achieved in the case of gradual release through a mechanism whose\noutputs can be described by a \\textit{lazy Markov stochastic process}. This\nstochastic process has a closed form expression and can be efficiently sampled.\nOur results are applicable beyond identity queries. To this end, we demonstrate\nthat our results can be applied in several cases, including Google's RAPPOR\nproject, trading of sensitive data, and controlled transmission of private data\nin a social network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 02:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-06"}

A voting model represents the way in which public perceptions are\nconveyed to voters. Our voting model is constructed by using two types of\nvoters--herders and independents--and two candidates. Independents conduct\nvoting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their\nvoting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority\ncandidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their\nnetworks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks\ndepend. Two kinds of phase transitions, an information cascade transition and a\nsuper-normal transition, were identified.

We first present a model of secular planetesimal dynamics\nthat accounts for the (1) perturbation due to the eccentric precessing binary,\nas well as the (2) gravity and (3) gas drag from a precessing eccentric disk.\nTheir simultaneous action leads to rich dynamics, with (multiple) secular\nresonances emerging in the disk.

The simplest\nstatic isotropic Finsler metric of a gravitating mass that incorporates the\nTully-Fisher relation at small acceleration is associated with a spacetime\ninterval that is either a homogeneous quartic root of polynomials of local\ndisplacements or a simple root of a rational fraction thereof. We determine the\nlow energy gravitational equation and find that Finsler spacetimes that produce\na Tully-Fisher relation require that the gravitational potential be modified.\nFor an isolated mass, Newton's potential $Mr^{-1}$ is replaced by $Ma_0\\log\n(r/r_0)$ where $a_0$ is MOND's acceleration scale and $r_0$ is a yet\nundetermined distance scale. Orbital energy is linear with respect to mass but\nangular momentum is proportional to $ M^{3/4}$. Asymptotic light deflection\nresulting from time curvature is similar to that of a singular isothermal\nsphere implying that space curvature must be the main source of deflection in\nstatic Finsler spacetimes possibly through the presence of the distance scale\n$r_0$ that appears in the asymptotic form of the gravitational potential.

In this paper we\ndemonstrate an approach for constraining the form of spectral densities\nassociated with QFT propagators, which involves matching the short distance\nexpansion of the spectral representation with the operator product expansion\n(OPE) of the propagators. As an application of this procedure we analyse the\nscalar propagator in $\\phi^4$-theory and the quark propagator in QCD, and show\nthat constraints are obtained on the spectral densities and the OPE\ncondensates.

Through the lens of the Metropolis\nalgorithm, we are able to elucidate the errors made when using a nonzero time\nincrement.\n  Of particular interest are transition paths that transverse an energy barrier\nthat is large (but not too large) compared to the typical thermal energy.

As such, we turn our attention to\nthe \"double-ended\" problem, where the OM functional can be interpreted as a\n\"thermodynamic\" action and employed to sample paths that start and end at\npredetermined points. We find that sampling the continuous-time limit of the OM\nfunctional, i.e., the Ito-Girsanov form, produces unphysical paths due to\nthermodynamic inconsistency arising from the singular nature of the limit.\nThese unphysical effects are due to the correlation between the particles\nposition and the random fluctuating noise that is introduced in the limiting\nprocess.

Convective cells are formed\nby Coulomb force in an insulating liquid residing between two plane electrodes\nsubject to unipolar injection. Besides pure electroconvection, we also consider\nthe case where a cross-flow is present, generated by a streamwise pressure\ngradient, in the form of a laminar Poiseuille flow. The effect of charge\ndiffusion, often neglected in previous linear stability analyses, is included\nin the present study and a transient growth analysis, rarely considered in EHD,\nis carried out. In the case without cross-flow, a non-zero charge diffusion\nleads to a lower linear stability threshold and thus to a more unstable low.\nThe transient growth, though enhanced by increasing charge diffusion, remains\nsmall and hence cannot fully account for the discrepancy of the linear\nstability threshold between theoretical and experimental results. When a\ncross-flow is present, increasing the strength of the electric field in the\nhigh-$Re$ Poiseuille flow yields a more unstable flow in both modal and\nnonmodal stability analyses. Even though the energy analysis and the\ninput-output analysis both indicate that the energy growth directly related to\nthe electric field is small, the electric effect enhances the lift-up\nmechanism. The symmetry of channel flow with respect to the centerline is\nbroken due to the additional electric field acting in the wall-normal\ndirection. As a result, the centers of the streamwise rolls are shifted towards\nthe injector electrode, and the optimal spanwise wavenumber achieving maximum\ntransient energy growth increases with the strength of the electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 13:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The most popular explanation for the\nanomalously high and hard X-ray fluxes is that these jets do not decelerate\nsignificantly by the kiloparsec scale, but rather remain highly relativistic\n(Lorentz factors $\\Gamma\\approx$10). By adopting a small angle to the\nline-of-sight, the X-rays can thus be explained by inverse Compton upscattering\nof CMB photons (IC/CMB), where the observed emission is strongly Doppler\nboosted. Using over six years of Fermi monitoring data, we show that the\nexpected hard, steady gamma-ray emission implied by the IC/CMB model is not\nseen in PKS 0637-752, the prototype jet for which this model was first\nproposed.

Most techniques to optimize these links use queueing network models or\nnetwork flow models, which require some idea of the actual execution rate of\neach independent compute kernel within the system.

Ultraviolet morphologies among\nthe BCGs with strong UV excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongated\nclumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from the\nsmooth profiles of the UV-quiet BCGs.

Lasserre and\nco-workers have shown that the real radical ideal of real polynomial systems\nwith finitely many real solutions can be determined by a combination of\nsemi-definite programming (SDP) and geometric involution techniques. A\nconjectured extension of such methods to positive dimensional polynomial\nsystems has been given recently by Ma, Wang and Zhi.\n  We show that regularity in the form of the Slater constraint qualification\n(strict feasibility) fails for the resulting SDP feasibility problems.
