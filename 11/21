In this paper we propose an incremental approach to\nsolving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear Horn clause solver. We\nachieve this by interleaving a program transformation and a linear solver. The\nprogram transformation is based on the notion of tree dimension, which we apply\nto trees corresponding to Horn clause derivations. The dimension of a tree is a\nmeasure of its non-linearity -- for example a linear tree (whose nodes have at\nmost one child) has dimension zero while a complete binary tree has dimension\nequal to its height.\n  A given set of Horn clauses $P$ can be transformed into a new set of clauses\n$P^k$ (whose derivation trees are the subset of $P$'s derivation trees with\ndimension at most $k$). We start by generating $P^k$ with $k=0$, which is\nlinear by definition, then pass it to a linear solver. If $P^k$ has a solution\n$M$, and is a solution to $P$ then $P$ has a solution $M$. If $M$ is not a\nsolution of $P$, we plugged $M$ to $P^{(k+1)}$ which again becomes linear and\npass it to the solver and continue successively for increasing value of $k$\nuntil we find a solution to $P$ or resources are exhausted. Experiment on some\nHorn clause verification benchmarks indicates that this is a promising approach\nfor solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear solver. It\nindicates that many times a solution obtained for some under-approximation\n$P^k$ of $P$ becomes a solution for $P$ for a fairly small value of $k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

We have a three stage approach: first we take in\nconsideration features of the individual entities at the local level of\nappearance, then we consider the relationship between these objects and actions\nand their video background, and third, we consider their spatiotemporal\nrelations as inputs to classifiers at the highest level of interpretation.\nThus, our approach finds a coherent linguistic description of videos in the\nform of a subject, verb and object based on their role played in the overall\nvisual story learned directly from training data, without using a known\nlanguage model. We test the efficiency of our approach on a large scale dataset\ncontaining YouTube clips taken in the wild and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance, often superior to current approaches that use more complex,\npre-learned linguistic knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

Furthermore, while deep networks are commonly\nrecognized as the best models to use in these domains, there is a widespread\nperception that in order to yield successful results they often require\ntime-consuming architecture search, manual tweaking of parameters and\ncomputationally intensive pre-processing or post-processing methods.\n  In this paper we challenge these views by presenting a deep 3D convolutional\narchitecture trained end to end to perform voxel-level prediction, i.e., to\noutput a variable at every voxel of the video. Most importantly, we show that\nthe same exact architecture can be used to achieve competitive results on three\nwidely different voxel-prediction tasks: video semantic segmentation, optical\nflow estimation, and video coloring. The three networks learned on these\nproblems are trained from raw video without any form of preprocessing and their\noutputs do not require post-processing to achieve outstanding performance.\nThus, they offer an efficient alternative to traditional and much more\ncomputationally expensive methods in these video domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

The equation of\nstate (EOS) of the gas becomes softer with CO freeze-out and the results show\nthat at the onset of star formation, the cloud retains its evolution history\nsuch that the number of formed stars differ (by 7%) between the three models.\nWhile the stellar mass distribution results in a different IMF when we consider\npure freeze-out, with the complete treatment of the GSC, the divergence from a\npure gas-phase model is minimal. We find that the impact of freeze-out is\nbalanced by the non-thermal processes; chemical and photodesorption. We also\nfind an average filament width of 0.12 pc ($\\pm$0.03 pc), and speculate that\nthis may be a result from the changes in the EOS caused by the gas-dust thermal\ncoupling. We conclude that GSC plays a big role in the chemical composition of\nmolecular clouds and that surface processes are needed to accurately interpret\nobservations, however, that GSC does not have a significant impact as far as\nstar formation and the IMF is concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 17:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 11:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

These effects are currently in\nthe focus of many exoplanet search projects, since the lack of a well-defined\ncharacterization and correction strategy hampers the detection of the signals\nassociated with small exoplanets. Accurate simulations of the stellar\nphotosphere can provide synthetic time series data. These may help to\ninvestigate the relation between activity jitter and stellar parameters when\nconsidering different active region patterns. Moreover, jitters can be analysed\nat different wavelength scales in order to design strategies to remove or\nminimize them. In this work we present the StarSim tool, which is based on a\nmodel for a spotted rotating photosphere built from the integration of the\nspectral contribution of a fine grid of surface elements. The model includes\nall significant effects affecting the flux intensities and the wavelength of\nspectral features produced by active regions and planets. A specific\napplication for the characterization and modelling of the spectral signature of\nactive regions is considered, showing that the chromatic effects of faculae are\ndominant for low temperature contrasts of spots.

This\ncontrasts with massive cluster motions who are mainly governed by the pull of\nthe large-scale overdense regions.

The water snow line lies in the planet formation region at < 10\nAU, and so far its location has been estimated only indirectly from\nspatially-unresolved spectroscopy. This work presents a proof-of-concept method\nto directly image the water snow line in protoplanetary disks through its\nphysical and chemical imprint in the local dust properties. We adopt a physical\ndisk model that includes dust coagulation, fragmentation, drift, and a change\nin fragmentation velocities of a factor 10 between dry silicates and icy grains\nas found by laboratory work. We find that the presence of a water snow line\nleads to a sharp discontinuity in the radial profile of the dust emission\nspectral index {\\alpha}_mm, due to replenishment of small grains through\nfragmentation. We use the ALMA simulator to demonstrate that this effect can be\nobserved in protoplanetary disks using spatially-resolved ALMA images in two\ncontinuum bands.

If the disk viscosity is low ({\\alpha}_visc < 10^-3) the snow line\nproduces a ring-like structure with a minimum at {\\alpha}_mm ~ 2 in the\noptically thick regime, possibly similar to what has been measured with ALMA in\nthe innermost region of the HL Tau disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Recent numerical\nstudies suggest that angular momentum transport in the inner region of PPDs is\nlargely driven by magnetized disk wind, yet the wind mass-loss rate remains\nunconstrained. On the other hand, disk mass loss has conventionally been\nattributed to photoevaporation, where external heating on the disk surface\ndrives a thermal wind. We unify the two scenarios by developing a 1D model of\nmagnetized disk winds with a simple treatment of thermodynamics as a proxy for\nexternal heating. The wind properties largely depend on 1) the magnetic field\nstrength at the wind base, characterized by the poloidal Alfv\\'en speed\n$v_{Ap}$, 2) the sound speed $c_s$ near the wind base, and 3) how rapidly\npoloidal field lines diverge (achieve $R^{-2}$ scaling). When $v_{Ap}\\gg c_s$,\ncorotation is enforced near the wind base, resulting in centrifugal\nacceleration. Otherwise, the wind is accelerated mainly by the pressure of the\ntoroidal magnetic field. In both cases, the dominant role played by magnetic\nforces likely yields wind outflow rates that well exceed purely hydrodynamical\nmechanisms. For typical PPD accretion-rate and wind-launching conditions, we\nexpect $v_{Ap}$ to be comparable to $c_s$ at the wind base. The resulting wind\nis heavily loaded, with total wind mass loss rate likely reaching a\nconsiderable fraction of wind-driven accretion rate. Implications for modeling\nglobal disk evolution and planet formation are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Partly through integration with more recent\nmachinery, including Katz's approach to $p$-adic differential operators, his\nstrategy has influenced four decades of developments. Prior papers employing\nKatz's and Serre's ideas exploiting differential operators and congruences to\nproduce families of automorphic forms rely crucially on $q$-expansions of\nautomorphic forms.\n  The overarching goal of the present paper is to adapt the strategy to\nautomorphic forms on unitary groups, which lack $q$-expansions when the\nsignature is of the form $(a, b)$, $a\\neq b$. In particular, this paper\ncompletely removes the restrictions on the signature present in prior work. As\nintermediate steps, we achieve two key objectives. First, partly by carefully\nanalyzing the action of the Young symmetrizer on Serre-Tate expansions, we\nexplicitly describe the action of differential operators on the Serre-Tate\nexpansions of automorphic forms on unitary groups of arbitrary signature. As a\ndirect consequence, for each unitary group, we obtain congruences and families\nanalogous to those studied by Katz and Serre. Second, via a novel lifting\nargument, we construct a $p$-adic measure taking values in the space of\n$p$-adic automorphic forms on unitary groups of any prescribed signature. We\nrelate the values of this measure to an explicit $p$-adic family of Eisenstein\nseries.

In the ultimatum game the reciprocity and the\nfifty-fifty partition seems to be a deviation from rational behavior of the\nplayers under the light of the Nash equilibrium concept.Such equilibrium\nemerges, for example, from the punishment of the responder who generally tends\nto refuse unfair proposals. In the iterated version of the game, the proposers\nare able to improve their proposals by adding a value thus making fairer\nproposals.

Recently, a reactive version of the ultimatum\ngame where acceptance occurs with fixed probability was proposed.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of\nincreasing the polarization bias of an ensemble of two-level register spins by\nmeans of joint coherent manipulations, involving a second ensemble of ancillary\nspins and energy dissipation into an external heat bath. We formulate this spin\nrefrigeration protocol, akin to algorithmic cooling, in the general language of\nquantum feedback control, and identify the relevant thermodynamic variables\ninvolved. Our analysis is two-fold: on the one hand, we assess the optimality\nof the protocol by means of suitable figures of merit, accounting for both its\nwork cost and effectiveness; on the other hand, we characterise the nature of\ncorrelations built up between the register and the ancilla. In particular, we\nobserve that neither the amount of classical correlations nor the quantum\nentanglement seem to be key ingredients fuelling our spin refrigeration\nprotocol. We report instead that a more general indicator of quantumness beyond\nentanglement, the so-called quantum discord, is closely related to the cooling\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 23:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 15:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

The main motivation for these architectural\ninnovations is that they capture better domain knowledge, and importantly are\neasier to optimize than more basic architectures. Recently, more complex\narchitectures such as Neural Turing Machines and Memory Networks have been\nproposed for tasks including question answering and general computation,\ncreating a new set of optimization challenges.

This method alone allows a fully-connected 20-layer deep network\nto be trained with standard gradient descent, even starting from a poor\ninitialization. We see consistent improvements for many complex models,\nincluding a 72% relative reduction in error rate over a carefully-tuned\nbaseline on a challenging question-answering task, and a doubling of the number\nof accurate binary multiplication models learned across 7,000 random restarts.\nWe encourage further application of this technique to additional complex modern\narchitectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 01:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

This paper investigates the\nenergy-aware virtual machine (VM) allocation problems in IaaS clouds along\ncharacteristics: multiple resources, and fixed interval times and\nnon-preemption of virtual machines. Many previous works proposed to use a\nminimum number of physical machines, however, this is not necessarily a good\nsolution to minimize total energy consumption in the VM placement with multiple\nresources, fixed interval times and non-preemption. We observed that minimizing\ntotal energy consumption of physical machines is equivalent to minimize the sum\nof total completion time of all physical machines. Based on the observation, we\npropose EMinRET algorithm. The EMinRET algorithm swaps an allocating VM with a\nsuitable overlapped VM, which is of the same VM type and is allocated on the\nsame physical machine, to minimize total completion time of all physical\nmachines. The EMinRET uses resource utilization during executing time period of\na physical machine as the evaluation metric, and will then choose a host that\nminimizes the metric to allocate a new VM. In addition, this work studies some\nheuristics for sorting the list of virtual machines (e.g., sorting by the\nearliest starting time, or the longest duration time first, etc.) to allocate\nVM. Using the realistic log-trace in the Parallel Workloads Archive, our\nsimulation results show that the EMinRET algorithm could reduce from 25% to 45%\nenergy consumption compared with power-aware best-fit decreasing (PABFD)) and\nvector bin-packing norm-based greedy algorithms.

For the CTC training, however, it is required to unroll (or\nunfold) the RNN by the length of an input sequence. This unrolling requires a\nlot of memory and hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning\nor adaptation. Furthermore, the length of training sequences is usually not\nuniform, which makes parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on\nshared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we\nintroduce an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm that\nenables unidirectional RNNs to learn sequences that are longer than the amount\nof unrolling. The RNNs can also be trained to process an infinitely long input\nsequence without pre-segmentation or external reset. Moreover, the proposed\napproach allows efficient parallel training on GPUs. For evaluation, phoneme\nrecognition and end-to-end speech recognition examples are presented on the\nTIMIT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpora, respectively. Our online model\nachieves 20.7% phoneme error rate (PER) on the very long input sequence that is\ngenerated by concatenating all 192 utterances in the TIMIT core test set. On\nWSJ, a network can be trained with only 64 times of unrolling while sacrificing\n4.5% relative word error rate (WER).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 05:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 12:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 20:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 13:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

In\nmany of these applications, the number of constraints is relatively small\ncompared to the number of unknowns. The traditional null-space method is\ninefficient for these systems, because it is expensive to find the null space\nexplicitly. Some alternatives, notably constraint-preconditioned or projected\nKrylov methods, are relatively efficient, but they can suffer from numerical\ninstability and even nonconvergence. In addition, most existing methods require\nthe system to be nonsingular or be reducible to a nonsingular system. In this\npaper, we propose a new method, called OPINS, for singular and nonsingular\nsaddle-point systems. OPINS is equivalent to the null-space method with an\northogonal projector, without forming the orthogonal basis of the null space\nexplicitly. OPINS can not only solve for the unique solution for nonsingular\nsaddle-point problems, but also find the minimum-norm solution in terms of the\nsolution variables for singular systems. The method is efficient and easy to\nimplement using existing Krylov solvers for singular systems. At the same time,\nit is more stable than the other alternatives, such as projected Krylov\nmethods. We present some preconditioners to accelerate the convergence of OPINS\nfor nonsingular systems, and compare OPINS against some present\nstate-of-the-art methods for various types of singular and nonsingular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 06:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and Fermi data, the whole\nenergy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap. In the\nobservation period, Mrk 421 showed both low and high activity states at all\nwavebands. The correlations among flux variations in different wavebands were\nanalyzed. Seven large flares, including five X-ray flares and two GeV gamma-ray\nflares with variable durations (3-58 days), and one X-ray outburst phase were\nidentified and used to investigate the variation of the spectral energy\ndistribution with respect to a relative quiescent phase. During the outburst\nphase and the seven flaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to\nincrease from sub-keV to few keV. The TeV gamma-ray flux increases up to\n0.9-7.2 times the flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV gamma-rays is\nfound to vary depending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify\nflares into three groups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the\none-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was adopted to describe the emission\nspectra. Two out of three groups can be satisfactorily described using injected\nelectrons with a power-law spectral index around 2.2, as expected from\nrelativistic diffuse shock acceleration, whereas the remaining group requires a\nharder injected spectrum.

Our technique is based on the hypothesis that semantic parts are\nrepresented by populations of neurons rather than by single filters. We propose\na clustering technique to extract part representations, which we call Visual\nConcepts. We show that visual concepts are semantically coherent in that they\nrepresent semantic parts, and visually coherent in that corresponding image\npatches appear very similar. Also, visual concepts provide full spatial\ncoverage of the parts of an object, rather than a few sparse parts as is\ntypically found in keypoint annotations. Furthermore, We treat single visual\nconcept as part detector and evaluate it for keypoint detection using the\nPASCAL3D+ dataset and for part detection using our newly annotated ImageNetPart\ndataset. The experiments demonstrate that visual concepts can be used to detect\nparts. We also show that some visual concepts respond to several semantic\nparts, provided these parts are visually similar.

A big difficulty is the large\nvariability of scale and location for objects and their corresponding parts.\nEven limited mistakes in estimating scale and location will degrade the parsing\noutput and cause errors in boundary details. To tackle these difficulties, we\npropose a \"Hierarchical Auto-Zoom Net\" (HAZN) for object part parsing which\nadapts to the local scales of objects and parts. HAZN is a sequence of two\n\"Auto-Zoom Net\" (AZNs), each employing fully convolutional networks that\nperform two tasks: (1) predict the locations and scales of object instances\n(the first AZN) or their parts (the second AZN); (2) estimate the part scores\nfor predicted object instance or part regions.

We come to this conclusion by a combination of theoretical arguments\nsupported by computer simulations using the Astrophysical Multipurpose Software\nEnvironment. According to this model the $\\sim 90$\\,\\MSun\\, present primary\nstar of the highly eccentric Eta Carinae binary system is the product of this\nmerger, and its $\\sim 30$\\,\\MSun\\, companion originally was the third star in\nthe system.

The\ncurrent orbital plane is then aligned with the equatorial plane of the\nHomunculus, and the symmetric lobes are roughly aligned with the argument of\nperiastron of the current Eta Carina binary. The merger itself then occurred in\n1838, which resulted in a massive asymmetric outflow in the equatorial plane of\nthe Homunculus. The 1843 outburst can in our model be attributed to the\nsubsequent encounter when the companion star (once the outer most star in the\ntriple system) plunges through the bloated envelope of the merger product, once\nwhen it passed periastron again.

Empirical evaluation on\nreal-world datasets shows that our proposed approach outperforms existing\nalgorithms for active learning of MOGP and single-output GP models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 15:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 08:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

Many previous works have been\nproposed to use a minimum number of physical machines, however, this is not\nnecessarily a good solution to minimize total energy consumption in the VM\nplacement with multiple resources, fixed interval time and non-preemption. We\nobserved that minimizing the sum of total busy time of all physical machines\nimplies minimizing total energy consumption of physical machines. In addition\nto, if mapping of a VM onto physical machines have the same total busy time\nthen the best mapping has physical machine's remaining available resource\nminimizing. Based on these observations, we proposed heuristic-based EM\nalgorithm to solve the energy-aware VM allocation with fixed starting time and\nduration time. In addition, this work studies some heuristics for sorting the\nlist of virtual machines (e.g., sorting by the earliest starting time, or\nlatest finishing time, or the longest duration time first, etc.) to allocate\nVM. We evaluate the EM using CloudSim toolkit and jobs log-traces in the\nFeitelson's Parallel Workloads Archive. Simulation's results show that all of\nEM-ST, EM-LFT and EM-LDTF algorithms could reduce total energy consumption\ncompared to state-of-the-art of power-aware VM allocation algorithms.

It is\ndemonstrated that switching a reactive component such as a capacitor, in a\nhigh-Q resonator with proper switching signal can preserve the stored energy\nand shift it to a different frequency. Switching boundaries are found by\ncontinuity of electric charge and magnetic flux. It is shown that if switching\ntime is synchronous with zero crossing of the voltage signal across the\nswitched capacitor, impulsive components can be avoided and continuity of\nelectric charge is satisfied without energy dissipation. We use this property\nto realize a fast binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulator with only a\nsingle RF source.
