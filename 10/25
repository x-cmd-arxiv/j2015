A number of parameter estimation methods have been proposed\nfor loss tomography of networks with a tree structure as well as a general\ntopological structure. However, these methods suffer from either high\ncomputational cost or insufficient use of information in the data. In this\npaper, we provide both theoretical results and practical algorithms for\nparameter estimation in loss tomography. By introducing a group of novel\nstatistics and alternative parameter systems, we find that the likelihood\nfunction of the observed data from loss tomography keeps exactly the same\nmathematical formulation for tree and general topologies, revealing that\nnetworks with different topologies share the same mathematical nature for loss\ntomography. More importantly, we discover that a re-parametrization of the\nlikelihood function belongs to the standard exponential family, which is convex\nand has a unique mode under regularity conditions. Based on these theoretical\nresults, novel algorithms to find the MLE are developed. Compared to existing\nmethods in the literature, the proposed methods enjoy great computational\nadvantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 16:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

This\narchitecture enables centralized processing at the CU, and hence the\nimplementation of enhanced interference mitigation strategies, but it also\nentails an increased decoding latency due to the transport on the fronthaul\nnetwork. The fronthaul latency may offset the benefits of centralized\nprocessing when considering the performance of protocols at layer 2 and above.\nThis letter studies the impact of fronthaul latency on the performance of\nstandard Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) protocols, namely Stop and\nWait, Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat. The performance of the C-RAN architecture\nin terms of throughput and efficiency is compared to the that of a conventional\ncellular system with local processing, as well as with that of a proposed\nhybrid C-RAN system in which BSs can perform decoding. The dynamics of the\nsystem are modeled as a multi-dimensional Markov process that includes\nsub-chains to capture the temporal correlation of interference and channel\ngains. Numerical results yield insights into the impact of system parameters\nsuch as fronthaul latency and signal-to-interference ratio on different ARQ\nprotocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 19:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

We argue that a derivative liability, after primary risk factors\nbeing hedged, resembles in economics an issued variable funding note, and\nshould be priced at the market rate of the issuer's debt. For the purpose of\ndetermining the fair value, the party on the liability side is economically\nneutral to make a deposit to the other party, which earns his current debt rate\nand effectively provides funding and hedging for the party holding the\nderivative asset. The newly derived partial differential equation for an option\ndiscounts the derivative's receivable part with counterparty's curve and\npayable part with own financing curve. The price difference from the\ncounterparty risk free price, or total counterparty risk adjustment, is\nprecisely defined by discounting the product of the risk free price and the\ncredit spread at the local liability curve. Subsequently the adjustment can be\nbroken into a default risk component -- CVA and a funding component -- FVA,\nconsistent with a simple note's fair value treatment and in accordance with the\nusual understanding of a bond's credit spread consisting of a CDS spread and a\nbasis. As for FVA, we define a cost -- credit funding adjustment (CFA) and a\nbenefit -- debit funding adjustment (DFA), in parallel to CVA and DVA and\nattributed to counterparty's and own funding basis. This resolves a number of\noutstanding FVA debate issues, such as double counting, violation of the law of\none price, misuse of cash flow discounting, and controversial hedging of own\ndefault risk. It also allows an integrated implementation strategy and reuse of\nexisting CVA infrastructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 01:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Traditional approaches of sediment\ntransport simulations heavily rely on empirical models, which are not able to\ncapture the physics-rich, regime-dependent behaviors of the process. With the\nincrease of available computational resources in the past decade, CFD-DEM\n(computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) has emerged as a viable\nhigh-fidelity method for the study of sediment transport. However, a\ncomprehensive, quantitative study of the generation and migration of different\nsediment bed patterns using CFD-DEM is still lacking. In this work,\ncurrent-induced sediment transport problems in a wide range of regimes are\nsimulated, including 'flat bed in motion', `small dune', `vortex dune' and\nsuspended transport. Simulations are performed by using SediFoam, an\nopen-source, massively parallel CFD-DEM solver developed by the authors. This\nis a general-purpose solver for particle-laden flows tailed for particle\ntransport problems. Validation tests are performed to demonstrate the\ncapability of CFD-DEM in the full range of sediment transport regimes.\nComparison of simulation results with experimental and numerical benchmark data\ndemonstrates the merits of CFD-DEM approach. In addition, the improvements of\nthe present simulations over existing studies using CFD-DEM are presented. The\npresent solver gives more accurate prediction of sediment transport rate by\nproperly accounting for the influence of particle volume fraction on the fluid\nflow. In summary, this work demonstrates that CFD-DEM is a promising\nparticle-resolving approach for probing the physics of current-induced sediment\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2015 02:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 03:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 20:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

The objective of this manuscript is to present an\noriginal self-contained treatment of the multidimensional pricing. During the\npast decades the Black-Scholes this model, which essentially is based on the\nlog-normal assumption, has been increasingly criticised. In particular, it was\nnoticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more\nconcentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This\nsuggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy\nprocesses instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced. We present a general method of high-dimensional\noption pricing based on a wide range of jump-diffusion models. Namely, we\nconstruct approximation formulas for the price of spread options. It is\nimportant to get an efficient approximation for the respective density\nfunction, since the reward function has usually a simple structure. Instead of\na commonly used tabulation approach, we use the respective m-widths to compare\na wide range of numerical methods. We give an algorithm of almost optimal, in\nthe sense of the respective m-widths, reconstruction of density functions. To\ndemonstrate the power of our approach we consider in details a concrete class\nof Levy driven processes and present the respective rates of convergence of\napproximation formulas.

We apply the model to Enceladus, by\nguessing the initial conditions that would render a structure compatible with\npresent-day observations, assuming the initial structure to have been\nhomogeneous. Assuming the satellite has been losing water continually along its\nevolution, we postulate that it was formed as a more massive, more icy and more\nporous satellite, and gradually transformed into its present day state due to\nsustained long-term tidal heating.

The notion of statistical\nevidence is thereby formulated in the framework of hypothesis testing, where\nthe null hypothesis is that the experiment can be described by an LHVM. The\nstatistical confidence with which the null hypothesis of an LHVM is rejected is\nquantified by the so-called P-value, where a smaller P-value implies higher\nconfidence. Establishing good statistical evidence is especially challenging if\nthe number of trials is small, or the Bell violation very low. Here, we derive\nthe optimal P-value for a large class of Bell inequalities. What's more, we\nobtain very sharp upper bounds on the P-value for all Bell inequalities.

There has been considerable progress in modeling the central engine of\nactive galactic nuclei by an accreting supermassive black hole coupled to a\nrelativistic plasma jet. However, can a single model be applied to a range of\nblack hole masses and accretion rates? Here we want to compare the latest\nthree-dimensional numerical model, originally developed for Sgr A* in the\ncenter of the Milky Way, to radio observations of the much more powerful and\nmore massive black hole in M87. We postprocess three-dimensional GRMHD models\nof a jet-producing radiatively inefficient accretion flow around a spinning\nblack hole using relativistic radiative transfer and ray-tracing to produce\nmodel spectra and images. As a key new ingredient to these models, we allow the\nproton-electron coupling in these simulations depend on the magnetic properties\nof the plasma. We find that the radio emission in M87 is well described by a\ncombination of a two-temperature accretion flow and a hot single-temperature\njet. The model fits the basic observed characteristics of the M87 radio core.\nThe best fit model has a mass-accretion rate of Mdot approx 9x10^{-3} MSUN/YR\nand a total jet power of P_j \\sim 10^{43} erg/s. Emission at 1.3mm is produced\nby the counter jet close to the event horizon. Its characteristic crescent\nshape surrounding the black hole shadow could be resolved by future\nmillimeter-wave VLBI experiments.

In this\npaper, we propose a modeling formalism and a synthesis algorithm that exploits\nthis hierarchical structure for more scalable synthesis.\n  We define local games on hierarchical graphs as a modeling formalism which\ndecomposes a large-scale reactive synthesis problem in two dimensions. First,\nthe construction of a hierarchical game graph introduces abstraction layers,\nwhere each layer is again a two-player game graph. Second, every such layer is\ndecomposed into multiple local game graphs, each corresponding to a node in the\nhigher level game graph. While local games have the potential to reduce the\nstate space for controller synthesis, they lead to more complex synthesis\nproblems where strategies computed for one local game can impose additional\nrequirements on lower-level local games.\n  Our second contribution is a procedure to construct a dynamic controller for\nlocal game graphs over hierarchies. The controller computes assume-admissible\nwinning strategies that satisfy local specifications in the presence of\nenvironment assumptions, and dynamically updates specifications and strategies\ndue to interactions between games at different abstraction layers at each step\nof the play.
