Upper-division\nphysics students encounter this technique in multiple topical areas including\nelectrostatics and quantum mechanics. To better understand the difficulties\nstudents encounter when utilizing the separation of variables technique, we\nexamined students' responses to midterm exam questions and a standardized\nconceptual assessment, and conducted think-aloud, problem-solving interviews.\nOur analysis was guided by an analytical framework that focuses on how students\nactivate, construct, execute, and reflect on the separation of variables\ntechnique when solving physics problems. Here we focus on student difficulties\nwith separation of variables as a technique to solve Laplace's equation in both\nCartesian and spherical coordinates in the context of junior-level\nelectrostatics. Challenges include: recognizing when separation of variables is\nthe appropriate tool; recalling/justifying the separated form of the potential\nand the need for the infinite sum; identifying implicit boundary conditions;\nand spontaneously reflecting on their solutions. Moreover, the type and\nfrequency of errors was often different for SoV problems in Cartesian and\nspherical geometries. We also briefly discuss implication of these our findings\nfor instruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 17:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

Sensitivity analysis provides an attractive way to\npartially circumvent this issue by assessing the potential influence of\nunmeasured confounding on the causal conclusions. However, previous sensitivity\nanalysis approaches often make strong and untestable assumptions such as having\na confounder that is binary, or having no interaction between the effects of\nthe exposure and the confounder on the outcome, or having only one confounder.\nWithout imposing any assumptions on the confounder or confounders, we derive a\nbounding factor and a sharp inequality such that the sensitivity analysis\nparameters must satisfy the inequality if an unmeasured confounder is to\nexplain away the observed effect estimate or reduce it to a particular level.\nOur approach is easy to implement and involves only two sensitivity parameters.\nSurprisingly, our bounding factor, which makes no simplifying assumptions, is\nno more conservative than a number of previous sensitivity analysis techniques\nthat do make assumptions. Our new bounding factor implies not only the\ntraditional Cornfield conditions that both the relative risk of the exposure on\nthe confounder and that of the confounder on the outcome must satisfy, but also\na high threshold that the maximum of these relative risks must satisfy.\nFurthermore, this new bounding factor can be viewed as a measure of the\nstrength of confounding between the exposure and the outcome induced by a\nconfounder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 19:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

While some quiescent\nneutron stars (e.g. Cen X-4, Aql X-1) have shown variations in their thermal\ncomponents on a range of timescales, several others, particularly those in\nglobular clusters with no detectable nonthermal hard X-rays (fit with a\npowerlaw), have shown no measurable variations.

We find that the\nspatial extent of the Ha distribution increases with stellar mass as\nr(Ha)[kpc]=1.5(Mstars/10^10Msun)^0.23. Furthermore, the Ha emission is more\nextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out\nassembly of galactic disks.

This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the\nenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of\ngalaxies.

Following our comprehensive studies of WR stars in the\nMilky Way, M31, and the LMC, we derive stellar parameters and mass-loss rates\nfor all seven putatively single WN stars known in the SMC.

The quantitative analysis of the WN stars is performed\nwith the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The physical\nproperties of our program stars are obtained from fitting synthetic spectra to\nmulti-band observations. In all SMC WN stars, a considerable surface hydrogen\nabundance is detectable. The majority of these objects have stellar\ntemperatures exceeding 75 kK, while their luminosities range from 10^5.5 to\n10^6.1 Lsun. The WN stars in the SMC exhibit on average lower mass-loss rates\nand weaker winds than their counterparts in the Milky Way, M31, and the LMC. By\ncomparing the mass-loss rates derived for WN stars in different Local Group\ngalaxies, we conclude that a clear dependence of the wind mass-loss on the\ninitial metallicity is evident, supporting the current paradigm that WR winds\nare driven by radiation.

By\nnumerically analyzing deviations from ETH behavior in the non-integrable Ising\nmodel, we propose a quantity that we call the $n$-$weight$ to democratically\ncharacterize the average deviations for all operators residing on a given\nnumber of sites, irrespective of their spatial structure. It appears to have a\nsimple scaling form, that we conjecture to hold true for all non-integrable\nsystems. A closely related quantity, that we term the $n$-$distinguishability$,\ntells us how well two states can be distinguished if only $n$-site operators\nare measured. Along the way, we discover that complicated operators on average\nare worse than simple ones at distinguishing between neighboring eigenstates,\ncontrary to the naive intuition created by the usual statements of the ETH that\nfew-body (many-body) operators acquire the same (different) expectation values\nin nearby eigenstates at finite energy density.

If the\nacoustic models are built using features of clean utterances, the features of a\nnoisy test utterance would be acoustically mismatched with the trained model.\nThis gives poor likelihoods and poor recognition accuracy. Model adaptation and\nfeature normalisation are two broad areas that address this problem. While the\nformer often gives better performance, the latter involves estimation of lesser\nnumber of parameters, making the system feasible for practical implementations.\n  This research focuses on the efficacies of various subspace, statistical and\nstereo based feature normalisation techniques. A subspace projection based\nmethod has been investigated as a standalone and adjunct technique involving\nreconstruction of noisy speech features from a precomputed set of clean speech\nbuilding-blocks. The building blocks are learned using non-negative matrix\nfactorisation (NMF) on log-Mel filter bank coefficients, which form a basis for\nthe clean speech subspace. The work provides a detailed study on how the method\ncan be incorporated into the extraction process of Mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefficients. Experimental results show that the new features are robust to\nnoise, and achieve better results when combined with the existing techniques.\n  The work also proposes a modification to the training process of SPLICE\nalgorithm for noise robust speech recognition. It is based on feature\ncorrelations, and enables this stereo-based algorithm to improve the\nperformance in all noise conditions, especially in unseen cases. Further, the\nmodified framework is extended to work for non-stereo datasets where clean and\nnoisy training utterances, but not stereo counterparts, are required. An\nMLLR-based computationally efficient run-time noise adaptation method in SPLICE\nframework has been proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 20:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

By\nfitting observational data on a case by case basis, we are able to obtain\nconstraints about the parallel electric field, the typical lengthscale over\nwhich particles emit the bulk of the detected radiation, and the number of\ninvolved particles. The model copes well with data of several dozens of\nmillisecond and young pulsars. By correlating the inferred model parameters\nwith the observed timing properties, some trends are discovered. First, a\nnon-negligible part of the radiation comes from the loss of perpendicular\nmomentum soon after pair creation. Second, the electric field strongly\ncorrelates with both the inverse of the emission lengthscale and the magnetic\nfield at light cylinder, thus ruling out models with high-energy photon\nproduction close to the surface. These correlations unify young and millisecond\npulsars under the same physical scenario, and predict that magnetars are\nintrinsically $\\gamma$-ray quiet via syncrhro-curvature processes, since\nmagnetospheric particles are not accelerated enough to emit a detectable\n$\\gamma$-ray flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 20:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

Several, such as\nGibbs' paradox, involve the fact that classical particles are distinguishable,\nand in textbooks these are often `resolved' by appeal to the quantum-mechanical\nindistinguishability of atoms or molecules of the same type. However, questions\nthen remain of how to correctly define the entropy of large poly-atomic\nparticles such as colloids in suspension, of which no two are exactly alike. By\nperforming experiments on such colloids, one can establish that certain\ndefinitions of the classical entropy fit the data, while others in the\nliterature do not. Specifically, the experimental facts point firmly to an\n`informatic' interpretation that dates back to Gibbs: entropy is determined by\nthe number of microstates that we as observers choose to treat as equivalent\nwhen we identify a macrostate. This approach, unlike some others, can account\nfor the existence of colloidal crystals, and for the observed abundances of\ncolloidal clusters of different shapes.

AMD is usually constructed from\nobservations of narrow absorption lines in radio-quiet active galaxies with\nwarm absorbers. We study the properties of the warm absorber in Mrk~509 using\nrecently published broad-band spectral energy distribution observed with\ndifferent instruments. This spectrum is an input in radiative transfer\ncomputations with full photoionisation treatment using {\\sc titan} code. We\nshow that the simplest way to fully reproduce the shape of AMD is to assume\nthat the warm absorber is a single zone under constant total pressure. With\nthis assumption we found theoretical AMD which matches the observed one\ndetermined on the basis of 600 ks RGS XMM-Newton spectrum of Mrk~509. The\nsoftness of the source spectrum and the important role of the free-free\nemission breaks the usual degeneracy in the ionization state calculations, and\nthe explicit dependence of the depths of AMD dips on density open a new path to\ndensity diagnostic for the warm absorber. In Mrk 509 the implied density is of\nthe order of $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 21:59:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 12:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

The high order meshing procedure starts with a\nlinear mesh, that is subsequently curved without taking care of the validity of\nthe high order elements. An optimization procedure is then used to both\nuntangle invalid elements and optimize the geometrical accuracy of the mesh.\nStandard measures of the distance between curves are considered to evaluate the\ngeometrical accuracy in planar two-dimensional meshes, but they prove\ncomputationally too costly for optimization purposes. A fast estimate of the\ngeometrical accuracy, based on Taylor expansions of the curves, is introduced.\nAn unconstrained optimization procedure based on this estimate is shown to\nyield significant improvements in the geometrical accuracy of high order\nmeshes, as measured by the standard Haudorff distance between the geometrical\nmodel and the mesh. Several examples illustrate the beneficial impact of this\nmethod on CFD solutions, with a particular role of the enhanced mesh boundary\nsmoothness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 23:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

From polarized brightness images,\nwe estimate the CME mass, which is close to the average mass of low-latitude\nCMEs. The CME kinetic energy (3.3x1030 erg) is also typical of the general\npopulation of CMEs. From photospheric magnetograms, we estimate the free energy\n(1.8x1031 erg) in the polar crown source region, which we find is sufficient to\npower the CME and the PEA. About 19% of the free energy went into the CME\nkinetic energy. We compute the thermal energy content of the PEA (2.3x1029 erg)\nand find it to be a small fraction (6.8%) of the CME kinetic energy.

Since early in the CGRO\nera, the empirical Band function has been considered a good description of the\nkeV-MeV spectra although its shape is very often inconsistent with the\npredictions of the pure synchrotron emission scenarios. We have recently\nestablished a new observational model analyzing data of the NASA Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope. In this model, GRB prompt emission is a combination\nof three main emission components: (i) a thermal-like component that we\ninterpreted so far as the jet photosphere emission, (ii) a non-thermal\ncomponent that we interpreted so far as synchrotron radiation, and (iii) an\nadditional non-thermal (cutoff) power-law most likely of inverse Compton\norigin. In this article we reanalyze some of the bright GRBs observed with\nCGRO/BATSE with the new model, namely GRBs 941017, 970111 and 990123. We\nconclude that BATSE data are fully consistent with the recent results obtained\nwith Fermi: some bright BATSE GRBs exhibit three separate components during the\nprompt phase with similar spectral parameters as these reported from Fermi\ndata. In addition, the analysis of the BATSE GRBs with the new model results in\na relation between the time-resolved energy flux of the non-thermal component\nand its corresponding $\\nu$F$_\\nu$ peak energy (i.e.,\nF$_{i}^{nTh}$-E$_{peak,i}^{nTh}$) that has a similar index as the one initially\nderived from Fermi data.

We find that the H-alpha dust extinction (A(Ha))\nderived with H-alpha/H-beta ratio (Balmer decrement) increases with increasing\nH-alpha/UV ratio as expected, but there remains a considerable scatter around\nthe relation, which is largely dependent on stellar mass and/or H-alpha\nequivalent width (EW(Ha)).

We quantify this trend and establish an empirical calibration for\npredicting A(Ha) with a combination of H-alpha/UV ratio, stellar mass and\nEW(Ha), with which we can successfully reduce the systematic uncertainties\naccompanying the simple H-alpha/UV approach by ~15-30%.

This paper presents a novel\nsolution that seamlessly integrates two technologies, mobile cloud computing\nand microwave power transfer (MPT), to enable computation in passive\nlow-complexity devices such as sensors and wearable computing devices.\nSpecifically, considering a single-user system, a base station (BS) either\ntransfers power to or offloads computation from a mobile to the cloud; the\nmobile uses harvested energy to compute given data either locally or by\noffloading. A framework for energy efficient computing is proposed that\ncomprises a set of policies for controlling CPU cycles for the mode of local\ncomputing, time division between MPT and offloading for the other mode of\noffloading, and mode selection. Given the CPU-cycle statistics information and\nchannel state information (CSI), the policies aim at maximizing the probability\nof successfully computing given data, called computing probability, under the\nenergy harvesting and deadline constraints. The policy optimization is\ntranslated into the equivalent problems of minimizing the mobile energy\nconsumption for local computing and maximizing the mobile energy savings for\noffloading which are solved using convex optimization theory. The structures of\nthe resultant policies are characterized in closed form. Furthermore, given\nnon-causal CSI, the said analytical framework is further developed to support\ncomputation load allocation over multiple channel realizations, which further\nincreases computing probability.

One may define a\ndepinning frequency, above which significant depinning occurs. This publication\npresents a derivation of the depinning frequency from experimental data. We\nfind a depinning frequency of 673 MHz for RRR 110 niobium. On this basis the\ncurrently used model is extended to describe the trapped flux sensitivity as\nfunction of residual resistance ratio (RRR) and operation frequency while also\naccounting for the pinning center size and the treatment history of the cavity.\nMoreover, the model offers an explanation for the significantly higher trapped\nflux sensitivity reported for nitrogen doped and 120 C baked cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 07:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

These provide\ntriaxial density profiles with cores or cusps at the centre. They are the first\nself-consistent triaxial models with analytic DFs suitable for modelling giant\nellipticals and dark haloes. Specifically, we study triaxial models that\nreproduce the Hernquist profile from Williams & Evans (2015), as well as\nflattened isochrones of the form proposed by Binney (2014). We explore the\nkinematics and orbital structure of these models in some detail. The models\ntypically become more radially anisotropic on moving outwards, have velocity\nellipsoids aligned in Cartesian coordinates in the centre and aligned in\nspherical polar coordinates in the outer parts.\n  In projection, the ellipticity of the isophotes and the position angle of the\nmajor axis of our models generally changes with radius. So, a natural\napplication is to elliptical galaxies that exhibit isophote twisting. As\ntriaxial St\\\"ackel models do not show isophote twists, our DFs are the first to\ngenerate mass density distributions that do exhibit this phenomenon, typically\nwith a gradient of $\\approx 10^\\circ$/effective radius, which is comparable to\nthe data.\n  Triaxiality is a natural consequence of models that are susceptible to the\nradial orbit instability. We show how a family of spherical models with\nanisotropy profiles that transition from isotropic at the centre to radially\nanisotropic becomes unstable when the outer anisotropy is made sufficiently\nradial. Models with a larger outer anisotropy can be constructed but are found\nto be triaxial. We argue that the onset of the radial orbit instability can be\nidentified with the transition point when adiabatic relaxation yields strongly\ntriaxial rather than weakly spherical endpoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 08:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

We investigate a simple dynamical model\nfor understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target\nand an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with\nclustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable\nregion, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a\nlocally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior; and\n(iii) a globally unstable region. A crude calibration of parameters to data\nputs the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price\nbubble, resembling a \"Great Moderation\", followed by a crash, with a period of\napproximately 10-15 years, which we dub the \"Basel leverage cycle\". We propose\na criterion for rating macroprudential policies based on their ability to\nminimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family\nof leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of\nBasel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to\ncountercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases.\nWe find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average\nleverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the\nfundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal\nwhen the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the\nopposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy\nis closer to constant leverage. We also find that systemic risk can be\ndramatically decreased by lowering the leverage target adjustment speed of the\nbanks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

We found that the\noccurrence of HBB is needed to interpret the nitrogen-enriched (log(N/H)+12>8)\nPNe.

While original quantum uncertainty\nproducts depend on ${\\rm{\\hbar}}$ and the number of states ($n$), a\ndimensionless approach makes the comparison between quantum uncertainty and\nclassical dispersion possible by excluding ${\\rm{\\hbar}}$. But the question is\nwhether the uncertainty still remains dependent on quantum number $n$. In the\nabove-mentioned article, there lies this contrast, on the one hand, the\ndimensionless quantum uncertainty of the potential box approaches classical\ndispersion only in the limit of large quantum numbers ($n\\to \\infty\n$)-consistent with the correspondence principle. On the other hand, similar\nevaluations for bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal to\ntheir classical counterparts independent of $n$. This equality may hide the\nquantum feature of low energy levels. In the current study, we change the\npotential intervals in order to make them symmetric for the linear potential\nand non-symmetric for the quadratic potential. As a result, it is shown in this\npaper that the dimensionless quantum uncertainty of these potentials in the new\npotential intervals is expressed in terms of quantum number $n$. In other\nwords, the uncertainty requires the correspondence principle in order to\napproach the classical limit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\ndimensionless analysis, as a useful pedagogical method, does not take away the\nquantum feature of the n-dependence of quantum uncertainty in general.\nMoreover, our numerical calculations include the higher powers of the position\nfor the potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 09:42:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 06:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

The\nformalism is designed for self-conjugate (N=Z) systems of nucleons moving in\naxially deformed mean fields and interacting through the most general isovector\nand isoscalar pairing interactions. The ground state of these systems is\ndescribed by a superposition of two types of condensates, i.e., condensates of\nisovector quartets, built by two isovector pairs coupled to the total isospin\nT=0, and condensates of isoscalar proton-neutron pairs. The comparison with the\nexact solutions of realistic isovector-isoscalar pairing Hamiltonians shows\nthat this ansatz for the ground state is able to describe with high precision\nthe pairing correlation energies. It is also shown that, at variance with the\nmajority of Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations, in the present formalism the\nisovector and isoscalar pairing correlations coexist for any pairing\ninteractions. The competition between the isovector and isoscalar\nproton-neutron pairing correlations is studied for N=Z nuclei with the valence\nnucleons moving in the $sd$ and $pf$ shells and in the major shell above\n$^{100}$Sn. We find that in these nuclei the isovector pairing prevail over the\nisoscalar pairing, especially for heavier nuclei. However, the isoscalar\nproton-neutron correlations are significant in all nuclei and they always\ncoexist with the isovector pairing correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

However, transmission trees from one outbreak do not generalize to\nfuture outbreaks. Reconstruction of transmission trees is most useful to public\nhealth if it leads to generalizable scientific insights about disease\ntransmission. In a survival analysis framework, estimation of transmission\nparameters is based on sums or averages over the possible transmission trees. A\nphylogeny can increase the precision of these estimates by providing partial\ninformation about who infected whom. The leaves of the phylogeny represent\nsampled pathogens, which have known hosts.

A theoretical model is\ndeveloped, which allows one to attribute the QBs at negative delay to the\nfour-wave mixing (FWM) signal detected at the non-standard direction. The beat\nsignal is strongly enhanced by the interference of the FWM wave with the\npolarization created by the probe pulse. At positive delay, the QBs are due to\nthe mutual interference of the quantum confined exciton states. Several QB\nfrequencies are observed in the experiments, which coincide with the interlevel\nspacings in the exciton system. The decay time for QBs is of order of several\npicoseconds at both the positive and negative delays. They are close to the\nrelaxation time of exciton population that allows one to consider the exciton\ndepopulation as the main mechanism of the coherence relaxation in the system\nunder study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 13:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Motivated by the evaluation of Italian\nuniversity grants, we consider a fuzzy RD design where the receipt of the\ntreatment is based on both eligibility criteria and a voluntary application\nstatus. Resting on the fact that grant application and grant receipt statuses\nare post-assignment (post-eligibility) intermediate variables, we use the\nprincipal stratification framework to define causal estimands within the Rubin\nCausal Model. We propose a probabilistic formulation of the assignment\nmechanism underlying RD designs, by re-formulating the Stable Unit Treatment\nValue Assumption (SUTVA) and making an explicit local overlap assumption for a\nsubpopulation around the threshold. A local randomization assumption is invoked\ninstead of more standard continuity assumptions. We also develop a model-based\nBayesian approach to select the target subpopulation(s) with adjustment for\nmultiple comparisons, and to draw inference for the target causal estimands in\nthis framework.

Specifically, the users are divided into two groups according to\ntheir large-scale fading coefficients, referred to as the center users, who\nonly suffer from modest pilot contamination and the edge users, who suffer from\nsevere pilot contamination. Based on this distinction, the SPR scheme is\nproposed for improving the QoS for the edge users, whereby a cell-center pilot\ngroup is reused for all cell-center users in all cells, while a cell-edge pilot\ngroup is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells. By extending the\nclassical block diagonalization precoding to a multi-cell scenario, the MBD\nprecoding scheme projects the downlink transmit signal onto the null space of\nthe subspace spanned by the inter-cell channels of the edge users in adjacent\ncells.

Such NLTE effects may be intensified or weakened by horizontal\nradiative transfer (RT) in a three-dimensionally (3-D) structured atmosphere.\nWe analyze the influence of horizontal RT on commonly used Fe I lines in a\nsnapshot of a 3-D radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a plage\nregion. NLTE- and horizontal RT effects occur with considerable strength (up to\n50% in line depth or equivalent width) in the analyzed snapshot. As they may\nhave either sign and both signs occur with approximately the same frequency and\nstrength, the net effects are small when considering spatially averaged\nquantities. The situation in the plage atmosphere turns out to be rather\ncomplex. Horizontal transfer leads to line-weakening relative to 1-D NLTE\ntransfer near the boundaries of kG magnetic elements. Around the centers of\nthese elements, however, we find an often significant line-strengthening. This\nbehavior is in contrast to that expected from previous 3-D RT computations in\nidealized flux-tube models, which display only a line weakening. The origin of\nthis unexpected behavior lies in the fact that magnetic elements are surrounded\nby dense and relatively cool down-flowing gas, which forms the walls of the\nmagnetic elements. The continuum in these dense walls is often formed in colder\ngas than in the central part of the magnetic elements. Consequently, the\ncentral parts of the magnetic element experience a sub-average UV-irradiation\nleading to the observed 3-D NLTE line strengthening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 14:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

We use the first-order structure function,\n$SF(\\delta t)$, to fit both light curves to the damped power-law PSD of\nKasliwal, Vogeley & Richards, 2015. On short timescales, we find a steeper\nlog-PSD slope ($\\gamma = 2.90$ to within $10$ percent) for the re-processed\nlight curve as compared to the light curve found on MAST ($\\gamma = 2.65$ to\nwithin $10$ percent)---both inconsistent with a damped random walk which\nrequires $\\gamma = 2$. The log-PSD slope inferred for the re-processed light\ncurve is consistent with previous results (Carini & Ryle, 2012, Williams &\nCarini, 2015) that study the same re-processed light curve. The turnover\ntimescale is almost identical for both light curves ($27.1$ and $27.5$~d for\nthe reprocessed and MAST database light curves). Based on the obvious visual\ndifference between the two versions of the light curve and on the PSD model\nfits, we conclude that there remain significant levels of spacecraft-induced\neffects in the standard pipeline reduction of the Kepler data. Re-processing\nthe light curves will change the model inferenced from the data but is unlikely\nto change the overall scientific conclusion reached by Kasliwal et al.\n2015---not all AGN light curves are consistent with the DRW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 15:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

As a result, realistic observers do not follow the smooth Hubble\nflow but have a peculiar, `tilt', velocity relative to it. Our Local Group of\ngalaxies, in particular, moves with respect to the universal expansion at a\nspeed of roughly 600~km/sec. Relative motion effects are known to interfere\nwith the observations and their interpretation. The strong dipolar anisotropy\nseen in the Cosmic Microwave Background, for example, is not treated as a sign\nof real universal anisotropy, but as a mere artifact of our peculiar motion\nrelative to the Hubble flow. With these in mind, we look into the implications\nof large-scale bulk motions for the kinematics of their associated observers,\nby adopting a `tilted' Friedmann model. Our aim is to examine whether the\ndeceleration parameter measured in the rest-frame of the bulk flow can differ\nfrom that of the actual universe due to relative-motion effects alone. We find\nthat there is a difference, which depends on the speed as well as the scale of\nthe bulk motion. The faster and the smaller the drifting domain, the larger the\ndifference. In principle, this allows relatively slow peculiar velocities to\nhave a disproportionately strong effect on the value of the deceleration\nparameter measured by observers within bulk flows of, say, few hundred\nmegaparsecs. In fact, under certain circumstances, it is even possible to\nchange the sign of the deceleration parameter.

In this study, a new approach to\npersonal cooling was developed using an infrared-transparent visible-opaque\nfabric (ITVOF), which provides passive cooling via the transmission of thermal\nradiation emitted by the human body directly to the environment. Here, we\npresent a conceptual framework to thermally and optically design an ITVOF.\nUsing a heat transfer model, the fabric was found to require a minimum infrared\n(IR) transmittance of 0.644 and a maximum IR reflectance of 0.2 to ensure\nthermal comfort at ambient temperatures as high as 26.1oC (79oF). To meet these\nrequirements, an ITVOF design was developed using synthetic polymer fibers with\nan intrinsically low IR absorptance. These fibers were then structured to\nminimize IR reflection via weak Rayleigh scattering while maintaining visible\nopaqueness via strong Mie scattering. For a fabric composed of parallel-aligned\npolyethylene fibers, numerical finite element simulations predict 1 {\\mu}m\ndiameter fibers bundled into 30 {\\mu}m yarns can achieve a total hemispherical\nIR transmittance of 0.972, which is nearly perfectly transparent to mid- and\nfar-IR radiation. The visible wavelength properties of the ITVOF are comparable\nto conventional textiles ensuring opaqueness to the human eye. By providing\npersonal cooling in a form amenable to everyday use, ITVOF-based clothing\noffers a simple, low-cost solution to reduce energy consumption in HVAC\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 15:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-19"}

The required\nnon-equilibrium condition is provided by the capacitive coupling of one quantum\ndot to the shot noise of a strongly biased quantum point contact in the\ntunnelling limit.

While ecosystem networks generally trace a\nthermodynamically conserved unit through the system, there appear to be several\nmodel classes. For example, trophic (TRO) networks are built upon a food web,\nusually follow energy or carbon, and are the most abundant in the literature.\nBiogeochemical cycling (BGC) networks trace nutrients like nitrogen or\nphosphorus and tend to have more recycling than TRO. We tested (1) the\nhypothesized generality of the properties in BGC networks and (2) that they\ntend to be more strongly expressed in BGC networks than in the TRO networks due\nto increased recycling. We compared the properties in 22 BGC and 57 TRO\necosystem networks from the literature using enaR. The results generally\nsupport the hypotheses. First, five of the properties occurred in all 22 BGC\nmodels, while network mutualism occurred in 86% of the models. Further, these\nresults were generally robust to a $\\pm$50% uncertainty in the model\nparameters. Second, the mean network statistics for the six properties were\nstatistically significantly greater in the BGC models than the TRO models.\nThese results (1) confirm the general presence of these properties in ecosystem\nnetworks, (2) highlight the significance of model types in determining property\nintensities, (3) reinforce the importance of recycling, and (4) provide a set\nof indicator benchmarks for future systems comparisons. Further, this work\nhighlights how indirect effects distributed by network connectivity can\ntransform whole-ecosystem functioning, and adds to the growing domain of\nnetwork ecology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 21:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 13:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}
