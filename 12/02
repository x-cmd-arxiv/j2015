Therefore, researchers are interested to know whether a\ndrug has competitive or non-competitive interaction to particular protein\ntargets.\n  Method: to analyze the interaction types we propose factorization method\nMacau which allows us to combine different measurement types into a single\ntensor together with proteins and compounds. The compounds are characterized by\nhigh dimensional 2D ECFP fingerprints. The novelty of the proposed method is\nthat using a specially designed noise injection MCMC sampler it can incorporate\nhigh dimensional side information, i.e., millions of unique 2D ECFP compound\nfeatures, even for large scale datasets of millions of compounds. Without the\nside information, in this case, the tensor factorization would be practically\nfutile.\n  Results: using public IC50 and Ki data from ChEMBL we trained a model from\nwhere we can identify the latent subspace separating the two measurement types\n(IC50 and Ki). The results suggest the proposed method can detect the\ncompetitive inhibitory activity between compounds and proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 16:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Many of these objects are predicted to be new L and T dwarfs based\non near- and mid-infrared colors. Using estimated spectral types along with\ndistance estimates, we have identified several objects likely belonging to the\nnearby Solar neighborhood (d $<$ 25 pc). We have followed up 19 of these new\ndiscoveries with near-infrared or optical spectroscopy, focusing on potentially\nnearby objects, objects with the latest predicted spectral types, and potential\nlate-type subdwarfs.

In order to\ntest the null hypothesis of a constant rate and to estimate the change points,\na Multiple Filter Test (MFT) and a corresponding algorithm (MFA) have been\nproposed that can be applied under the assumption of independent inter spike\nintervals (ISIs).\n  As empirical spike trains often show weak dependencies in the correlation\nstructure of ISIs, we extend the MFT here to point processes associated with\nshort range dependencies. By specifically estimating serial dependencies in the\ntest statistic, we show that the new MFT can be applied to a variety of\nempirical firing patterns, including positive and negative serial correlations\nas well as tonic and bursty firing. The new MFT is applied to a data set of\nempirical spike trains with serial correlations, and simulations show improved\nperformance against methods that assume independence. In case of positive\ncorrelations, our new MFT is necessary to reduce the number of false positives,\nwhich can be highly enhanced when falsely assuming independence. For the\nfrequent case of negative correlations, the new MFT shows an improved detection\nprobability of change points and thus, also a higher potential of signal\nextraction from noisy spike trains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 16:14:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 20:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

The observed stellar groups display a broad spectrum of masses,\nsizes and other properties, so it is often assumed that there is no underlying\nstructure in this diversity. Here we show that the assumption of an\nunstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.\nCurrent data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,\nsize, age, maximum stellar mass etc. In this first paper we take a closer look\nat the correlation of cluster mass and radius. We use literature data to\nexplore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solar\nneighborhood. We show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood\nthere exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius of\nthe form $M_c = C R_c^{\\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. This correlation holds\nfor infra red K band data as well as X-ray sources and for clusters containing\na hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. The\ncorrelation is difficult to verify for clusters containing <30 stars due to\nlow-number statistics. Dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embedded\nclusters. We find a similar slope for the mass-size relation of dense, massive\nclumps as for the embedded star clusters. This might point at a direct\ntranslation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate size\nmeasurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles. Taking into\naccount multiple paths for clump mass into cluster mass, we obtain an average\nstar-formation efficiency of 18%{+9.3}{-5.7} for the embedded clusters in the\nsolar neighborhood. The derived mass-radius relation gives constraints for the\ntheory of clustered star formation.

Much effort has gone into\ncomputing \"self force\" corrections to this motion, arising from the small\nbody's own contributions to the system's spacetime. Another correction to the\nmotion arises from coupling of the small body's spin to the black hole's\nspacetime curvature. Spin-curvature coupling drives a precession of the small\nbody, and introduces a \"force\" (relative to the geodesic) which shifts the\nsmall body's worldline. These effects scale with the small body's spin at\nleading order. In this paper, we show that the equations which govern\nspin-curvature coupling can be analyzed with a frequency-domain decomposition,\nat least to leading order in the small body's spin. We show how to compute the\nfrequency of precession along generic orbits, and how to describe the small\nbody's precession and motion in the frequency domain.

Current methods\nfor analysis of microbial communities are typically based on taxonomic\nphylogenetic alignment using 16S rRNA metagenomic or Whole Genome Sequencing\ndata. In typical characterizations of microbial communities, studies deal with\nbillions of micobial sequences, aligning them to a phylogenetic tree. We\nintroduce a new approach for the efficient analysis of microbial communities.\nOur new reference-free analysis tech- nique is based on n-gram sequence\nanalysis of 16S rRNA data and reduces the processing data size dramatically (by\n105 fold), without requiring taxonomic alignment. The proposed approach is\napplied to characterize phenotypic microbial community differ- ences in\ndifferent settings. Specifically, we applied this approach in classification of\nmicrobial com- munities across different body sites, characterization of oral\nmicrobiomes associated with healthy and diseased individuals, and\nclassification of microbial communities longitudinally during the develop- ment\nof infants. Different dimensionality reduction methods are introduced that\noffer a more scalable analysis framework, while minimizing the loss in\nclassification accuracies. Among dimensionality re- duction techniques, we\npropose a continuous vector representation for microbial communities, which can\nwidely be used for deep learning applications in microbial informatics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 19:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

This effect is detected for central galaxies with a stellar\nmass larger than 10^10 solar masses and found to be strongest for red passive\ngalaxies, while blue galaxies exhibit a weaker trend. For galaxies with a minor\naxis parallel to the direction of the nearest filament, we find that the\ncoplanarity is stronger in the vicinity of the central galaxy, and decreases\nwhen moving towards the outskirts of the host halo.

One aspect of this is trying to understand whether\nthe time evolution of accretion rates in deeply embedded objects is best\ncharacterised by a smooth decline from early to late stages or by intermittent\nbursts of high accretion.\n  Aims: We create synthetic observations of deeply embedded protostars in a\nlarge numerical simulation of a molecular cloud, which are compared directly to\nreal observations. The goal is to compare episodic accretion events in the\nsimulation to observations and to test the methodology used for analysing the\nobservations.\n  Methods: Simple freeze-out and sublimation chemistry is added to the\nsimulation, and synthetic C$^{18}$O line cubes are created for a large number\nof simulated protostars. The spatial extent of C$^{18}$O is measured for the\nsimulated protostars and compared directly to a sample of 16 deeply embedded\nprotostars observed with the Submillimeter Array. If CO is distributed over a\nlarger area than predicted based on the protostellar luminosity, it may\nindicate that the luminosity has been higher in the past and that CO is still\nin the process of refreezing.\n  Results: Approximately 1% of the protostars in the simulation show extended\nC$^{18}$O emission, as opposed to approximately 50% in the observations,\nindicating that the magnitude and frequency of episodic accretion events in the\nsimulation is too low relative to observations. The protostellar accretion\nrates in the simulation are primarily modulated by infall from the larger\nscales of the molecular cloud, and do not include any disk physics. The\ndiscrepancy between simulation and observations is taken as support for the\nnecessity of disks, even in deeply embedded objects, to produce episodic\naccretion events of sufficient frequency and amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 20:14:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 17:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Chamaeleon II molecular cloud is an active star forming region that\noffers an excellent opportunity for studying the formation of brown dwarfs in\nthe southern hemisphere. Aims. Our aims are to identify a population of pre-\nand proto- brown dwarfs (5 sigma mass limit threshold of ~0.015 Msun) and\nprovide information on the formation mechanisms of substellar objects. Methods.\nWe performed high sensitivity observations at 870 microns using the LABOCA\nbolometer at the APEX telescope towards an active star forming region in\nChamaeleon II. The data are complemented with an extensive multiwavelength\ncatalogue of sources from the optical to the far-infrared to study the nature\nof the LABOCA detections. Results. We detect fifteen cores at 870 microns, and\neleven of them show masses in the substellar regime. The most intense objects\nin the surveyed field correspond to the submillimeter counterparts of the well\nknown young stellar objects DK Cha and IRAS 12500-7658. We identify a possible\nproto-brown dwarf candidate (ChaII-APEX-L) with IRAC emission at 3.6 and 4.5\nmicrons. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that most of the spatially\nresolved cores are transient, and that the point-like starless cores in the\nsub-stellar regime (with masses between 0.016 Msun and 0.066 Msun) could be\npre-brown dwarfs cores gravitationally unstable if they have radii smaller than\n220 AU to 907 AU (1.2\" to 5\" at 178 pc) respectively for different masses.

They will also allow\napplying the same measurement technique to other (e.g., new physics) samples of\ncharm quarks in which the polarization is a priori unknown. The proposed\nanalysis is similar to the ATLAS and CMS measurements of the $W$+$c$ cross\nsection in the 7 TeV run that used reconstructed $D$-meson decays for charm\ntagging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 20:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 17:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

In particular, a moderate value of the heaviest neutrino to\nscalar triplet mass ratio $r\\lesssim {\\cal O}(1)$ is still experimentally\nallowed and can be explored in the future LFV experiments. Similarly, the\ncontribution of a relatively light triplet to the LNV process of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay could be significant, disfavouring a part of the model\nparameter space otherwise allowed by LFV constraints. Nevertheless, we find\nregions of parameter space consistent with both LFV and LNV searches, for which\nthe values of the total effective neutrino mass can be accessible to the next\ngeneration ton-scale experiments. Such light triplets can also be directly\nsearched for at the LHC, thus providing a complementary probe of this scenario.\nFinally, we also study the implications of the triplet contribution for the\nleft-right symmetric model interpretation of the recent diboson anomaly at the\nLHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 20:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 13:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

In order to study the origin of the different line widths, we stack the\nindividual spectra in 5 bins of increasing peak intensity and fit two Gaussian\ncomponents to the stacked spectra. We find a unique narrow component of FWHM =\n7.5+-0.4 km/s visible in both the single dish and the interferometric data. In\naddition, a broad component with FWHM = 14.4+-1.5 km/s is present in the\nsingle-dish data, but cannot be identified in the interferometric data. We\ninterpret this additional broad line width component detected by the single\ndish as a low brightness molecular gas component that is extended on spatial\nscales >0.5 kpc, and thus filtered out by the interferometer. We search for\nevidence of line broadening by stellar feedback across a range of star\nformation rates but find no such evidence on ~100 pc spatial scale when\ncharacterizing the line profile by a single Gaussian component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 21:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

In particular, we characterize\nthe classical and parameterized complexity of the problem when the\nVapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dimension) of the input is small.\nVC-dimension is a natural measure of complexity of set systems. Several\ntractable instances of Hitting Set with a geometric or graph-theoretical flavor\nare known to have low VC-dimension. In set systems of bounded VC-dimension,\nHitting Set is known to admit efficient and almost optimal approximation\nalgorithms (Br\\\"onnimann and Goodrich, 1995; Even, Rawitz, and Shahar, 2005;\nAgarwal and Pan, 2014).\n  In contrast to these approximation-results, a low VC-dimension does not\nnecessarily imply tractability in the parameterized sense. In fact, we show\nthat Hitting Set is W[1]-hard already on inputs with VC-dimension 2, even if\nthe VC-dimension of the dual set system is also 2. Thus, Hitting Set is very\nunlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable even in this arguably simple case.\nThis answers an open question raised by King in 2010. For set systems whose\n(primal or dual) VC-dimension is 1, we show that Hitting Set is solvable in\npolynomial time.\n  To bridge the gap in complexity between the classes of inputs with\nVC-dimension 1 and 2, we use a measure that is more fine-grained than\nVC-dimension. In terms of this measure, we identify a sharp threshold where the\ncomplexity of Hitting Set transitions from polynomial-time-solvable to NP-hard.\nThe tractable class that lies just under the threshold is a generalization of\nEdge Cover, and thus extends the domain of polynomial-time tractability of\nHitting Set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 21:07:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 11:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

The lightcurve shows a strong periodic signal at 1.88 days,\nwhich we attribute to spot coverage and rotation. We confirm the planet host is\na member of the Hyades by measuring the radial velocity of the system with the\nhigh-resolution near-infrared spectrograph IGRINS.

We use the derived\nstellar density as a prior on fitting the K2 transit photometry, which provides\nweak constraints on eccentricity.

For most\nmass ranges, the fraction of matter in the form of primordial black holes is\nlimited by many different observations on various scales. Primordial black\nholes are assumed to be formed when overdensities that cross the horizon have\nSchwarzschild radii larger than the horizon. Traditionally it was therefore\nassumed that primordial black-hole masses were equal to the horizon mass at\ntheir time of formation. However, detailed calculations of their collapse show\nthat primordial black holes formed at each point in time should rather form a\nspectrum of different masses, obeying critical scaling. Though this has been\nknown for more than fifteen years, the effect of this scaling behaviour is\nlargely ignored when considering predictions for primordial black hole mass\nspectra. In this paper we consider the critical collapse scaling for a variety\nof models which produce primordial black holes, and find that it generally\nleads to a shift, broadening and an overall decrease of the mass contained in\nprimordial black holes. This effect is model and parameter dependent and cannot\nbe contained by a constant rescaling of the spectrum; it can become important\nand should be taken into account when comparing to observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 21:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 00:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 12:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 16:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

Thus, in this work, the effect\nof hydrogen on the interactions between a screw dislocation and <111> tilt GBs\nin {\\alpha}-Fe were examined. Our simulations reveal that the outcome of the\nDGB interaction strongly depends on the underlying GB dislocation network.\nFurther, there exists a strong correlation between the GB energy and the energy\nbarrier for slip transmission. In other words, GBs with lower interfacial\nenergy demonstrate a higher barrier for slip transmission. The introduction of\nhydrogen along the GB causes the energy barrier for slip transmission to\nincrease consistently for all of the GBs examined. The energy balance for a\ncrack initiation in the presence of hydrogen was examined with the help of our\nobservations and previous findings. It was found that the presence of hydrogen\nincreases the strain energy stored within the GB which could lead to a\ntransgranular-to-intergranular fracture mode transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 21:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The\ncentral idea is to label the target nucleus with a spin polarization that\ndepends on its spatial location, which is subsequently revealed by making this\npolarization flow back to the NV for readout. Using extensive analytical and\nnumerical modeling, we show that the technique can attain high spatial\nresolution depending on the NV lifetime and target spin location.

Here, we investigate whether potentially\nEarth-like exoplanets could be identified using UV-visible-to-NIR wavelength\nbroadband photometry (350-1000 nm). Specifically, we calculate optimal\nphotometric bins for identifying an exo-Earth and distinguishing it from\nuninhabitable planets including both Solar System objects and model exoplanets.\nThe color of some hypothetical exoplanets - particularly icy terrestrial worlds\nwith thick atmospheres - is similar to Earth's because of Rayleigh scattering\nin the blue region of the spectrum. Nevertheless, subtle features in Earth's\nreflectance spectrum appear to be unique. In particular, Earth's reflectance\nspectrum has a 'U-shape' unlike all our hypothetical, uninhabitable planets.\nThis shape is partly biogenic because O2-rich, oxidizing air is transparent to\nsunlight, allowing prominent Rayleigh scattering, while ozone absorbs visible\nlight, creating the bottom of the 'U'. Whether such uniqueness has practical\nutility depends on observational noise. If observations are photon limited or\ndominated by astrophysical sources (zodiacal light or imperfect starlight\nsuppression), then the use of broadband visible wavelength photometry to\nidentify Earth twins has little practical advantage over obtaining detailed\nspectra. However, if observations are dominated by dark current then optimized\nphotometry could greatly assist preliminary characterization.

A number of mechanisms have been proposed for transferring volleys of\nspikes between layers of a feedforward neural circuit. Many of these mechanisms\nuse synchronous activity to provide windows in time when spikes may be\ntransferred more easily from layer to layer. Recently, we have demonstrated\nthat a pulse-gating mechanism can transfer graded information between layers in\na feedforward neuronal network. Our transfer mechanism resulted in a\ntime-translationally invariant firing rate and synaptic current waveforms of\narbitrary amplitude, thus providing exact, graded information transfer between\nlayers. In this paper, we apply a Fokker-Planck approach to understand how this\ntranslational invariance manifests itself in a high-dimensional, non-linear\nfeedforward integrate-and-fire network. We show that there is good\ncorrespondence in spiking probabilities between the Fokker-Planck solutions and\nour previous mean-field solutions. We identify an approximate line attractor in\nstate space as the essential structure underlying the time-translational\ninvariance of our solutions.

The steady-state reduced density matrix\nsynchronizes with the periodic drive, and a Fourier analysis allows the\nextraction of the occupation probabilities of the Floquet quasi-energy levels.\nThe lack of detailed balance at steady-state is quantified in terms of an\nentropy production rate, and it is shown that this equals the heat current\nflowing out of the system, and into the reservoir. It is also shown that the\nentropy production rate mainly depends on the off-diagonal components of the\nFloquet density matrix.

Although the crowd generates insightful information especially\nfor complex problems such as entity resolution (ER), the output quality of\ncrowd workers is often noisy. That is, workers may unintentionally generate\nfalse or contradicting data even for simple tasks. The challenge that we\naddress in this paper is how to minimize the cost for task requesters while\nmaximizing ER result quality under the assumption of unreliable input from the\ncrowd. For that purpose, we first establish how to deduce a consistent ER\nsolution from noisy worker answers as part of the data interpretation problem.\nWe then focus on the next-crowdsource problem which is to find the next task\nthat maximizes the information gain of the ER result for the minimal additional\ncost. We compare our robust data interpretation strategies to alternative\nstate-of-the-art approaches that do not incorporate the notion of\nfault-tolerance, i.e., the robustness to noise. In our experimental evaluation\nwe show that our approaches yield a quality improvement of at least 20% for two\nreal-world datasets. Furthermore, we examine task-to-worker assignment\nstrategies as well as task parallelization techniques in terms of their cost\nand quality trade-offs in this paper.

The\nlow-energy contribution is concentrated in a narrow range near the bottom of\nthe conduction band. It has the typical form of a Fermi distribution with an\neffective temperature and chemical potential. The effective temperature and\nchemical potential in this low-energy term are determined by the intensity of\ncarriers' generation, the speed of electron-phonon relaxation, rates of\ninter-band recombination and electron capture on the defects. In addition,\nthere is a substantial high-energy correction. This high-energy 'tail' covers\nlargely the conduction band. The shape of the high-energy 'tail' strongly\ndepends on the rate of electron-phonon relaxation but does not depend on the\nrates of recombination and trapping. We apply the theory to the calculation of\na non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in irradiated GaN. Probabilities of\noptical excitations from the valence to conduction band and electron-phonon\ncoupling probabilities in GaN were calculated by the density functional\nperturbation theory.

The lack of such an operational description has\nhindered advances in understanding physical, chemical and biological processes,\nwhere often unjustified theoretical assumptions are made to render a dynamical\ndescription tractable. This has led to theories plagued with unphysical results\nand no consensus on what a quantum Markov (memoryless) process is. Here, we\ndevelop a universal framework to characterise arbitrary non-Markovian quantum\nprocesses. We show how a multi-time non-Markovian process can be reconstructed\nexperimentally, and that it has a natural representation as a many body quantum\nstate, where temporal correlations are mapped to spatial ones. Moreover, this\nstate is expected to have an efficient matrix product operator form in many\ncases. Our framework constitutes a systematic tool for the effective\ndescription of memory-bearing open-system evolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 06:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 06:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2018 06:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

In this\nscenario constraints from xenon and germanium targets are evaded dynamically,\ndue to the suppression of the WIMP coupling to neutrons, while those from\nfluorine targets are evaded kinematically, because the minimal WIMP incoming\nspeed required to trigger upscatters off fluorine exceeds the maximal WIMP\nvelocity in the Galaxy, or is very close to it. In this scenario WIMP\nscatterings off sodium are usually sensitive to the large-speed tail of the\nWIMP velocity distribution and modulated fractions of the signal close to unity\narise in a natural way. On the other hand, a halo-independent analysis with\nmore conservative assumptions about the WIMP velocity distribution allows to\nextend the viable parameter space to configurations where large modulated\nfractions are not strictly necessary. We discuss large modulated fractions in\nthe Maxwellian case showing that they imply a departure from the usual cosine\ntime dependence of the expected signal in DAMA. However we explicitly show that\nthe DAMA data is not sensitive to this distortion, both in time and frequency\nspace, even in the extreme case of a 100 % modulated fraction. Moreover the\nsame scenario provides an explanation of the maximum in the energy spectrum of\nthe modulation amplitude detected by DAMA in terms of WIMPs whose minimal\nincoming speed matches the kinematic threshold for inelastic upscatters. For\nthe elastic case the detection of such maximum suggests an inversion of the\nmodulation phase below the present DAMA energy threshold, while this is not\nexpected for inelastic scattering. This may allow to discriminate between the\ntwo scenarios in a future low-threshold analysis of the DAMA data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 07:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 18:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

Preventing such large-scale outages is thus key for\nassuring a reliable power supply.

These strategies are independent of the detailed grid dynamics and\ncombined may serve as an effective guideline to reduce outages in power grid\nnetworks by intentionally strengthen optimally selected links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 08:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-10"}

However, due to the rapid mixing\nimplied by the mean field assumption, first order transitions required non-zero\ninitial densities of sick individuals. For the stochastic model studied here\nthe results depend strongly on the underlying network. First order transitions\nare found when there are few short but many long loops: (i) No first order\ntransitions exist on trees and on 2-d lattices with local contacts (ii) They do\nexist on Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, on d-dimensional lattices with d >= 4, and\non 2-d lattices with sufficiently long-ranged contacts; (iii) On 3-d lattices\nwith local contacts the results depend on the microscopic details of the\nimplementation; (iv) While single infected seeds can always lead to infinite\nepidemics on regular lattices, on ER networks one sometimes needs finite\ninitial densities of infected nodes; (v) In all cases the first order\ntransitions are actually \"hybrid\", i.e. they display also power law scaling\nusually associated with second order transitions. On regular lattices, our\nmodel can also be interpreted as the growth of an interface due to cooperative\nattachment of two species of particles. Critically pinned interfaces in this\nmodel seem to be in different universality classes than standard critically\npinned interfaces in models with forbidden overhangs.

Coalescence with these disrupted threads then occurs leading to the\ndisruption of yet more threads as the avalanche develops.

Several novel phenomena have been shown\nto emerge from the interaction of conducting electrons with the skyrmion\nlattice, such as a topological Hall-effect and a spin-transfer torque at\nultra-low current densities. In the insulating compound Cu2OSeO3,\nmagneto-electric coupling enables control of the skyrmion lattice via electric\nfields, promising a dissipation-less route towards novel spintronic devices.\nOne of the outstanding fundamental issues is related to the thermodynamic\nstability of the skyrmion lattice. To date, the skyrmion lattice in bulk\nmaterials has been found only in a narrow temperature region just below the\norder-disorder transition. If this narrow stability is unavoidable, it would\nseverely limit applications. Here we present the discovery that applying just\nmoderate pressure on Cu2OSeO3 substantially increases the absolute size of the\nskyrmion pocket. This insight demonstrates directly that tuning the electronic\nstructure can lead to a significant enhancement of the skyrmion lattice\nstability. We interpret the discovery by extending the previously employed\nGinzburg-Landau approach and conclude that change in the anisotropy is the main\ndriver for control of the size of the skyrmion pocket. This realization\nprovides an important guide for tuning the properties of future skyrmion\nhosting materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 10:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Their properties in the linear-response regime\nhave been successfully described by the theory of Fermi liquids.

The\nprimary aim is to obtain information on the energy stored in the Coulomb\ninteraction between the conduction electrons, on the temperature dependence\nthereof, and on the change of Coulomb interaction when Cooper-pairs are formed.\nWe performed temperature-dependent ellipsometry measurements on several\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8-x}$ single crystals: under-doped with $T_c=60, 70$\nand 83K, optimally doped with $T_c=91$K, overdoped with $T_c=84, 81, 70$ and\n$58$K, as well as optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+x}$ with\n$T_c=110$K.

This effect at - or close to - $T_c$ depends strongly on doping, with a\nsign-change for weak overdoping.

Typical rates are of the order ~1-5 x 10^-5\n1/yr and ~10^-4-10^-5 1/yr in large spiral galaxies and old ellipticals,\nrespectively. The brightest electromagnetic signals are predicted for evolved\ngiant type donors for which I find rates of the order ~2.5 x 10^-5 1/yr (large\nspirals) and ~1.3 x 10^-5 1/yr (old ellipticals).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 12:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-03"}

After a careful\nstudy, we built a dataset of Turkish tweets and manually tagged them.

Entropy measures the rate of information gain, or degree of\nregularity in a time series e.g. heartbeat. Ideally, entropy should be able to\nquantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as\ndetermine if the variation arises from a random process. Unfortunately current\nentropy measures mostly are unable to perform the latter differentiation. Thus,\na high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, whereas a low score\nindicates a high degree of regularity. This leads to the observation that\ncurrent entropy measures are equivalent to evaluating how random a series is,\nor conversely the degree of regularity in a time series. This raises the\npossibility that existing tests for randomness, such as the runs test or\npermutation test, may have similar utility in diagnosing certain conditions.\nThis paper compares various tests for randomness with existing entropy-based\nmeasurements such as sample entropy, permutation entropy and multi-scale\nentropy. Our experimental results indicate that the test statistics of the runs\ntest and permutation test are often highly correlated with entropy scores and\nmay be able to provide further information regarding the complexity of time\nseries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 15:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-03"}

Additionally a number of these are also relevant for the beam physics of\nproton accelerators. This paper is the third in a series of four describing the\nthe conversion of CESR to the test accelerator, CesrTA. The first two papers\ndiscuss the overall plan for the conversion of the storage ring to an\ninstrument capable of studying advanced accelerator physics issues and the\ndetails of the vacuum system upgrades. This paper focusses on the necessary\ndevelopment of new instrumentation, situated in four dedicated experimental\nregions, capable of studying such phenomena as electron clouds (ECs) and\nmethods to mitigate EC effects. The fourth paper in this series describes the\nvacuum system modifications of the superconducting wigglers to accommodate the\ndiagnostic instrumentation for the study of EC behavior within wigglers.

In\nparticular the game nicely illustrates that cyclic interactions allow multiple\nstrategies to coexist for long time intervals. When formulated in terms of a\none-dimensional cellular automata, the spatial distribution of strategies\nexhibits coarsening with algebraically growing domain size over time, while the\ntwo-dimensional version allows domains to break and thereby opens for long-time\ncoexistence. We here consider a quasi-one-dimensional implementation of the\ncyclic competition, and study the long-term dynamics as a function of rare\ninvasions between parallel linear ecosystems. We find that increasing the\ncomplexity from two to three parallel subsystems allows a transition from\ncomplete coarsening to an active steady state where the domain size stays\nfinite. We further find that this transition happens irrespective of whether\nthe update is done in parallel for all sites simultaneously, or done randomly\nin sequential order. In both cases the active state is characterized by\nlocalized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In\nthe case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase\ntransition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the\nthree-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied. We\nidentify the critical parameter for this transition, and show that the density\nof active boundaries have critical exponents that are consistent with the\ndirected percolation universality class. On the other hand, numerical\nsimulations with the random sequential dynamics suggest that the system may\nexhibit an active steady state as long as the invasion rate is finite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 16:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 11:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The infected cell life\ncycle consists of a non-productively infected stage in which it is producing\nvirions but not releasing them and of a productively infected stage in which it\nis just releasing virions. The study explores why the infected cell cycle\nshould be so delineated, something which is akin to a classic bang-bang control\nor all-or-none principle. The times spent in each of these stages represent a\nviral strategy to optimize peak viral load. Increasing the time spent in the\nnon-productively infected phase ({\\tau}1) would lead to a concomitant increase\nin peak viremia. However increasing this time would also invite a more vigorous\nresponse from Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CTLs). Simultaneously, if there is a\nvigorous antibody response, then we might expect {\\tau}1 to be high, in order\nthat the virus builds up its population and conversely if there is a weak\nantibody response, {\\tau}1 might be small. These tradeoffs are explored using a\nmathematical model of virus propagation using Ordinary Differential Equations\n(ODEs). The study raises questions about whether common viruses have actually\nsettled into an optimum, the role for reliability and whether experimental\ninfections of hosts with non-endemic strains could help elicit answers about\nviral progression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 10:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2016 23:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

We then introduce and\ndiscuss Shafer belief functions. Technically, Shafer belief functions\ngeneralize probability distributions. Philosophically, they pertain to\nindividual or shared knowledge of facts, rather than to facts themselves, and\ntherefore can be interpreted as generalizing epistemic probability, that is,\nprobability theory interpreted epistemologically. Belief functions are more\nflexible and better suited to deal with certain types of uncertainty than\nclassical probability distributions. We develop a new calculus for belief\nfunctions which does not use the much criticized Dempster's rule of\ncombination, by generalizing the classical notions of conditioning and\nindependence in a natural and uncontroversial way. Using this calculus, we\nexplain our rejection of Dempster's rule in detail. We apply the new theory to\na number of examples, including a gambling example and an example in a forensic\nsetting. We prove a law of large numbers for belief functions and offer a\nbetting interpretation similar to the Dutch Book Theorem for probability\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 13:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

We use a calculus of belief functions which does not use the much\ncriticized Dempster rule of combination, but only the very natural\nDempster-Shafer conditioning. We then apply this calculus to some classical\nforensic problems like the various island problems and the problem of parental\nidentification. If we impose no prior knowledge apart from assuming that the\nculprit or parent belongs to a given population (something which is possible in\nour setting), then our answers differ from the classical ones when uniform or\nother priors are imposed. We can actually retrieve the classical answers by\nimposing the relevant priors, so our setup can and should be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of the classical methodology, allowing more flexibility. We show\nhow our calculus can be used to develop an analogue of Bayes' rule, with belief\nfunctions instead of classical probabilities.

The corresponding linear setting for\ntime-harmonic oscillations reduces to a spectral problem whose parameter is the\nfrequency. A constant that characterises the brash ice divides the set of\nfrequencies into two subsets and the results obtained for each of these subsets\nare essentially different.\n  For frequencies belonging to a finite interval adjacent to zero, the total\nenergy of motion is finite and the equipartition of energy holds for the whole\nsystem.
