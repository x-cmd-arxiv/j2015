Quadratic perturbations\nform three-mode networks inside the star, which evolve as coupled oscillators,\nexchanging energy.

Finding the correct floor, in a fast and efficient manner, in a\nshopping mall or an unknown university building can save the users' search time\nand can enable a myriad of Location Based Services in the future. One of the\nmost widely spread techniques for floor estimation in multi-floor buildings is\nthe fingerprinting-based localization using Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nmeasurements coming from indoor networks, such as WLAN and BLE. The clear\nadvantage of RSS-based floor estimation is its ease of implementation on a\nmultitude of mobile devices at the Application Programming Interface (API)\nlevel, because RSS values are directly accessible through API interface.\nHowever, the downside of a fingerprinting approach, especially for large-scale\nfloor estimation and positioning solutions, is their need to store and transmit\na huge amount of fingerprinting data. The problem becomes more severe when the\nlocalization is intended to be done on mobile devices which have limited\nmemory, power, and computational resources. An alternative floor estimation\nmethod, which has lower complexity and is faster than the fingerprinting is the\nWeighted Centroid Localization (WCL) method.

In this paper a novel K-means-based\nmethod for floor estimation via fingerprint clustering of WiFi and various\nother positioning sensor outputs is introduced. Our method achieves a floor\nestimation accuracy close to the one with NN fingerprinting, while\nsignificantly improves the complexity and the speed of the floor detection\nalgorithm.

In this work we study some of these fundamental\noptimization problems, as well as their parameterized and reoptimization\nvariants.\n  We first present improved bounds for job scheduling on unrelated parallel\nmachines, with the objective of minimizing the latest completion time\n(makespan) of the schedule. We consider the subclass of fully-feasible\ninstances, in which the processing time of each job, on any machine, does not\nexceed the minimum makespan. The problem is known to be hard to approximate\nwithin factor 4/3 already in this subclass. Although fully-feasible instances\nare hard to identify, we give a polynomial time algorithm that yields for such\ninstances a schedule whose makespan is better than twice the optimal, the best\nknown ratio for general instances. Moreover, we show that our result is robust\nunder small violations of feasibility constraints.\n  We further study the power of parameterization. We show that makespan\nminimization on unrelated machines admits a parameterized approximation scheme,\nwhere the parameter used is the number of processing times that are large\nrelative to the latest completion time of the schedule. We also present an FPT\nalgorithm for the graph-balancing problem, which corresponds to the instances\nof the restricted assignment problem where each job can be processed on at most\n2 machines.\n  Finally, motivated by practical scenarios, we initiate the study of\nreoptimization in job scheduling on identical and uniform machines, with the\nobjective of minimizing the makespan.

In this paper, we develop a model\nfor allocating malaria interventions across geographic regions and time,\nsubject to budget constraints, with the aim of minimizing the number of\nperson-days of malaria infection. The model considers a range of several\nconditions: climatic characteristics, treatment efficacy, distribution costs,\nand treatment coverage. We couple an expanded susceptible-infected-recovered\n(SIR) compartment model for the disease dynamics with an integer linear\nprogramming (ILP) model for selecting the disease interventions. Our model\nproduces an intervention plan for all regions, identifying which combination of\ninterventions, with which level of coverage, to use in each region and year in\na five-year planning horizon. Simulations using the model yield high-level,\nqualitative insights on optimal intervention policies: The optimal policy is\ndifferent when considering a five-year time horizon than when considering only\na single year, due to the effects that interventions have on the disease\ntransmission dynamics. The vaccine intervention is rarely selected, except if\nits assumed cost is significantly lower than that predicted in the literature.\nIncreasing the available budget causes the number of person-days of malaria\ninfection to decrease linearly up to a point, after which the benefit of\nincreased budget starts to taper. The optimal policy is highly dependent on\nassumptions about mosquito density, selecting different interventions for wet\nclimates with high density than for dry climates with low density, and the\ninterventions are found to be less effective at controlling malaria in the wet\nclimates when attainable intervention coverage is 60% or lower.

This is because it\nwill feature large antenna arrays as well as extremely dense base station (BS)\ndeployments. The viability of mmWave for energy harvesting though is unclear,\ndue to the differences in propagation characteristics such as extreme\nsensitivity to building blockages. This paper considers a scenario where\nlow-power devices extract energy and/or information from the mmWave signals.\nUsing stochastic geometry, analytical expressions are derived for the energy\ncoverage probability, the average harvested power, and the overall\n(energy-and-information) coverage probability at a typical wireless-powered\ndevice in terms of the BS density, the antenna geometry parameters, and the\nchannel parameters. Numerical results reveal several network and device level\ndesign insights. At the BSs, optimizing the antenna geometry parameters such as\nbeamwidth can maximize the network-wide energy coverage for a given user\npopulation. At the device level, the performance can be substantially improved\nby optimally splitting the received signal for energy and information\nextraction, and by deploying multi-antenna arrays. For the latter, an efficient\nlow-power multi-antenna mmWave receiver architecture is proposed for\nsimultaneous energy and information transfer.

Tightly intertwining discrete, continuous and stochastic\ndynamics complicates modelling, analysis and verification of stochastic hybrid\nsystems (SHSs). In the literature, this issue has been extensively\ninvestigated, but unfortunately it still remains challenging as no promising\ngeneral solutions are available yet. In this paper, we give our effort by\nproposing a general compositional approach for modelling and verification of\nSHSs. First, we extend Hybrid CSP (HCSP), a very expressive and process\nalgebra-like formal modeling language for hybrid systems, by introducing\nprobability and stochasticity to model SHSs, which is called stochastic HCSP\n(SHCSP).

A corollary of this finding\nis that both mantle het- erogeneity and spreading rate have implications for\nthe speed and time scale of melt migration. Here, we investigate these\nimplications using numerical models of magma flow in heterogeneous mantle\nbeneath spreading plates. The models predict that a broad distribution of magma\nflow speeds is characteristic of the sub-ridge mantle. Within the melting\nregion, magmatic flow is fastest in regions of average fusibility;\nsurprisingly, magmas from sources of above-average fusibility travel to the\nridge in a longer time. Spreading rate has comparatively simple consequences,\nmainly resulting in faster segregation speeds at higher spreading rates. The\ncomputed time scales are short enough to preserve deep origin 230Th\ndisequilibria and, under favourable parameter regimes, also 226Ra excesses. An\nimportant prediction from the models is that mantle heterogeneity induces\nsignificant natural variability into U-series disequilibria, complicating the\nidentification of relationships between disequilibria and ridge properties or\nchemical signatures of heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2015 13:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

We analyze the conceptual link\nbetween these two cases. In economic interactions fat tails arise because the\nrichest individuals enact some protection mechanisms (\"saving propensity\")\nwhich allow them to put at stake, in their interactions, only a small part of\ntheir wealth. In high-energy particle collisions something similar happens, in\nthe sense that when particles with very large energy collide with slow\nparticles, then as a sole consequence of relativistic kinematics (mass\ndilation), they tend to exchange only a small part of their energy; processes\nlike the frontal collision of two identical particles, where the exchanged\nenergy is 100%, are very improbable, at least in a diluted gas. We thus show\nhow in two completely different systems, one of socio-economic nature and one\nof physical nature, a certain feature of the binary microscopic interactions\nleads to the same consequence in the macroscopic distribution for the income or\nrespectively for the energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2015 09:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

We describe the\nimplementation details and the setup used in the experimental study of the\namplifier. Near the threshold to the first parametric instability, and in\ndegenerate-mode amplification, the PA achieved very high gains in a very narrow\nbandwidth centered on its resonance frequency. In quasi-degenerate mode\namplification, we obtained lower values of gain, but with a wider bandwidth\nthat is tunable. The experimental data were accurately described by the\npredictions of the model.
