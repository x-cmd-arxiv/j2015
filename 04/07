Apart from a\nfew special situations, these vortices are singly quantized with unit\ncirculation. Recently, the NIST group has constructed a two-component BEC with\na spin-orbit coupled Hamiltonian involving Pauli matrices, and I here study the\ndynamics of a two-component vortex in such a spin-orbit coupled condensate.\nThese spin-orbit coupled BECs use an applied magnetic field to split the\nhyperfine levels. Hence they rely on a focused laser beam to trap the atoms. In\naddition, two Raman laser beams create an effective (or synthetic) gauge\npotential. The resulting spin-orbit Hamiltonian is discussed in some detail.\nThe various laser beams are fixed in the laboratory, so that it is not feasible\nto nucleate a vortex by an applied rotation that would need to rotate all the\nlaser beams and the magnetic field. In a one-component BEC, a vortex can also\nbe created by a thermal quench, starting from the normal state and suddenly\ncooling deep into the condensed state. I propose that a similar method would\nwork for a vortex in a spin-orbit coupled BEC. Such a vortex has two\ncomponents, and each has its own circulation quantum number. If both components\nhave the same circulation, I find that the composite vortex should execute\nuniform precession, like that observed in a single-component BEC. In contrast,\nif one component has unit circulation and the other has zero circulation, then\nsome fraction of the dynamical vortex trajectories should eventually leave the\ncondensate, providing clear experimental evidence for this unusual vortex\nstructure. In the context of exciton-polariton condensates, such a vortex is\nknown as a \"half-quantum vortex\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 16:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Policy\nmakers are faced with the intricate task of drafting realistically\nimplementable policies that strike a balance between risk management and cost.\nTwo major techniques policy makers have at their disposal are: epidemic\nmodeling and contact tracing. Models are used to forecast the evolution of the\nepidemic both globally and regionally, while contact tracing is used to\nreconstruct the chain of people who have been potentially infected, so that\nthey can be tested, isolated and treated immediately. However, both techniques\nmight provide limited information, especially during an already advanced crisis\nwhen the need for action is urgent.\n  In this paper we propose an alternative approach that goes beyond epidemic\nmodeling and contact tracing, and leverages behavioral data generated by mobile\ncarrier networks to evaluate contagion risk on a per-user basis. The individual\nrisk represents the loss incurred by not isolating or treating a specific\nperson, both in terms of how likely it is for this person to spread the disease\nas well as how many secondary infections it will cause. To this aim, we develop\na model, named Progmosis, which quantifies this risk based on movement and\nregional aggregated statistics about infection rates. We develop and release an\nopen-source tool that calculates this risk based on cellular network events. We\nsimulate a realistic epidemic scenarios, based on an Ebola virus outbreak; we\nfind that gradually restricting the mobility of a subset of individuals reduces\nthe number of infected people after 30 days by 24%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 16:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ is a promising new\nabsorber material that has attracted significant interest in recent years.\nHowever, similar to CZTS, Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ displays cation disorder. In this work,\nwe develop synthetic techniques to control the disorder in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ thin\nfilms.

Some argue for an early Moon-forming\nevent, approximately 30 million years (Myr) after the condensation of the first\nsolids in the Solar System, whereas others claim a date later than 50 Myr (and\npossibly as late as around 100 My) after condensation.

As the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accreted\nmass decreases in a predictable fashion. This relationship exists within both\nthe classical scenario and the Grand Tack scenario of terrestrial planet\nformation, and it holds across a wide range of disk conditions. The\nconcentration of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle\nconstrains the mass of chondritic material added to Earth during Late\nAccretion. Using HSE abundance measurements, we determine a Moon-formation age\nof 95 +/- 32 Myr since condensation. The possibility exists that some late\nprojectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete HSE record in Earth's\nmantle. Even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest that\nthe late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of Earth's mass, and so the\nHSE clock still robustly limits the timing of the Moon-forming event to\nsignificantly later than 40 My after condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 21:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

An approach is presented to use\ntime-series spectroscopy to separate non-equilibrium quantities from slowly\nvarying equilibria. A stochastic process associated with the non-equilibrium\npart of the spectrum is characterized in terms of its central moments or\ncumulants, which may vary over time. This parameterization encodes information\nabout the non-equilibrium behavior of the system.\n  Stochastic time-series spectroscopy (STSS) can be implemented at very little\nexpense in many settings since a series of scans are typically recorded in\norder to generate a low-noise averaged spectrum. Higher moments or cumulants\nmay be readily calculated from this series, enabling the observation of\nquantities that would be difficult or impossible to determine from an average\nspectrum or from prinicipal components analysis (PCA).\n  This method is more scalable than PCA, having linear time complexity, yet it\ncan produce comparable or superior results, as shown in example applications.\nOne example compares an STSS-derived CO$_2$ bending mode to a standard\nreference spectrum and the result of PCA. A second example shows that STSS can\nreveal conditions of stress in rocks, a scenario where traditional methods such\nas PCA are inadequate. This allows spectral lines and non-equilibrium behavior\nto be precisely resolved. A relationship between 2nd order STSS and a\ntime-varying form of PCA is considered. Although the possible applications of\nSTSS have not been fully explored, it promises to reveal information that\npreviously could not be easily measured, possibly enabling new domains of\nspectroscopy and remote sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 23:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

We suggest that the companion of HD 49798 is most\nlikely a CO WD, which can be expected to increase its mass to the Chandrasekhar\nmass limit by accreting He-rich material from HD 49798. Thus, HD 49798 with its\ncompanion may produce an SN Ia in its future evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 02:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

This implementation improves the computational\nefficiency over the existing plane-wave transport code, scales better for\nparallelization over large number of nodes, and does not require the current\ndirection to be along a lattice axis. As a first application, we calculate the\ntunneling current through a side-contact graphene junction formed by two\nseparate graphene sheets with the edges overlapping each other.

His method extends Marc\nRieffel's construction of generalized fixed-point algebras from proper group\nactions on $ C^{\\ast} $-algebras. This dissertation seeks to generalize Meyer's\nwork to construct generalized fixed-point algebras for twisted $ C^{\\ast}\n$-dynamical systems. To accomplish this, we must introduce some new concepts,\nthe foremost being that of a twisted Hilbert $ C^{\\ast} $-module, which is a\nHilbert $ C^{\\ast} $-module equipped with a twisted group action by bijective\nlinear isometries that is compatible with the module's right $ C^{\\ast}\n$-algebra action and its $ C^{\\ast} $-algebra-valued inner product. Twisted\nHilbert $ C^{\\ast} $-modules over a fixed twisted $ C^{\\ast} $-dynamical system\nform a category, where morphisms are twisted-equivariant adjointable operators.\nGiven a twisted $ C^{\\ast} $-dynamical system, we provide a definition of a\nrelatively continuous subspace of a twisted Hilbert $ C^{\\ast} $-module\n(inspired by an idea due to Ruy Exel), and then prescribe a method of\nconstructing, from such a subspace, a generalized fixed-point algebra that is\nMorita-Rieffel equivalent to an ideal of the corresponding reduced twisted\ncrossed product. Our construction thus generalizes that of Meyer and, by\nextension, that of Rieffel. Our main result is the description of a classifying\ncategory for the class of all Hilbert modules over a reduced twisted crossed\nproduct. This implies that every Hilbert module over a $ d $-dimensional\nnon-commutative torus can be constructed from a Hilbert space endowed with a\ntwisted $ \\mathbb{Z}^{d} $-action by unitary operators and a relatively\ncontinuous subspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 03:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 19:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

For this, the phonon-mode spectrum of the\ncrystal is engineered by standing-wave optical potentials or by using Rydberg\nexcited ions, thus generating localized phonon-modes around a hexagon of ions\nselected out of the entire two-dimensional crystal. These tailored modes can\nmediate spin-spin interactions between ion-qubits on a hexagonal plaquette when\nsubject to state-dependent optical dipole forces.

The other mechanism may be forced local acoustic oscillations\ndue to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as\n`sunquakes' in the Sun). We analyze short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in\n75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations\nwhich may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 percent of\nstellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown\norigin.

We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles\n(QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do\nnot correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to\nflare loop oscillations.

A special focus is made on how this microscopic\ntheory can be reduced to a macroscopic dynamic for a selected set of collective\nvariables. Important physical phenomena like adiabaticity/diabaticity, one-body\ndissipation or memory effect are discussed. Special aspects related to the use\nof a time-dependent density functional instead of a time-dependent Hartree-Fock\ntheory based on a bare hamiltonian are underlined. The absence of proper\ndescription of complex internal correlations however strongly impacts the\npredictive power of mean-field. A brief overview of theories going beyond the\nindependent particles/quasi-particles theory is given. Then, a special\nattention is paid for finite fermionic systems at low internal excitation. In\nthat case, quantum fluctuations in collective space that are poorly treated at\nthe mean-field level, are important. Several approaches going beyond\nmean-field, that are anticipated to improve the description of quantum\nfluctuations, are discussed: the Balian-V\\'en\\'eroni variational principle, the\nTime-Dependent Random Phase Approximation and the recently proposed Stochastic\nMean-Field theory.

We test the validity of the method on realistic gas\ndistribution and kinematics of the Milky Way, using a numerical simulation of\nthe Galaxy. We show that the resulting velocity profile strongly deviates from\nthe true rotation curve of the simulation, as it overstimates it in the central\nregions, and underestimates it around the bar corotation. Also, its shape\nstrongly depends on the orientation of the stellar bar. The discrepancies are\ncaused by highly non-uniform azimuthal velocities, and the systematic selection\nby the TP method of high-velocity gas along the bar and spiral arms, or\nlow-velocity gas in less dense regions. The velocity profile is in good\nagreement with the rotation curve only beyond corotation, far from massive\nasymmetric structures. Therefore the observed velocity profile of the Milky Way\ninferred by the TP method is expected to be very close to the true Galactic\nrotation curve for 4.5<R<8 kpc. Another consequence is that the Galactic\nvelocity profile for R<4-4.5 kpc is very likely flawed by the non-uniform\nazimuthal velocities, and does not represent the true Galactic rotation curve,\nbut instead local motions. The real shape of the innermost rotation curve is\nprobably shallower than previously thought. Using a wrong rotation curve has a\ndramatic impact on the modelling of the mass distribution, in particular for\nthe bulge component of which derived enclosed mass within the central kpc and\nscale radius are, respectively, twice and half of the actual values. We thus\nstrongly argue against using terminal velocities or the velocity curve from the\nTP method for modelling the mass distribution of the Milky Way.

The outstanding feature was the detection of auto-oscillation of the\nYIG when enough dc current was passed in the Pt. This finding has created a\ngreat excitement in the community for two reasons: first, one could control\nelectronically the damping of insulators, which can offer improved properties\ncompared to metals, and here YIG has the lowest damping known in nature;\nsecond, the damping compensation could be achieved on very large objects, a\nparticularly relevant point for the field of magnonics [6,7] whose aim is to\nuse spin-waves as carriers of information.

This premise has recently guided the research to the innovative and\nmeaningful idea of imposing multiple constraints on the parameters involved in\nthe problem under study. For instance, when dealing with problems whose\nparameters form sparse and low-rank matrices, the adoption of suitably combined\nconstraints imposing sparsity and low-rankness, is expected to yield\nsubstantially enhanced estimation results. In this paper, we address the\nspectral unmixing problem in hyperspectral images. Specifically, two novel\nunmixing algorithms are introduced, in an attempt to exploit both spatial\ncorrelation and sparse representation of pixels lying in homogeneous regions of\nhyperspectral images. To this end, a novel convex mixed penalty term is first\ndefined consisting of the sum of the weighted $\\ell_1$ and the weighted nuclear\nnorm of the abundance matrix corresponding to a small area of the image\ndetermined by a sliding square window. This penalty term is then used to\nregularize a conventional quadratic cost function and impose simultaneously\nsparsity and row-rankness on the abundance matrix. The resulting regularized\ncost function is minimized by a) an incremental proximal sparse and low-rank\nunmixing algorithm and b) an algorithm based on the alternating minimization\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is\nillustrated in experiments conducted both on simulated and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 08:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 16:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Overlapping coverage of three to five mobile\nnetwork operators (MNOs) results in enormous amount of energy waste which is\navoidable. The traffic demands of the mobile networks vary significantly\nthroughout the day. As the offered load for all networks are not same at a\ngiven time and the differences in energy consumption at different loads are\nsignificant, multi-MNO capacity/coverage sharing can dramatically reduce energy\nconsumption of mobile networks and provide the MNOs a cost effective means to\ncope with the exponential growth of traffic. In this paper, we propose an\nenergy saving market for a multi-MNO network scenario. As the competing MNOs\nare not comfortable with information sharing, we propose a double auction\nclearinghouse market mechanism where MNOs sell and buy capacity in order to\nminimize energy consumption. In our setting, each MNO proposes its bids and\nasks simultaneously for buying and selling multi-unit capacities respectively\nto an independent auctioneer, i.e., clearinghouse and ends up either as a buyer\nor as a seller in each round. We show that the mechanism allows the MNOs to\nsave significant percentage of energy cost throughout a wide range of network\nload. Different than other energy saving features such as cell sleep or antenna\nmuting which can not be enabled at heavy traffic load, dynamic capacity sharing\nallows MNOs to handle traffic bursts with energy saving opportunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 09:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

We present the discovery of two transiting extrasolar planets by the\nsatellite CoRoT. Aims. We aim at a characterization of the planetary bulk\nparameters, which allow us to further investigate the formation and evolution\nof the planetary systems and the main properties of the host stars. Methods. We\nused the transit light curve to characterize the planetary parameters relative\nto the stellar parameters. The analysis of HARPS spectra established the\nplanetary nature of the detections, providing their masses. Further photometric\nand spectroscopic ground-based observations provided stellar parameters (log\ng,Teff,v sin i) to characterize the host stars. Our model takes the geometry of\nthe transit to constrain the stellar density into account, which when linked to\nstellar evolutionary models, determines the bulk parameters of the star.\nBecause of the asymmetric shape of the light curve of one of the planets, we\nhad to include the possibility in our model that the stellar surface was not\nstrictly spherical. Results. We present the planetary parameters of CoRoT-28b,\na Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.484+/-0.087MJup; radius 0.955+/-0.066RJup)\norbiting an evolved star with an orbital period of 5.208 51 +/- 0.000 38 days,\nand CoRoT-29b, another Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.85 +/- 0.20MJup; radius\n0.90 +/- 0.16RJup) orbiting an oblate star with an orbital period of 2.850 570\n+/- 0.000 006 days.

These two new planetary systems have\nvery interesting properties and deserve further study, particularly in the case\nof the star CoRoT-29.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 09:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 07:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

We have now established a robust optical\nstatistical distance indicator, the H$\\alpha$ surface brightness- radius or S-r\nrelation, which addresses this problem. We developed this relation from a\ncritically evaluated sample of primary calibrating PNe. The robust nature of\nthe method results from our revised calibrating distances with significantly\nreduced systematic uncertainties, and the recent availability of high-quality\ndata, including updated nebular diameters and integrated H$\\alpha$ fluxes. The\nS-r technique is simple in its application, requiring only an angular size, an\nintegrated H\\alpha\\ flux, and the reddening to the PN. From these quantities,\nan intrinsic radius is calculated, which when combined with the angular size,\nyields the distance directly. Furthermore, we have found that optically thick\nPNe tend to populate the upper bound of the trend, while optically-thin PNe\nfall along the lower boundary in the S-r plane. This enables sub-trends to be\ndeveloped which offer even better precision in the determination of distances,\nas good as 18 per cent in the case of optically-thin, high-excitation PNe. This\nis significantly better than any previous statistical indicator. We use this\ntechnique to create a catalogue of statistical distances for over 1100 Galactic\nPNe, the largest such compilation in the literature to date. Finally, in an\nappendix, we investigate both a set of transitional PNe and a range of PN\nmimics in the S-r plane, to demonstrate its use as a diagnostic tool.\nInterestingly, stellar ejecta around massive stars plot on a tight locus in S-r\nspace with the potential to act as a separate distance indicator for these\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 09:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 14:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 17:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

The total survey area was 1.5 deg^2 near ecliptic plane and\nclose to the opposition. We detected 150 MBAs with 4 bands (B, V , R, I) in\nthis survey.

From this observation, 75 of 150 MBAs with\ncolor uncertainty less than 0.1 were used in the spectral type analysis, and\ntwo possible Q-type aster- oids were detected. This mean that the Q-type to\nS-type ratio in MBAs is < 0.05. Meanwhile, the Q/S ratio in near Earth\nasteroids (NEAs) has been estimated to be 0.5 to 2 (Binzel et al., 2004; Dandy\net al., 2003).

It is argued in relation to classical mechanics that the propositional\nstructure of the theory allows truth-value assignment in conformity with the\ntraditional conception of a correspondence theory of truth. Every proposition\nin classical mechanics is assigned a definite truth value, either 'true' or\n'false', describing what is actually the case at a certain moment of time.\nTruth-value assignment in quantum mechanics, however, differs; it is known, by\nmeans of a variety of 'no go' theorems, that it is not possible to assign\ndefinite truth values to all propositions pertaining to a quantum system\nwithout generating a Kochen-Specker contradiction. In this respect, the\nBub-Clifton 'uniqueness theorem' is utilized for arguing that truth-value\ndefiniteness is consistently restored with respect to a determinate sublattice\nof propositions defined by the state of the quantum system concerned and a\nparticular observable to be measured. An account of truth of contextual\ncorrespondence is thereby provided that is appropriate to the quantum domain of\ndiscourse. The conceptual implications of the resulting account are traced down\nand analyzed at length. In this light, the traditional conception of\ncorrespondence truth may be viewed as a species or as a limit case of the more\ngeneric proposed scheme of contextual correspondence when the non-explicit\nspecification of a context of discourse poses no further consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 10:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

This\npaper, instead, considers a hybrid level of coordination for the scheduling\nproblem in the downlink of a multi-cloud radio-access network, as a means to\nbenefit from both scheduling policies. Consider a multi-cloud radio access\nnetwork, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high\ncapacity links, and therefore allows joint signal processing between them.\nAcross the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is\npermitted, as it requires a lower level of backhaul communication. The frame\nstructure of every BS is composed of various time/frequency blocks, called\npower-zones (PZs), and kept at fixed power level. The paper addresses the\nproblem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and\nscheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is\nscheduled, at most, to a single cloud, but possibly to many BSs within the\ncloud, and can be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The\npaper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the\nconflict graph. The scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a\nmaximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, in which each\nvertex symbolizes an association of cloud, user, BS and PZ, with a weight\nrepresenting the utility of that association. Simulation results suggest that\nthe proposed hybrid scheduling strategy provides appreciable gain as compared\nto the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with a negligible degradation to\nsignal-level coordination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 11:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

The potential presence of\nliquid water depends on many factors such as, most importantly, surface\ntemperatures. The properties of the planetary atmosphere and its interaction\nwith the radiative energy provided by the planet's host star are thereby of\ndecisive importance. In this study we investigate the influence of different\nmain-sequence stars upon the climate of Earth-like extrasolar planets and their\npotential habitability by applying a 3D Earth climate model accounting for\nlocal and dynamical processes. The calculations have been performed for planets\nwith Earth-like atmospheres at orbital distances where the total amount of\nenergy received from the various host stars equals the solar constant. In\ncontrast to previous 3D modeling studies, we include the effect of ozone\nradiative heating upon the vertical temperature structure of the atmospheres.\nThe global orbital mean results obtained have been compared to those of a 1D\nradiative convective climate model. The different stellar spectral energy\ndistributions lead to different surface temperatures and due to ozone heating\nto very different vertical temperature structures. As previous 1D studies we\nfind higher surface temperatures for the Earth-like planet around the K-type\nstar, and lower temperatures for the planet around the F-type star compared to\nan Earth-like planet around the Sun. However, this effect is more pronounced in\nthe 3D model results than in the 1D model because the 3D model accounts for\nfeedback processes such as the ice-albedo and the water vapor feedback. Whether\nthe 1D model may approximate the global mean of the 3D model results strongly\ndepends on the choice of the relative humidity profile in the 1D model, which\nis used to determine the water vapor profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 11:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep\nlearning framework for video classification, which is able to model static\nspatial information, short-term motion, as well as long-term temporal clues in\nthe videos. Specifically, the spatial and the short-term motion features are\nextracted separately by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These two\ntypes of CNN-based features are then combined in a regularized feature fusion\nnetwork for classification, which is able to learn and utilize feature\nrelationships for improved performance. In addition, Long Short Term Memory\n(LSTM) networks are applied on top of the two features to further model\nlonger-term temporal clues. The main contribution of this work is the hybrid\nlearning framework that can model several important aspects of the video data.\nWe also show that (1) combining the spatial and the short-term motion features\nin the regularized fusion network is better than direct classification and\nfusion using the CNN with a softmax layer, and (2) the sequence-based LSTM is\nhighly complementary to the traditional classification strategy without\nconsidering the temporal frame orders. Extensive experiments are conducted on\ntwo popular and challenging benchmarks, the UCF-101 Human Actions and the\nColumbia Consumer Videos (CCV). On both benchmarks, our framework achieves\nto-date the best reported performance: $91.3\\%$ on the UCF-101 and $83.5\\%$ on\nthe CCV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 11:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

The SFH is derived\nby means of a non-parametric spectrophotometric model applied to individual\ngalaxies at z ~ 0.04- 0.1 in the WINGS clusters and the PM2GC field. The field\nreconstructed evolution of the star formation rate density (SFRD) follows the\nvalues observed at each redshift (Madau & Dickinson 2014), except at z > 2\nwhere our estimate is ~ 1.7x higher than the high-z observed value. The slope\nof the SFRD decline with time gets progressively steeper going from low mass to\nhigh mass haloes. The decrease of the SFRD since z = 2 is due to 1) quenching -\n50% of the SFRD in the field and 75% in clusters at z > 2 originated in\ngalaxies that are passive today - and 2) the fact that the average SFR of\ntoday's star-forming galaxies has decreased with time. We quantify the\ncontribution to the SFRD(z) of galaxies of today's different masses and\nmorphologies. The current morphology correlates with the current star formation\nactivity but is irrelevant for the past stellar history. The average SFH\ndepends on galaxy mass, but galaxies of a given mass have different histories\ndepending on their environment. We conclude that the variation of the SFRD(z)\nwith environment is not driven by different distributions of galaxy masses and\nmorphologies in clusters and field, and must be due to an accelerated formation\nin high mass haloes compared to low mass ones even for galaxies that will end\nup having the same galaxy mass today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 13:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 15:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Two or more\nmobile agents start from different nodes of a network and have to accomplish\nthe task of gathering which consists in getting all together at the same node\nat the same time. An adversary chooses the initial nodes of the agents and\nassigns a different positive integer (called label) to each of them. Initially,\neach agent knows its label but does not know the labels of the other agents or\ntheir positions relative to its own. Agents move in synchronous rounds and can\ncommunicate with each other only when located at the same node. Up to f of the\nagents are Byzantine. A Byzantine agent can choose an arbitrary port when it\nmoves, can convey arbitrary information to other agents and can change its\nlabel in every round, in particular by forging the label of another agent or by\ncreating a completely new one.\n  What is the minimum number M of good agents that guarantees deterministic\ngathering of all of them, with termination?\n  We provide exact answers to this open problem by considering the case when\nthe agents initially know the size of the network and the case when they do\nnot. In the former case, we prove M=f+1 while in the latter, we prove M=f+2.\nMore precisely, for networks of known size, we design a deterministic algorithm\ngathering all good agents in any network provided that the number of good\nagents is at least f+1. For networks of unknown size, we also design a\ndeterministic algorithm ensuring the gathering of all good agents in any\nnetwork but provided that the number of good agents is at least f+2.

Synthetic model atmosphere calculations are still the most commonly\nused tool when determining precise stellar parameters and stellar chemical\ncompositions. Besides three-dimensional models that consistently solve for\nhydrodynamic processes, one-dimensional models that use an approximation for\nconvective energy transport play the major role.\n  Aims. We use modern Balmer-line formation theory as well as spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) measurements for the Sun and Procyon to calibrate the model\nparameter {\\alpha} that describes the efficiency of convection in our 1D\nmodels. Convection was calibrated over a significant range in parameter space,\nreaching from F-K along the main sequence and sampling the turnoff and giant\nbranch over a wide range of metallicities. This calibration was compared to\ntheoretical evaluations and allowed an accurate modeling of stellar\natmospheres.\n  Methods. We used Balmer-line fitting and SED fits to determine the convective\nefficiency parameter {\\alpha}. Both methods are sensitive to the structure and\ntemperature stratification of the deeper photosphere.\n  Results. While SED fits do not allow a precise determination of the\nconvective parameter for the Sun and Procyon, they both favor values\nsignificantly higher than 1.0. Balmer-line fitting, which we find to be more\nsensitive, suggests that the convective efficiency parameter {\\alpha} is\n$\\approx$ 2.0 for the main sequence and quickly decreases to $\\approx$ 1.0 for\nevolved stars.

These estimates are useful for\nvarious numerical methods, in particular, for a posteriori error estimation\nmethods for partial differential equations (PDEs). Therefore, we are mainly\nfocused on domains typical for numerical analysis (simplexes in 2d and 3d) and\nsuggest easily computable relations that provide sharp bounds of the respective\nconstants. Also, we investigate numerically the behavior of the constants in\nthe classical Poincare inequalities and compare these results with known\nanalytical estimates.

A somewhat peculiar situation arises for couplings\nof Hermitian matter fields to massive vector potentials; in that case the only\ncurrent is the screened Maxwell current and the coupling disappears in the\nmassless limit. In case of selfinteracting massive vector mesons the situation\nbecomes even more peculiar in that the usually renormalizability guaranteeing\nvalidity of the first order power-counting criterion breaks down in second\norder and requires the compensatory presence of additional Hermitian H-fields.\nSome aspect of these observation have already been noticed in the BRST gauge\ntheoretic formulation, but here we use a new setting based on string-local\nvector mesons which is required by Hilbert space positivity. The coupling to\nH-fields induces Mexican hat like selfinteractions; they are not imposed and\nbear no relation with spontaneous symmetry breaking; they are rather\nconsequences of the foundational causal localization properties realized in a\nHilbert space setting. In case of selfinteracting massive vectormesons their\npresence is required in order to maintain the first order power-counting\nrestriction of renormalizability also in second order. The presentation of the\nnew Hilbert space setting for vector mesons which replaces gauge theory and\nextends on-shell unitarity to its off-shell counterpart is the main motivation\nfor this work. The new Hilbert space setting also shows that the second order\nLie-algebra structure of selfinteracting vector mesons is a consequence of the\nprinciples of QFT and promises a deeper understanding of the origin of\nconfinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 10:35:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 13:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 17:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 16:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-02"}
