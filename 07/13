The Google matrix analysis allows to obtain reliable ranking\nof countries and activity sectors and to determine the sensitivity of\nCheiRank-PageRank commercial balance of countries in respect to price\nvariations and labor cost in various countries. We demonstrate that the\ndeveloped approach takes into account multiplicity of network links with\neconomy interactions between countries and activity sectors thus being more\nefficient compared to the usual export-import analysis. Our results highlight\nthe striking increase of the influence of German economic activity on other\ncountries during the period 1995 to 2009 while the influence of Eurozone\ndecreases during the same period. We compare our results with the similar\nanalysis of the world trade network from the UN COMTRADE database. We argue\nthat the knowledge of network structure allows to analyze the effects of\neconomic influence and contagion propagation over the world economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 21:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

UBM's estimation method consists of two major components.\nFirst, it estimates how much an application's stall time can be reduced if the\naccessed page is placed in DRAM. To do this, UBM comprehensively considers\naccess frequency, row buffer locality, and memory level parallelism (MLP) to\nestimate the application's stall time reduction. Second, UBM estimates how much\neach application's stall time reduction contributes to overall system\nperformance. Based on this estimation method, UBM can determine and place the\nmost critical data in DRAM to directly optimize system performance.\nExperimental results show that UBM improves system performance by 14% on\naverage (and up to 39%) compared to the best of three state-of-the-art\nmechanisms for a large number of data-intensive workloads from the SPEC CPU2006\nand Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) suites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 01:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-18"}

In contrast to the\ncase of non-clustered networks, two kinds of sparsely synchronized states such\nas modular and global synchronization are found. For the case of modular sparse\nsynchronization, the population behavior reveals the modular structure, because\nthe intra-modular dynamics of sub-networks make some mismatching. On the other\nhand, in the case of global sparse synchronization, the population behavior is\nglobally identical, independently of the cluster structure, because the\nintra-modular dynamics of sub-networks make perfect matching. We introduce a\nrealistic cross-correlation modularity measure, representing the\nmatching-degree between the instantaneous sub-population spike rates of the\nsub-networks, and examine whether the sparse synchronization is global or\nmodular. Furthermore, we characterize the modular and global sparse\nsynchronization by employing the realistic sub- and whole-population order\nparameters and statistical-mechanical measures. The roles of $J_{inter}$ and\n$M_{syn}^{(inter)}$ are thus found as follows. For large $J_{inter}$, due to\nstrong inhibition it plays a destructive role to \"spoil\" the pacing between\nspikes, while for small $J_{inter}$ it plays a constructive role to \"favor\" the\npacing between spikes. In contrast, $M_{syn}^{(inter)}$ seems to play a role\njust to favor the pacing between spikes. With increasing $M_{syn}^{(inter)}$,\nthe pacing degree between spikes increases monotonically thanks to the increase\nin the degree of effectiveness of global communication between spikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 02:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 06:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

In\nparticular, when the object support is centro-symmetric, the iterative solution\noften stagnates such that the resultant complex image contains the features of\nboth the desired solution and its inverted and complex-conjugated replica. The\nconventional approach to address the twin image problem is to modify the object\nsupport during initial iterations which can possibly lead to elimination of one\nof the twin images.

In this article,\nwe use Lov\\'asz local lemma to first give a new simple proof of said theorem,\nand second to prove the existence of a $G$-effectively closed strongly\naperiodic subshift for any finitely generated group $G$. We also study the\nproblem of constructing subshifts which generalize a property of Sturmian\nsequences to finitely generated groups. More precisely, a subshift over the\nalphabet $\\{0,1\\}$ has uniform density $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ if for every\nconfiguration the density of $1$'s in any increasing sequence of balls\nconverges to $\\alpha$. We show a slightly more general result which implies\nthat these subshifts always exist in the case of groups of subexponential\ngrowth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 09:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 12:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Mar 2018 13:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

Measuring living tissues, however, is a challenging task\nthat poses countless technical and practical problems, in particular if the\ntissues need to be measured under the skin. This paper presents a bio-impedance\nsensor ASIC targeting a battery-free, miniature size, implantable device, which\nperforms accurate 4-point complex impedance extraction in the frequency range\nfrom 2 kHz to 2 MHz. The ASIC is fabricated in 150 nm CMOS, has a size of 1.22\nmm x 1.22 mm and consumes 165 uA from a 1.8 V power supply. The ASIC is\nembedded in a prototype which communicates with, and is powered by an external\nreader device through inductive coupling. The prototype is validated by\nmeasuring the impedances of different combinations of discrete components,\nmeasuring the electrochemical impedance of physiological solution, and\nperforming ex vivo measurements on animal organs. The proposed ASIC is able to\nextract complex impedances with around 1 Ohm resolution; therefore enabling\naccurate wireless tissue measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 10:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

For this we construct the complete eigenbasis of\nthe Hamiltonian using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method in the\nlanguage of the matrix product states. It is a peculiarity of the NRG that\nwhile the Wilson chain is supposed to describe a macroscopic bath, very few\nsingle particle excitations already suffice to essentially thermalize the\nimpurity system at finite temperature, which amounts to having added a\nmacroscopic amount of energy. Thus given an initial state of the system such as\nthe ground state together with microscopic excitations, we calculate the\nspectral function of the impurity using the microcanonical and diagonal and\ngrand canonical ensembles. By adding or removing particles at a certain Wilson\nenergy shell on top of the ground state, we find qualitative agreement between\nthe spectral functions calculated for different ensembles. This indicates that\nthe system thermalizes in the long-time limit, and can be described by an\nappropriate statistical-mechanical ensemble. Moreover, by calculating the\nimpurity spectral density at the Fermi level and the dot occupancy for energy\neigenstates relevant for microcanonical ensemble, we find good support for ETH.\nThe ultimate mechanism responsible for this effective thermalization within the\nNRG can be identified as Anderson orthogonality: the more charge that needs to\nflow to or from infinity after applying a local excitation within the Wilson\nchain, the more the system looks thermal afterwards at an increased\ntemperature. For the same reason, however, thermalization fails if charge\nrearrangement after the excitation remains mostly local.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 11:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Over 64,400 transport experiments, we observe several distinct\ntransport regimes, including environment-assisted quantum transport and the\n''quantum Goldilocks'' regime in strong, statically disordered discrete-time\nsystems. Low loss and high-fidelity programmable transformations make this\nnanophotonic processor a promising platform for many-boson quantum simulation\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 11:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 02:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 13:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Formally,\na patrolling problem is specified by a set $U$ of nodes (admissible defender's\npositions), a set $T \\subseteq U$ of vulnerable targets, an admissible\ndefender's moves over $U$, and a function which to every target assigns the\ntime needed to complete an intrusion at it. The goal is to design an optimal\nstrategy for a defender who is moving from node to node and aims at detecting\npossible intrusions at the targets. The goal of the attacker is to maximize the\nprobability of a successful attack. We assume that the attacker is adversarial,\ni.e., he knows the strategy of the defender and can observe her moves.\n  We prove that the defender has an optimal strategy for every patrolling\nproblem. Further, we show that for every $\\varepsilon$ > 0, there exists a\nfinite-memory $\\varepsilon$-optimal strategy for the defender constructible in\nexponential time, and we observe that such a strategy cannot be computed in\npolynomial time unless P=NP.\n  Then we focus ourselves to unrestricted defender's moves. Here, a patrolling\nproblem is fully determined by its signature, the number of targets of each\nattack length. We bound the maximal probability of successfully defended\nattacks. Then, we introduce a decomposition method which allows to split a\ngiven patrolling problem $G$ into smaller subproblems and construct a\ndefender's strategy for $G$ by \"composing\" the strategies constructed for these\nsubproblems.\n  Finally, for patrolling problems with $T = U$ and a well-formed signature, we\ngive an exact classification of all sufficiently connected environments where\nthe defender can achieve the same value as in the fully connected uniform\nenvironment. This result is useful for designing \"good\" environments where the\ndefender can act optimally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 11:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The survey includes studies from a wide scope of academic\ndisciplines, in order to create an inventory of the different mathematical\nfunctions used to describe the distributions. The goal of the study was to\ndetermine, whether a unique function can be used to describe all the\ndistributions (universality) or a particular function is best suited to\ndescribe the distributions in each specific field of research (domain\nuniversality). We propose a classification of distributions into eighth\ndifferent categories, based on three representations: the Zipf representation,\nthe cumulative density function (CDF) and the probability density function\n(PDF). In the 89 cases included in the survey, neither universality nor domain\nuniversality was found. In particular, based on the results of the survey, the\nclaim that \"power law provides a good description for majority of\ndistributions\" may be rejected. Only one third of the distributions in our\nsurvey are associated with power laws, while another third is well described by\nlognormal and similar functions (Dagum, Weibull, loglogistic and Gamma\nfunctions). We suggest that correct characterization of a distribution relies\non two conditions. First, it is important to include the full range of the\navailable data to avoid distortion due to arbitrary cut off values. Second, it\nis advisable to display the data in all three representations: the Zipf\nrepresentation, the CDF and the PDF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 11:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

Moreover, our backbone-branches architecture does not contain\nfull-connection layers for location regression, leading to efficient learning\nand inference.

Analytic conditions for existence of exact compact\nthree-site solutions are obtained, and explicitly illustrated for the cases of\npower-law (cubic) and saturable nonlinearities. These nonlinear compact modes\nappear as continuations of linear compact modes belonging to a flat dispersion\nband. While for the linear system a compact mode exists only for one specific\nratio of the two different coupling constants, nonlinearity may lead to\ncompactification of otherwise non-compact localized modes for a range of\ncoupling ratios, at some specific power. For saturable lattices, the\ncompactification power can be tuned by also varying the nonlinear parameter.\nIntroducing different on-site energies and anisotropic couplings yield further\npossibilities for compactness tuning. The properties of strongly localized\nmodes are investigated numerically for cubic and saturable nonlinearities, and\nin particular their stability over large parameter regimes is shown. Since the\nlinear flat band is isolated, its compact modes may be continued into compact\nnonlinear modes both for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities.

One immediate consequence is the\naccumulation of gas in the centre of galaxies where it can form stars and alter\nthe chemical and physical properties. We use a sample of nearby face--on disc\ngalaxies with available SDSS spectra to study whether the properties of the\nionised gas in the central parts (radii <~0.6-2.1 kpc) of barred galaxies are\naltered by the presence of a bar, and whether the bar effect is related to bar\nand/or parent galaxy properties. The distributions of all parameters analysed\nare different for barred and unbarred galaxies, except for the R23 metallicity\ntracer and the oxygen abundance (from photoionisation models). The median\nvalues point towards (marginally) larger dust content, star formation rate per\nunit area, electron density and ionisation parameter in the centres of barred\ngalaxies than in the unbarred counterpart. The most remarkable barred/unbarred\ndifference appears in the [NII]6583/Ha line ratio, which is on average ~25%\nlarger in barred galaxies, due to a larger N/O in the centres of these\ngalaxies. We observe an enhancement of the central gas differences in\nlater-type galaxies or galaxies with less massive bulges. However the bar seems\nto have a lower impact on the central gas properties for galaxies with more\nmassive bulges (M_bulge > 10^10 M_sun) or galaxies with total stellar mass\nabove ~ 10^10.8 M_sun. In conclusion, we find observational evidence that the\npresence of a galactic bar affects the central ionised gas properties of disc\ngalaxies, where the most striking effect is an enhancement in the N/O abundance\nratio, which can be qualitatively interpreted as due to a different origin or\nevolutionary processes for less and more massive bulges, with the gaseous phase\nof the former having currently a closer relation with bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 14:13:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 11:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks traveling close\ntogether can save about 10% of their fuel consumption.

On average, the new\nderived fluorine abundances are systematically lower by 0.33 dex with respect\nto previous determinations. This may derive from a combination of the lower\nexcitation energies of the HF lines and the larger macroturbulence parameters\nused here as well as from the new adopted CN line list. Yet, theoretical\nnucleosynthesis models in AGB stars agree with the new fluorine determinations\nat solar metallicities. At low metallicities, an agreement between theory and\nobservations can be found by handling in a different way the\nradiative/convective interface at the base of the convective envelope. New\nfluorine spectroscopic measurements agree with theoretical models at low and at\nsolar metallicity. Despite this, complementary sources are needed to explain\nits observed abundance in the solar neighbourhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 15:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Given a point\nsource located in an unbounded half-space or an infinitely extended layer,\nSommerfeld and others showed that Fourier analysis combined with contour\nintegration provides a systematic and broadly effective approach, leading to\nwhat is generally referred to as the Sommerfeld integral representation. When\neither the source or target is at some distance from an infinite boundary, the\nnumber of degrees of freedom needed to resolve the scattering response is very\nmodest. When both are near an interface, however, the Sommerfeld integral\ninvolves a very large range of integration and its direct application becomes\nunwieldy. Historically, three schemes have been employed to overcome this\ndifficulty: the method of images, contour deformation, and asymptotic methods\nof various kinds. None of these methods make use of classical layer potentials\nin physical space, despite their advantages in terms of adaptive resolution and\nhigh-order accuracy. The reason for this is simple: layer potentials are\nimpractical in layered media or half-space geometries since they require the\ndiscretization of an infinite boundary. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nmethod which combines layer potentials (physical-space) on a finite portion of\nthe interface together with a Sommerfeld-type (Fourier) correction. We prove\nthat our method is efficient and rapidly convergent for arbitrarily located\nsources and targets, and show that the scheme is particularly effective when\nsolving scattering problems for objects which are close to the half-space\nboundary or even embedded across a layered media interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 15:23:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 12:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

The obvious general criterion for\nvariable selection is to choose the `most representative' or `most relevant'\nvariables.

The mRMR (minimum Redundance\nMaximum Relevance) procedure, proposed by Ding and Peng (2005) and Peng et al.\n(2005) is an algorithm to systematically perform variable selection, achieving\na reasonable trade-off between relevance and redundancy.

The\nCohen-Jones-Segal construction associates a stable homotopy type to a framed\nflow category whose cohomology is designed to recover the corresponding Morse\nor Floer cohomology.

In case it is at farthest point known as lunar apogee\ncauses smallest full moon or micro full moon and if it is closest to us termed\nas lunar perigee will result in macro full moon, also known as super moon, a\nterm coined by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979. The theoretical expressions\nfor the lunar luminous fluxes on the earth representing the power of lunar\nlight the earth intercepts in the direction normal to the incidence over an\narea of one square meter are derived for two extreme positions lunar apogee and\nlunar perigee. The expressions for the apparent sizes of full moons\ncorresponding to said positions are also mentioned. It is found that full\nperigee moon is about 29 percent brighter and 14 percent bigger than the full\napogee moon consistent with the reported values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 11:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Tracking is carried out in\nthe Bayesian framework and its extension to a distributed context is made\npossible via an information-theoretic approach to data fusion which exploits\nconsensus algorithms and the notion of Kullback-Leibler Average (KLA) of the\nProbability Density Functions (PDFs) to be fused. The first step toward\ndistributed tracking considers a single moving object. Consensus takes place in\neach agent for spreading information over the network so that each node can\ntrack the object. To achieve such a goal, consensus is carried out on the local\nsingle-object posterior distribution, which is the result of local data\nprocessing, in the Bayesian setting, exploiting the last available measurement\nabout the object. The next step is in the direction of distributed estimation\nof multiple moving objects. In order to model, in a rigorous and elegant way, a\npossibly time-varying number of objects present in a given area of interest,\nthe Random Finite Set (RFS) formulation is adopted since it provides the notion\nof probability density for multi-object states that allows to directly extend\nexisting tools in distributed estimation to multi-object tracking. The last\ntheoretical step of the present dissertation is toward distributed filtering\nwith the further requirement of unique object identities. To this end the\nlabeled RFS framework is adopted as it provides a tractable approach to the\nmulti-object Bayesian recursion. A generalization of the KLA to the labeled RFS\nframework, enables the development of novel consensus multi-object tracking\nfilters which are fully distributed, scalable and computationally efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 21:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

It is well-known that\nmalignant tumors induce the formation of a lymphatic and a blood vascular\nnetwork around themselves. A similar but far less studied process occurs in\nrelation to the nervous system and is referred to as \\emph{neoneurogenesis}; in\nfact, recent studies have demonstrated that tumors initiate their own\ninnervation. However, the relationship between tumor progression and the\nnervous system is still poorly understood. This process is most likely\nregulated by a multitude of factors in the tumor-nerve microenvironment and it\nis therefore important to study the interactions between the nervous system and\ntumor cells through mathematical/computational modelling: this may reveal the\nmost significant factors of the plethora of interacting elements regulating\nneoneurogenesis. The present work is a first attempt to model the\nneurobiological aspect of cancer development through a (simple) system of\ndifferential equations. The model confirms the experimental observations that a\ntumor is able to promote nerve formation/elongation around itself, and that\nhigh levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and axon guidance molecules (AGMs) are\nrecorded in the presence of a tumor. Our results also reflect the observation\nthat high stress levels (represented by higher norepinephrine release by\nsympathetic nerves) contribute to tumor development and spread, indicating a\nmutually beneficial relationship between tumor cells and neurons. The model\npredictions suggest novel therapeutic strategies, aimed at blocking the stress\neffects on tumor growth and dissemination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 08:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}
