To explain\nthese facts, we have constructed a simple model of three phases. Phase A: a\ngiant interstellar cloud is uniformly accelerated (or decelerated) with respect\nto the field stars during a relatively short period of time (10 Myr) and the\ncloud's mass is uniformly increased; phase B: the acceleration (or\ndeceleration) and mass accretion of the cloud cease. The star formation spreads\nthroughout the cloud, giving origin to stellar groups of similar ages; and\nphase C: the cloud loses all its gaseous component at a constant rate and in\nparallel is uniformly decelerated (or accelerated) until reaching the initial\nvelocity of phase A (case 1) or the velocity of the gas cloud remains constant\n(case 2). Both cases give equivalent results. The system equations for the star\nmotions governed by a time-dependent gravitational potential of the giant cloud\nand referred to a coordinate system co-moving with the cloud have been solved\nanalytically. We have assumed a homogeneous spheroidal cloud of fixed\nsemi-major axis a=300 pc and of an initial density of 7 at cm^{-3}, with a\ndensity increment of 100 per cent and a cloud's velocity variation of 30 km\ns^{-1}, from the beginning to the end of Phase A. The result is that about 4\nper cent of the field stars that are passing within the volume of the cloud at\nthe beginning of phase A is captured. The Sun itself could have been captured\nby the same cloud that originated the moving groups of the solar neighbourhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 16:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

GAMMA-400 will try to solve the unanswered questions on these\ntopics by high-precision measurements of the Galactic and extragalactic\ngamma-ray sources, Galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission and the spectra\nof cosmic-ray electrons + positrons and nuclei, thanks to excellent energy and\nangular resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 16:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

This source is thought to be a distant BL Lac object behind the Galactic\nplane and, though it exhibits a steep spectrum it is a weak GeV source, only\nrecently detected using 5 years of Fermi-LAT data. Deep VERITAS observations at\nhigh elevations result in the most significant VHE detection of this object so\nfar, with an excess above 200 GeV of more than 18 standard deviations. We use\nvariability and spectral analyses of VERITAS data on HESS J1943+213 in a\nmulti-wavelength context to address the source classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 17:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 22:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Galaxy properties, notably the star formation (SF) ability, are\naltered as they fall into overdense regions. The critical issues to understand\nthis evolution are how the truncation of SF is connected to the morphological\ntransformation and the responsible physical mechanism. The GaLAxy Cluster\nEvolution Survey (GLACE) is conducting a study on the variation of galaxy\nproperties (SF, AGN, morphology) as a function of environment in a\nrepresentative sample of clusters. A deep survey of emission line galaxies\n(ELG) is being performed, mapping a set of optical lines ([OII], [OIII],\nH$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$/[NII]) in several clusters at z $\\sim$ 0.40, 0.63 and\n0.86. Using the Tunable Filters (TF) of OSIRIS/GTC, GLACE applies the technique\nof TF tomography: for each line, a set of images at different wavelengths are\ntaken through the TF, to cover a rest frame velocity range of several thousands\nkm/s. The first GLACE results target the H$\\alpha$/[NII] lines in the cluster\nZwCl 0024.0+1652 at z = 0.395 covering $\\sim$ 2 $\\times$ r$_{vir}$.

We have studied the spatial distribution of ELG, confirming\nthe existence of two components in the redshift space. Finally, we have\nexploited the outstanding spectral resolution of the TF to estimate the cluster\nmass from ELG dynamics, finding M$_{200}$ = 4.1 $\\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}\nh^{-1}$, in agreement with previous weak-lensing estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 18:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

To constrain the physical\norigin of the Br Gamma line in Herbig Ae stars, all the interferometric\nobservables were compared with the predictions of a line radiative transfer\ndisc wind model. The measured visibilities clearly increase within the Br Gamma\nline, indicating that the Br Gamma emitting region is more compact than the\ncontinuum. By fitting a geometric Gaussian model to the continuum-corrected Br\nGamma visibilities, we derived a compact radius of the Br Gamma emitting region\nof ~0.07+/-0.02AU (Gaussian half width at half maximum; or a ring-fit radius of\n~0.08+/-0.02AU). To interpret the observations, we developed a\nmagneto-centrifugally driven disc wind model.

Here, we review recent work on developing and\nimplementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and\ndistributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have\nreceived a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either\nin theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a\nsingle machine. Our main focus is on the underlying theory and practical\nimplementation of random projection and random sampling algorithms for very\nlarge very overdetermined (i.e., overconstrained) $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$\nregression problems. Randomization can be used in one of two related ways:\neither to construct sub-sampled problems that can be solved, exactly or\napproximately, with traditional numerical methods; or to construct\npreconditioned versions of the original full problem that are easier to solve\nwith traditional iterative algorithms. Theoretical results demonstrate that in\nnear input-sparsity time and with only a few passes through the data one can\nobtain very strong relative-error approximate solutions, with high probability.\nEmpirical results highlight the importance of various trade-offs (e.g., between\nthe time to construct an embedding and the conditioning quality of the\nembedding, between the relative importance of computation versus communication,\netc.) and demonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ regression problems can be\nsolved to low, medium, or high precision in existing distributed systems on up\nto terabyte-sized data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 18:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 07:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Its general non-thermal character and\nthe softness in the X-ray band remain unexplained. We tackle these issues by\nperforming Monte Carlo simulations of radiation-matter interactions in a\nscattering dominated photon-lepton plasma. The plasma -- initially in\nequilibrium -- is driven to non-equilibrium conditions by a sudden energy\ninjection in the lepton population, mimicking the effect of a shock wave or the\ndissipation of magnetic energy. Equilibrium restoration occurs due to energy\nexchange between the photons and leptons. While the initial and final\nequilibrium spectra are thermal, the transitional photon spectra are\ncharacterized by non-thermal features such as power-law tails, high energy\nbumps, and multiple components. Such non-thermal features are observed at\ninfinity if the dissipation occurs at small to moderate optical depths, and the\nspectrum is released before thermalization is complete. We model the synthetic\nspectra with a Band function and show that the resulting spectral parameters\nare similar to observations for a frequency range of 2-3 orders of magnitude\naround the peak. In addition, our model predicts correlations between the\nlow-frequency photon index and the peak frequency as well as between the low-\nand high-frequency indices.

Observational data sets are large and complex.\nMultiple testing and multiple modeling can lead to false positive findings.\nPublication, confirmation and other biases are also possible problems.\n  Moreover, the fact that most data sets used in studies evaluating the\nrelationships among air quality and public health outcomes are not publicly\navailable makes reproducing the claims nearly impossible. Here we have built\nand made publicly available a dataset containing daily air quality levels,\nPM2.5 and ozone, daily temperature levels, minimum and maximum and daily\nrelative humidity levels for the eight most populous California air basins.

In summary, the empirical evidence is\nthat current levels of air quality, ozone and PM2.5, are not causally related\nto acute deaths for California.

Unfortunately, during this same period, there has been\nrelatively little work studying the phenomenologies associated with their\nnon-supersymmetric counterparts. The primary reason for this relative lack of\nattention is the fact that strings without spacetime supersymmetry are\ngenerally unstable, exhibiting large one-loop dilaton tadpoles. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate that this hurdle can be overcome in a class of tachyon-free\nfour-dimensional string models realized through coordinate-dependent\ncompactifications. Moreover, as we shall see, it is possible to construct\nmodels in this class whose low-lying states resemble the Standard Model (or\neven potential unified extensions thereof) --- all without any light\nsuperpartners, and indeed without supersymmetry at any energy scale. The\nexistence of such models thus opens the door to general studies of\nnon-supersymmetric string phenomenology, and in this paper we proceed to\ndiscuss a variety of theoretical and phenomenological issues associated with\nsuch non-supersymmetric strings. On the theoretical side, we discuss the\nfiniteness properties of such strings, the general characteristics of their\nmass spectra, the magnitude and behavior of their one-loop cosmological\nconstants, and their interpolation properties. By contrast, on the\nphenomenological side, the properties we discuss are more model-specific and\ninclude their construction techniques, their natural energy scales, their\nparticle and charge assignments, and the magnitudes of their associated Yukawa\ncouplings and scalar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 20:55:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 18:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

In this paper we\nlay down the theoretical framework and explore models of dynamical R-parity\nviolation in which the breaking of R-parity is communicated to the visible\nsector by heavy messenger fields. We find that R-parity violation is often\ndominated by non-holomorphic operators that have so far been largely ignored,\nand might require a modification of the existing searches at the LHC. The\ndynamical origin implies that the effects of such operators are suppressed by\nthe ratio of either the light fermion masses or the supersymmetry breaking\nscale to the mediation scale, thereby providing a natural explanation for the\nsmallness of R-parity violation. We consider various scenarios, classified by\nwhether R-parity violation, flavor breaking and/or supersymmetry breaking are\nmediated by the same messenger fields. The most compact case, corresponding to\na deformation of the so called flavor mediation scenario, allows for the\nmediation of supersymmetry breaking, R-parity breaking, and flavor symmetry\nbreaking in a unified manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 21:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 14:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-15"}

With the\ncorresponding $2-4$ times tighter binary separation, PG 1302 would be\nundergoing gravitational wave dominated inspiral, and serve as a proof that the\nBHs can be fueled and produce bright emission even in this late stage of the\nmerger. The expected fraction of binaries with the shorter $t_{\\rm bin}$, among\nbright quasars, would be reduced by 1-2 orders of magnitude, compared to the\n5.2 year period, in better agreement with the rarity of candidates reported by\nGraham et al.

Finally, shorter periods would imply higher binary\nspeeds, possibly imprinting periodicity on the light curves from relativistic\nbeaming, as well as measurable relativistic effects on the Fe K$\\alpha$ line.\nThe CBD model predicts additional periodic variability on timescales of $t_{\\rm\nbin}$ and $\\approx 0.5 t_{\\rm bin}$, as well as periodic variation of broad\nline widths and offsets relative to the narrow lines, which are consistent with\nthe observations.

Our goal is to explain the differences and\ntrends observed in the FIR line emission of dwarf galaxies compared to more\nmetal-rich galaxies. We present Herschel PACS spectroscopic observations of the\nCII157um, OI63 and 145um, OIII88um, NII122 and 205um, and NIII57um\nfine-structure cooling lines in a sample of 48 low-metallicity star-forming\ngalaxies of the guaranteed time key program Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We correlate\nPACS line ratios and line-to-LTIR ratios with LTIR, LTIR/LB, metallicity, and\nFIR color, and interpret the observed trends in terms of ISM conditions and\nphase filling factors with Cloudy radiative transfer models. We find that the\nFIR lines together account for up to 3 percent of LTIR and that star-forming\nregions dominate the overall emission in dwarf galaxies. Compared to metal-rich\ngalaxies, the ratios of OIII/NII122 and NIII/NII122 are high, indicative of\nhard radiation fields. In the photodissociation region (PDR), the CII/OI63\nratio is slightly higher than in metal-rich galaxies, with a small increase\nwith metallicity, and the OI145/OI63 ratio is generally lower than 0.1,\ndemonstrating that optical depth effects should be small on the scales probed.\nThe OIII/OI63 ratio can be used as an indicator of the ionized gas/PDR filling\nfactor, and is found ~4 times higher in the dwarfs than in metal-rich galaxies.\nThe high CII/LTIR, OI/LTIR, and OIII/LTIR ratios, which decrease with\nincreasing LTIR and LTIR/LB, are interpreted as a combination of moderate FUV\nfields and low PDR covering factor. Harboring compact phases of low filling\nfactor and a large volume filling factor of diffuse gas, the ISM of\nlow-metallicity dwarf galaxies has a more porous structure than that in\nmetal-rich galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 21:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We\nconsider a class of retransmission-based schemes, where transmitters in the\nnetwork are only allowed to resend their symbols in order to assist with the\nneutralization of interference at the receivers. We introduce a necessary and\nsufficient condition on the network topology, under which half symmetric\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF) is achievable through the considered\nretransmission-based schemes. This corresponds to the \"best\" topologies since\nhalf symmetric DoF is the highest possible value for the symmetric DoF in the\npresence of interference. We show that when the condition is satisfied, there\nalways exists a set of carefully chosen transmitters in the network, such that\nby retransmission of their symbols at an appropriate time slot, we can\nneutralize all the interfering signals at the receivers. Quite surprisingly, we\nalso show that for any given network topology, if we cannot achieve half\nsymmetric DoF by retransmission-based schemes, then there does not exist any\nlinear scheme that can do so. We also consider a practical network scenario\nthat models cell edge users in a heterogeneous network, and show that the\ncharacterized condition on the network topology occurs frequently. Furthermore,\nwe numerically evaluate the achievable rates of the DoF-optimal\nretransmission-based scheme in such network scenario, and show that its\nthroughput gain is not restricted to the asymptotic DoF analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 23:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

The motivating application comes from sleep\nmedicine, where researchers are able to non-invasively record physiological\ntime series signals during sleep. The frequency patterns of these signals,\nwhich can be quantified through the power spectrum, contain interpretable\ninformation about biological processes. An important problem in sleep research\nis drawing connections between power spectra of time series signals and\nclinical characteristics; these connections are key to understanding biological\npathways through which sleep affects, and can be treated to improve, health.\nSuch analyses are challenging as they must overcome the complicated structure\nof a power spectrum from multiple time series as a complex positive-definite\nmatrix-valued function. This article proposes a new approach to such analyses\nbased on a tensor-product spline model of Cholesky components of\noutcome-dependent power spectra. The approach flexibly models power spectra as\nnonparametric functions of frequency and outcome while preserving geometric\nconstraints. Formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, a Whittle likelihood\nbased Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for automated\nmodel fitting and for conducting inference on associations between outcomes and\nspectral measures.

Silicon\nhas attracted great interest as a host material for developing spin qubits\nbecause of its weak spin-orbit coupling and hyperfine interaction, and several\narchitectures based on gate defined quantum dots have been proposed and\ndemonstrated experimentally. Recently, a quantum dot hybrid qubit formed by\nthree electrons in double quantum dot was proposed, and non-adiabatic\npulsed-gate operation was implemented experimentally, demonstrating simple and\nfast electrical manipulations of spin states with a promising ratio of\ncoherence time to manipulation time. However, the overall gate fidelity of the\npulse-gated hybrid qubit is limited by relatively fast dephasing due to charge\nnoise during one of the two required gate operations. Here we perform the first\nmicrowave-driven gate operations of a quantum dot hybrid qubit, avoiding\nentirely the regime in which it is most sensitive to charge noise. Resonant\ndetuning modulation along with phase control of the microwaves enables a pi\nrotation time of less than 5 ns (50 ps) around X(Z)-axis with high fidelities >\n93 (96) %.

This slows down the training by requiring lower\nlearning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously\nhard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this\nphenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing\nlayer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of\nthe model architecture and performing the normalization for each training\nmini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and\nbe less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some\ncases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image\nclassification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14\ntimes fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant\nmargin.

It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates\nslower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks\nbetween their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating\nindividual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses. These\nfindings are derived for equal-mass binaries without intrinsic neutron-star\nspin analyzing hydrodynamical simulations without magnetic field effects.

Ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of asteroid\n(4) Vesta have suggested the presence of olivine on the surface. These\nobservations were reinforced by the discovery of olivine-rich HED meteorites\nfrom Vesta in recent years. However, analysis of data from NASA's Dawn\nspacecraft has shown that this olivine-bearing unit is actually impact melt in\nthe ejecta of Oppia crater.

The famous paradoxes of quantum\ntheory, the mysterious nature of measurements in quantum theory and the\nprincipal no-go theorems for hidden variables are first briefly reviewed. The\nKoopman-von Neumann Hilbert space theory based on complex wave functions\nunderlying particle trajectories in classical phase space, is an important step\nforward in that direction. It provides a clear and beautiful harmony of\nclassical waves and particles. Sudarshan has given an alternative but\nequivalent formulation that shows that classical mechanics can be regarded as a\nquantum theory with essentially hidden non-commuting variables. An extension of\nKvNS theory to classical electrodynamics provides a sound Hilbert space\nfoundation to it and satisfactorily accounts for entanglement and\nBell-CHSH-like violations already observed in classical polarization optics. An\nimportant new insight that has been obtained through these developments is that\nentanglement and Bell-like inequality violations are neither unique signatures\nof quantumness nor of non-locality---they are rather signatures of\nnon-separability. Finally, Sudarshan's proposed solution to the measurement\nproblem using KvNS theory for the measuring apparatus is sketched to show to\nwhat extent wave and particles can be harmonized in quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 07:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

The experimentally verified, much more\nhomogeneous, ground state of the stoichiometric CuMnO$_2$ is attributed to the\nreduced magnetoelastic competition between the counteracting magnetic-exchange\nand elastic-energy contributions. The comparison of the two systems\nadditionally highlights the role of disorder and allows an understanding of the\npuzzling phenomenon of phase separation in uniform antiferromagnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 08:36:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 12:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

While PBRS\nis proven to always preserve optimal policies, its effect on learning speed is\ndetermined by the quality of its potential function, which, in turn, depends on\nboth the underlying heuristic and the scale. Knowing which heuristic will prove\neffective requires testing the options beforehand, and determining the\nappropriate scale requires tuning, both of which introduce additional sample\ncomplexity. We formulate a PBRS framework that reduces learning speed, but does\nnot incur extra sample complexity. For this, we propose to simultaneously learn\nan ensemble of policies, shaped w.r.t. many heuristics and on a range of\nscales. The target policy is then obtained by voting. The ensemble needs to be\nable to efficiently and reliably learn off-policy: requirements fulfilled by\nthe recent Horde architecture, which we take as our basis.

We study the effects impurities on\nthis charge ordered phase via a single-band model in which bond order is the\nanalogue of charge order in the cuprates. Impurities are assumed to be\npointlike and are treated within the self-consistent t-matrix approximation\n(SCTMA). We show that suppression of bond order by impurities occurs through\nthe local disruption of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ form factor near individual\nimpurities. Unlike $d$-wave superconductors, where the sensitivity of $T_c$ to\nimpurities can be traced to a vanishing average of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order\nparameter over the Fermi surface, the response of bond order to impurities is\ndictated by a few Fermi surface \"hotspots\". The bond order transition\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ thus follows a different universal dependence on\nimpurity concentration $n_i$ than does the superconducting $T_c$. In\nparticular, $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ decreases more rapidly than $T_c$ with increasing\n$n_i$ when there is a nonzero Fermi surface curvature at the hotspots. Based on\nexperimental evidence that the pseudogap is insensitive to Zn doping, we\nconclude that a direct connection between charge order and the pseudogap is\nunlikely. Furthermore, the enhancement of stripe correlations in the La-based\ncuprates by Zn doping is evidence that this charge order is also distinct from\nstripes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 13:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

In the present work\nwe have investigated the possible use of Gorilla glass (produced by Corning), a\nchemical tempered glass that, thanks to its strength characteristics, would be\nideal. The un-tempered glass foils were curved by means of an innovative hot\nslumping technique and subsequently chemically tempered.

The\neffect of the overall shape changes in the final resolution performance of the\nglass mirrors was studied by simulating the glass foils integration with our\ninnovative approach based on glass reinforcing ribs.

In this problem, we are given a set of\n$n$ points in Euclidean space $R^d$, and the goal is to choose $k$ centers in\n$R^d$ so that the sum of squared distances of each point to its nearest center\nis minimized. The best approximation algorithms for this problem include a\npolynomial time constant factor approximation for general $k$ and a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation which runs in time $poly(n) 2^{O(k/\\epsilon)}$. At\nthe other extreme, the only known computational complexity result for this\nproblem is NP-hardness [ADHP'09]. The main difficulty in obtaining hardness\nresults stems from the Euclidean nature of the problem, and the fact that any\npoint in $R^d$ can be a potential center. This gap in understanding left open\nthe intriguing possibility that the problem might admit a PTAS for all $k,d$.\n  In this paper we provide the first hardness of approximation for the\nEuclidean $k$-means problem. Concretely, we show that there exists a constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$ such that it is NP-hard to approximate the $k$-means objective\nto within a factor of $(1+\\epsilon)$. We show this via an efficient reduction\nfrom the vertex cover problem on triangle-free graphs: given a triangle-free\ngraph, the goal is to choose the fewest number of vertices which are incident\non all the edges. Additionally, we give a proof that the current best hardness\nresults for vertex cover can be carried over to triangle-free graphs.

Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a\nbasic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not\nnecessarily true. We further propose to leverage the results of review-level\nsentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity\nlabelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework. Besides, the\nframework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and\nheuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity.\nExperimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our\nframework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89%, which is a\nsignificant improvement from current approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 14:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

Close inspection\nof the instantaneous Poynting vector reveals formation of optical vortices -\nlocalized areas of cyclic powerflow - at the metal-dielectric interface. As a\nresult, optical energy circulates through a subwavelength-thick 'conveyor belt'\nbetween the metal and dielectric where it creates a high density of optical\nstates (DOS), tight optical energy localization, and low group velocity\nassociated with SPP waves. The formation of bonding and anti-bonding SPP modes\nin metal-dielectric-metal waveguides can also be conveniently explained in\nterms of different spatial arrangements of localized powerflow vortices between\ntwo metal interfaces. Finally, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of\nglobal topological transitions in metamaterials composed of multiple metal and\ndielectric films, i.e., transitions of their iso-frequency surfaces from\nellipsoids to hyperboloids, which are not accompanied by the breaking of\nlattice symmetry. Our analysis reveals that such global topological transitions\nare governed by the dynamic local re-arrangement of local topological features\nof the optical interference field, such as vortices and saddle points, which\nreconfigures global optical powerflow within the metamaterial.

As in recent\nworks devoted to the study of (unsmoothed) subspace methods in the case where\n$M$ and $N$ are of the same order of magnitude, it is shown that it is still\npossible to derive improved DoA estimators termed as Generalized-MUSIC with\nspatial smoothing (G-MUSIC SS). The key ingredient of this work is a technical\nresult showing that the largest singular values and corresponding singular\nvectors of low rank deterministic perturbation of certain Gaussian block-Hankel\nlarge random matrices behave as if the entries of the latter random matrices\nwere independent identically distributed. This allows to conclude that when the\nnumber of sources and their DoA do not scale with $M,N,L,$ a situation\nmodelling widely spaced DoA scenarios, then both traditional and Generalized\nspatial smoothing subspace methods provide consistent DoA estimators whose\nconvergence speed is faster than $\\frac{1}{M}$. The case of DoA that are spaced\nof the order of a beamwidth, which models closely spaced sources, is also\nconsidered. It is shown that the convergence speed of G-MUSIC SS estimates is\nunchanged, but that it is no longer the case for MUSIC SS ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 18:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}
