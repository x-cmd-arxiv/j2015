The hypercomplex\nversion of the traditional Mexican hat potential associated with the $U(1)$\ngauge field theory, corresponds to a {\\it hybrid} potential with two real\ncomponents, and with $U(1)\\times SO(1,1)$ as symmetry group. Each component\ncorresponds to a deformation of the hat potential, with the appearance of a new\ndegenerate vacuum. Hypercomplex electrodynamics will show novel properties,\nsuch as the spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios with running masses for the\nvectorial and scalar Higgs fields, and the Aharonov-Bohm type strings defects\nas exact solutions; these topological defects may be detected only by quantum\ninterference of charged particles through gauge invariant loop integrals.

(2) Reduce reliance on untrusted computers.\n  In this paper we explore how to remove the mail system trust assumption in\ncode voting. We use PSMT protocols (SCN 2012) where with the help of visual\naids, humans can carry out $\\mod 10$ addition correctly with a 99\\% degree of\naccuracy. We introduce an unconditionally secure MIX based on the combinatorics\nof set systems.\n  Given that end users of our proposed voting scheme construction are humans we\n\\emph{cannot use} classical Secure Multi Party Computation protocols.\n  Our solutions are for both single and multi-seat elections achieving:\n\\begin{enumerate}[i)]\n  \\item An anonymous and perfectly secure communication network secure against\na $t$-bounded passive adversary used to deliver voting,\n  \\item The end step of the protocol can be handled by a human to evade the\nthreat of malware. \\end{enumerate} We do not focus on active adversaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2015 19:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

In\nsteady-state, the distribution of CO$_2$ in the groundwater upstream of the\naquifer involves a balance between three competing effects: (i) the\nbuoyancy-driven flow of CO$_2$ saturated water; (ii) the diffusion of CO$_2$\nfrom saturated to under-saturated water; and (iii) the advection associated\nwith the oncoming background flow. This leads to three limiting regimes. In the\nlimit of very slow diffusion, a nearly static intrusion of dense fluid may\nextend a finite distance upstream, balanced by the pressure gradient associated\nwith the oncoming background flow. In the limit of fast diffusion relative to\nthe flow, a gradient zone may become established in which the along aquifer\ndiffusive flux balances the advection associated with the background flow.\nHowever, if the buoyancy-driven flow speed exceeds the background hydrological\nflow speed, then a third, intermediate regime may become established. In this\nregime, a convective recirculation develops upstream of the anticline involving\nthe vertical diffusion of CO$_2$ from an upstream propagating flow of dense\nCO$_2$ saturated water into the downstream propagating flow of CO$_2$\nunsaturated water.

The Target of\nRapamycin (TOR) pathway is becoming increasingly recognized as a master\nregulator of cell size, however less is known how TOR activity might be coupled\nwith the cell cycle. Here, we establish that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes\ncytokinesis through activation of a Rho GTPase-Rho Kinase (ROCK) signaling\ncascade. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling by depletion of any of its\nnegative regulators: TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, or DEPTOR, induces polyploidy in a\nrapamycin-sensitive manner. mTORC1 hyperactivation-mediated polyploidization\noccurs by a prolonged, but ultimately failed attempt at abcission followed by\nre-fusion. Similar to the effects of ROCK2 overexpression, these mTORC1-driven\naberrant cytokinesis events are accompanied by increased Rho-GTP loading,\nextensive plasma membrane blebbing, and increased actin-myosin contractility,\nall of which can be rescued by either mTORC1 or ROCK inhibition.

What is remarkable\nabout nonequilibrium equalities is that they apply to rather general\nnonequilibrium situations beyond the linear response regime. However,\nnonequilibrium equalities are known to be inapplicable to some important\nsituations. In this thesis, we introduce a concept of absolute irreversibility\nas a new class of irreversibility that encompasses the entire range of those\nirreversible situations to which the conventional nonequilibrium equalities are\ninapplicable. In mathematical terms, absolute irreversibility corresponds to\nthe singular part of probability measure and can be separated from the ordinary\nirreversible part by Lebesgue's decomposition theorem in measure theory. This\ntheorem guarantees the uniqueness of the decomposition of probability measure\ninto singular and nonsingular parts, which enables us to give a well-defined\nmathematical and physical meaning to absolute irreversibility. Consequently, we\nderive a new type of nonequilibrium equalities in the presence of absolute\nirreversibility. Inequalities derived from our nonequilibrium equalities give\nstronger restrictions on the entropy production during nonequilibrium processes\nthan the conventional second-law like inequalities. Moreover, we present a new\nresolution of Gibbs' paradox from the viewpoint of absolute irreversibility.\nThis resolution applies to a classical mesoscopic regime, where two prevailing\nresolutions of Gibbs' paradox break down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 03:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

For in-plane spins, this Zeeman-like field, together with the\nintervalley hole-phonon scattering, opens an intervalley spin relaxation\nchannel, which is found to dominate the in-plane spin relaxation in bilayer\nWSe$_2$ even at low temperature. For out-of-plane spins, this Zeeman-like field\nis superimposed by the identical Hartree-Fock effective magnetic fields in the\ntwo valleys, and hence different total effective magnetic fields between two\nvalleys are obtained. Owing to the large difference of the total fields at\nlarge spin polarization, different out-of-plane spin relaxation times in the\ntwo valleys are obtained when the intervalley hole-phonon scattering is weak at\nlow temperature and low hole density. This difference in the spin relaxation\ntimes can be suppressed by enhancing the intervalley hole-phonon scattering\nthrough increasing temperature or hole density. Moreover, at large spin\npolarization and low temperature, due to the weak intravalley hole-phonon\nscattering but relatively strong hole-hole Coulomb scattering, the fast spin\nprecessions are found to result in a quasi hot-hole Fermi distribution\ncharacterized by an effective hot-hole temperature larger than the temperature,\nwhich also enhances the intervalley scattering. During this process, it is\ninteresting to discover that the initially equal hole densities in the two\nvalleys are broken in the temporal evolution, and a valley polarization is\nbuilt up. ....\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 05:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The most beneficial members should\ncontribute as much as possible, but such selection of orchard parents would\nreduce performance of the orchard progeny due to serious inbreeding. To avoid\ninbreeding, we should include a constraint on the numerator relationship matrix\nto keep a group coancestry under an appropriate threshold. Though an SDP\n(semidefinite programming) approach proposed by Pong-Wong and Woolliams gave an\naccurate optimal value, it required rather long computation time.\n  In this paper, we propose an SOCP (second-order cone programming) approach to\nreduce this computation time. We demonstrate that the same solution is attained\nby the SOCP formulation, but requires much less time. Since a simple SOCP\nformulation is not much more efficient compared to the SDP approach, we exploit\na sparsity structure of the numerator relationship matrix, and formulate the\nSOCP constraint using Henderson's algorithm.

Ground state\nproperties of finite nuclei can accurately be reproduced without neglecting\nexchange (Fock) contributions. Purpose: Finite-temperature RHFB (FT-RHFB)\ntheory has not yet been developed, leaving yet unknown its predictions for\nphase transitions and thermal excitations in both stable and weakly bound\nnuclei. Method: FT-RHFB equations are solved in a Dirac Woods-Saxon (DWS) basis\nconsidering two kinds of pairing interactions: finite or zero range. Such a\nmodel is appropriate for describing stable as well as loosely bound nuclei\nsince the basis states have correct asymptotic behaviour for large spatial\ndistributions. Results: Systematic FT-RH(F)B calculations are performed for\nseveral semi-magic isotopic/isotonic chains comparing the predictions of a\nlarge number of Lagrangians, among which are PKA1, PKO1 and DD-ME2. It is found\nthat the critical temperature for a pairing transition generally follows the\nrule $T_c = 0.60\\Delta(0)$ for a finite-range pairing force and $T_c =\n0.57\\Delta(0)$ for a contact pairing force, where $\\Delta(0)$ is the pairing\ngap at zero temperature. Two types of pairing persistence are analysed: type I\npairing persistence occurs in closed subshell nuclei while type II pairing\npersistence can occur in loosely bound nuclei strongly coupled to the continuum\nstates.

This paper presents a\ngeneral framework to study attacks on state estimation by adversaries capable\nof injecting bad-data into measurements and further, of jamming their\nreception. Through these two techniques, a novel `detectable jamming' attack is\ndesigned that changes the state estimation despite failing bad-data detection\nchecks. Compared to commonly studied `hidden' data attacks, these attacks have\nlower costs and a wider feasible operating region. It is shown that the entire\ndomain of jamming costs can be divided into two regions, with distinct\ngraph-cut based formulations for the design of the optimal attack. The most\nsignificant insight arising from this result is that the adversarial capability\nto jam measurements changes the optimal 'detectable jamming' attack design only\nif the jamming cost is less than half the cost of bad-data injection. A\npolynomial time approximate algorithm for attack vector construction is\ndeveloped and its efficacy in attack design is demonstrated through simulations\non IEEE test systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 10:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

On the one hand, the social\npressure exerted by peers favours the emergence of local consensus. On the\nother hand, the concurrent participation of agents to discussions on different\ntopics induces each agent to develop a coherent set of opinions across all the\ntopics in which he is active. Moreover, the pervasive action of external\nstimuli, such as mass media, pulls the entire population towards a specific\nconfiguration of opinions on different topics. Here we propose a model in which\nagents with interrelated opinions, interacting on several layers representing\ndifferent topics, tend to spread their own ideas to their neighbourhood, strive\nto maintain internal coherence, due to the fact that each agent identifies\nmeaningful relationships among its opinions on the different topics, and are at\nthe same time subject to external fields, resembling the pressure of mass\nmedia. We show that the presence of heterogeneity in the internal coupling\nassigned by agents to their different opinions allows to obtain states with\nmixed levels of consensus, still ensuring that all the agents attain a coherent\nset of opinions. Furthermore, we show that all the observed features of the\nmodel are preserved in the presence of thermal noise up to a critical\ntemperature, after which global consensus is no longer attainable. This\nsuggests the relevance of our results for real social systems, where noise is\ninevitably present in the form of information uncertainty and\nmisunderstandings. The model also demonstrates how mass media can be\neffectively used to favour the propagation of a chosen set of opinions, thus\npolarising the consensus of an entire population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 10:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 23:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

The quantum\ncritical points thus described are supposed to correspond to a very large value\nof the dynamic exponent ($ z\\rightarrow \\infty $). In our analysis, we find\nthat quantum fluctuations are enhanced due to the higher derivative corrections\nin the bulk which in turn increases the possibility of quantum phase transition\nnear the critical point.

For encryption, a\nlow-entropy, password-based key is used. Such a database may be subject to\nunauthorized access which can lead to the disclosure of all passwords by an\noffline brute-force attack. In this paper, we present PALPAS, a secure and\nuser-friendly tool that synchronizes passwords between user devices without\nstoring information about them centrally. The idea of PALPAS is to generate a\npassword from a high entropy secret shared by all devices and a random salt\nvalue for each service. Only the salt values are stored on a server but not the\nsecret. The salt enables the user devices to generate the same password but is\nstatistically independent of the password. In order for PALPAS to generate\npasswords according to different password policies, we also present a mechanism\nthat automatically retrieves and processes the password requirements of\nservices. PALPAS users need to only memorize a single password and the setup of\nPALPAS on a further device demands only a one-time transfer of few static data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 11:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The\nquality of such approaches depends substantially on the selection of the data\nthat is kept. Optimising this data in the domain and codomain gives rise to\nchallenging mathematical problems that shall be addressed in our work.\n  In the 1D case, we prove results that provide insights into the difficulty of\nthis problem, and we give evidence that a splitting into spatial and tonal\n(i.e. function value) optimisation does hardly deteriorate the results.

Since the LCM is independent of distance estimates\nor dark matter halo densities, it is the first model of its kind which\nconstrains luminous matter modeling directly from the observed spectral shifts\nof characteristic photon emission/absorption lines. In this paper we present\nthe LCM solution to a diverse sample of twenty-five (25) galaxies of varying\nmorphologies and sizes. For the chosen sample, it is shown that the LCM is more\naccurate than either Modified Newtonian Dynamics or dark matter models and\nreturns physically reasonable mass to light ratios and exponential scale\nlengths. Unlike either Modified Newtonian Dynamics or dark matter models, the\nLCM predicts something which is directly falsifiable through improvements in\nour observational capacity, the luminous mass profile. The question, while\ninteresting, of if the LCM constrains the relation of the baryonic to dark\nmatter is beyond the scope of the current work.\n  The focus of this paper is to show that it is possible to describe a broad\nand diverse spectrum of galaxies efficiently with the LCM formula. Moreover,\nsince the LCM free parameter predicts the ratio of the Milky Way galaxy\nbaryonic mass density to that of the galaxy emitting the photon, if the Milky\nWay mass models can be trusted at face values, we then show that the LCM\nbecomes a zero parameter model.\n  This paper substantially expands the results in arXiv:1309.7370 and\narXiv:1407:7583.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 13:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The physical torque must\nconsider the presence of the pulsar magnetosphere. Among various efforts, the\nwind braking model can explain many observations of pulsars and magnetars in a\nunified way. It is also consistent with the up-to-date observations. It is time\nfor a paradigm shift in pulsar studies: from magnetic dipole braking to wind\nbraking. As one alternative to the magnetospheric model, the fallback disk\nmodel is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 14:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 04:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-14"}

The proposed\nhigh order Nystr\\\"{o}m VIE method is shown to have high accuracy and\ndemonstrates $p$-convergence for computing the electromagnetic scattering of\ncubes in $R^3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 14:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

The recent interest concerns the high temperature\nsuperconductivity and its intimate reason in the monolayer FeSe thin films. The\nchallenge here is how the double superconducting gaps seen by the scanning\ntunnelling spectroscopy (STS) associate however to only one set of Fermi\npockets seen by the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The\nrecently discovered (Li1-xFexOH)FeSe phase with Tc=40 K provides a good\nplatform to check the fundamental problems. Here we report the STS study on the\n(Li1-xFexOH)FeSe single crystals. The STS spectrum clearly indicates the\npresence of double anisotropic gaps with maximum magnitudes of Delta_1=14.3 meV\nand Delta_2=8.6 meV, and mimics that of the monolayer FeSe thin film. Further\nanalysis based on the quasiparticle interference (QPI) allows us to rule out\nthe d-wave gap, and for the first time assign the larger (smaller) gap to the\nouter (inner) hybridized Fermi pockets associating with the dxy (dxz/dyz)\norbitals, respectively.
