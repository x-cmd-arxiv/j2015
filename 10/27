We explore the space of the parameters to constrain the distribution\nof the heat pulses, their duration and their spatial size, and, as a feedback\non the data, their signatures on the light curves. From both methods the best\nagreement is obtained for a relatively large population of events (1000) with a\nshort duration (less than 1 min) and a relatively shallow distribution (power\nlaw with index 1.5) in a limited energy range (1.5 decades).

These properties may fail in\nsemi-infinite linear programming where the constraint vector space is infinite\ndimensional. Unlike the finite-dimensional case, in semi-infinite linear\nprograms the constraint vector space is a modeling choice. We show that, for a\nsufficiently restricted vector space, both (SD) and (DP) always hold, at the\ncost of restricting the perturbations to that space.

Reversely, the extraction of $G_A$ from the\nneutrino nucleus cross section suffers from large systematic errors due to\nnuclear model dependencies, while the use of single parameter dipole fits\nunderestimates the errors and prevents an identification of the relevant\nkinematics for this determination. We propose to use a generalized\naxial-vector-meson-dominance (AVMD) in conjunction with large-$N_c$ and high\nenergy QCD constrains to model the nucleon axial form factor, as well as the\nhalf width rule as an a priori uncertainty estimate. The minimal hadronic\nansatz comprises the sum of two monopoles corresponding to the lightest\naxial-vector mesons being coupled to the axial current. The parameters of the\nresulting axial form factor are the masses and widths of the two axial mesons\nas obtained from the averaged PDG values. By applying the half width rule in a\nMonte Carlo simulation, a distribution of theoretical predictions can then be\ngenerated for the neutrino-nucleus quasielastic cross section. We test the\nmodel by applying it to the $(\\nu_\\mu,\\mu)$ quasielastic cross section from\n$^{12}$C for the kinematics of the MiniBooNE experiment. The resulting\npredictions have no free parameters. We find that the relativistic Fermi gas\nmodel globally reproduces the experimental data, giving $\\chi^2/ \\# bins =\n0.81$. A $Q^2$-dependent error analysis of the neutrino data shows that the\nuncertainties in the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ are comparable to the ones\ninduced by the a priori half width rule.

The algebraic path properties can model dataflow\nanalysis problems, the shortest path problem, and many other natural problems\nthat arise in program analysis. We consider that each component of the\nconcurrent system is a graph with constant treewidth, a property satisfied by\nthe controlflow graphs of most programs. We allow for multiple possible\nqueries, which arise naturally in demand driven dataflow analysis. The study of\nmultiple queries allows us to consider the tradeoff between the resource usage\nof the one-time preprocessing and for each individual query. The traditional\napproach constructs the product graph of all components and applies the\nbest-known graph algorithm on the product. In this approach, even the answer to\na single query requires the transitive closure, which provides no room for\ntradeoff between preprocessing and query time.\n  Our main contributions are algorithms that significantly improve the\nworst-case running time of the traditional approach, and provide various\ntradeoffs depending on the number of queries. For example, in a concurrent\nsystem of two components, the traditional approach requires hexic time in the\nworst case for answering one query as well as computing the transitive closure,\nwhereas we show that with one-time preprocessing in almost cubic time, each\nsubsequent query can be answered in at most linear time, and even the\ntransitive closure can be computed in almost quartic time.

One of the main\nlimitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like\ndistribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\\it\ninstance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical\ntemperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be\npossible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling.

Yet other studies have\nascribed this feature to impurity phases, sample vacancies, and surface\nreconstructions. Given the typical methods used to prepare SmB6 single\ncrystals, the flux and floating zone procedures, these ascriptions should not\nbe taken lightly. Here, we demonstrate how compositional variations and\nobservable amounts of impurity phases in SmB6 crystals grown by floating zone\nand flux affect the physical properties.

A large,\nnearly stoichiometric crystal of SmB6 was successfully grown using the\nfloat-zone technique; upon continuing the zone melting, samarium vacancies are\nintroduced. These samarium vacancies drastically alter the resistance and\nplateauing magnitude of the low temperature resistance compared to\nstoichiometric SmB6. These results highlight that small presences of impurity\nphases and compositional variations must be considered when collecting and\nanalyzing physical property data of SmB6.

We present new\nsingle-dish GBT neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of 30 compact groups and\ndefine a new way to quantify the group HI content as the HI-to-stellar mass\nratio of the group as a whole. We compare the HI content with mid-IR indicators\nof star formation and optical [g-r] color to search for correlations between\ngroup gas content and star formation activity of individual group members.\nQuiescent galaxies tend to live in HI-poor groups, and galaxies with active\nstar formation are more commonly found in HI-rich groups. Intriguingly, we also\nfind \"rogue\" galaxies whose star formation does not correlate with group HI\ncontent. In particular, we identify three galaxies (NGC 2968 in RSCG 34, KUG\n1131+202A in RSCG 42, and NGC 4613 in RSCG 64) whose mid-IR activity is\ndiscrepant with the HI. We speculate that this mismatch between mid-IR activity\nand HI content is a consequence of strong interactions in this environment that\ncan strip HI from galaxies and abruptly affect star-formation.

A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 20:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

This\ndramatic environmental effect is generally not taken into account in the SFHs\nusually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of these\ngalaxies, yielding to a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, a\nbiased estimate of the SFR. We aim at reproducing the SFH of galaxies that\nunderwent a rapid star formation quenching using a truncated delayed SFH that\nwe implemented in the SED fitting code CIGALE. We show that the ratio between\nthe instantaneous SFR and the SFR just before the quenching ($r_{SFR}$) is well\nconstrained as long as rest frame UV data are available. This SED modelling is\napplied to the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) containing isolated galaxies and\nsources falling in the dense environment of the Virgo cluster. The latter are\nHI-deficient due to ram pressure stripping. We show that the truncated delayed\nSFH successfully reproduces their SED while typical SFH assumptions fail. A\ngood correlation is found between $r_{SFR}$ and HI-def, the parameter\nquantifying the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that SED fitting\nresults can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency of\ngalaxies for which HI observations are not available. The HRS galaxies are\nplaced on the SFR-$M_*$ diagram showing that the HI-deficient sources lie in\nthe quiescent region confirming previous studies.

Our\nsimulated galaxies are not in the ideal state assumed in Toomre instability, of\nlinear fluctuations in an isolated, uniform, rotating disk. There, instability\nis characterised by a $Q$ parameter below unity, and lower when the disk is\nthick. Instead, the high-redshift discs are highly perturbed. Over long periods\nthey consist of non-linear perturbations, compact massive clumps and extended\nstructures, with new clumps forming in inter-clump regions. This is while the\ngalaxy is subject to frequent external perturbances. We compute the local,\ntwo-component $Q$ parameter for gas and stars, smoothed on a $\\sim1~{\\rm kpc}$\nscale to capture clumps of $10^{8-9}~{\\rm M}_\\odot$. The $Q<1$ regions are\nconfined to collapsed clumps due to the high surface density there, while the\ninter-clump regions show $Q$ significantly higher than unity. Tracing the\nclumps back to their relatively smooth Lagrangian patches, we find that $Q$\nprior to clump formation typically ranges from unity to a few. This is unlike\nthe expectations from standard Toomre instability. We discuss possible\nmechanisms for high-$Q$ clump formation, e.g. rapid turbulence decay leading to\nsmall clumps that grow by mergers, non-axisymmetric instability, or clump\nformation induced by non-linear perturbations in the disk. Alternatively, the\nhigh-$Q$ non-linear VDI may be stimulated by the external perturbations such as\nmergers and counter-rotating streams.

In appropriately\nscaled units, interactions are characterized entirely by a screening parameter,\n$\\kappa$. As a result, systems of similar $\\kappa$ show the same dynamics,\nregardless of the underlying parameters (e.g., density and temperature). We\ndemonstrate this behavior using ultracold neutral plasmas (UNP) created by\nphotoionizing a cold ($T\\le10$ mK) gas. The ions in UNP systems are well\ndescribed by the Yukawa model, with the electrons providing the screening.\nCreation of the plasma through photoionization can be thought of as a rapid\nquench from $\\kappa_{0}=\\infty$ to a final $\\kappa$ value set by the electron\ndensity and temperature.

While there have existed quite a few approaches to phase\nretrieval, recent developments in compressed sensing and convex\noptimization-based signal recovery have inspired a host of new ones. This work\npresents an overview of these approaches.\n  Since phase retrieval, by its very nature, is ill-posed, to make the problem\nmeaningful one needs to either assume prior structure on the signal (e.g.,\nsparsity) or obtain additional measurements (e.g., masks, structured\nilluminations). For both the cases, we review conditions for the\nidentifiability of the signal, as well as practical algorithms for signal\nrecovery.

Both moons are embedded in an arc of dust particles.\nTo understand the amount of micron-sized dust and their spatial distribution in\nthese arcs, we model the source, dynamical evolution, and sinks of these dust\nin the arc. We assume hypervelocity impacts of micrometeoroids on the moons as\nsource of these dust (Hedman et al., 2009), the so called impact-ejecta process\n(Krivov et al., 2003; Spahn et al., 2006). After ejecting and escaping from the\nmoons, these micron-sized particles are subject to several perturbing forces,\nincluding gravitational perturbation from Mimas, oblateness of Saturn, Lorentz\nforce, solar radiation pressure, and plasma drag. Particles can be either\nconfined in the arcs due to corotational resonance with Mimas, as their source\nmoons (Spitale et al., 2006; Cooper et al., 2008; Hedman et al., 2009), or\npushed outward by plasma drag. Particle sinks are recollisions with the source\nmoon, collision with other moons, or migrate out of the radial zone of\ninterest. In addition to that, the upper limit of the particle lifetimes are\ncontrolled by plasma sputtering, which decreases the particle size in a rate of\norder 1$\\mu$m radius every 100 years (Johnson et al., 2008).

On the other hand, large particles can stay in arcs for longer\ntime and therefore are more likely to collide with the source moon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 23:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

We take\nthe advantage of the high accuracy and ${\\cal O}(N)$ computational complexity\nof our multiscale FRI method to investigate the flexibility of large ribosomal\nsubunits, which is difficult to analyze by alternative approaches. An\nanisotropic FRI approach, which involves localized Hessian matrices, is\nutilized to study the translocation dynamics in an RNA polymerase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 23:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

That observation is often taken to mean that thinning\nMCMC output cannot improve statistical efficiency. Here we suppose that it\ncosts one unit of time to advance a Markov chain and then $\\theta>0$ units of\ntime to compute a sampled quantity of interest. For a thinned process, that\ncost $\\theta$ is incurred less often, so it can be advanced through more\nstages.

The ringlet\nis mainly composed of micron-sized particles (Showalter, 1991, Hedman et al.,\n2011), implying that these particles may be significantly perturbed by\nnon-gravitational forces, which can limit their lifetimes. We establish a\nkinetic model considering the birth, evolution, and death of dust in the Encke\ncentral ringlet allowing to evaluate the ringlet optical depth. First, we\ninvestigate the generation of dust by micrometeorite impacts (the\n`impact-ejecta' process) on putative, yet undetected embedded moonlets. Taking\ninto account the orbital evolution under the influence of the relevant\nperturbation forces, the dominant loss mechanisms are collisions with ring\nparticles in the gap edges, the putative moonlets in the gap, or erosion by\nsputtering in Saturn's plasma environment. However, our results show that this\nimpact-ejecta process alone can only sustain a ringlet of optical depth 3-4\norders of magnitude smaller than the observed values. Consequently, other\nprocesses must be taken into account. For example, mutual collisions among\nputative moonlets should produce dust at about the same rate, while further\ndisruption of ejecta, as proposed by Dikarev (1999), should increase the total\namount of particles.

In contrast, the force induced by cosmic\ndispiration could affect both the direction and magnitude of the spin current.\nAs a consequence, the spin-Hall conductivity doesn't receive corrections from\nscrew dislocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 01:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-27"}

To this\nend, Mahlmann and Schindelhauer introduced the random \"flip\" transformation,\nwhere in each time step, a random pair of vertices that have an edge decide to\n`swap a neighbor'. They conjectured that performing $O(n d)$ such flips at\nrandom would convert any connected $d$-regular graph into a $d$-regular\nexpander graph, with high probability. However, the best known upper bound for\nthe number of steps is roughly $O(n^{17} d^{23})$, obtained via a delicate\nMarkov chain comparison argument.\n  Our main result is to prove that a natural instantiation of the random flip\nproduces an expander in at most $O(n^2 d^2 \\sqrt{\\log n})$ steps, with high\nprobability. Our argument uses a potential-function analysis based on the\nmatrix exponential, together with the recent beautiful results on the\nhigher-order Cheeger inequality of graphs.

Distinct from the classical tests is the use of\nquantum wave packets and their expected large spatial separation in the QTEST\nexperiment. This dual species atom interferometer experiment will also be\nsensitive to time-dependent equivalence principle violations that would be\nsignatures for ultralight dark-matter particles. In addition, QTEST will be\nable to perform photon recoil measurements to better than 10$^{-11}$ precision.\nThis improves upon terrestrial experiments by a factor of 100, enabling an\naccurate test of the standard model of particle physics and contributing to\nmass measurement, in the proposed new international system of units (SI), with\nsignificantly improved precision. The predicted high measurement precision of\nQTEST comes from the microgravity environment on ISS, offering extended free\nfall times in a well-controlled environment. Suppression of systematic errors\nby use of symmetric interferometer configurations and rejection of common-mode\nerrors drives the QTEST design.

Its deterministic Boolean network model predicts that\ntwo parallel pathways with comparable magnitudes of attractive basins should\nexist after the protein p53 is activated when a cell becomes harmfully\ndisturbed.

It further avoids the need for individual\ngalaxy inclination measurements.\n  To quantify the properties of stacked HI emission lines, we consider a\nsimplistic model of galactic disks with analytically expressible line profiles.\nUsing this model, we compare the widths of stacked profiles with those of\nindividual galaxies. We then follow the same procedure using more realistic\nmock galaxies drawn from the S3-SAX model (a derivative of the Millennium\nsimulation). Remarkably, when stacking the apparent HI lines of galaxies with\nsimilar absolute magnitude and random inclinations, the width of the stack is\nvery similar to the width of the deprojected (= corrected for inclination) and\ndedispersed (= after removal of velocity dispersion) input lines. Therefore,\nthe ratio between the widths of the stack and the deprojected/dedispersed input\nlines is approximately constant - about 0.93 - with very little dependence on\nthe gas dispersion, galaxy mass, galaxy morphology, and shape of the rotation\ncurve.\n  Finally, we apply our technique to construct a stacked TFR using HIPASS data\nwhich already has a well defined TFR based on individual detections.

Simple arguments suggest that a scenario of supernova\nremnants (SNRs) in the Milky Way as the dominant sources for the cosmic ray\npopulation below the knee could work: in a generic calculation, it can be shown\nthat these objects can provide the energy budget necessary to explain the\nobserved flux of cosmic rays. However, this argument is based on the assumption\nthat all sources behave in the same way, i.e.\\ they all have the same energy\nbudget, spectral behavior and maximum energy. In this paper, we investigate if\na realistic population of SNRs is capable of producing the cosmic ray flux as\nit is observed below the knee. We use 21 SNRs that are well-studied from radio\nwavelengths up to gamma-ray energies. It could be shown previously (Mandelartz\n& Becker Tjus 2015) that the high-energy bump in the energy spectrum of these\n21 sources can be dominated by hadronic emission. Here, gamma-rays are produced\nvia $\\pi^{0}-$decays from cosmic ray interactions in molecular clouds near the\nsupernova remnant, which serves as the cosmic ray accelerator. The cosmic ray\nspectra show a large variety in their energy budget, spectral behavior and\nmaximum energy. These sources are assumed to be representative for the total\nclass of SNRs, where we assume that about 100 - 200 cosmic ray emitting SNRs\nshould be present today. Finally, we use these source spectra to simulate the\ncosmic ray transport from individual SNRs in the Galaxy with the GALPROP code\nfor cosmic ray propagation. We find that the cosmic ray budget can be matched\nwell for a diffusion coefficient that is close to $D\\propto E^{0.3}$. A\nstronger dependence on the energy, e.g. $E^{0.5}$, would lead to a spectrum at\nEarth that is too steep when compared to what is detected and the energy budget\ncannot be matched, in particular toward high energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 08:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

The tests are made by counting the number of groups\n$R_B$ above a variable cut-off threshold of observed total whole-spot area\n(uncorrected for foreshortening) to simulate what a lower acuity observer would\nhave seen. The synthesised annual means of $R_B$ are then re-scaled to the\nobserved RGO group number $R_A$ using a variety of regression techniques.

In\ngenerating the backbone sunspot number, Svalgaard and Schatten [2015] force\nregression fits to pass through the scatter plot origin which generates\nunreliable fits (the residuals do not form a normal distribution) and causes\nsunspot cycle amplitudes to be exaggerated in the intercalibrated data. It is\ndemonstrated that the use of Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots to test for a normal\ndistribution is a useful indicator of erroneous and misleading regression fits.\nOrdinary least squares linear fits, not forced to pass through the origin, are\nsometimes reliable (although the optimum method used is shown to be different\nwhen matching peak and average sunspot group numbers). However other fits are\nonly reliable if non-linear regression is used. From these results it is\nentirely possible that the inflation of solar cycle amplitudes in the backbone\ngroup sunspot number as one goes back in time, relative to related\nsolar-terrestrial parameters, is entirely caused by the use of inappropriate\nand non-robust regression techniques to calibrate the sunspot data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 08:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 10:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 22:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The recently proposed CAR\n(Cannistrai-Alanis-Ravai) index shows the power of local link/triangle\ninformation in improving link-prediction accuracy. With the information of\nlevel-2 links, which are links between common-neighbors, most classical\nsimilarity indices can be improved. Nevertheless, calculating the number of\nlevel-2 links makes CAR index not efficient enough. Inspired by the idea of\nemploying local link/triangle information, we propose a new similarity index\nwith more local structure information. In our method, local link/triangle\nstructure information can be conveyed by clustering coefficient of common\nneighbors directly. The reason why clustering coefficient has good\neffectiveness in estimating the contribution of a common-neighbor is because\nthat it employs links existing between neighbors of the common-neighbor and\nthese links have the same structural position with the candidate link to this\ncommon-neighbor. Ten real-world networks drawn from five various fields are\nused to test the performance of our method against to classical similarity\nindices and recently proposed CAR index. Two estimators: precision and AUP, are\nused to evaluate the accuracy of link prediction algorithms. Generally\nspeaking, our new index only performs competitively with CAR, but it is a good\ncomplement to CAR for networks with not very high LCP-corr, which is a measure\nto estimate the correlation between number of common-neighbors and number of\nlinks between common-neighbors.

Indeed, when one is working with smooth\nmaps instead of Lipschitz maps and trying to solve a rough differential\nequation, one loses the quantitative estimates controlling the convergence of\nthe Picard sequence. Moreover, even with a definition of rough paths in smooth\nmanifolds, ordinary and rough differential equations can only be solved locally\nin such case. In this paper, we first recall the foundations of the Lipschitz\ngeometry, introduced in \"Rough Paths on Manifolds\" (Cass, T., Litterer, C. &\nLyons, T.), along with the main findings that encompass the classical theory of\nrough paths in Banach spaces. Then we give what we believe to be a minimal\nframework for defining rough paths on a manifold that is both less rigid than\nthe classical one and emphasized on the local behaviour of rough paths.

An isomeric state and a state beyond the second\nbarrier peak are excited by means of instantaneous as well as temporally\nextended gauge boosts with quadrupole shapes. The subsequent deexcitation is\nstudied in a time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulation, with emphasis on fissioned\nfinal states. The corresponding fission fragment mass numbers are studied.\n  Results: In general, the energy deposited by the quadrupole boost is quickly\nabsorbed by the nucleus. In instantaneous boosts, this leads to fast shape\nrearrangements and violent dynamics that can ultimately lead to fission. This\nis a qualitatively different process than the deformation-induced fission.\nBoosts induced within a finite time window excite the system in a relatively\ngentler way, and do induce fission but with a smaller energy deposition.\n  Conclusions: The fission products obtained using boost-induced fission in\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock are more asymmetric than the fragments obtained in\ndeformation-induced fission, or the corresponding adiabatic approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 10:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 14:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

The goal of this paper is to present a new\napproach for microarray datasets merging, based upon explicit modeling of\ninterstudy variability and gene variability. We develop and demonstrate a new\nalgorithm for microarray datasets merging. The underlying model assumes\nnormally distributed intrinsic gene expressions, distorted by a study-dependent\nnonlinear transformation, and study dependent (normally distributed)\nobservation noise. The algorithm addresses both parameter estimation (the\nparameters being gene expression means and variances, observation noise\nvariances and the nonlinear transformations) and data adjustment, and yields as\na result adjusted datasets suitable for aggregation. The method is validated on\ntwo case studies. The first one concerns E. Coli expression data, artificially\ndistorted by given nonlinear transformations and additive observation noise.\nThe proposed method is able to correct for the distortion, and yields adjusted\ndatasets from which the relevant biological effects can be recovered, as shown\nby a standard differential analysis. The second case study concerns the\naggregation of two real prostate cancer datasets. After adjustment using the\nproposed algorithm, a differential analysis performed on adjusted datasets\nyields a larger number of differentially expressed genes (between control and\ntumor data). The proposed method has been implemented using the statistical\nsoftware R 1, and Bioconductor packages 2. The source code (valid for merging\ntwo datasets), as well as the datasets used for the validation, and some\ncomplementary results, are made available on the web site\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 10:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

However, there are disadvantages to using any of the\ngoods as money, and in addition fiat money issued in the form of notes or coins\nwill be valueless in the final time period, and hence in all earlier periods.\nAlso, Walrasian market prices are determined only up to an arbitrary rescaling.\nNevertheless we show that it is possible to devise a system which uses money to\nexchange goods and in which money has a determinate positive value. In this\nsystem, tokens are initially supplied to all traders by a central authority and\nrecovered by a purchase tax. All trades must be made using tokens or promissory\nnotes for tokens. This mechanism controls the flow rather than the stock of\nmoney: it introduces some trading frictions, some redistribution of wealth, and\nsome distortion of prices, but these effects can all be made small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 12:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 12:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

Motivated by the recent\nlearning-based PCG framework and other existing PCG works, we propose an\nalternative approach to online content generation and adaptation in Super Mario\nBros (SMB). Unlike most of existing works in SMB, our approach exploits the\nsynergy between rule-based and learning-based methods to produce constructive\nprimitives, quality yet controllable game segments in SMB. As a result, a\ncomplete quality game level can be generated online by integrating relevant\nconstructive primitives via controllable parameters regarding geometrical\nfeatures and procedure-level properties. Also the adaptive content can be\ngenerated in real time by dynamically selecting proper constructive primitives\nvia an adaptation criterion, e.g., dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). Our\napproach is of several favorable properties in terms of content quality\nassurance, generation efficiency and controllability.

Contrary to the previous studies in covariant density functional\ntheory, it was found that the impact of $N=172$ spherical shell gap on the\nstructure of superheavy elements is very limited. Similar to non-relativistic\nfunctionals some covariant functionals predict the important role played by the\nspherical $N=184$ gap. For these functionals (NL3*, DD-ME2 and PC-PK1), there\nis a band of spherical nuclei along and near the $Z=120$ and $N=184$ lines.\nHowever, for other functionals (DD-PC1 and DD-ME$\\delta$) oblate shapes\ndominate at and in the vicinity of these lines. Available experimental data are\nin general described with comparable accuracy and do not allow to discriminate\nthese predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 14:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

In the presence of the wormhole dual to the\nthermofield double state of two CFTs, the existence of bulk gauge fields is in\nsome tension with the microscopic tensor factorization of the Hilbert space. I\nexplain how this tension can be resolved by splitting the gauge field into\ncharged constituents, and I argue that this leads to a new argument for the\n\"principle of completeness\", which states that the charge lattice of a gauge\ntheory coupled to gravity must be fully populated. I also claim that it leads\nto a new motivation for (and a clarification of) the \"weak gravity conjecture\",\nwhich I interpret as a strengthening of this principle. This setup gives a\nsimple example of a situation where describing low-energy bulk physics in CFT\nlanguage requires knowledge of high-energy bulk physics. This contradicts to\nsome extent the notion of \"effective conformal field theory\", but in fact is an\nexpected feature of the resolution of the black hole information problem.

This paper considers\nthe co-channel deployment of a macrocell overlaid with small cells. The small\ncell base stations (SBSs) harvest energy from environmental sources whereas the\nmacrocell base station (MBS) uses conventional power supply. Given a stochastic\nenergy arrival process for the SBSs, we derive a power control policy for the\ndownlink transmission of both MBS and SBSs such that they can achieve their\nobjectives (e.g., maintain the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nat an acceptable level) on a given transmission channel. We consider a\ncentralized energy harvesting mechanism for SBSs, i.e., there is a central\nenergy storage (CES) where energy is harvested and then distributed to the\nSBSs. When the number of SBSs is small, the game between the CES and the MBS is\nmodeled as a single-controller stochastic game and the equilibrium policies are\nobtained as a solution of a quadratic programming problem. However, when the\nnumber of SBSs tends to infinity (i.e., a highly dense network), the\ncentralized scheme becomes infeasible, and therefore, we use a mean field\nstochastic game to obtain a distributed power control policy for each SBS. By\nsolving a system of partial differential equations, we derive the power control\npolicy of SBSs given the knowledge of mean field distribution and the available\nharvested energy levels in the batteries of the SBSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 15:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The idea is to ascertain whether fD should\nrepresent a better model than fA, specifically, for the well-known IRMS\nevaluation.\n  The study clarifies that fA and fD should really represent different\nmodel-families. For example, the possible variation, eA, of an absolute\nestimate as the yA (and/ or the risk of running a machine on the basis of the\nmeasurement-model fA) should be dictated by the possible\nRi-measurement-variations (u_S and u_W) only: eA = (u_S + u_W); i.e., at worst:\neA = 2ui. However, the variation, eD, of the corresponding differential (i.e.\nYD) estimate yd should largely be decided by SRi and WRi values: ed = 2(|m_i |x\nu_i) = (|m_i | x eA); with: mi = (SRi/[SRi - WRi]).\n  Thus, any IRMS measurement (i.e. for which |SRi - WRi| is nearly zero is a\nrequirement) should signify that |mi| tends to infinity. Clearly, yD should be\nless accurate than yA, and/ or even turn out to be highly erroneous (eD tends\nto infinity). Nevertheless, the evaluation as the absolute yA, and hence as the\nsample isotopic ratio Sri, is shown to be equivalent to our previously reported\nfinding that the conversion of a D-estimate (here, yD) into Sri should help to\nimprove the achievable output-accuracy and -comparability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 10:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

A novel treatment\nmethod such as antiviral drug is highly necessary for coping with the dengue\ndisease. Envelope protein is one of the non-structural proteins of DENV, which\nengaged in the viral fusion process.

The screening of 3,883 cyclic peptides, each of\nthem connected by prolin-prolin bond, through molecular docking resulted in\nfive best ligands. The pharmacological and toxicity character of these five\nligands were analised in silico. The result showed that PYRRP was the best\nligand.

Hence, existing influenza drugs could not cope with H1N1 infection\ndue to the high mutation rate of the virus. In this respect, new method to\nblock the virus was devised. The polymerase PAC-PB1N enzyme is responsible for\nthe replication of H1N1 virus. Thus, novel inhibitors were developed to ward\noff the functionality of the enzyme. In this research, cyclic peptides has been\nchosen to inhibit PAC-PB1N due to its proven stability in reaching the drug\ntarget. Thus, computational method for elucidating the molecular interaction\nbetween cyclic peptides and PAC-PB1N has been developed by using the LigX tools\nfrom MOE 2008.10 software. The tools could render the bindings that involved in\nthe interactions. The interactions between individual amino acid in the\ninhibitor and enzyme could be seen as well. Thus, the peptide sequences of\nCKTTC and CKKTC were chosen as the lead compounds. In this end, the feasibility\nof cyclic peptides to act as drug candidate for H1N1 could be exposed by the 2d\nand 3d modeling of the molecular interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 03:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
