We apply\nour formalism to the radial structure of magnetized accretion disks threaded by\na poloidal magnetic field dragged during the process of star formation\ndeveloped by Shu and coworkers. We consider disks around low mass protostars, T\nTauri, and FU Orionis stars. We consider two levels of disk magnetization,\n$\\lambda_{sys} = 4$ (strongly magnetized disks), and $\\lambda_{sys} = 12$\n(weakly magnetized disks). The rotation rates of strongly magnetized disks have\nlarge deviations from Keplerian rotation. In these models, resistive heating\ndominates the thermal structure for the FU Ori disk. The T Tauri disk is very\nthin and cold because it is strongly compressed by magnetic pressure; it may be\ntoo thin compared with observations. Instead, in the weakly magnetized disks,\nrotation velocities are close to Keplerian, and resistive heating is always\nless than 7\\% of the viscous heating. In these models, the T Tauri disk has a\nlarger aspect ratio, consistent with that inferred from observations. All the\ndisks have spatially extended hot atmospheres where the irradiation flux is\nabsorbed, although most of the mass ($\\sim 90-95$ \\%) is in the disk midplane.\nWith the advent of ALMA one expects direct measurements of magnetic fields and\ntheir morphology at disk scales. It will then be possible to determine the\nmass-to-flux ratio of magnetized accretion disks around young stars, an\nessential parameter for their structure and evolution. Our models contribute to\nthe understanding of the vertical structure and emission of these disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 17:09:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

In our model the axial form factors\nG_A(Q^2) (axial-vector form factor) and G_P(Q^2) (induced pseudoscalar form\nfactor), are calculated based on the constituent quark axial form factors and\nthe octet baryon wave functions. The quark axial current is parametrized by the\ntwo constituent quark form factors, the axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2),\nand the induced pseudoscalar form factor g_P^q(Q^2). The baryon wave functions\nare composed of a dominant S-state and a P-state mixture for the relative\nangular momentum of the quarks. First, we study in detail the nucleon case. We\nassume that the quark axial-vector form factor g_A^q(Q^2) has the same function\nform as that of the quark electromagnetic isovector form factor. The remaining\nparameters of the model, the P-state mixture and the Q^2-dependence of\ng_P^q(Q^2), are determined by a fit to the nucleon axial form factor data\nobtained by lattice QCD simulations with large pion masses.

There are standard approaches to marginal\nmodelling, but long- and short-range dependence of extremes may both appear. In\napplications, an assumption of long-range independence often seems reasonable,\nbut short-range dependence, i.e., the clustering of extremes, needs attention.\nThe extremal index $0<\\theta\\le 1$ is a natural limiting measure of clustering,\nbut for wide classes of dependent processes, including all stationary Gaussian\nprocesses, it cannot distinguish dependent processes from independent processes\nwith $\\theta=1$.

In these models, memories\nare stored in the plastic recurrent connections of neural populations in the\nform of \"attractor states\". The maximal information capacity for conventional\nabstract attractor networks with unconstrained connections is 2 bits/synapse.\nHowever, an unconstrained synapse has the capacity to store infinite amount of\nbits in a noiseless theoretical scenario: a capacity that conventional\nattractor networks cannot achieve. Here, I propose a hierarchical attractor\nnetwork that can achieve an ultra high information capacity. The network has\ntwo layers: a visible layer with $N_v$ neurons, and a hidden layer with $N_h$\nneurons. The visible-to-hidden connections are set at random and kept fixed\nduring the training phase, in which the memory patterns are stored as\nfixed-points of the network dynamics. The hidden-to-visible connections,\ninitially normally distributed, are learned via a local, online learning rule\ncalled the Three-Threshold Learning Rule and there is no within-layer\nconnections. The results of simulations suggested that the maximal information\ncapacity grows exponentially with the expansion ratio $N_h/N_v$. As a first\norder approximation to understand the mechanism providing the high capacity, I\nsimulated a naive mean-field approximation (nMFA) of the network. The\nexponential increase was captured by the nMFA, revealing that a key underlying\nfactor is the correlation between the hidden and the visible units.\nAdditionally, it was observed that, at maximal capacity, the degree of symmetry\nof the connectivity between the hidden and the visible neurons increases with\nthe expansion ratio.

Different variants of these bounds apply to either the entropy change\nor any individual current, e.g., the rate of substrate consumption in a\nchemical reaction or the electron current in an electronic device. The bounds\nvary with respect to their degree of universality and tightness. A universal\nparabolic bound on the generating function of an arbitrary current depends\nsolely on the average entropy production. A second, stronger bound requires\nknowledge both of the thermodynamic forces that drive the system and of the\ntopology of the network of states. These two bounds are conjectures based on\nextensive numerics. An exponential bound that depends only on the average\nentropy production and the average number of transitions per time is rigorously\nproved. This bound has no obvious relation to the parabolic bound but it is\ntypically tighter further away from equilibrium. An asymptotic bound that\ndepends on the specific transition rates and becomes tight for large\nfluctuations is also derived. This bound allows for the prediction of the\nasymptotic growth of the generating function. Even though our results are\nrestricted to networks with a finite number of states, we show that the\nparabolic bound is also valid for three paradigmatic examples of driven\ndiffusive systems for which the generating function can be calculated using the\nadditivity principle.

While previous\nstudies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we\ninvestigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration,\nsize evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows\ndrive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales\nvia two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming,\nproducing young stars that migrate $\\sim1{\\rm\\,kpc}$ within their first $100\n{\\rm\\,Myr}$, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the\nglobal potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce\nseveral dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by\nfactors of $>2$ over $\\sim200 {\\rm\\,Myr}$, and these rapid size fluctuations\ncan account for much of the observed scatter in radius at fixed $M_{\\rm star}.$\nSecond, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat\nstellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This\nage-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and\nmetallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating\nradial star-formation histories from stellar populations at $z=0$ can be\nseverely biased. These effects are strongest at $M_{\\rm\nstar}\\approx10^{7-9.6}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, the same regime where feedback most\nefficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics\nin low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic\nsolutions to small-scale problems in $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 22:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

We present lightcurve features for\nall K2 stellar targets, including their three strongest detected frequencies,\nwhich can be used to study stellar rotation periods where the observed\nvariability arises from spot modulation. The resulting catalogue of variable\nstars, classes, and associated data features are made available online. We\npublish our SOM code in Python as part of the open source PyMVPA package, which\nin combination with already available RF modules can be easily used to recreate\nthe method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 21:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 08:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This paper describes a domain-general data analysis method called\nCrossCat. CrossCat infers multiple non-overlapping views of the data, each\nconsisting of a subset of the variables, and uses a separate nonparametric\nmixture to model each view. CrossCat is based on approximately Bayesian\ninference in a hierarchical, nonparamet- ric model for data tables. This model\nconsists of a Dirichlet process mixture over the columns of a data table in\nwhich each mixture component is itself an independent Dirichlet process mixture\nover the rows; the inner mixture components are simple parametric models whose\nform depends on the types of data in the table. CrossCat combines strengths of\nmixture modeling and Bayesian net- work structure learning. Like mixture\nmodeling, CrossCat can model a broad class of distributions by positing latent\nvariables, and produces representations that can be efficiently conditioned and\nsampled from for prediction. Like Bayesian networks, CrossCat represents the\ndependencies and independencies between variables, and thus remains accurate\nwhen there are multiple statistical signals. Inference is done via a scalable\nGibbs sampling scheme; this paper shows that it works well in practice. This\npaper also includes empirical results on heterogeneous tabular data of up to 10\nmillion cells, such as hospital cost and quality measures, voting records,\nunemployment rates, gene expression measurements, and images of handwritten\ndigits. CrossCat infers structure that is consistent with accepted findings and\ncommon-sense knowledge in multiple domains and yields predictive accuracy\ncompetitive with generative, discriminative, and model-free alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 22:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

In all these cases, we\nsucceeded to obtain new results, such as calculations in modified\nconfigurations of the above mentioned steps and detailed considerations of new\nlimiting cases in already studied before steps.

It is frequently argued that shocks\nare the main driver of the flaring events. However, the spectral variability\nmodelings generally lack detailed considerations of the self-consistent\nmagnetic field evolution modeling, thus so far the associated optical\npolarization signatures are poorly understood. We present the first\nsimultaneous modeling of the optical radiation and polarization signatures\nbased on 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic shocks in the\nblazar emission environment, with the simplest physical assumptions. By\ncomparing the results with observations, we find that shocks in a weakly\nmagnetized environment will largely lead to significant changes in the optical\npolarization signatures, which are seldom seen in observations. Hence an\nemission region with relatively strong magnetization is preferred. In such an\nenvironment, slow shocks may produce minor flares with either erratic\npolarization fluctuations or considerable polarization variations, depending on\nthe parameters; fast shocks can produce major flares with smooth PA rotations.\nIn addition, the magnetic fields in both cases are observed to actively revert\nto the original topology after the shocks. All these features are consistent\nwith observations. Future observations of the radiation and polarization\nsignatures will further constrain the flaring mechanism and the blazar emission\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 03:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Due to this dynamic nature, it becomes difficult to propose\nsuitable growth models that can explain the various important characteristic\nproperties of these networks. In fact, in many application oriented studies\nonly knowing these properties is sufficient. We, in this paper show that even\nif the network structure at a future time point is not available one can still\nmanage to estimate its properties. We propose a novel method to map a temporal\nnetwork to a set of time series instances, analyze them and using a standard\nforecast model of time series, try to predict the properties of a temporal\nnetwork at a later time instance. We mainly focus on the temporal network of\nhuman face- to-face contacts and observe that it represents a stochastic\nprocess with memory that can be modeled as ARIMA. We use cross validation\ntechniques to find the percentage accuracy of our predictions. An important\nobservation is that the frequency domain properties of the time series obtained\nfrom spectrogram analysis could be used to refine the prediction framework by\nidentifying beforehand the cases where the error in prediction is likely to be\nhigh. This leads to an improvement of 7.96% (for error level <= 20%) in\nprediction accuracy on an average across all datasets.

With this insight, we build an\napproximately photon number conserving Monte Carlo model of bubble growth based\non partitioning regions of dark matter into halos.

A further consequence of thermal pulses is the\nformation of detached shells of gas and dust around the star. We aim to\ndetermine the physical properties of the detached gas shell around R\nSculptoris, in particular the shell mass and temperature, and to constrain the\nevolution of the mass-loss rate during and after a thermal pulse. We analyse\nCO(1-0), CO(2-1), and CO(3-2) emission, observed by. The spatial resolution of\nthe ALMA data allows us to separate the detached shell emission from the\nextended emission inside the shell. We perform radiative transfer modelling of\nboth components to determine the shell properties and the post-pulse mass-loss\nproperties. The ALMA data show a gas shell with a radius of 19.5\" expanding at\n14.3km/s. The different scales probed by the ALMA Cycle 0 array show that the\nshell must be entirely filled with gas, contrary to the idea of a detached\nshell. The comparison to single-dish spectra and radiative transfer modelling\nconfirms this. We derive a shell mass of 4.5e-3 Msun with a temperature of 50K.\nTypical timescales for thermal pulses imply a pulse mass-loss rate of 2.3e-5\nMsun/yr. For the post-pulse mass-loss rate, we find evidence for a gradual\ndecline of the mass-loss rate, with an average value of 1.6e-5 Msun/yr. The\ntotal amount of mass lost since the last thermal pulse is 0.03 Msun, a factor\nfour higher compared to classical models, with a sharp decline in mass-loss\nrate immediately after the pulse. We find that the mass-loss rate after a\nthermal pulse has to decline more slowly than generally expected from models of\nthermal pulses. This may cause the star to lose significantly more mass during\na thermal pulse cycle, which affects the chemical evolution of the star and the\ninterstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 09:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

We discuss several\npossible origins of the pressure dependency of {\\mu}: (a) saturation of the\ncontact area (and friction force) due to high nominal squeezing pressure, (b)\nnon-linear viscoelasticity, (c) non-randomness in the surface topography, in\nparticular the influence of the skewness of the surface roughness profile, (d)\nadhesion, and (e) frictional heating. We show that in most cases the\nnon-linearity in the {\\mu}(p) relation is mainly due to process (e) (frictional\nheating), which softens the rubber, increases the area of contact, and (in most\ncases) reduces the viscoelastic contribution to the friction. In fact, since\nthe temperature distribution in the rubber at time t depends on on the sliding\nhistory (i.e., on the earlier time t0 < t), the friction coefficient at time t\nwill also depend on the sliding history, i.e. it is, strictly speaking, a time\nintegral operator. The energy dissipation in the contact regions between solids\nin sliding contact can result in high local temperatures which may strongly\naffect the area of real contact and the friction force (and the wear-rate).\nThis is the case for rubber sliding on road surfaces at speeds above 1 mm/s. In\nRef. [14] we have derived equations which describe the frictional heating for\nsolids with arbitrary thermal properties. In this paper the theory is applied\nto rubber friction on road surfaces. Numerical results are presented and\ncompared to experimental data. We observe good agreement between the calculated\nand measured temperature increase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 10:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

We argue that the existence of a unique maximising\nprobability distribution $\\{p(j\\vert K)\\}$ for states labelled by $j$ given\ndata $K$ implies that the corresponding maximal value of the information\nentropy $\\sigma(\\{(p_j\\vert K)\\}) = -\\sum_j (p_j \\vert K)\\ln{(p_j\\vert K)}$\ndepends explicitly on the data at equilibrium and on the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem. As such, it is a direct measure of our uncertainty about the exact\nstate of the body and can be identified with the traditional thermodynamic\nentropy. We consider the well known microcanonical, canonical and grand\ncanonical methods and ensure that the fluctuations about mean values are\ngenerally minuscule for macroscopic systems before identifying these mean\nvalues with experimental observables and thereby connecting to many standard\nresults from thermodynamics. Unexpectedly, we find that it is not generally\npossible for a quantum process to be both isentropic and reversibly adiabatic.\nThis is in sharp contrast to traditional thermodynamics where it is assumed\nthat isentropic, reversible adiabatic processes can be summoned up on demand\nand easily realised. By contrast, we find that linear relations between\npressures $P_j$ and energies $E_j$ are necessary and sufficient conditions for\na quasi-static and adiabatic change to be isentropic, but, of course, this\nrelationship only holds for a few especially simple systems, such as the\nperfect gas, and is not generally true for more complicated systems.

In this paper, we begin to explore the fundamental question: Which\ntype of information transfer is more analogous to real world? Inspired from the\nperformance characterization methodology outlined in the 90's, we note that\ninsights derived from simulations can be qualitative or quantitative depending\non the degree of the fidelity of models used in simulations and the nature of\nthe questions posed by the experimenter. We adapt the methodology in the\ncontext of current graphics simulation tools for modeling data generation\nprocesses and, for systematic performance characterization and trade-off\nanalysis for vision system design leading to qualitative and quantitative\ninsights. In concrete, we examine invariance assumptions used in vision\nalgorithms for video surveillance settings as a case study and assess the\ndegree to which those invariance assumptions deviate as a function of\ncontextual variables on both graphics simulations and in real data. As computer\ngraphics rendering quality improves, we believe teasing apart the degree to\nwhich model assumptions are valid via systematic graphics simulation can be a\nsignificant aid to assisting more principled ways of approaching vision system\ndesign and performance modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 13:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

The system is\nanalyzed numerically using a one-dimensional heat equation with a source term\nfor the reaction progress variable, which is specified to have zero\ndiffusivity, and the model reveals a spectrum of flame-propagation regimes. For\nthe case of a switch-type reaction rate and homogeneous media (continuous\nregime), the flame propagates steadily at a velocity in agreement with\nanalytical solutions. As the sources are spatially concentrated into\n{\\delta}-function-like sources, propagation approaches the discrete regime with\na fixed period between ignition of the sources, for which an analytic solution\nis also available for validation. When the source term is governed by an\nArrhenius rate and the activation energy is increased beyond the stability\nboundary, the flame begins to exhibit a long-wavelength (4-5 times the thermal\nflame thickness) oscillation characteristic of the thermo-diffusive\ninstability, in good agreement with prior stability analysis. When spatial\ndiscreteness is introduced, a competition is observed between the long-period\noscillations of the thermo-diffusive instability and the pulsations associated\nwith the rapid heat release of the concentrated sources. Interestingly, the\npresence of spatial discreteness is able to excite higher modes (period\ndoubling and chaotic solutions) of the thermo-diffusive instability, suggesting\nthat the introduction of discreteness may have an influence qualitatively\nsimilar to that of increasing activation energy.

Of\nparticular interest are auroral substorms, characterized by spatial variations\nof order 100 m and temporal variations of order 10 ms. These scales are thought\nto be produced by dispersive Alfv\\'en waves in the near-Earth magnetosphere.\nThe auroral tomography system characterized in this paper reconstructs the\nauroral volume emission rate to estimate the characteristic energy and location\nin the direction perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of peak electron\nprecipitation flux using a distributed network of precisely synchronized\nground-based cameras.

It was found that in non-superconducting FeSe ultrathin film\nwithout Mg coating, insulating \\b{eta}-Fe1-xSe phase with iron-vacancy\ndisorders is the main phase and more likely to be the parent phase of FeSe\nsuperconducting system. Proper Mg coating on the surface of FeSe films can lead\nto Mg entering FeSe crystal lattice to fill up these Fe vacancies rather than\nreplace Fe. Simultaneously, additional electron doping is introduced and the\nelectron carrier concentration in this parent phase can be tuned, which is\nresponsible for the SIT and evolution of superconductivity in this system.\nHowever, abnormal decrease of electron concentration was found in FeSe film\nwith excessive Mg coating, which brings about the severe degradation in\nsuperconducting performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 02:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}
