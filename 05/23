The\ncoarse-graining of the microscopic simulations enables to calculate thermal\ndilepton emission rates by application of in-medium spectral functions from\nequilibrium quantum-field theoretical calculations. The results show that\nextremely high baryon chemical potentials dominate the evolution of the created\nhot and dense fireball. Consequently, a significant modification of the $\\rho$\nspectral shape becomes visible in the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum,\nresulting in an enhancement in the low-mass region $M_{ee} = 200$ to 600\nMeV/$c^{2}$. This enhancement, mainly caused by baryonic effects on the $\\rho$\nspectral shape, can fully describe the experimentally observed excess above the\nhadronic cocktail contributions in Ar+KCl ($E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.76$ $A$GeV)\nreactions as measured by the HADES collaboration and also gives a good\nexplanation of the older DLS Ca+Ca ($E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.04$ $A$GeV) data. For\nthe larger Au+Au ($E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=1.23$ $A$GeV) system, we predict an even\nstronger excess from our calculations. A systematic comparison of the results\nfor different system sizes from C+C to Au+Au shows that the thermal dilepton\nyield increases stronger ($\\propto A^{4/3}$) than the hadronic background\ncontributions, which scale with $A$, due to its sensitivity on the time\nevolution of the reaction. We stress that the findings of the present work are\nconsistent with our previous coarse-graining results for the NA60 measurements\nat top SPS energy.

Nevertheless, we show that for every non-trivial symmetric\n$k$-ary Boolean function $f$ there exists a degree bound $\\Delta_0$ so that for\nall $\\Delta \\geq \\Delta_0$ the following problem is NP-hard: given a\n$k$-uniform hypergraph with maximum degree at most $\\Delta$, approximate the\npartition function of the hypergraph 2-spin model associated with $f$. It is\nNP-hard to approximate this partition function even within an exponential\nfactor. By contrast, if $f$ is a trivial symmetric Boolean function (e.g., any\nfunction $f$ that is excluded from our result), then the partition function of\nthe corresponding hypergraph 2-spin model can be computed exactly in polynomial\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 17:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 15:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 16:54:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 13:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

To improve the robustness of such methods w.r.t. noise\nand missing data, first approaches have recently been proposed that seek to\nembed the underlying PDE into a variational framework with data and smoothness\nterm. So far, however, such methods either make use of a radial depth\nparametrisation that makes the regularisation hard to interpret from a\ngeometrical viewpoint or they consider indirect smoothness terms that require\nadditional consistency constraints to provide valid solutions. Moreover the\nminimisation of such frameworks is an intricate task, since the underlying\nenergy is typically non-convex. In our paper we address all three of the\naforementioned issues. First, we propose a novel variational model that\noperates directly on the Cartesian depth. In this context, we also point out a\ncommon mistake in the derivation of the surface normal. Moreover, we employ a\ndirect second-order regulariser with edge-preservation property. This direct\nregulariser yields by construction valid solutions without requiring additional\nconsistency constraints.

Typical approaches to the monitoring of climate data include weather\nstation monitoring and remote sensing. However, climate monitoring stations are\nvery often distributed spatially in a sparse manner, and consequently, this has\na significant impact on the ability to reveal exposure risks due to extreme\nclimates at an intra-urban scale. Additionally, traditional remote sensing data\nsources are typically not received and analyzed in real-time which is often\nrequired for adaptive urban management of climate extremes, such as sudden\nheatwaves. Fortunately, recent social media, such as Twitter, furnishes\nreal-time and high-resolution spatial information that might be useful for\nclimate condition estimation. The objective of this study is utilizing\ngeo-tagged tweets (participatory sensing data) for urban temperature analysis.\nWe first detect tweets relating hotness (hot-tweets). Then, we study\nrelationships between monitored temperatures and hot-tweets via a statistical\nmodel framework based on copula modelling methods. We demonstrate that there\nare strong relationships between \"hot-tweets\" and temperatures recorded at an\nintra-urban scale. Subsequently, we then investigate the application of\n\"hot-tweets\" informing spatio-temporal Gaussian process interpolation of\ntemperatures as an application example of \"hot-tweets\". We utilize a\ncombination of spatially sparse weather monitoring sensor data and spatially\nand temporally dense lower quality twitter data. Here, a spatial best linear\nunbiased estimation technique is applied. The result suggests that tweets\nprovide some useful auxiliary information for urban climate assessment.

Einstein's\nequations on the brane reduces to a 6-dim Hamiltonian dynamical system with\nadditional terms that implement nonsingular bounces in the model. The phase\nspace of the model has two critical points (a saddle-center-center and a\ncenter-center-center) in a finite region of phase space, and two asymptotic de\nSitter critical points, one acting as an attractor to late-time dynamics. The\nsaddle-center-center engenders in the phase space the topology of stable and\nunstable 4-dim cylinders $R \\times S^3$, where $R$ is a saddle direction and\n$S^3$ is the center manifold of unstable periodic orbits (the nonlinear\nextension of the center-center sector). By a proper canonical transformation we\nseparate the degrees of freedom of the dynamics into one degree connected with\nthe expansion/contraction of the scales of the model, and two rotational\ndegrees of freedom connected to the $S^3$. The typical dynamical flow is then\nan oscillatory mode about a neighborhood of the cylinders.

The extrapolated virial masses today are uncertain with\nestimates ranging from 10^8 Msun to 10^9 Msun. We show that the progenitor halo\nmasses of UFDs can be as low as Mvir = 10^7 Msun. Under the right conditions,\nsuch a halo can survive the energy input of a supernova and its radiative\nprogenitor. A clumpy medium is much less susceptible to both internal and\nexternal injections of energy. It is less prone to SN sweeping because the\ncoupling efficiency of the explosive energy is much lower than for a diffuse\nISM.

The\ngas survives the SN explosion, is enriched with the abundance yields of the\ndiscrete events, and reaches surface densities where low mass stars can form.\nOur highest resolution simulations reveal why cooling is so effective in\nretaining gas compared to any other factor.

The structure is\nreminiscent of velocity dispersion maps of galaxies comprising two\ncounter-rotating discs, and may explain the existence of the kinematically\ndistinct core (KDC). Further evidence for two counter-rotating components comes\nfrom the analysis of the higher moments of the stellar line-of-sight velocity\ndistributions and fitting MUSE spectra with two separate Gaussian line-of-sight\nvelocity distributions. The emission-line kinematics show evidence of being\nlinked to the present cooling flows and the buoyant cavities seen in X-rays.

For\nhigh-variability organs such as the pancreas, previous approaches report\nundesirably low accuracies. We present a bottom-up approach for pancreas\nsegmentation in abdominal CT scans that is based on a hierarchy of information\npropagation by classifying image patches at different resolutions; and\ncascading superpixels. There are four stages: 1) decomposing CT slice images as\na set of disjoint boundary-preserving superpixels; 2) computing pancreas class\nprobability maps via dense patch labeling; 3) classifying superpixels by\npooling both intensity and probability features to form empirical statistics in\ncascaded random forest frameworks; and 4) simple connectivity based\npost-processing. The dense image patch labeling are conducted by: efficient\nrandom forest classifier on image histogram, location and texture features; and\nmore expensive (but with better specificity) deep convolutional neural network\nclassification on larger image windows (with more spatial contexts). Evaluation\nof the approach is performed on a database of 80 manually segmented CT volumes\nin six-fold cross-validation (CV).

Specifically, in information-theoretic $k$-server\nPIR, the database is replicated among $k$ non-communicating servers, and each\nserver learns nothing about the item retrieved by the user. The cost of PIR\nprotocols is usually measured in terms of their communication complexity, which\nis the total number of bits exchanged between the user and the servers, and\nstorage overhead, which is the ratio between the total number of bits stored on\nall the servers and the number of bits in the database. Since single-server\ninformation-theoretic PIR is impossible, the storage overhead of all existing\nPIR protocols is at least $2$.\n  In this work, we show that information-theoretic PIR can be achieved with\nstorage overhead arbitrarily close to the optimal value of $1$, without\nsacrificing the communication complexity. Specifically, we prove that all known\n$k$-server PIR protocols can be efficiently emulated, while preserving both\nprivacy and communication complexity but significantly reducing the storage\noverhead. To this end, we distribute the $n$ bits of the database among $s+r$\nservers, each storing $n/s$ coded bits (rather than replicas). For every fixed\n$k$, the resulting storage overhead $(s+r)/s$ approaches $1$ as $s$ grows;\nexplicitly we have $r\\le k\\sqrt{s}(1+o(1))$. Moreover, in the special case $k =\n2$, the storage overhead is only $1 + \\frac{1}{s}$. In order to achieve these\nresults, we introduce and study a new kind of binary linear codes, called here\n$k$-server PIR codes. We then show how such codes can be constructed, and we\nestablish several bounds on the parameters of $k$-server PIR codes. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss extensions of our results to nonbinary alphabets, to robust\nPIR, and to $t$-private PIR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 22:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

These clusters require an enormous amount of power (~500-2000 kW\neach), and most of this energy is converted into heat.

The largest cluster in the room has 1600\nnodes that run a variety of jobs during general use. Since extremes\ntemperatures are important, a Normal distribution plus generalized Pareto\ndistribution for the upper tail is used to model the marginal distribution,\nalong with a Gaussian process copula to account for spatio-temporal dependence.\nA Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model is used to model the spatial and/or\ntemporal effects on the node temperatures as the cooling changes take place.\nThis model is then used to assess the condition of the node temperatures after\neach change to the room. The analysis approach was used to uncover the cause of\na problematic episode of overheating nodes on one of the supercomputing\nclusters. The next step is to also use the model to estimate the trend in node\ntemperatures due to an increase in supply air temperature and ultimately decide\nwhen any further temperature increases would become unsafe.

Intermittent bursts that\nhave been observed in the outer boundary layer and have been linked to the\nformation of a torque maximum for counter-rotation are shown to disappear as\n$\\eta \\rightarrow 1$. The corresponding torque maximum disappears as well.\nInstead, two new maxima of different origin appear for $\\eta\\geq0.9$ and RPCF,\na broad and a narrow one, in contrast to the results for smaller $\\eta$. The\nbroad maximum at $R_\\Omega=0.2$ is connected with a strong vortical flow and\ncan be reproduced by streamwise invariant simulations. The narrow maximum at\n$R_\\Omega=0.02$ only emerges with increasing $Re_S$ and is accompanied by an\nefficient and correlated momentum transport by the mean flow. Since the narrow\nmaximum is of larger amplitude for $Re_S=2\\cdot10^4$, our simulations suggest\nthat it will dominate at even higher $Re_S$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2015 06:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Stable power supply requires a robust design of the power grid\ntopology. Currently, the impact of the grid structure on the grid robustness is\nmainly assessed by purely topological metrics, that fail to capture the\nfundamental properties of the electrical power grids such as power flow\nallocation according to Kirchhoff's laws. This paper deploys the effective\ngraph resistance as a metric to relate the topology of a grid to its robustness\nagainst cascading failures. Specifically, the effective graph resistance is\ndeployed as a metric for network expansions (by means of transmission line\nadditions) of an existing power grid. Four strategies based on network\nproperties are investigated to optimize the effective graph resistance,\naccordingly to improve the robustness, of a given power grid at a low\ncomputational complexity. Experimental results suggest the existence of\nBraess's paradox in power grids: bringing an additional line into the system\noccasionally results in decrease of the grid robustness.

First we take into account how assuming a finite loop\ngeometrical inductance and junction capacitance in each SQUID may alter the\noperation of this device.
