We find that there are considerable\ndifferences in the dynamics of the emergence of a magnetic flux tube when\n{\\lambda} is varied. In the solar interior, for larger values of {\\lambda}, the\nrising magnetic field emerges faster and expands more due to its lower magnetic\ntension.

A central part of the Higgs programme at an e+e- collider\nis the model-independent determination of the absolute Higgs couplings to\nfermions and to gauge bosons. Here the measurement of the e+e-->HZ\nHiggsstrahlung cross section, using the recoil mass technique, sets the\nabsolute scale for all Higgs coupling measurements. Previous studies have\nconsidered e+e- ->ZH with Z->l+l-, where l = electron or muon. In this paper it\nis shown for the first time that a near model-independent recoil mass technique\ncan be extended to the hadronic decays of the Z boson. Because the branching\nratio for Z->qq is approximately ten times greater than for Z->l+l-, this\nmethod is statistically more powerful than using the leptonic decays. For an\nintegrated luminosity of 500 fb-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 350 GeV at\nCLIC, the e+e-->HZ cross section can be measured to 1.8 % using the hadronic\nrecoil mass technique.

In the context of complex networks, bilinear systems capture scenarios\nwhere an actuator not only can affect the state of a node but also\ninterconnections among nodes.

This result motivates our\nstudy of various objects associated to the reachability Gramian to quantify the\nease of controllability of the bilinear network: the minimum eigenvalue\n(worst-case minimum input energy to reach a state), the trace (average minimum\ninput energy to reach a state), and its determinant (volume of the ellipsoid\ncontaining the reachable states using control inputs with no more than unit\nenergy).

Recently, several studies have pointed out observational\ndifficulties with constraining the low column density (i.e. Av <1) PDF using\ndust tracers. In order to constrain the shape and properties of the low column\ndensity probability distribution function, we investigate the PDF of multiphase\natomic gas in the Perseus molecular cloud using opacity-corrected GALFA-HI data\nand compare the PDF shape and properties to the total gas PDF and the N(H2)\nPDF. We find that the shape of the PDF in the atomic medium of Perseus is well\ndescribed by a lognormal distribution, and not by a power-law or bimodal\ndistribution. The peak of the atomic gas PDF in and around Perseus lies at the\nHI-H2 transition column density for this cloud, past which the N(H2) PDF takes\non a powerlaw form. We find that the PDF of the atomic gas is narrow and at\ncolumn densities larger than the HI-H2 transition the HI rapidly depletes,\nsuggesting that the HI PDF may be used to find the HI-H2 transition column\ndensity. We also calculate the sonic Mach number of the atomic gas by using HI\nabsorption line data, which yields a median value of Ms=4.0 for the CNM, while\nthe HI emission PDF, which traces both the WNM and CNM, has a width more\nconsistent with transonic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 19:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

It is discussed that an end-to-end model for GC formation and\nevolution should capture four different phases: (1) star and cluster formation\nin the high-pressure interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, (2) cluster\ndisruption by tidal shocks in the gas-rich host galaxy disc, (3) cluster\nmigration into the galaxy halo, and (4) the final evaporation-dominated\nevolution of GCs until the present day. Previous models have mainly focussed on\nphase 4. We present and discuss a simple model that includes each of these four\nsteps - its key difference with respect to previous work is the simultaneous\naddition of the high-redshift formation and early evolution of young GCs, as\nwell as their migration into galaxy haloes. The new model provides an excellent\nmatch to the observed GC mass spectrum and specific frequency, as well as the\nrelations of GCs to the host dark matter halo mass and supermassive black hole\nmass. These results show (1) that the properties of present-day GCs are\nreproduced by assuming that they are the natural outcome of regular\nhigh-redshift star formation (i.e. they form according to same physical\nprocesses that govern massive cluster formation in the local Universe), and (2)\nthat models only including GC evaporation strongly underestimate their\nintegrated mass loss over a Hubble time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 20:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

Several\narguments suggest that regardless of phase, the mass in the cold outflow does\nnot make it far from the disk; the mass flux through surfaces above the disk\nappears to decline with a projected scale length of ~ 1-2 kpc.

Several recent studies have focused on structures\nwhere such conventional $s$-wave superconductors are coupled to systems with an\nunusual configuration of electronic spin and momentum at the Fermi surface.\nUnder these conditions, the nature of the paired state can be modified and the\nsystem may even undergo a topological phase transition [2, 3].

We investigate here a new mechanism by which large amounts of angular\nmomentum might be shed from young stellar systems, thus yielding slowly\nrotating young stars. Assuming that planets promptly form in circumstellar\ndisks and rapidly migrate close to the central star, we investigate how the\ntidal and magnetic interactions between the protostar, its close-in planet(s),\nand the inner circumstellar disk can efficiently remove angular momentum from\nthe central object. We find that neither the tidal torque nor the variety of\nmagnetic torques acting between the star and the embedded planet are able to\ncounteract the spin up torques due to accretion and contraction. Indeed, the\nformer are orders of magnitude weaker than the latter beyond the corotation\nradius and are thus unable to prevent the young star from spinning up.

In light of this\ncapacity result, the capacity region of the degraded Gaussian interference\nchannel is established immediately. Next, by combining the capacity regions of\nthe one-sided interference channels in the weak and strong interference\nregimes, new outer bounds on the capacity region of the interference channel\nare introduced, in various interference regimes.

This PhD\nthesis is a quest into the influences of gas and active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\non the SFR, with particular focus on massive galaxies at z~2. First, a new code\nif presented; SImulator of GAlaxy Millimeter/submillimeter Emission (S\\'IGAME)\nwhich can predict the atomic/molecular line emission in the far-infrared regime\nfrom galaxies. By post-processing the outputs of cosmological simulations of\ngalaxy formation with sub-grid physics recipes, S\\'IGAME divides the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) into different gas phases and derives density and\ntemperature structure, employing locally resolved radiation and pressure\nfields. This method is used to predict the strengths of CO rotational\ntransitions as well as the [CII] emission line in normal star-forming galaxies\nat z~2. A CO ladder close to that of our own Galaxy is found, but with CO-H2\nconversion factors about 3 times smaller. For a set of 7 simulated galaxies at\nz~2, the relation between [CII] luminosity and SFR displays a slope\nsignificantly steeper than that found for observed galaxies at z<0.5.

Recently, stream-switching mechanisms based\non distributed source coding (DSC) have been proposed. In order to reduce the\noverall transmission rate, these approaches provide a \"merge\" mechanism, where\ninformation is sent to the decoder such that the exact same frame can be\nreconstructed given that any one of a known set of side information (SI) frames\nis available at the decoder (e.g., each SI frame may correspond to a different\nstream from which we are switching). However, the use of bit-plane coding and\nchannel coding in many DSC approaches leads to complex coding and decoding. In\nthis paper, we propose an alternative approach for merging multiple SI frames,\nusing a piecewise constant (PWC) function as the merge operator. In our\napproach, for each block to be reconstructed, a series of parameters of these\nPWC merge functions are transmitted in order to guarantee identical\nreconstruction given the known side information blocks. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios. In the first case, a target frame is first given, and then\nmerge parameters are chosen so that this frame can be reconstructed exactly at\nthe decoder. In contrast, in the second scenario, the reconstructed frame and\nmerge parameters are jointly optimized to meet a rate-distortion criteria.\nExperiments show that for both scenarios, our proposed merge techniques can\noutperform both a recent approach based on DSC and the SP-frame approach in\nH.264, in terms of compression efficiency and decoder complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 03:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

In this setup, molecular electronic levels\nlocalized on the conjugated groups independently shift with applied bias. While\nin the forward polarity a resonance condition is met, enhancing conductance, in\nthe reversed direction molecular electronic states shift away from each other,\nresulting in small tunneling currents. In the absence of interactions with a\nthermal environment (consisting e.g. internal vibrations, solvent),\nrectification ratios reach three orders of magnitude.

The latter two factors imply the\ncontribution of droplet deformability, commonly considered in the study of\ndroplet migration under steady shear flow conditions. We show that the imposed\noscillation brings in additional time complexity in the droplet movement,\nrealized through temporally varying drop-shape, flow direction and the inertial\nresponse of the droplet.

The model is extended to consider several optimization problems\nmotivated by realistic scenarios. We demonstrate how to infer water flow in a\nsmall pipe network from a single pressure sensor, and show how to control water\ninflow to minimize damaging pressure gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 05:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2016 16:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 21:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

An attractive heuristic for solving such problems is to\nfactorize the low-rank matrix, and to run projected gradient descent on the\nnonconvex factorized optimization problem. The goal of this problem is to\nprovide a general theoretical framework for understanding when such methods\nwork well, and to characterize the nature of the resulting fixed point. We\nprovide a simple set of conditions under which projected gradient descent, when\ngiven a suitable initialization, converges geometrically to a statistically\nuseful solution. Our results are applicable even when the initial solution is\noutside any region of local convexity, and even when the problem is globally\nconcave. Working in a non-asymptotic framework, we show that our conditions are\nsatisfied for a wide range of concrete models, including matrix regression,\nstructured PCA, matrix completion with real and quantized observations, matrix\ndecomposition, and graph clustering problems.

We try to\nreconcile the dilemma between the new observations and the current theory of\nstructure formation and growth. To test the results against the possible biases\nin redshift determination and the incompleteness of the Greiner sample, we also\napply our analysis to the 244 GRBs discovered by Swift and the subsample\npresented by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxy Legacy Survey (SHOALS). The\nreal space two-point correlation function (2PCF) of GRBs, $\\xi(r),$ is\ncalculated using a Landy-Szalay estimator. We perform a standard least-$\\chi^2$\nfit to the measured 2PCFs of GRBs. We use the best-fit 2PCF to deduce a\nrecently defined homogeneity scale. The homogeneity scale, $R_H$, is defined as\nthe comoving radius of the sphere inside which the number of GRBs $N(<r)$ is\nproportional to $r^3$ within $1\\%$, or equivalently above which the correlation\ndimension of the sample $D_2$ is within $1\\%$ of $D_2=3$.

In\ncombination with previous ALMA observations from Cycle 0 at 689GHz, we compare\nthe visibility profiles at the two frequencies and calculate the spectral index\n($\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$). The observations of SR21 show a clear shift in the\nvisibility nulls, indicating radial variations of the inner edge of the cavity\nat the two wavelengths. Notable radial variations of the spectral index are\nalso detected for SR21 with values of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}3.8-4.2$ in the\ninner region ($r<35$ AU) and $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}2.6-3.0$ outside. An\naxisymmetric ring (which we call the ring model) or a ring with the addition of\nan azimuthal Gaussian profile, for mimicking a vortex structure (which we call\nthe vortex model), is assumed for fitting the disk morphology. For SR21, the\nring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model\nbetter fits the 689GHz emission. For HD135344B, neither a significant shift in\nthe null of the visibilities nor radial variations of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$ are\ndetected. Furthermore, for HD135344B, the vortex model fits both frequencies\nbetter than the ring model. However, the azimuthal extent of the vortex\nincreases with wavelength, contrary to model predictions for particle trapping\nby anticyclonic vortices. For both disks, the azimuthal variations of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}$ remain uncertain to confirm azimuthal trapping. The\ncomparison of the current data with a generic model of dust evolution that\nincludes planet-disk interaction suggests that particles in the outer disk of\nSR21 have grown to millimetre sizes and have accumulated in a radial pressure\nbump, whereas with the current resolution there is not clear evidence of radial\ntrapping in HD135344B, although it cannot be excluded either.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 09:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Those models help us identify four complexity\nclasses: Fuzzy-FPA of fuzzy functions, Fuzzy-PA and Fuzzy-NPA of fuzzy decision\nproblems, and Fuzzy-NPAO of fuzzy optimization problems. Based on a relative\napproximation scheme targeting fuzzy membership degree, we formulate two\nnotions of \"reducibility\" in order to compare the computational complexity of\ntwo fuzzy problems. These reducibility notions make it possible to locate the\nmost difficult fuzzy problems in Fuzzy-NPA and in Fuzzy-NPAO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 09:07:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

When conditioning on\nvarious wind direction sectors, the dynamics of the conversion process appear\nas a fluctuating trajectory around an average IEC-like power curve, see section\nII. Our approach is to consider the wind farm as a dynamical system that can be\ndescribed as a stochastic drift/diffusion model, where a drift coefficient\ndescribes the attraction towards the power curve and a diffusion coefficient\nquantifies additional turbulent fluctuations. These stochastic coefficients are\ninserted into a Langevin equation that, once properly adapted to our particular\nsystem, models a synthetic signal of power output for any given wind\nspeed/direction signals, see section III. When combined with a pre-model for\nturbulent wind fluctuations, the stochastic approach models the power output of\nthe wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1Hz using only ten-minute average\nvalues of wind speed and directions. The stochastic signals generated are\ncompared to the measured signal, and show a good statistical agreement,\nincluding a proper reproduction of the intermittent, gusty features measured.\nIn parallel, a second application for performance monitoring is introduced in\nsection IV. The drift coefficient can be used as a sensitive measure of the\nglobal wind farm performance. When monitoring the wind farm as a whole, the\ndrift coefficient registers some significant deviation from normal operation if\none of twelve wind turbines is shut down during less than 4% of the time. Also,\nintermittent anomalies can be detected more rapidly than when using ten-minute\naveraging methods. Finally, a probabilistic description of the conversion\nprocess is proposed and modeled in appendix A, that can in turn be used to\nfurther improve the estimation of the stochastic coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 09:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

To this end, microscopic units of varying\ncomplexity, aimed at assembling the target phases, have been thought, designed,\ninvestigated and built. Such a path usually requires laborious fabrication\ntechniques, especially when a specific funcionalisation of the building blocks\nis required. Telechelic star polymers, i.e., star polymers made of a number $f$\nof di-block copolymers consisting of solvophobic and solvophilic monomers\ngrafted on a central anchoring point, spontaneously self-assemble into soft\npatchy particles featuring attractive spots (patches) on the surface. Here we\nshow that the tunability of such a system can be widely extended by controlling\nthe physical and chemical parameters of the solution. Indeed, at fixed external\nconditions the self-assembly behaviour depends only on the number of arms\nand/or on the ratio of solvophobic to solvophilic monomers. However, changes in\ntemperature and/or solvent quality makes it possible to reliably change the\nnumber and size of the attractive patches. This allows to steer the mesoscopic\nself-assembly behaviour without modifying the microscopic constituents.\nInterestingly, we also demonstrate that diverse combinations of the parameters\ncan generate stars with the same number of patches but different radial and\nangular stiffness. This mechanism could provide a neat way of further\nfine-tuning the elastic properties of the supramolecular network without\nchanging its topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 10:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The description is geometric and foliates in a\ncausal and physically transparent manner. The general observables of this model\nare constructed from local Lorentz symmetry considerations only. For smooth\nconfigurations, the local lattice actions reduce to the Hilbert-Palatini\naction, a cosmological term and the three topological terms of dimension four\nof Pontyagin, Euler and Nieh-Yan. Consistency conditions for a topologically\nhypercubic complex with null 4-simplexes are derived and a topological lattice\ntheory that enforces these non-local constraints is constructed. The lattice\nintegration measure is derived from an \\SLC-invariant integration measure by\nlocalization of the non-local structure group. This measure is unique up to a\ndensity that depends on the local 4-volume. It can be expressed in terms of\nmanifestly coordinate invariant geometrical quantities. The density provides an\ninvariant regularization of the lattice integration measure that suppresses\nconfigurations with small local 4-volumes. Amplitudes conditioned on geodesic\ndistances between local observables have a physical interpretation and may have\na smooth ultraviolet limit. Numerical studies on small lattices in the\nunphysical strong coupling regime of large imaginary cosmological constant\nsuggest that this model of triangulated causal manifolds is finite. Two\ntopologically different triangulations of space-time are discussed: a single,\ncausally connected universe and a duoverse with two causally disjoint connected\ncomponents. In the duoverse, two hypercubic sublattices are causally disjoint\nbut the local curvature depends on fields of both sublattices. This may\nsimulate effects of dark matter in the continuum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 11:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 01:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-04"}

Our interest is in the reconstruction of\npiecewise continuous fields in which the discontinuity set is described by a\nfinite number of geometric parameters. Natural applications include groundwater\nflow and electrical impedance tomography. We take a Bayesian approach, placing\na prior distribution on $u$ and determining the conditional distribution on $u$\ngiven the data $y$. It is then natural to study maximum a posterior (MAP)\nestimators. Recently (Dashti et al 2013) it has been shown that MAP estimators\ncan be characterised as minimisers of a generalised Onsager-Machlup functional,\nin the case where the prior measure is a Gaussian random field. We extend this\ntheory to a more general class of prior distributions which allows for\npiecewise continuous fields. Specifically, the prior field is assumed to be\npiecewise Gaussian with random interfaces between the different Gaussians\ndefined by a finite number of parameters. We also make connections with recent\nwork on MAP estimators for linear problems and possibly non-Gaussian priors\n(Helin, Burger 2015) which employs the notion of Fomin derivative.\n  In showing applicability of our theory we focus on the groundwater flow and\nEIT models, though the theory holds more generally. Numerical experiments are\nimplemented for the groundwater flow model, demonstrating the feasibility of\ndetermining MAP estimators for these piecewise continuous models, but also that\nthe geometric formulation can lead to multiple nearby (local) MAP estimators.\nWe relate these MAP estimators to the behaviour of output from MCMC samples of\nthe posterior, obtained using a state-of-the-art function space\nMetropolis-Hastings method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 13:10:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 20:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Qualitative comparisons using three-dimensional vorticity isosurfaces\nand lines, then quantitative comparisons using the helicity. To have a single\ninitial reconnection, as in the experiments, the trefoil is perturbed by 4 weak\nvortex rings. Initially there is a long period with deformations similar to the\nexperiment during which the energy, continuum helicity and topological\nself-linking number are all preserved. In the next period, once reconnection\nhas clearly begun, a Reynolds number independent fraction of the initial\nhelicity is dissipated in a finite time. In contrast, the experimental analysis\nfinds that the helicity inferred from the trajectories of hydrogen bubbles is\npreserved during reconnection. Since vortices reconnect gradually in a\nclassical fluid, it is suggested that the essential difference is in the\ninterpretation of the reconnection timescales associated with the observed\nevents. Both the time when reconnection begins, and when it ends. Supporting\nevidence for the strong numerical helicity depletion is provided by spectra, a\nprofile and visualisations of the helicity that show the formation of negative\nhelicity on the periphery of the trefoil. A single case with the same\ntrajectory and circulation, but a thinner core, replicates this helicity\ndepletion despite larger Sobolev norms, showing that the reconnection timescale\nis determined by the initial trajectory and circulation of the trefoil, not the\ninitial vorticity. This case also shows that the very small viscosity,\n$\\nu\\rightarrow 0$ mathematical restrictions upon finite-time dissipative\nbehavior do not apply to this range of modest viscosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 13:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

Training such a DCNN usually relies on a large number of images with\npixel-level segmentation masks, and annotating these images is very costly in\nterms of both finance and human effort. In this paper, we propose a simple to\ncomplex (STC) framework in which only image-level annotations are utilized to\nlearn DCNNs for semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first train an initial\nsegmentation network called Initial-DCNN with the saliency maps of simple\nimages (i.e., those with a single category of major object(s) and clean\nbackground). These saliency maps can be automatically obtained by existing\nbottom-up salient object detection techniques, where no supervision information\nis needed. Then, a better network called Enhanced-DCNN is learned with\nsupervision from the predicted segmentation masks of simple images based on the\nInitial-DCNN as well as the image-level annotations. Finally, more pixel-level\nsegmentation masks of complex images (two or more categories of objects with\ncluttered background), which are inferred by using Enhanced-DCNN and\nimage-level annotations, are utilized as the supervision information to learn\nthe Powerful-DCNN for semantic segmentation. Our method utilizes $40$K simple\nimages from Flickr.com and 10K complex images from PASCAL VOC for step-wisely\nboosting the segmentation network. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL VOC\n2012 segmentation benchmark well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nSTC framework compared with other state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 13:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 10:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

The latter simulation runs nearly 100 times\nfaster than the three-dimensional simulation, and gives very similar results\nfor time-averaged properties of the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 14:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Compared to classical\nreaction-diffusion models, this framework allows us to more realistically\ndescribe the situation where movement of individuals occurs on a faster time\nscale than the demographic (population) time scale, and we cannot determine\npopulation growth based on local density. However, most of the results reported\nso far for such systems have only been verified numerically and for a\nparticular choice of model functions, which obviously casts doubts about these\nfindings. In this paper, we analyse a class of integro-differential\npredator-prey models with a highly mobile predator in a heterogeneous\nenvironment, and we reveal the main factors stabilizing such systems. In\nparticular, we explore an ecologically relevant case of interactions in a\nhighly eutrophic environment, where the prey carrying capacity can be formally\nset to 'infinity'. We investigate two main scenarios: (i) the spatial gradient\nof the growth rate is due to abiotic factors only, and (ii) the local growth\nrate depends on the global density distribution across the environment (e.g.\ndue to non-local self-shading). For an arbitrary spatial gradient of the prey\ngrowth rate, we analytically investigate the possibility of the predator-prey\nequilibrium in such systems and we explore the conditions of stability of this\nequilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that for a Holling type I (linear)\nfunctional response, the predator can stabilize the system at low prey density\neven for an 'unlimited' carrying capacity. We conclude that the interplay\nbetween spatial heterogeneity in the prey growth and fast displacement of the\npredator across the habitat works as an efficient stabilizing mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 15:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-06"}

In practice, this response\nis contaminated by noise and reverberations. The direct-path relative transfer\nfunction (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between the direct-path acoustic\ntransfer function of the two channels. We propose a method to estimate the\nDP-RTF from the noisy and reverberant microphone signals in the short-time\nFourier transform domain. First, the convolutive transfer function\napproximation is adopted to accurately represent the impulse response of the\nsensors in the STFT domain.

Thus, developing models of organisms\nand their constituents should be done within the overall systemic context of\nthe studied phenomena.

The foundational idea of the\nstudy is that growth of cells, organs, systems and whole organisms, besides\nbiomolecular machinery, is influenced by biophysical mechanisms acting at\ndifferent scale levels. In particular, the general growth law uniquely defines\ndistribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass\nsynthesis at each phase of growth and at each scale level. We exemplify the\napproach considering metabolic properties of growing human and dog livers and\nliver transplants. A procedure for verification of obtained results has been\nintroduced too. We found that two examined dogs have high metabolic rates\nconsuming about 0.62 and 1 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per\nday, and verified this using the proposed verification procedure. We also\nevaluated consumption rate of nutrients in human livers, determining it to be\nabout 0.088 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per day for males,\nand about 0.098 for females. This noticeable difference can be explained by\nevolutionary development, which required females to have greater liver\nprocessing capacity to support pregnancy. We also found how much nutrients go\nto biomass synthesis and maintenance at each phase of liver and liver\ntransplant growth. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach can\nbe used for finding metabolic characteristics of cells, organs, and whole\norganisms, which can further serve as important inputs for many applications in\nbiology (protein expression), biotechnology (synthesis of substances), and\nmedicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 01:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

Such geometrized theoretical descriptions of the fundamental\ninteractions might lead us to get closer to the unification of the principle\ntheories.\n  Here, we apply a $3+1_C+1$ dimensional theory, which contains one extra\ncompactified spatial dimension $1_C$ in connection with the flavour quantum\nnumber in Quantum Chromodynamics. Within our model the size of the $1_C$\ndimension is proportional to the inverse mass-difference of the first low-mass\nbaryon states.
