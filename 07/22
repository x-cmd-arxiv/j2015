The Hitting Set problem parameterized by the size of the solution is a\nwell-known W[2]-complete problem in parameterized complexity theory. In this\npaper we investigate the complexity of Hitting Set under various structural\nparameterizations of the input. Our starting point is the folklore result that\nHitting Set is polynomial-time solvable if there is a tree T on vertex set U\nsuch that the sets in F induce connected subtrees of T. We consider the case\nthat there is a treelike graph with vertex set U such that the sets in F induce\nconnected subgraphs; the parameter of the problem is a measure of how treelike\nthe graph is.

Recently, pre-transit absorption\nin UV metal transitions of the hot Jupiter exoplanets HD 189733b and WASP12-b\nhave been interpreted as being caused by material compressed in a planetary bow\nshock. Here we present a robust detection of a time-resolved pre-transit, as\nwell as in-transit, absorption signature around the hot Jupiter exoplanet HD\n189733b using high spectral resolution observations of several hydrogen Balmer\nlines. The line shape of the pre-transit feature and the shape of the time\nseries absorption provide the strongest constraints on the morphology and\nphysical characteristics of extended structures around an exoplanet. The\nin-transit measurements confirm the previous exospheric H-alpha detection\nalthough the absorption depth measured here is ~50% lower. The pre-transit\nabsorption feature occurs 125 minutes before the predicted optical transit, a\nprojected linear distance from the planet to the stellar disk of 7.2 planetary\nradii. The absorption strength observed in the Balmer lines indicates an\noptically thick, but physically small, geometry. We model this signal as the\nearly ingress of a planetary bow shock. If the bow shock is mediated by a\nplanetary magnetosphere, the large standoff distance derived from the model\nsuggests a large equatorial planetary magnetic field strength of 28 G. Better\nknowledge of exoplanet magnetic field strengths is crucial to understanding the\nrole these fields play in planetary evolution and the potential development of\nlife on planets in the habitable zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 17:18:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 00:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 11:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

We find a total\nof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellar\ncores, and they will likely form stars in the future. We also detect 58\nprotostellar cores. The core mass function (CMF) derived for the prestellar\ncores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (IMF),\nsupporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the IMF\nand the CMF. The global shift in mass scale observed between the CMF and the\nIMF is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. By\ncomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,\nwe estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 Myr. We find a strong\ncorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and the\ndensest filaments. About 90% of the Herschel-identified prestellar cores are\nlocated above a background column density corresponding to A_V~7, and ~75% of\nthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unit\nlength >~16 M_sun/pc. These findings support a picture wherein the cores making\nup the peak of the CMF (and probably responsible for the base of the IMF)\nresult primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginally\nsupercritical filaments.

We give a global resolution of codimension two\nsingularities of the Abelian model; we identify the full anomaly free matter\ncontent, and match it to the unHiggsed non-Abelian model. The non-Abelian\nWeierstrass model exhibits a new algebraic description of the singularities in\nthe fibration that results in the first explicit construction of matter in the\nsymmetric representation of SU(3). This matter is realized on double point\nsingularities of the discriminant locus. The construction suggests a\ngeneralization to U(1)^k factors with k>2, which can be studied by Higgsing\ntheories with larger non-Abelian gauge groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 19:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 16:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The time scales\nfor this metamorphosis are only loosely constrained by observations. In\nparticular, the K+A phase should follow immediately after the QSO phase during\nwhich the dust and gas remaining from the (U)LIRG phase are expelled by the\nAGN. An intermediate class of QSOs with K+A spectral signatures, the\npost-starburst QSOs or PSQ, may represent the transitional phase between QSOs\nand K+As. We have compiled a sample of 72 {bona fide} $z<0.5$ PSQ from the SDSS\nDR7 QSO catalogue. We find the intermediate age populations in this sample to\nbe on average significantly weaker and metal poorer than their putative\ndescendants, the K+A galaxies. The typical spectral energy distribution of PSQ\nis well fitted by three components: starlight; an obscured power-law; and a hot\ndust component required to reproduce the mid-IR fluxes. From the slope and\nbolometric luminosity of the power-law component we estimate typical masses and\naccretion rates of the AGN, but we find little evidence of powerful radio-loud\nor strong X-ray emitters in our sample. This may indicate that the power-law\ncomponent originates in a nuclear starburst rather than in an AGN, as expected\nif the bulk of their young stars are still being formed, or that the AGN is\nstill heavily enshrouded in dust and gas. We find that both alternatives are\nproblematic and that more and better optical, X-ray, and mm-wave observations\nare needed to elucidate the evolutionary history of PSQ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 20:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Here we investigate the possibilities to reduce\nthe required number of RF chains, by performing antenna selection. While this\napproach is not a very effective strategy for theoretical independent Rayleigh\nfading channels, a substantial reduction in the number of RF chains can be\nachieved for real massive MIMO channels, without significant performance loss.\nWe evaluate antenna selection performance on measured channels at 2.6 GHz,\nusing a linear and a cylindrical array, both having 128 elements. Sum-rate\nmaximization is used as the criterion for antenna selection. A selection scheme\nbased on convex optimization is nearly optimal and used as a benchmark. The\nachieved sum-rate is compared with that of a very simple scheme that selects\nthe antennas with the highest received power.

(2014) of a pulsar in M82 that can\nreach luminosities of up to 10^40 ergs s^-1, a factor of ~100 the Eddington\nluminosity for a 1.4 Msol compact object, poses a challenge for accretion\nphysics. In order to better understand the nature of this source and its duty\ncycle, and in the light of several physical models that have been subsequently\npublished, we conduct a spectral and temporal analysis of the 0.5-8 keV X-ray\nemission from this source from 15 years of Chandra observations. We fit the\nChandra spectra of the pulsar with a power-law model and a disk black body\nmodel, subjected to interstellar absorption in M82. We carefully assess for the\neffect of pile-up in our observations, where 4/19 observations have a pile-up\nfraction >10%, which we account for during spectral modeling with a convolution\nmodel. When fitted with a power-law model, the average photon index when the\nsource is at high luminosity (L_X>10^39 ergs s^-1) is Gamma=1.33+/-0.15. For\nthe disk black body model, the average temperature is T=3.24+/-0.65 keV,\nconsistent with other luminous X-ray pulsars. We also investigated the\ninclusion of a soft excess component and spectral break, finding that the\nspectra are also consistent with these features common to luminous X-ray\npulsars. In addition, we present spectral analysis from NuSTAR over the 3-50\nkeV range where we have isolated the pulsed component. We find that the pulsed\nemission in this band is best fit by a power-law with a high-energy cut-off,\nwhere Gamma=0.6+/-0.3 and E_C=14^{+5}_{-3} keV. While the pulsar has previously\nbeen identified as a transient, we find from our longer-baseline study that it\nhas been remarkably active over the 15-year period, where for 9/19 (47%)\nobservations that we analyzed, the pulsar appears to be emitting at a\nluminosity in excess of 10^39 ergs s^-1, greater than 10 times its Eddington\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 23:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 19:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

The basic equations are ion and electron fluid equations and the\nMaxwell equations without displacement current. The neglect of displacement\ncurrent is consistent with the assumption of charge neutrality. It thus reduces\nto the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the long wavelength limit,\nbut the two-fluid effect appearing at ion and electron inertial scales is fully\ntaken into account. It is shown that the basic equations may be rewritten in a\nform that has formally the same structure as the MHD equations. The total mass,\nmomentum, and energy are all written in the conservative form. A new\nthree-dimensional numerical simulation code has been developed for the QNTF\nequations. The HLL (Harten-Lax-van Leer) approximate Riemann solver combined\nwith the upwind constrained transport (UCT) scheme is applied. The method was\noriginally developed for MHD (Londrillo & Del Zanna, 2004), but works quite\nwell for the present model as well. The simulation code is able to capture\nsharp multidimensional discontinuities as well as dispersive waves arising from\nthe two-fluid effect at small scales without producing $\\nabla \\cdot\n\\mathbf{B}$ errors. It is well known that conventional Hall-MHD codes often\nsuffer a numerical stability issue associated with short wavelength whistler\nwaves. On the other hand, since finite electron inertia introduces an upper\nbound to the phase speed of whistler waves in the present model, our code is\nfree from the issue even without explicit dissipation terms or implicit time\nintegration. Numerical experiments have confirmed that there is no need to\nresolve characteristic time scales such as plasma frequency or cyclotron\nfrequency for numerical stability. Consequently, the QNTF model offers a better\nalternative to the Hall-MHD or fully electromagnetic two-fluid models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 00:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 08:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-03"}

However, a\nnumber of theories aiming at unifying gravity with the other fundamental\ninteractions including string field theory suggest violation of Lorentz\nsymmetry [1-4].\n  While the energy scale of such strongly Lorentz symmetry-violating physics is\nmuch higher than that currently attainable by particle accelerators, Lorentz\nviolation may nevertheless be detectable via precision measurements at low\nenergies [2]. Here, we carry out a systematic theoretical investigation of the\nsensitivity of a wide range of atomic systems to violation of local Lorentz\ninvariance (LLI). Aim of these studies is to identify which atom shows the\nbiggest promise to detect violation of Lorentz symmetry. We identify the Yb+\nion as an ideal system with high sensitivity as well as excellent experimental\ncontrollability. By applying quantum information inspired technology to Yb+, we\nexpect tests of LLI violating physics in the electron-photon sector to reach\nlevels of $10^{-23}$, five orders of magnitude more sensitive than the current\nbest bounds [5-7]. Most importantly, the projected sensitivity of $10^{-23}$\nfor the Yb+ ion tests will allow for the first time to probe whether Lorentz\nviolation is minimally suppressed at low energies for photons and electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 03:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

The effect\nof the localization of the d orbitals of Ca pseudopotential has been included.\nThe Hubbard U corrected d-orbital for Ca sites are playing a role assisting the\ncharge transfer from p orbitals of S site to the Ca site, giving both localized\nelectron and hole states within the band gap, with an energy interval of\n1.2~1.4 eV. This corresponds to the localized excitonic levels below the\nconduction band edge for the optical absorption. The electronic properties and\nformation energies of native point defects have been discussed. We found the\nneutral S vacancy has the lowest energy of 0.62 eV under Ca-rich limit. The\nSchottky defect pair defect is another dominant defect with cost of 1.51 eV per\ndefect site from S-rich to Ca-rich chemical potential limits. The defect\nformation energy further summarized that the doubly positive S vacancy and\ndoubly negative Ca vacancy are both the most stable donor-type and\nacceptor-type defects respectively coexisting in CaS. We also summarized a\nnarrow doping limit energy which has been determined as 1.33 eV constantly in\nCaS independent to different chemical potential limits. But such doping allowed\nrange entirely shifts from valence band vicinity toward the conduction band\nedge from S-rich to Ca-rich limits. Under S-rich limit, the dopable range for\nEF shifting corresponds to Eu2+ doping experiments, the luminescence wavelength\nlimit is predicted to be 659 nm (1.88 eV) remarkably close to the reported\nresults 650 nm. This gives a solid theoretical reference for the lanthanide\nions doping experiments in CaS. We conclude that the defect levels combined\nwith formation energy is an accessible way to suggest the doping energy range\nand an assistant to explain the activation stage of photostimulated\nluminescence (PSL) mechanism in lanthanide ions doped crystal materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 03:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

After explaining that the IPR plays\na crucial role as a central regulator in calcium dynamics, several sources of\nrelevant experimental data are introduced. Single ion channels are best studied\nby recording single-channel currents under different ligand concentrations via\nthe patch-clamp technique. The particular relevance of modal gating, the\nspontaneous switching between different levels of channel activity that occur\neven at constant ligand concentrations, is highlighted. In order to investigate\nthe interactions of IPRs, calcium release from small clusters of channels,\nso-called calcium puffs, can be used. We then present the mathematical\nframework common to all models based on single-channel data, aggregated\ncontinuous-time Markov models, and give a short review of statistical\napproaches for parameterising these models with experimental data. The process\nof building a Markov model that integrates various sources of experimental data\nis illustrated using two recent examples, the model by Ullah et al. and the\n\"Park-Drive\" model by Siekmann et al., the only models that account for all\nsources of data currently available. Finally, it is demonstrated that the\nessential features of the Park-Drive model in different models of calcium\ndynamics are preserved after reducing it to a two-state model that only\naccounts for the switching between the inactive \"park\" and the active \"drive\"\nmode.

It has also been shown that a phase transition from\nhadronic matter to quark matter would result in an extended mixed phase region\nthat would segregate phases by net charge to minimize the total energy of the\nphase, leading to the formation of a crystalline lattice. The existence of\nquark matter in the core of a neutron star may have significant consequences\nfor its thermal evolution, which for thousands of years is facilitated\nprimarily by neutrino emission. In this work we investigate the effect a\ncrystalline quark-hadron mixed phase can have on the neutrino emissivity from\nthe core. To this end we calculate the equation of state using the relativistic\nmean-field approximation to model hadronic matter and a nonlocal extension of\nthe three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for quark matter. Next we determine\nthe extent of the quark-hadron mixed phase and its crystalline structure using\nthe Glendenning construction, allowing for the formation of spherical blob,\nrod, and slab rare phase geometries. Finally we calculate the neutrino\nemissivity due to electron-lattice interactions utilizing the formalism\ndeveloped for the analogous process in neutron star crusts.

Experimentally, quantum critical points have been identified and\nstudied in a growing list of heavy fermion compounds. Theoretically, Kondo\ndestruction has provided a means to characterize a class of unconventional\nquantum critical points that goes beyond the Landau framework of\norder-parameter fluctuations. Among the prominent evidence for such local\nquantum criticality have been measurements in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. A rapid crossover\nis observed at finite temperatures in the isothermal field dependence of the\nHall coefficient and other transport and thermodynamic quantities, which\nspecifies a $T^*(B)$ line in the temperature ($T$)-magnetic field ($B$) phase\ndiagram. Here, we discuss what happens when temperature is raised, by analyzing\nthe ratio of the crossover width to the crossover position. With this ratio\napproaching unity at $T \\gtrsim 0.5$ K, YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at zero magnetic field\nbelongs to the quantum-critical fluctuation regime, where the single-particle\nspectral function has significant spectral weight at both the small and large\nFermi surfaces. This implies that, in this temperature range, any measurements\nsensitive to the Fermi surface will also see a significant spectral weight at\nthe large Fermi surface. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nexperiments recently reported for YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at $T>1$ K are consistent with\nthis expectation, and therefore support the association of the $T^*(B)$ line\nwith the physics of Kondo destruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 07:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Second, it\nseverely suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the use of\nmultivariate nonparametric function estimation. The purpose of this paper is\nthus two-fold: a bias-correction is suggested to this test and a dimension\nreduction-based model-adaptive enhancement is recommended to promote the power\nperformance. The proposed test still possesses the Wilks phenomenon, and the\ntest statistic can converge to its limit at a much faster rate and is much more\nsensitive to alternative models than the original nonparametric generalized\nlikelihood ratio test as if the dimension of covariates were one.

For this, we\nconsider a power system whose operation is driven by a two-stage electricity\nmarket, with a forward and a real-time market. We analyze two different\nclearing mechanisms: a conventional one, whereby the forward and the balancing\nmarkets are independently cleared following a merit order, and a stochastic\none, whereby both market stages are co-optimized with a view to minimizing the\nexpected aggregate system operating cost. We first derive analytical formulae\nto determine the dispatch rule prompted by the co-optimized two-stage market\nfor a stylized power system with flexible, inflexible and stochastic power\ngeneration and infinite transmission capacity. This exercise sheds light on the\nconditions for the stochastic market-clearing mechanism to break the merit\norder. We then introduce and characterize two enhanced variants of the\nconventional two-stage market that result in either price-consistent or\ncost-efficient merit-order dispatch solutions, respectively. The first of these\nvariants corresponds to a conventional two-stage market that allows for virtual\nbidding, while the second requires that the stochastic power production be\ncentrally dispatched.

The method, which can accommodate\nlagged dependent variables, serially correlated errors, unobserved variables,\nand many alternatives, builds on the ideas of indirect inference. The main\ndifficulty in implementing indirect inference in discrete choice models is that\nthe objective surface is a step function, rendering gradient-based optimization\nmethods useless. To overcome this obstacle, this paper shows how to smooth the\nobjective surface. The key idea is to use a smoothed function of the latent\nutilities as the dependent variable in the auxiliary model. As the smoothing\nparameter goes to zero, this function delivers the discrete choice implied by\nthe latent utilities, thereby guaranteeing consistency. We establish conditions\non the smoothing such that our estimator enjoys the same limiting distribution\nas the indirect inference estimator, while at the same time ensuring that the\nsmoothing facilitates the convergence of gradient-based optimization methods.

Large galaxy surveys like\nSDSS now permit us to investigate in detail environment-driven transformation\nprocesses by comparing centrals and satellites. In this paper I summarize what\nwe have so far learnt about environmental effects by analysing the observed\nproperties of local central and satellite galaxies in SDSS, as a function of\ntheir stellar mass and the dark matter mass of their host group/cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 11:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

In an attempt to\nunderstand this, we considered all the large SEP events of cycle 24 that\noccurred until the end of 2014. We compared the properties of the associated\nCMEs with those in cycle 23. We found that the CME speeds in the sky plane were\nsimilar, but almost all those cycle-24 CMEs were halos. A significant fraction\nof (16%) of the frontside SEP events were associated with eruptive prominence\nevents. CMEs associated with filament eruption events accelerate slowly and\nattain peak speeds beyond the typical GLE release heights. When we considered\nonly western hemispheric events that had good connectivity to the CME nose,\nthere were only 8 events that could be considered as GLE candidates. One turned\nout to be the first GLE event of cycle 24 (2012 May 17). In two events, the\nCMEs were very fast (>2000 km/s) but they were launched into a tenuous medium\n(high Alfven speed). In the remaining five events, the speeds were well below\nthe typical GLE CME speed (~2000 km/s). Furthermore, the CMEs attained their\npeak speeds beyond the typical heights where GLE particles are released. We\nconclude that several factors contribute to the low rate of high-energy SEP\nevents in cycle 24: (i) reduced efficiency of shock acceleration (weak\nheliospheric magnetic field), (ii) poor latitudinal and longitudinal\nconnectivity), and (iii) variation in local ambient conditions (e.g., high\nAlfven speed).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 12:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Bitcoin nodes continuously generate and propagate\nblocks---collections of newly approved transactions that are added to Bitcoin's\nledger. Block creation requires nodes to invest computational resources, but\nalso carries a reward in the form of bitcoins that are paid to the creator.\nWhile the protocol requires nodes to quickly distribute newly created blocks,\nstrong nodes can in fact gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create\nand selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish\nmining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a\nspecific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).\n  In this paper we extend the underlying model for selfish mining attacks, and\nprovide an algorithm to find $\\epsilon$-optimal policies for attackers within\nthe model, as well as tight upper bounds on the revenue of optimal policies. As\na consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power\nan attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining. We find that the\nprofit threshold -- the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable\nattack -- is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. Indeed, the\npolicies given by our algorithm dominate SM1, by better regulating\nattack-withdrawals.\n  Using our algorithm, we show that Eyal and Sirer's suggested countermeasure\nto selfish mining is slightly less effective than previously conjectured. Next,\nwe gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays,\nand show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold\nvanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from\nthe protocol. We conclude with observations regarding the combined power of\nselfish mining and double spending attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 13:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 07:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}

The emerging cognitive radio sensor networks (CRSNs) provide a\npromising solution to address this challenge by enabling sensor nodes to\nopportunistically access licensed channels. However, since sensor nodes have to\nconsume considerable energy to support CR functionalities, such as channel\nsensing and switching, the opportunistic channel accessing should be carefully\ndevised for improving the energy efficiency in CRSN. To this end, we\ninvestigate the dynamic channel accessing problem to improve the energy\nefficiency for a clustered CRSN. Under the primary users' protection\nrequirement, we study the resource allocation issues to maximize the energy\nefficiency of utilizing a licensed channel for intra-cluster and inter-cluster\ndata transmission, respectively. With the consideration of the energy\nconsumption in channel sensing and switching, we further determine the\ncondition when sensor nodes should sense and switch to a licensed channel for\nimproving the energy efficiency, according to the packet loss rate of the\nlicense-free channel.

However, adding flow-sensitive\nconstructs (e.g., references or files) to a dynamic IFC system is subtle and\nmay also introduce high-bandwidth covert channels. In this work, we extend\nLIO---a language-based floating-label system---with flow-sensitive references.\nThe key insight to safely manipulating the label of a reference is to not only\nconsider the label on the data stored in the reference, i.e., the reference\nlabel, but also the label on the reference label itself. Taking this into\nconsideration, we provide an upgrade primitive that can be used to change the\nlabel of a reference in a safe manner.

The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances\ncomparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.\nFor vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold\nenhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the\nwavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the\nspontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no\ncorrelation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.\nAt any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a\nclosely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by\nthe static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic\ninverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.\nGeneralizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak\nabsorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two\nmain theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy\ntransfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS. Secondly the\nFRET rate is expressed as a frequency integral of the imaginary part of the\nGreen function. This leads to an approximate FRET rate in terms of the LDOS\nintegrated over a huge bandwidth from zero frequency to about 10 times the\ndonor emission frequency, corresponding to the vacuum-ultraviolet. Even then,\nthe broadband LDOS hardly contributes to the energy transfer rates.

To address this question, we studied tip cell overtaking\nin two existing cellular Potts models of angiogenic sprouting. In these models\nangiogenic sprouting-like behavior emerges from a small set of plausible cell\nbehaviors and the endothelial cells spontaneously migrate forwards and\nbackwards within sprouts, suggesting that tip cell overtaking might occur as a\nside effect of sprouting.

In addition, significant absorption at\nlow energies has been detected in the spectra of all these sources. Based on\ndata from the VVV (VISTA/ESO) infrared Galactic Bulge Survey, we have\nunambiguously identified three of the five sources, determined the J, H and K\nmagnitudes of the corresponding stars, and obtained upper limits on the fluxes\nfor the remaining two sources.

Note that all our results were obtained using improved absorption values\nand an extinction law differing in this direction from the standard one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 21:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

The model\ncan be applied for a description of elastic deformation of rocks, ceramics,\nconcrete, nanocomposites, aerogels and other materials with structural elements\ninteracting via forces and torques. A material is represented as a set of\nparticles (rigid bodies) connected by elastic bonds. Vectors rigidly connected\nwith particles are used for description of particles orientations. Simple\nexpression for potential energy of a bond is proposed. Corresponding forces and\ntorques are calculated. Parameters of the potential are related to\nlongitudinal, transverse (shear), bending, and torsional stiffnesses of the\nbond. It is shown that fitting parameters of the potential allows one to\nsatisfy any values of stiffnesses. Therefore, the model is applicable to bonds\nwith arbitrary length/thickness ratio. Bond stiffnesses are expressed in terms\nof geometrical and elastic properties of the bonds using three models:\nBernoulli-Euler beam, Timoshenko beam, and short elastic cylinder.
