The major hurdle in realizing crystal structures from\nDNA-functionalized particles is expected to be kinetic barriers that trap the\nsystem in metastable amorphous states. Therefore, it is vital to explore the\nmolecular details of particle assembly processes in order to understand the\nunderlying mechanisms. Molecular simulations based on coarse-grained models can\nprovide a convenient route to explore these details. Most of the currently\navailable coarse-grained models of DNA-functionalized particles ignore key\nchemical and structural details of DNA behavior. These models therefore are\nlimited in scope for studying experimental phenomena. In this paper, we present\na new coarse-grained model of DNA-functionalized particles which incorporates\nsome of the desired features of DNA behavior. The coarse-grained DNA model used\nhere provides explicit DNA representation (at the nucleotide level) and\ncomplementary interactions between Watson-Crick base pairs, which lead to the\nformation of single-stranded hairpin and double-stranded DNA. Aggregation\nbetween multiple complementary strands is also prevented in our model. We study\ninteractions between two DNA- functionalized particles as a function of DNA\ngrafting density, lengths of the hybridizing and non-hybridizing parts of DNA,\nand temperature. The calculated free energies as a function of pair distance\nbetween particles qualitatively resemble experimental measurements of\nDNA-mediated pair interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 16:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}

We give an\noverview of challenges and recent advances in the field of device fabrication\nand discuss two of our fabrication methods in more detail which result in\ndistinctly different device performances. In the first class of devices, Co/MgO\nelectrodes are directly deposited onto graphene which results in rough\nMgO-to-Co interfaces and favor the formation of conducting pinholes throughout\nthe MgO layer. We show that the contact resistance area product (R$_c$A) is a\nbenchmark for spin transport properties as it scales with the measured spin\nlifetime in these devices indicating that contact-induced spin dephasing is the\nbottleneck for spin transport even in devices with large R$_c$A values. In a\nsecond class of devices, Co/MgO electrodes are first patterned onto a silicon\nsubstrate.

In this paper, we demonstrate, through an\nextensive classification study using kernel machines, that the min-max kernel\noften provides an effective measure of similarity for nonnegative data. As the\nmin-max kernel is nonlinear and might be difficult to be used for industrial\napplications with massive data, we show that the min-max kernel can be\nlinearized via hashing techniques. This allows practitioners to apply min-max\nkernel to large-scale applications using well matured linear algorithms such as\nlinear SVM or logistic regression.\n  The previous remarkable work on consistent weighted sampling (CWS) produces\nsamples in the form of ($i^*, t^*$) where the $i^*$ records the location (and\nin fact also the weights) information analogous to the samples produced by\nclassical minwise hashing on binary data. Because the $t^*$ is theoretically\nunbounded, it was not immediately clear how to effectively implement CWS for\nbuilding large-scale linear classifiers. In this paper, we provide a simple\nsolution by discarding $t^*$ (which we refer to as the \"0-bit\" scheme).

These SFGs were targeted for spectroscopy based on their\nphotometric redshifts. The VUDS spectra are used to measure the UV spectral\nslopes ($\\beta$) as well as Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW).

Standard methods used to treat the\nlatter scenario are mainly based on ad hoc implementations of the classic Monte\nCarlo (MC) approach, which is characterized by a high computational time,\nstrongly dependent on the number of considered assets. This is why many\nfinancial players moved to more enhanced Technologies, e.g., grid computing and\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) capabilities.

In this work, we\nshow that if we bind a 1D representation of the symmetry (such as a charge) to\nthe intersection point of several domain walls, condensing such modified\ndomain-walls can lead to a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT)\nstate. This result is obtained by showing that the modified domain-wall\ncondensed state has a non-trivial SPT invariant -- the symmetry-twist dependent\npartition function. We propose two different kinds of field theories that can\ndescribe the above mentioned SPT states. The first one is a\nGinzburg-Landau-type non-linear sigma model theory, but with an additional\nmulti-kink domain-wall topological term. Such theory has an anomalous $U^k(1)$\nsymmetry but an anomaly-free $Z_N^k$ symmetry. The second one is a gauge\ntheory, which is beyond Abelian Chern-Simons/BF gauge theories.

The\nStar formation efficiency (~100) and gas mass (M_gas=2.1-9.5x10^{10} M_sun)\ninferred from the CO(3-2) line depend on the underlying assumptions on the\nexcitation of the transition and the CO-to-H2 conversion factor.

When it exists, this is a\nHamiltonian cycle. Finding global minimizers even of a smooth function is a\nchallenge. The difficulty is often exacerbated by the existence of many global\nminimizers. One may think this would help, but in the case of Hamiltonian\ncycles the ratio of the number of global minimizers to the number of local\nminimizers is typically astronomically small. There are various equivalent\nforms of the problem and here we report on two.\n  Although the focus is on finding Hamiltonian cycles, and this has an interest\nin and of itself, this is just a proxy for a class of problems that have\ndiscrete variables. The solution of relaxations of these problems is typically\nat a degenerate vertex, and in the neighborhood of the solution the Hessian is\nindefinite. The form of the Hamiltonian cycle problem we address has the virtue\nof being an ideal test problem for algorithms designed for discrete nonlinear\nproblems in general. It is easy to generate problems of varying size and\nvarying character, and they have the advantage of being able to determine if a\nglobal solution has been found. A feature of many discrete problems is that\nthere are many solutions. For example, in the frequency assignment problem any\npermutation of a solution is also a solution. A consequence is that a common\ncharacteristic of the relaxed problems is that they have large numbers of\nglobal minimizers and even larger numbers of both local minimizers, and saddle\npoints whose reduced Hessian has only a single negative eigenvalue.

Apart from these foundations, the original\nresearch of the author and his collaborators will be presented: Together with\nFewster, the author studied the up and down structure of permutations using\ntheir decomposition into so-called atomic permutations. The relevance of these\nresults to this thesis is their application in the calculation of the moments\nof quadratic quantum fields. In a work with Pinamonti, the author showed the\nlocal and global existence of solutions to the semiclassical Einstein equation\nin flat cosmological spacetimes coupled to a scalar field by solving\nsimultaneously for the quantum state and the Hubble function in an\nintegral-functional equation. The theorem is proved with a fixed-point theorem\nusing the continuous functional differentiability and boundedness of the\nintegral kernel of the integral-functional equation. In another work with\nPinamonti the author proposed an extension of the semiclassical Einstein\nequations which couples the moments of a stochastic Einstein tensor to the\nmoments of the quantum stress-energy tensor. In a toy model of a Newtonianly\nperturbed exponentially expanding spacetime it is shown that the quantum\nfluctuations of the stress-energy tensor induce an almost scale-invariant power\nspectrum for the perturbation potential and that non-Gaussianties arise\nnaturally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 01:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The N$_2$H$^+$ emission is\nfound to be relatively weak near the hot core and the outflows, and its\ndistribution is clearly anti-correlated with the CS emission. This result\nindicates that a young outflow is interacting with cold ambient gas. The\nHN$^{13}$C emission is compact and mostly emanates from the hot core, whereas\nthe DNC emission is extended around the hot core. Thus, the DNC and HN$^{13}$C\nemission traces warm regions near the protostar differently. The DNC emission\nis stronger than the HN$^{13}$C emission toward most parts of this clump. The\nDNC/HNC abundance ratio averaged within a $15^{\\prime\\prime} \\times\n15^{\\prime\\prime}$ area around the phase center is higher than 0.06.

Taking these results into account, we suggest that the low\nDNC/HNC ratio in the high-mass sources obtained by the single-dish observations\nare at least partly due to the low filling factor of the high density regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 01:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Then, this paper examine\nwhether or not such compact objects can exist under some suitable conditions.\nWe investigate thoroughly the static spherical polytropic ball of perfect fluid\nwith single polytrope index, and then investigate a representative example of\nthe piecewise polytropic ball. Our result is that the spherical polytropic ball\nwhich we have investigated cannot possess UCOP, if the sound speed at center is\nsubluminal (slower-than-light). This means that, if the polytrope treated in\nthis paper is a good model of stellar matter in compact objects, the detection\nof shadow image is regarded as a good evidence of black hole existence.

Recent work has introduced a\nsemi-discrete framework for obtaining model update functions that connect\nhost-parasitoid population levels from year-to-year. In particular, this\nframework uses differential equations to describe the hosts-parasitoid\ninteraction during the time of year where they come in contact, allowing\nspecific behaviors to be mechanistically incorporated into the model. We use\nthe semi-discrete approach to study the effects of host-feeding, which occurs\nwhen a parasitoid consumes a potential host larva without ovipositing. Our\nresults show that host-feeding by itself cannot stabilize the system, and both\nthe host and parasitoid populations exhibit diverging oscillations similar to\nthe Nicholson-Bailey model. However, when combined with other stabilizing\nmechanisms such as density-dependent host mortality or density-dependent\nparasitoid attack rate, host-feeding expands the region of parameter space that\nallows for a stable host-parasitoid equilibrium. Finally, our results show that\nhost-feeding causes inefficiency in the parasitoid population, which yields a\nhigher population of hosts per generation. This suggests that host-feeding may\nhave limited long-term impact in terms of suppressing host levels for\nbiological control applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 03:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

Although the area is much smaller than previous work dealing\nwith weak lensing peak statistics, the number density of galaxies usable for\nweak lensing analysis is about twice as large as those. The higher galaxy\nnumber density reduces the noise in the weak lensing mass maps, and thus\nincreases the signal-to-noise ratio of peaks of the lensing signal due to\nmassive clusters. This enables us to construct a weak lensing selected cluster\nsample by adopting a high threshold S/N, such that the contamination rate due\nto false signals is small. We find 6 peaks with S/N>5.

The welfare-based choice model is meaningful on\nits own by providing a new way of constructing choice models. More importantly,\nit provides great analysis convenience for establishing connections among\nexisting choice models. We prove by using convex analysis theory, that the\nwelfare-based choice model is equivalent to the representative agent choice\nmodel and the semi-parametric choice model, establishing the equivalence of the\nlatter two.

Conceptually, CDWs have their origin rooted in the\ninstability of a one-dimensional system described by Peierls. The extension of\nthis concept to reduced dimensional systems has led to the concept of Fermi\nsurface nesting (FSN), which dictates the wave vector q_cdw of the CDW and the\ncorresponding lattice distortion. The idea is that segments of the Fermi\ncontours are connected by q_cdw, resulting in the effective screening of\nphonons inducing Kohn Anomalies in their dispersion at q_cdw, driving a lattice\nrestructuring at low temperatures. There is growing theoretical and\nexperimental evidence that this picture fails in many real systems and in fact\nit is the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) matrix\nelement that determines the characteristic of CDW phase (q_cdw). Here, based on\nthe published results for the prototypical CDW system 2H-NbSe2, we show how\nwell the q-dependent EPC matrix element, but not the FSN, can describe the\norigin of CDW. We further demonstrate a procedure of combing electronic band\nand phonon (dispersion and linewidth) measurements to extract the EPC matrix\nelement, allowing the electronic states involved in the EPC to be identified.\nThus we show that a large EPC does not necessarily induce the CDW phase, with\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8 (Bi2212) as the example, and the charge ordered phenomena\nobserved in various cuprates are not driven by FSN or EPC. To experimentally\nresolve the microscopic picture of EPC will lead to a fundamental change in the\nway we think about, write about, and classify Charge Density Waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 06:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

However, it has long been\nunknown whether the regularizing effects are good enough to find best possible\nregularized solutions. Here a best possible regularized solution means that it\nis at least as accurate as the best regularized solution obtained by the\ntruncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) method.

We present a coupling of\nindividual based models of bovine TB in badgers and cattle, which aims to\ncapture the key details of the natural history of the disease and of both\nspecies at approximately county scale. The model is spatially explicit it\nfollows a very large number of cattle and badgers on a different grid size for\neach species and includes also winter housing. We show that the model can\nreplicate the reported dynamics of both cattle and badger populations as well\nas the increasing prevalence of the disease in cattle. Parameter space used as\ninput in simulations was swept out using Latin hypercube sampling and\nsensitivity analysis to model outputs was conducted using mixed effect models.\nBy exploring a large and computationally intensive parameter space we show that\nof the available control strategies it is the frequency of TB testing and\nwhether or not winter housing is practised that have the most significant\neffects on the number of infected cattle, with the effect of winter housing\nbecoming stronger as farm size increases. Whether badgers were culled or not\nexplained about 5%, while the accuracy of the test employed to detect infected\ncattle explained less than 3% of the variance in the number of infected cattle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 09:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The corresponding estimation problem\nis highly nonlinear and, in general, requires an estimation of the number of\nmultipath components. In the IARD approach individual multipath components are\nprocessed sequentially, which permits a tractable convergence analysis of the\ncorresponding inference expressions. This leads to a simple condition, termed\nhere a pruning condition, that determines if a multipath component is\n\"sparsified\" or retained in the model, thus permitting a fast and adaptive\nrealization of the estimation algorithm. Yet previous experiments demonstrated\nthat IARD fails to select the correct number of components when the parameters\nentering nonlinearly the multipath model are also estimated. To understand this\neffect, an analysis of the statistical structure of the pruning condition is\nproposed. It is shown that the corresponding test statistic in the pruning\ncondition follows an extreme value distribution. As a result, the standard IARD\nalgorithm implements a statistical test with a very high probability of false\nalarm. This leads to insertion of estimation artifacts and underestimation of\nsignal sparsity. Moreover, the probability of false alarm worsens as the number\nof measured signal samples grows. Based on the developed statistical\ninterpretation of the IARD, an optimal adjustment of the pruning condition is\nproposed. This permits a reliable and efficient removal of estimation artifacts\nand joint estimation of signal parameters, as well as optimal model order\nselection within a sparse Bayesian learning framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 10:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The automata (or nodes) move passively in a well-mixed\nsolution and can cooperate by interacting in pairs. Every such interaction may\nresult in an update of the local states of the nodes. Additionally, the nodes\nmay also choose to connect to each other in order to start forming some\nrequired structure. We may think of such nodes as the smallest possible\nprogrammable pieces of matter. The model that we introduce here is a more\napplied version of Network Constructors, imposing physical (or geometrical)\nconstraints on the connections. Each node can connect to other nodes only via a\nvery limited number of local ports, therefore at any given time it has only a\nbounded number of neighbors. Connections are always made at unit distance and\nare perpendicular to connections of neighboring ports. We show that this\nrestricted model is still capable of forming very practical 2D or 3D shapes. We\nprovide direct constructors for some basic shape construction problems.

How these stochastic phenomena\ninteract to govern cell fate are poorly understood. Nonetheless, cell fate\ndecision making procedure is mainly regulated through the activation of\ndifferentiation waves and associated signaling pathways. In the current work,\nwe focus on the Notch/Delta signaling pathway which is not only known to\ntrigger such waves but also is used to achieve the principle of lateral\ninhibition, i.e. a competition for exclusive fates through cross-signaling\nbetween neighboring cells. Such a process ensures unambiguous stochastic\ndecisions influenced by intrinsic noise sources, e.g.~as ones found in the\nregulation of signaling pathways, and extrinsic stochastic fluctuations,\nattributed to micro-environmental factors.

This has been prompted by recent measurements of\nthe Galactic rotation curve, which suggest that the limits have been biassed by\nthe assumption of an over-massive halo. The paper first discusses the security\nof the detection efficiency calculations which are central to deriving the\nMACHO content of the Galactic halo. It then sets out to compare the rotation\ncurves from various halo models with recent observations, with a view to\nestablishing what limits can be put on an all-MACHO halo. The main thrust of\nthe paper is to investigate whether lighter halo models which are consistent\nwith microlensing by an all-MACHO halo are also consistent with recent measures\nof the Galactic rotation curve. In this case the population of bodies\ndiscovered by the MACHO collaboration would make up the entire dark matter\ncontent of the Galactic halo. The main result of this paper is that it is easy\nto find low mass halo models consistent with the observed Galactic rotation\ncurve, which also imply an optical depth to microlensing similar to that found\nby the MACHO collaboration. This means that all-MACHO halos cannot be ruled out\non the basis of their observations. In conclusion, limits placed on the MACHO\ncontent of the Galactic halo from microlensing surveys in the Magellanic Clouds\nare inconsistent and model dependent, and do not provide a secure basis for\nrejecting an all-MACHO halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 12:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

To provide insight from a different perspective and\ngain a unified phase transition picture, non-extended phase space\nthermodynamics of $(n+1)$-dimensional charged topological Lovelock AdS black\nholes is investigated detailedly in the grand canonical ensemble. Specifically,\nthe specific heat at constant electric potential is calculated and phase\ntransition in the grand canonical ensemble is discussed. To probe the impact of\nthe various parameters, we utilize the control variate method and solve the\nphase transition condition equation numerically for the case $k=1,-1$. There\nare two critical points for the case $n=6,k=1$ while there is only one for\nother cases. For $k=0$, there exists no phase transition point. To figure out\nthe nature of phase transition in the grand canonical ensemble, we carry out an\nanalytic check of the analog form of Ehrenfest equations proposed by Banerjee\net al. It is shown that Lovelock AdS black holes in the grand canonical\nensemble undergo a second order phase transition. To examine the phase\nstructure in the grand canonical ensemble, we utilize the thermodynamic\ngeometry method and calculate both the Weinhold metric and Ruppeiner metric. It\nis shown that for both analytic and graphical results that the divergence\nstructure of the Ruppeiner scalar curvature coincides with that of the specific\nheat.

Various discrete-time\ndynamical models including non-random input, random-input and switching or\nhybrid system manoeuvre models are presented. The problem of manoeuvre\ndetection is covered. Classical and current filtering methods for manoeuvre\ntracking are presented including multi-level process noise, input estimation,\nvariable dimension filtering, two-stage filter, the interacting multiple model\nalgorithm, and generalised pseudo-Bayesian algorithms. Various extensions of\nthese algorithms to the case of cluttered measurements are also described and\nthese include: joint manoeuvre and measurement association, probabilistic data\nassociation and multi-hypothesis tracking. Smoothing schemes, including IMM\nsmoothing and batch expectation-maximisation using the Viterbi algorithm, are\nalso described. The use of amplitude information for target measurement\ndiscrimination is discussed. It is noted that although many manoeuvre tacking\ntechniques exist, the literature contains surprisingly few performance\ncomparisons to guide the design engineer although a performance benchmark has\nrecently been introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 01:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

To this\nend, the source has been taken as Tolman-Bondi model which preserve\ninhomogeneity in nature. The field equations, Misner-Sharp mass and dynamical\nequations have formulated in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $5D$. The\njunction conditions have been explored between the anisotropic source and\nvacuum solution in Gauss-Bonnet gravity in detail. The Misner and Sharp\napproach has been applied to define the proper time and radial derivatives.\nFurther, these helps to formulate general dynamical equations. The equations\nshow that the mass of the collapsing system increases with the same amount as\nthe effective radial pressure increases. The dynamical system preserve\nretardation which implies that system under-consideration goes to gravitational\ncollapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 05:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}
