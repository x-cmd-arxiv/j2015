We introduce an extra amplitude modulation on one deformable mirror\nconfiguration to create an uncorrelated wave-front, which is a critical\nprocedure for wave-front sensing. The simulation shows that the reconstructed\nwave-front is consistent with the original wave-front theoretically, which\nindicates that such an algorithm is a promising technique for the wave-front\nmeasurement for the high-contrast imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 17:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Unfortunately, direct\nmeasurements of O/H in the neutral gas are extremely difficult to obtain, as\nthe only OI line available within the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV\nwavelength range (1150-3200 A) is often saturated. As such, proxies for oxygen\nare needed to indirectly derive O/H via the assumption that solar ratios based\non local Milky Way sight lines hold in different environments. In this paper we\nassess the validity of using two such proxies, PII and SII, within more typical\nstar-forming environments. Using HST-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) far-UV\n(FUV) spectra of a sample of nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and the oxygen\nabundances in their ionized gas, we demonstrate that both P and S are mildly\ndepleted with respect to O and follow a trend, log(PII/SII)= -1.73+/-0.18, in\nexcellent agreement with the solar ratio of log(P/S)_sol=-1.71+/-0.04 over the\nlarge range of metallicities (0.03-3.2 Z_sol) and H I column densities (log[N(H\nI)/cm^-2] =18.44-21.28) spanned by the sample. From literature data we show\nevidence that both elements individually trace oxygen according to their\nrespective solar ratios across a wide range of environments. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the solar ratios of log(P/O)_sol=-3.28+/-0.06 and\nlog(S/O)_sol=-1.57+/-0.06 can both be used to derive reliable O/H abundances in\nthe neutral gas of local and high-redshift SFGs. The difference between O/H in\nthe ionized- and neutral-gas phases is studied with respect to metallicity and\nH I content. The observed trends are consistent with galactic outflows and/or\nstar formation inefficiency affecting the most metal-poor galaxies, with the\npossibility of primordial gas accretion at all metallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 19:02:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 22:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 18:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-05"}

Tartakovsky and Veeravalli (2004)\ndeveloped a general asymptotic theory of changepoint detection in the non-iid\ncase and discrete time, and Baron and Tartakovsky (2006) in continuous time\nassuming certain stability of the log-likelihood ratio process. This stability\nproperty was formulated in terms of the r-quick convergence of the normalized\nlog-likelihood ratio process to a positive and finite number, which can be\ninterpreted as the limiting Kullback-Leibler information between the \"change\"\nand \"no change\" hypotheses. In these papers, it was conjectured that the\nr-quick convergence can be relaxed in the r-complete convergence, which is\ntypically much easier to verify in particular examples. In the present paper,\nwe justify this conjecture by showing that the Shiryaev change detection\nprocedure is nearly optimal, minimizing asymptotically (as the probability of\nfalse alarm vanishes) the moments of the delay to detection up to order r\nwhenever r-complete convergence holds. We also study asymptotic properties of\nthe Shiryaev-Roberts detection procedure in the Bayesian context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 19:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 23:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

Yet, it is\nunclear if precipitation intensities will increase mainly due to modified\nthermodynamic forcing or due to stronger convective dynamics. In gradual\nself-organization, convective events produce highest intensities late in the\nday. Tracking rain cells throughout their life cycles, we find that interacting\nevents respond strongly to changes in boundary conditions. Conversely, events\nwithout interaction remain unaffected. Increased surface temperature indeed\nleads to more interaction and higher precipitation extremes. However, a similar\nintensification occurs when leaving temperature unchanged but simply granting\nmore time for self-organization.Our study implies that the convective field as\na whole acquires a memory of past precipitation and inter-cloud dynamics,\ndriving extremes.

Also the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension have become\nso widespread and common that they are often used without references to the\nrigorous definitions or pioneering works. The survey is devoted to the finite\ndimensional dynamical systems in Euclidean space and its aim is to explain, in\na simple but rigorous way, the connection between the key works in the area: by\nKaplan and Yorke (the concept of Lyapunov dimension, 1979), Douady and Oesterle\n(estimation of Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov dimension of maps, 1980),\nConstantin, Eden, Foias, and Temam (estimation of Hausdorff dimension via the\nLyapunov exponents and dimension of dynamical systems, 1985-90), Leonov\n(estimation of the Lyapunov dimension via the direct Lyapunov method, 1991),\nand numerical methods for the computation of Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov\ndimension. In this survey a concise overview of the classical results is\npresented, various definitions of Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension are\ndiscussed.\n  An effective analytical method for the estimation of Lyapunov dimension is\npresented, its application to the self-excited and hidden attractors of\nwell-known dynamical systems is demonstrated, and analytical formulas of exact\nLyapunov dimension are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 19:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 11:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

It\nis predicted that such high accretion rates should give rise to massive,\nradiatively-driven winds. However, observational evidence of a wind, in the\nform of absorption or emission features, has remained elusive. As such, the\nreported detection of X-ray spectral residuals in XMM-Newton spectra of NGC\n5408 X-1, which could be related to absorption in a wind is potentially very\nexciting. However, it has previously been assumed by several authors that these\nfeatures simply originate from background diffuse plasma emission related to\nstar-formation in the ULX's host galaxy. In this work we utilise the spatial\nresolving power of Chandra to test whether we can rule out this latter\ninterpretation. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity in these\nspectral features is emitted from a highly localised region close to the ULX,\nand appears point-like even with Chandra. It is therefore highly likely that\nthe spectral features are associated with the ULX itself, and little of the\nflux in this spectral component originates from spatially extended emission in\nthe host galaxy. This may be consistent with the suggestion of absorption in an\noptically thin phase of a super-Eddington wind. Alternatively, we could be\nseeing emission from collisionally ionised material close to the black hole,\nbut critically this would be difficult to reconcile with models where the\nsource inclination largely determines the observed X-ray spectral and timing\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 20:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

An intriguing feature of quantum interference arises in a three\nslit experiment. In this set-up, the interference pattern can be written in\nterms of the two and one slit patterns obtained by blocking some of the slits.\nThis is in stark contrast with the standard two slit experiment, where the\ninterference pattern is irreducible. This was first noted by Rafael Sorkin, who\nasked why quantum theory only exhibits irreducible interference in the two slit\nexperiment. One approach to this problem is to compare the predictions of\nquantum theory to those of operationally-defined `foil' theories, in the hope\nof determining whether theories exhibiting higher-order interference suffer\nfrom pathological--or at least undesirable--features. In this paper two\nproposed extensions of quantum theory are considered: the theory of Density\nCubes proposed by Dakic et al., which has been shown to exhibit irreducible\ninterference in the three slit set-up, and the Quartic Quantum Theory of\nZyczkowski. The theory of Density Cubes will be shown to provide an advantage\nover quantum theory in a certain computational task and to posses a\nwell-defined mechanism which leads to the emergence of quantum theory. Despite\nthis, the axioms used to define Density Cubes will be shown to be insufficient\nto uniquely characterise the theory. In comparison, Quartic Quantum Theory is\nwell-defined and we show that it exhibits irreducible interference to all\norders. This feature of the theory is argued not to be a genuine phenomenon,\nbut to arise from an ambiguity in the current definition of higher-order\ninterference. To understand why quantum theory has limited interference\ntherefore, a new operational definition of higher-order interference is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 20:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 19:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

The entanglement spectrum is also given additional structure due to\nthe presence of the gapless photon. Making use of the Bisognano-Wichmann\ntheorem and a local thermal approximation, these two contributions to the\nentanglement (particle and photon) are recast in terms of boundary and bulk\ncontributions, respectively.

H4 is peculiar because the\ncluster is significantly more metal-rich than the galaxy's other clusters, is\nlocated near the galaxy center, and may also be the youngest cluster in the\ngalaxy. In this study, we present detailed chemical abundances derived from\nhigh-resolution (R~28000) spectroscopy of an isolated H4 member star for\ncomparison with a sample of 22 nearby Fornax field stars. We find the H4 member\nto be depleted in the alpha-elements Si, Ca, and Ti with [Si/Fe]=-0.35+-0.34,\n[Ca/Fe]=+0.05+-0.08, and [Ti/Fe]=-0.27+-0.23, resulting in an average\n[alpha/Fe]=-0.19+-0.14.

For the\nfield stars we find a clear sequence, seen as an early depletion in [alpha/Fe]\nat low metallicities, in good agreement with previous measurements. H4 falls on\ntop of the observed field star [alpha/Fe] sequence and clearly disagrees with\nthe properties of Milky Way halo stars. We therefore conclude that within a\ngalaxy, the chemical enrichment of globular clusters may be closely linked to\nthe enrichment pattern of the field star population.

These dynamics are characterized by changes in temporal phases\n(onset-apex-offset) and intensity of emotion expressions and AUs, the\nappearance of which may vary considerably among target subjects, making the\nrecognition/detection task very challenging. The state-of-the-art Latent\nConditional Random Fields (L-CRF) framework allows one to efficiently encode\nthese dynamics through the latent states accounting for the temporal\nconsistency in emotion expression and ordinal relationships between its\nintensity levels, these latent states are typically assumed to be either\nunordered (nominal) or fully ordered (ordinal). Yet, such an approach is often\ntoo restrictive. For instance, in the case of AU detection, the goal is to\ndiscriminate between the segments of an image sequence in which this AU is\nactive or inactive. While the sequence segments containing activation of the\ntarget AU may better be described using ordinal latent states, the inactive\nsegments better be described using unordered (nominal) latent states, as no\nassumption can be made about their underlying structure (since they can contain\neither neutral faces or activations of non-target AUs). To address this, we\npropose the variable-state L-CRF (VSL-CRF) model that automatically selects the\noptimal latent states for the target image sequence. To reduce the model\noverfitting either the nominal or ordinal latent states, we propose a novel\ngraph-Laplacian regularization of the latent states. Our experiments on three\npublic expression databases show that the proposed model achieves better\ngeneralization performance compared to traditional L-CRFs and other related\nstate-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 21:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

There are several areas that can\nbenefit from cloud computing and one in special is gaining much attention: the\nflash-crowd handling. Flash-crowd events happen when servers are unable to\nhandle the volume of requests for a specific content (or a set of contents)\nthat actually reach it, thus causing some requests to be denied. For the\nhandling of flash-crowd events in Web applications, clouds can offer elastic\ncomputing and storage capacity during these events in order to process all\nrequests. However, it is important that flash-crowd events are quickly detected\nand the amount of resources to be instantiated during flash crowds is correctly\nestimated. In this paper, a new mechanism for detection of flash crowds based\non concepts of entropy and total correlation is proposed. Moreover, the\nFlash-Crowd Handling Problem (FCHP) is precisely defined and formulated as an\ninteger programming problem. A new algorithm for solving it, named FCHP-ILS, is\nalso proposed. With FCHP-ILS the Web provider is able to replicate contents in\nthe available resources and define the types and amount of resources to\ninstantiate in the cloud during a flash-crowd event. Finally we present a case\nstudy, based on a synthetic dataset representing flash-crowd events in small\nscenarios aiming at comparing the proposed approach with de facto standard\nAmazon's Auto Scaling mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 22:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

Common data reduction techniques, such as\nuniform and stratified sampling, do not exploit the fact that the sampled\ntuples will be transformed into a visualization for human consumption.\n  We propose a visualization-aware sampling (VAS) that guarantees high quality\nvisualizations with a small subset of the entire dataset. We validate our\nmethod when applied to scatter and map plots for three common visualization\ngoals: regression, density estimation, and clustering. The key to our sampling\nmethod's success is in choosing tuples which minimize a visualization-inspired\nloss function. Our user study confirms that optimizing this loss function\ncorrelates strongly with user success in using the resulting visualizations. We\nalso show the NP-hardness of our optimization problem and propose an efficient\napproximation algorithm. Our experiments show that, compared to previous\nmethods, (i) using the same sample size, VAS improves user's success by up to\n35% in various visualization tasks, and (ii) VAS can achieve a required\nvisualization quality up to 400 times faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 22:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 23:47:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

Graph filters can be represented by\nmatrix polynomials of the graph-shift operator, which captures the structure of\nthe graph and is assumed to be given. Thus, graph-filter design consists in\nchoosing the coefficients of these polynomials (known as filter coefficients)\nto resemble desired linear transformations. Due to the local structure of the\ngraph-shift operator, graph filters can be implemented distributedly across\nnodes, making them suitable for networked settings. We determine spectral\nconditions under which a specific linear transformation can be implemented\nperfectly using graph filters. Furthermore, for the cases where perfect\nimplementation is infeasible, the design of optimal approximations for\ndifferent error metrics is analyzed. We introduce the notion of a node-variant\ngraph filter, which allows the simultaneous implementation of multiple\n(regular) graph filters in different nodes of the graph. This additional\nflexibility enables the design of more general operators without undermining\nthe locality in implementation. Perfect and approximate implementation of\nnetwork operators is also studied for node-variant graph filters.

Ozawa proposed a solution based on the\noperator algebra of observables which has recently been used in experiments\ninvestigating the error-disturbance trade-off of quantum measurements.\nImportantly, this solution makes surprisingly detailed statements about the\nrelations between measurement outcomes and the unknown target observable. In\nthe present paper, we investigate this relation by performing a sequence of two\nmeasurements on the polarization of a photon, so that the first measurement\ncommutes with the target observable and the second measurement is sensitive to\na complementary observable. While the initial measurement can be evaluated\nusing classical statistics, the second measurement introduces the effects of\nquantum correlations between the non-commuting physical properties. By varying\nthe resolution of the initial measurement, we can change the relative\ncontribution of the non-classical correlations and identify their role in the\nevaluation of the quantum measurement.

Here we\nresolve the first issue and provide the first step about the second issue by\ndeveloping a general formalism in the linear response theory with appropriate\napproximations and using analytic arguments. The most striking result is that\neven without impurities the Fermi surface term, a non-Berry-curvature term,\nplays dominant roles at high or slightly low temperatures. In particular, this\nFermi surface term causes the temperature dependence of the dc anomalous Hall\nor spin Hall conductivity due to the interaction-induced quasiparticle damping\nand the correction of the dc spin Hall conductivity due to the spin-Coulomb\ndrag. Those results revise our understanding of the intrinsic AHE and SHE. We\nalso find that the differences between the dc anomalous Hall and longitudinal\nconductivities arise from the difference in the dominant multiband excitations.\nThis not only explains why the Fermi sea term such as the Berry-curvature term\nbecomes important in clean and low-temperature case only for interband\ntransports but also provides the useful principles on treating the\nelectron-electron interaction in an interacting multiorbital metal for general\nformalism of transport coefficients.

It turns out\nthat these representation ring filtrations are considerably easier to express\nglobally than over a fixed compact Lie group. Furthermore, they have formal\nsimilarities to the filtration on Burnside rings induced by the symmetric\nproducts of spheres, which was computed by Schwede.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 09:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

The quantum discord of inflationary perturbations is\ncalculated for an arbitrary splitting of the system, and shown to be very large\non super-Hubble scales. This entails the presence of large quantum\ncorrelations, due to the entangled production of particles with opposite\nmomentums during inflation. To determine how this is reflected at the\nobservational level, we study whether quantum correlators can be reproduced by\na non-discordant state, i.e. a state with vanishing discord that contains\nclassical correlations only. We demonstrate that this can be done for the power\nspectrum, the price to pay being twofold: first, large errors in other\ntwo-point correlation functions and second, the presence of intrinsic\nnon-Gaussianity. The detectability of these two features remains to be\ndetermined but could possibly rule out a non-discordant description of the\ncosmic microwave background. If one abandons the idea that perturbations should\nbe modeled by quantum mechanics and wants to use a classical stochastic\nformalism instead, we show that any two-point correlators on super-Hubble\nscales can be exactly reproduced regardless of the squeezing of the system.

Finally, we\nshow that the Proper Forcing Axiom implies that every narrow system of\ncountable width has a cofinal branch but is consistent with the existence of a\nnarrow system of width $\\omega_1$ with no cofinal branch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 12:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 09:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-13"}

The proof is much less\nstraightforward than it is in the case of scalar functions on Abelian groups.\n  As an easy corollary, we prove a stability theorem for near representations.\nIt states that if $G$ is a finite group and $f:G\\to$M$_n(\\mathbb C)$ is a\nfunction that is close to a representation in the sense that $f(xy)-f(x)f(y)$\nhas a small Hilbert-Schmidt norm (also known as the Frobenius norm) for every\n$x,y\\in G$, then there must be a representation $\\rho$ such that $f(x)-\\rho(x)$\nhas small Hilbert-Schmidt norm for every $x$. Again, the dimension of $\\rho$\nneed not be exactly $n$, but it must be close to $n$. We also obtain stability\ntheorems for other Schatten $p$-norms. A stability theorem of this kind was\nobtained for the operator norm by Grove, Karcher and Ruh in 1974 and in a more\ngeneral form by Kazhdan in 1982. (For the operator norm, the dimension of the\napproximating representation is exactly $n$.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 13:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 11:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

Modelling\nthese data allowed us to determine the psysical parameters and to establish its\npeculiarities. Results: The newly discovered vataclysmic variable\n2MASSJ22560844+5954299 shows the deepest eclipse amongst the known nova-like\nstars. It was reproduced by totally covering a very luminous accretion disk by\na red secondary component. The temperature distribution of the disk is flatter\nthan that of steady-state disk. The target is unusual with the combination of a\nlow mass ratio q~1.0 (considerably below the limit q=1.2 of stable mass\ntransfer of CVs) and an M-star secondary. The intensity of the observed three\nemission lines, H_alpha, He 5875, and He 6678, sharply increases around phase\n0.0, accompanied by a Doppler jump to the shorter wavelength. The absence of\neclipses of the emission lines and their single-peaked profiles means that they\noriginate mainly in a vertically extended hot-spot halo.

The\naltitude of the coronal X-ray source is observed to increase with energy by\n~+0.2 arcsec/keV between 10 and 25 keV.

However, it has been argued that\nthe strong ejecta asymmetries produced by this model might be inconsistent with\nthe low degree of polarisation typically observed in Type Ia supernova\nexplosions. Here, we test this claim by carrying out a spectropolarimetric\nanalysis for the model proposed by Pakmor et al. (2012) for an explosion\ntriggered during the merger of a 1.1 M$_{\\odot}$ and 0.9 M$_{\\odot}$\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf binary system. Owing to the asymmetries of the\nejecta, the polarisation signal varies significantly with viewing angle. We\nfind that polarisation levels for observers in the equatorial plane are modest\n($\\lesssim$ 1 per cent) and show clear evidence for a dominant axis, as a\nconsequence of the ejecta symmetry about the orbital plane. In contrast,\norientations out of the plane are associated with higher degrees of\npolarisation and departures from a dominant axis. While the particular model\nstudied here gives a good match to highly-polarised events such as SN 2004dt,\nit has difficulties in reproducing the low polarisation levels commonly\nobserved in normal Type Ia supernovae. Specifically, we find that significant\nasymmetries in the element distribution result in a wealth of strong\npolarisation features that are not observed in the majority of currently\navailable spectropolarimetric data of Type Ia supernovae. Future studies will\nmap out the parameter space of the merger scenario to investigate if\nalternative models can provide better agreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 14:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

Additionally, vertical-flux initial\nconditions are potentially able to influence this dynamo via the occurrence of\nthe magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We aim to study the influence of\nvarious initial field configurations on the saturated state of the mean-field\ndynamo. This is motivated by the observation that different saturation behavior\nwas previously obtained for different supernova rates. We perform direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) of three-dimensional local boxes of the vertically\nstratified, turbulent interstellar medium, employing shearing-periodic boundary\nconditions horizontally. Unlike in our previous work, we also impose a vertical\nseed magnetic field. We run the simulations until the growth of the magnetic\nenergy becomes negligible. We furthermore perform simulations of equivalent 1D\ndynamo models, with an algebraic quenching mechanism for the dynamo\ncoefficients. We compare the saturation of the magnetic field in the DNS with\nthe algebraic quenching of a mean-field dynamo. The final magnetic field\nstrength found in the direct simulation is in excellent agreement with a\nquenched $\\alpha\\Omega$~dynamo. For supernova rates representative of the Milky\nWay, field losses via a Galactic wind are likely responsible for saturation. We\nconclude that the relative strength of the turbulent and regular magnetic\nfields in spiral galaxies may depend on the galaxy's star formation rate. We\npropose that a mean field approach with algebraic quenching may serve as a\nsimple sub-grid scale model for galaxy evolution simulations including a\nprescribed feedback from magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 15:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

The authors consider a particular\nsystem---multiple vesicles suspended in a periodic channel of arbitrary\nshape---to describe the numerical method and test its performance. Rather than\nrelying on the periodic Green's function as classical BIE methods do, the\nmethod combines the free-space Green's function with a small auxiliary basis,\nand imposes periodicity as an extra linear condition. As a result, we can\nexploit existing free-space solver libraries, quadratures, and fast algorithms,\nand handle a large number of vesicles in a geometrically complex channel.\nSpectral accuracy in space is achieved using the periodic trapezoid rule and\nproduct quadratures, while a first-order semi-implicit scheme evolves particles\nby treating the vesicle-channel interactions explicitly. New\nconstraint-correction formulas are introduced that preserve reduced areas of\nvesicles, independent of the number of time steps taken. By using two types of\nfast algorithms, (i) the fast multipole method (FMM) for the computation of the\nvesicle-vesicle and the vesicle-channel hydrodynamic interaction, and (ii) a\nfast direct solver for the BIE on the fixed channel geometry, the computational\ncost is reduced to $O(N)$ per time step where $N$ is the spatial discretization\nsize. Moreover, the direct solver inverts the wall BIE operator at $t = 0$,\nstores its compressed representation and applies it at every time step to\nevolve the vesicle positions, leading to dramatic cost savings compared to\nclassical approaches.

This requires\nan understanding of both micro-structural effects and different sources of\nuncertainty in the problem. We first show that the uncertainties in the problem\nare of both statistical (aleatoric) and systematic (epistemic) types and that\ncurrent multiscale stochastic models, such as stationary random fields, which\nare based on precise probability theory, are not capable of correctly\ncharacterizing uncertainty in fiber composites. Next, we motivate the\napplicability of models based on imprecise uncertainty theory and present a\nnovel fuzzy-stochastic model, which can more accurately describe uncertainties\nin fiber composites. The new model is constructed by combining stochastic\nfields and fuzzy variables through a simple calibration-validation approach.\nFinally, we construct a global-local multiscale algorithm for efficiently\ncomputing output quantities of interest. The method aims at approximating\nrequired quantities, such as displacements and stresses, in regions of\nrelatively small size, e.g. hot spots or zones. The algorithm uses the concept\nof representative volume elements and computes a global solution to construct a\nlocal approximation that captures the microscale features of the solution. The\nresults are based on and backed by real experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 17:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}
