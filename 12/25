Most of these proceed by first transforming data to some specific\nextreme value marginal distribution, often the unit Fr\\'echet, then fitting a\nfamily of max-stable processes to the transformed data and exploring dependence\nwithin the framework of that model. The marginal transformation, model\nselection, and model fitting are all possible sources of misspecification in\nthis approach.\n  We propose an alternative model-free approach, based on the idea that\nsubstantial information on the strength of tail dependence and its temporal\nstructure are encoded in the distribution of the waiting times between\nexceedances of high thresholds at different locations. We propose quantifying\nthe strength of extremal dependence and assessing uncertainty by using\nstatistics based on these waiting times. The method does not rely on any\nspecific underlying model for the process, nor on asymptotic distribution\ntheory. The method is illustrated by applications to climatological, financial,\nand electrophysiology data.\n  To put the proposed approach within the context of the existing literature,\nwe construct a class of spacetime-indexed stochastic processes whose waiting\ntime distributions are available in closed form by endowing the support points\nin de Haan's spectral representation of max-stable processes with random birth\ntimes, velocities, and lifetimes, and applying Smith's model to these\nprocesses. We show that waiting times in this model are stochatically\ndecreasing in mean speed, and the sample mean of the waiting times obeys a\ncentral limit theorem with a uniform convergence rate under mild conditions.\nThis indicates that our procedure can be implemented in this setting using\nstandard $t$ statistics and associated hypothesis tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 16:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 23:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 17:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered\nthe adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from\nbirth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among\ngenetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic\ncomponent in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder\nprinciple, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically\nexpressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division\ntime is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a\nfixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean\ncell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in\ntiming increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the\ndistribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is\nindependent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in\nexperimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to\ndifferent newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other.

We also study structural\nproperties of colored HOMFLY homology for links and evaluate Poincare\npolynomials in numerous examples. Among these structural properties is a novel\n\"sliding\" property, which can be explained by using (refined) modular S-matrix.\nThis leads to the identification of modular transformations in Chern-Simons\ntheory and 3d N=2 theory via the 3d/3d correspondence. Lastly, we introduce the\nnotion of associated varieties as classical limits of recursion relations of\ncolored superpolynomials of links, and study their properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 19:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 09:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2017 08:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-25"}

Specifically, we\naddress mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We\nfind that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percents in mass)\nfollowing the disk's dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their\natmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the\nunderlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles\nthan the core (equivalently, lighter than a few % of the planet's mass) can be\nblown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool\nand contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale\nto the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the\nmass-temperature plane in which low-density super Earths can be found: planets\nhave to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres,\nwhile not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion\nand become gas giants (Jupiters).

While in the companion paper we focus\non axions and WIMPs, in this paper we focus on the results regarding the\nmeasurement of the DBD of $^{136}$Xe in a high pressure Xe (HPXe) TPC.\nParticularly relevant are the results obtained in Xe + TMA mixtures with\nmicrobulk Micromegas, showing very promising results in terms of gain,\nstability of operation, and energy resolution at pressures up to 10 bar. TMA at\nlevels of $\\sim$1\\% reduces electron diffusion by a factor of 10 with respect\nto pure Xe, improving the quality of the topological pattern, with a positive\nimpact on the discrimination capability. Operation with a medium size prototype\n(30 cm diameter and 38 cm drift) of 1 kg of Xe at 10 bar in the fiducial\nvolumen has allowed to test the detection concept in realistic experimental\nconditions. Microbulk Micromegas are able to image the DBD ionization signature\nwith high quality while, at the same time, measuring its energy deposition with\na resolution of at least $\\sim$3% FWHM @ Q$_{\\beta\\beta}$, and probably down to\n$\\sim$1% FWHM. In addition, first results on the topological signature\ninformation show promising background discrimination capabilities out of reach\nof other experimental implementations. Moreover, microbulk Micromegas have very\nlow levels of intrinsic radioactivity, and offer cost-effective scaling-up\noptions. All these results demonstrate that Micromegas-read HPXe TPC is a very\ncompetitive technique for the next generation DBD experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 22:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

However, such\ninterference-facilitated pair separation (IFPS) has not been extensively\nstudied in the integrated setting, where the strong polarization and wavelength\ndependencies of integrated couplers -- as opposed to bulk-optics beamsplitters\n-- can have important implications for performance beyond the identical-photon\nregime. This paper provides a detailed review of IFPS and examines how these\ndependencies impact separation fidelity and interference visibility. Focus is\ngiven to IFPS mediated by an integrated directional coupler. The analysis\napplies equally to both on-chip and in-fiber implementations, and can be\nexpanded to other coupler architectures such as multimode interferometers.

Second,\nanalysis of the collected data in order to assess the risks - the risk scoring.\nThis assessment may include flagging especially egregious vulnerabilities and\nexposures, or computing metrics that provide an overall characterization of the\nnetwork's risk level. Currently used risk metrics are often simple sums or\ncounts of vulnerabilities and missing patches.\n  The research challenges pertaining to CMRS fall mainly into two categories.\nThe first centers on the problem of integrating and fusing highly heterogeneous\ninformation. The second group of challenges is the lack of rigorous approaches\nto computing risk. Existing risk scoring algorithms remain limited to ad hoc\nheuristics such as simple sums of vulnerability scores or counts of things like\nmissing patches or open ports, etc. Weaknesses and potentially misleading\nnature of such metrics are well recognized. For example, the individual\nvulnerability scores are dangerously reliant on subjective, human, qualitative\ninput, potentially inaccurate and expensive to obtain. Further, the total\nnumber of vulnerabilities may matters far less than how vulnerabilities are\ndistributed over hosts, or over time. Similarly, neither topology of the\nnetwork nor the roles and dynamics of inter-host interactions are considered by\nsimple sums of vulnerabilities or missing patches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2015 00:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

Examples of such measurements include geographic\ncoordinates in the context of phylogeography and phenotypic traits in the\ncontext of comparative studies. A popular approach is to model the evolution of\ncontinuously varying traits as a Brownian diffusion process. However, standard\nBrownian diffusion is quite restrictive and may not accurately characterize\ncertain trait evolutionary processes. Here, we relax one of the major\nrestrictions of standard Brownian diffusion by incorporating a nontrivial\nestimable drift into the process. We introduce a relaxed drift diffusion model\nfor the evolution of multivariate continuously varying traits along a\nphylogenetic tree via Brownian diffusion with drift. Notably, the relaxed drift\nmodel accommodates branch-specific variation of drift rates while preserving\nmodel identifiability. We implement the relaxed drift model in a Bayesian\ninference framework to simultaneously reconstruct the evolutionary histories of\nmolecular sequence data and associated multivariate continuous trait data, and\nprovide tools to visualize evolutionary reconstructions. We illustrate our\napproach in three viral examples. In the first two, we examine the\nspatiotemporal spread of HIV-1 in central Africa and West Nile virus in North\nAmerica and show that a relaxed drift approach uncovers a clearer, more\ndetailed picture of the dynamics of viral dispersal than standard Brownian\ndiffusion.

We report here an interesting trend in their\nrelative structural stability - the isolated M4O4 clusters prefer to stabilize\nmore in the planar structure, while the cubane-like 3D structure is more\nfavourable for most of the isolated M4S4 clusters than their planar 2D\ncounterparts. Our study reveals that this contrasting trend in the relative\nstructural stability is expected to be driven by an interesting interplay\nbetween the s-d and p-d hybridization effects of the constituents' valence\nelectrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2015 05:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The magnetic field strength of the BZ jet is chosen as either\nfrom standard equipartition arguments or from magnetically arrested disc (MAD)\nsimulations.

Broadband\nmicrowave signal is electro-optically modulated onto the pump lightwave that is\nlaunched into one end of the fiber. Acoustic wave in the fiber inherits the\namplitude and phase information of the pump lightwave and thus the coupling\nbetween the acoustic wave and pump lightwave leads to the auto-correlated\nprocess of the pump lightwave as well as the modulated microwave signal.\nDerivation of the SBS coupling equations shows that the short-pulse probe\nlightwave amplified by the pump lightwave possesses the nature of\nauto-correlation formula. All-optical pulse compression of the broadband\nmicrowave signal is implemented after a subtraction between the detected probe\npulse with and without SBS.

It is also confirmed by\nneutrino oscillation experiments that neutrinos have tiny but non-zero masses.\nSince their masses are non-zero the neutrinos cannot be strictly described by\npure helicity states which coincide with the chirality eigenstates. On the\nother hand, it is generally assumed that ultrarelativistic massive fermions can\nbe described well enough by the Weyl equations. This assumption obviously\nexplains why the neutrinos are almost 100\\% longitudinally polarized. We\ndiscuss the validity of this assumption and show that the assumption is\nfallacious for a fermion with a general spin orientation. For instance, a\nfermion with a transverse polarization (relative to its momentum) cannot be\ndescribed by one of the Weyl equations even in the ultrarelativistic limit.\nHence, the fact that neutrinos are almost completely longitudinally polarized\ncannot be explained in the basis of relativistic quantum mechanics or quantum\nfield theory. As a solution to this problem, we propose a new hypothesis\naccording to which neutrinos are strictly described by pure helicity states\nalthough they are not massless.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 20:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 12:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

Monitor mode, which allows eavesdropping on\nall frames on a wireless communication channel, is a first step to lower this\nbarrier. Use cases include, but are not limited to, network packet analyses,\nsecurity research and testing of new medium access control layer protocols.\nMonitor mode is generally offered by SoftMAC drivers that implement the media\naccess control sublayer management entity (MLME) in the driver rather than in\nthe Wi-Fi chip. On smartphones, however, mostly FullMAC chips are used to\nreduce power consumption, as MLME tasks do not need to wake up the main\nprocessor. Even though, monitor mode is also possible in FullMAC scenarios, it\nis generally not implemented in today's Wi-Fi firmwares used in smartphones.\nThis work focuses on bringing monitor mode to Nexus 5 smartphones to enhance\nthe interoperability between applications that require monitor mode and BCM4339\nWi-Fi chips.
