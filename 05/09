Detection of quasar microvariations is\nchallenging for their non-periodicity, as well as the need for high monitoring\nfrequency and high signal-to-noise ratio. Statistical tests developed for the\nanalysis of quasar differential light curves usually show either low power or\nlow reliability, or both. In this paper we compare two statistical procedures\nthat include several stars to perform tests with enhanced power and high\nreliability. We perform light curve simulations of variable quasars and\nnon-variable stars, and analyze them with statistical procedures developed from\nthe F-test and the analysis of variance. The results show a large improvement\nin the power of both statistical probes, and a larger reliability, when several\nstars are included in the analysis. The results from the simulations agree with\nthose obtained from observations of real quasars. The high power and high\nreliability of the tests discussed in this paper improve the results that can\nbe obtained from short and long time scale variability studies. These\ntechniques are not limited to quasar variability; on the contrary, they can be\neasily implemented to other sources such as variable stars. Their applications\nto future research and to the analysis of large field photometric monitoring\narchives can reveal new variable sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2015 18:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

A magnetic field is likely carried\ninto the gap, potentially influencing the flow. Gap crossing has been simulated\nwith varying degrees of attention to field evolution (pure hydrodynamical,\nideal, and resistive MHD), but as yet there has been no detailed assessment of\nthe role of the field accounting for all three key non-ideal MHD effects: Ohmic\nresistivity, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift.

And XXVIII exhibits a complex horizontal\nbranch morphology, which is suggestive of metallicity enrichment and thus an\nextended period of star formation in the past. Decomposing the horizontal\nbranch into blue (metal poor, assumed to be older) and red (relatively more\nmetal rich, assumed to be younger) populations shows that the metal rich are\nalso more spatially concentrated in the center of the galaxy. We use\nspectroscopic measurements of the Calcium triplet, combined with the improved\nprecision of the Gemini photometry, to measure the metallicity of the galaxies,\nconfirming the metallicity spread and showing that they both lie on the\nluminosity-metallicity relation for dwarf satellites. Taken together, the\ngalaxies exhibit largely typical properties for dSphs despite their significant\ndistances from M31. These dwarfs thus place particularly significant\nconstraints on models of dSph formation involving environmental processes such\nas tidal or ram pressure stripping.

The\nVSI is driven by a weak vertical gradient in the disk's orbital motion, but\nmust overcome vertical buoyancy, a strongly stabilizing influence in cold\ndisks, where heating is dominated by external irradiation. Rapid radiative\ncooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate. We\nquantify the cooling timescale $t_c$ needed for efficient VSI growth, through a\nlinear analysis of the VSI with cooling in vertically global, radially local\ndisk models.

Recently, dynamic message-passing (DMP) has been\nproposed as an efficient algorithm for simulating epidemic models on networks,\nand in particular for estimating the probability that a given node will become\ninfectious at a particular time. To date, DMP has been applied exclusively to\nmodels with one-way state changes, as opposed to models like SIS\n(susceptible-infectious-susceptible) and SIRS\n(susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible) where nodes can return to\npreviously inhabited states. Because many real-world epidemics can exhibit such\nrecurrent dynamics, we propose a DMP algorithm for complex, recurrent epidemic\nmodels on networks. Our approach takes correlations between neighboring nodes\ninto account while preventing causal signals from backtracking to their\nimmediate source, and thus avoids \"echo chamber effects\" where a pair of\nadjacent nodes each amplify the probability that the other is infectious. We\ndemonstrate that this approach well approximates results obtained from Monte\nCarlo simulation and that its accuracy is often superior to the pair\napproximation (which also takes second-order correlations into account).\nMoreover, our approach is more computationally efficient than the pair\napproximation, especially for complex epidemic models: the number of variables\nin our DMP approach grows as $2mk$ where $m$ is the number of edges and $k$ is\nthe number of states, as opposed to $mk^2$ for the pair approximation.

We derive three specific models for the rectangular\nchannels, regular polygonal channels, and regular polygonal ring channels. We\nshow that the optimal channel shapes are the square-shaped channel for the\nrectangular channel, and circular-shaped channel for the other classes of\nshapes. Finally, we show that among all 2 dimensional shapes the optimal design\nchoice that maximizes information rate is the circular-shaped channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2015 22:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

However, because this approach attempts\nto identify any non-trivial relationship no matter how weak, it often\nidentifies too many relationships to be useful. What is needed is a way of\nidentifying a smaller set of relationships that merit detailed further\nanalysis.\n  Here we formally present and characterize equitability, a property of\nmeasures of dependence that aims to overcome this challenge. Notionally, an\nequitable statistic is a statistic that, given some measure of noise, assigns\nsimilar scores to equally noisy relationships of different types [Reshef et al.\n2011]. We begin by formalizing this idea via a new object called the\ninterpretable interval, which functions as an interval estimate of the amount\nof noise in a relationship of unknown type. We define an equitable statistic as\none with small interpretable intervals.\n  We then draw on the equivalence of interval estimation and hypothesis testing\nto show that under moderate assumptions an equitable statistic is one that\nyields well powered tests for distinguishing not only between trivial and\nnon-trivial relationships of all kinds but also between non-trivial\nrelationships of different strengths. This means that equitability allows us to\nspecify a threshold relationship strength $x_0$ and to search for relationships\nof all kinds with strength greater than $x_0$. Thus, equitability can be\nthought of as a strengthening of power against independence that enables\nfruitful analysis of data sets with a small number of strong, interesting\nrelationships and a large number of weaker ones.

A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of\ndependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for\nfollow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef\net al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores\nto equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,\nexponential, periodic).\n  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of\ndependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the\npopulation value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al.\n2011], as a canonical \"smoothing\" of mutual information, and as the supremum of\nan infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of\nthe marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an\nefficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random\nvariables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is\nefficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time\nalgorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through\nsimulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then\nintroduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a\ntrivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful\nindependence testing rather than equitability.\n  We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power\nagainst independence respectively.

This property, called equitability, is\nformalized in Reshef et al. [2015b].

Regarding equitability, our analysis finds that MICe\nis the most equitable method on functional relationships in most of the\nsettings we considered, although mutual information estimation proves the most\nequitable at large sample sizes in some specific settings. Regarding power\nagainst independence, we find that TICe, along with Heller and Gorfine's S^DDP,\nis the state of the art on the relationships we tested. Our analyses also show\na trade-off between power against independence and equitability consistent with\nthe theory in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In terms of runtime, MICe and TICe are\nsignificantly faster than many other measures of dependence tested, and\ncomputing either one makes computing the other trivial.

We map out the phase diagram in this case,\nwhich has not previously been studied. The results differ from those obtained\nwith different twist and isospin directions. One practical issue when including\nelectromagnetism is that the critical masses for up and down quarks differ. We\nshow that one of the criteria suggested to determine these critical masses does\nnot work, and propose an alternative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2015 00:58:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 22:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Here\nwe propose that a potential outcome of this atmospheric evolution is the\nformation of helium-dominated atmospheres. The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our\natmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere\nenvelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen\nabundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion\nyears. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium\natmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2015 01:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

In\nthis paradigm, the abundance peaks themselves are well reproduced by a\nmoderately neutron rich, main $r$-process environment such as that encountered\nin the magnetohydrodynamical jets in supernovae supplemented with a\nhigh-entropy, weakly neutron rich environment such as that encountered in the\nneutrino-driven-wind model to produce the lighter $r$-process isotopes.\nMoreover, we show that the relative contributions to the $r$-process abundances\nin both the solar-system and metal-poor stars from the weak, main, and\nfission-recycling environments required by this proposal are consistent with\nestimates of the relative Galactic event rates of core-collapse supernovae for\nthe weak and main $r$-process and neutron star mergers for the\nfission-recycling $r$-process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2015 11:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 14:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Our finite-size-scaling analysis shows that the\npercolation threshold of the initial domain pattern emerging from the dynamic\ninstability is close to 0.5 for strongly repulsive condensates. The percolation\nprobability is universally described with a scaling function when the\nprobability is rescaled by the characteristic domain size in the dynamic\nscaling regime of the phase-ordering kinetics, independent of the\nintercomponent interaction. It is revealed that an infinite domain wall\nsandwiched between percolating domains in the two condensates has an noninteger\nfractal dimension and keeps the scaling behavior during the dynamic scaling\nregime. This result seems to be in contrast to the argument that the dynamic\nscale invariance is violated in the presence of an infinite topological defect\nin numerical cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2015 14:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 02:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The multiple comparisons are usually performed using the mean-ranks\ntest.

We show that the outcome of\nthe mean-ranks test depends on the pool of algorithms originally included in\nthe experiment.
