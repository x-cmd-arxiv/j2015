The correlations are used to form a weighted network\nwhich is found to vary mildly in time. In fact, the structure of communities in\nthe network remains quite stable till about 1980. The goal is that the\ncalculated structure approximately reproduces the usually accepted geopolitical\nregions: the North East, the South, and the \"Midwest + West\" as the third one.\nFurthermore, the dataset reveals that the name distribution satisfies the Zipf\nlaw, separately for each state and each year, i.e. the name frequency $f\\propto\nr^{-\\alpha}$, where r is the name rank. Between 1920 and 1980, the exponent\nalpha is the largest one for the set of states classified as 'the South', but\nthe smallest one for the set of states classified as \"Midwest + West\". Our\ninterpretation is that the pool of selected names was quite narrow in the\nSouthern states. The data is compared with some related statistics of names in\nBelgium, a country also with different regions, but having quite a different\nscale than the USA. There, the Zipf exponent is low for young people and for\nthe Brussels citizens.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 18:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 10:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-11"}

Two types of wavelet based load models are\nconsidered, the multi-resolution wavelet load model for each individual\ncustomer and the classified wavelet load model for customers that share similar\nload patterns. The multi-resolution wavelet load model compresses the data, and\nthe classified wavelet load model further compresses the data. The method of\ngrouping customers into classes using the wavelet based classification\ntechnique is illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 19:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

The main aim of\nthe antineutrino run is to measure the leptonic phase $\\delta_{CP}$ which may\nhelp to understand the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. In this\nwork we show that in T2K, antineutrinos are required only for removing the\nwrong octant solutions which in turn improves the CP sensitivity.

If we divide the total true parameter space into eight sets, then\nwe find that T2K antineutrino run helps in improving the CP sensitivity for\nonly two sets while for the remaining six combinations pure neutrino run gives\nthe best CP sensitivity. Thus if the neutrino run is replaced by the\nantineutrino run then it causes a reduction in the CP sensitivity in 75$\\%$ of\nthe true parameter space due to lesser statistics. Thus it is worthwhile to\nstudy if the T2K antineutrino run can be reduced by the antineutrino runs of\nthe other experiments, so that T2K can run in dominant neutrino mode to extract\nthe best CP sensitivity.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 21:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 12:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

In particular, we study the so-called \"thermal sweeping\" mechanism which\nresults in rapid clearing of the disc. Thermal sweeping was originally thought\nto arise when the radial and vertical pressure scale lengths at the X-ray\nheated inner edge of the disc match. We demonstrate that this criterion is not\nfundamental. Rather, thermal sweeping occurs when the pressure maximum at the\ninner edge of the dust heated disc falls below the maximum possible pressure of\nX-ray heated gas (which depends on the local X-ray flux). We derive new\ncritical peak volume and surface density estimates for rapid radiative clearing\nwhich, in general, result in rapid dispersal happening less readily than in\nprevious estimates. This less efficient clearing of discs by X-ray driven\nthermal sweeping leaves open the issue of what mechanism can clear gas from the\nouter disc sufficiently quickly to explain the non-detection of cold gas around\nweak line T Tauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 21:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Such a theory predicts alignments between\nthe spin of haloes and tidal shear field. However, non-linear evolution and\nangular momentum acquisition may alter this prediction significantly.

Although linear reconstructions of the tidal field have looked at\nsimilar issues, this is the first such study to examine galaxy alignments with\nvelocity-shear field. Ellipticals in the 2MRS sample, show a statistically\nsignificant alignment with two of the principal axes of the shear field. In\ngeneral, elliptical galaxies have their short axis aligned with the axis of\ngreatest compression and perpendicular to the axis of slowest compression.\nSpiral galaxies show no signal. Such an alignment is significantly strengthened\nwhen considering only those galaxies that are used in velocity field\nreconstruction. When examining such a subsample, a weak alignment with the axis\nof greatest compression emerges for spiral galaxies as well. This result\nindicates that although velocity field reconstructions still rely on fairly\nnoisy and sparse data, the underlying alignment with shear field is strong\nenough to be visible even when small numbers of galaxies are considered -\nespecially if those galaxies are used as constraints in the reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 21:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 04:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

In this paper we complete the analysis of bosonic\nfields on this background by studying Maxwell perturbations, focusing on\nsuperradiant instabilities and vector clouds. For this purpose, we solve the\nTeukolsky equations numerically, imposing the boundary conditions we have\nproposed in\\cite{Wang:2015goa} for the radial Teukolsky equation. As found\ntherein, two Robin boundary conditions can be imposed for Maxwell fields on\nKerr-AdS black holes, one of which produces a new set of quasinormal modes even\nfor Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. Here, we show these different boundary\nconditions produce two different sets of superradiant modes. Interestingly the\n\"new modes\" may be unstable in a larger parameter space. We then study\nstationary Maxwell clouds, that exist at the threshold of the superradiant\ninstability, with the two Robin boundary conditions. These clouds, obtained at\nthe linear level, indicate the existence of a new family of black hole\nsolutions at the nonlinear level, within the Einstein-Maxwell-AdS system,\nbranching off from the Kerr-Newman-AdS family. As a comparison with the Maxwell\nclouds, scalar clouds on Kerr-AdS black holes are also studied, and it is shown\nthere are Kerr-AdS black holes that are stable against scalar, but not vector\nmodes, with the same \"quantum numbers\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 21:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

The central\ningredient of our proposal is the remarkable result that, for an unpolarized\ndecaying particle, the location of the peak in the energy distribution of the\nobserved decay product is identical to the (fixed) value of the energy that\nthis particle would have in the rest-frame of the decaying particle, which, in\nturn, is a simple function of the involved masses. In addition, we utilized the\nproperty that this energy distribution is symmetric around the location of peak\nwhen energy is plotted on a logarithmic scale. The general strategy was\ndemonstrated in several specific cases, including both beyond the SM particles,\nas well as for the top quark. In the present work, we generalize this method to\nthe case of a massive decay product from a two-body decay; this procedure is\nfar from trivial because (in general) both the above- mentioned properties are\nno longer valid. Nonetheless, we propose a suitably modified parametrization of\nthe energy distribution that was used successfully for the massless case, which\ncan deal with the massive case as well. We establish the accuracy of this\nparametrization using concrete examples of energy spectra of Z bosons from the\ndecay of a heavier stop into a Z boson and a lighter stop. We then study a\nrealistic application for the same process, but now including dominant\nbackgrounds and using foreseeable statistics at LHC14, in order to determine\nthe performance of this method for an actual mass measurement. The upshot of\nour present and previous work is that, in spite of energy being a\nLorentz-variant quantity, its distribution emerges as a powerful tool for mass\nmeasurement at hadron colliders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 22:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

To generalize the Kitaev model beyond the\nexactly solvable limit and connect it with other compass models, we propose a\nnew model, dubbed \"the tripod model\", which contains a continuum of\ncompass-type models.

Achieving this goal is possible using late-type stars, which\nin virtue of their long lifetimes can be regarded as fossil remnants from\nvarious epochs of the formation of the Galaxy. There are two main paths to\nreliably age-date late-type stars: astrometric distances for stars in the\nturn-off and subgiant region, or oscillation frequencies along the red giant\nbranch. So far, these methods have been applied to large samples of stars in\nthe solar neighbourhood, and in the Kepler field.

However, bundling is no longer profitable if\nthe goods have high production costs. To overcome this challenge, we introduce\na new mechanism, Pure Bundling with Disposal for Cost (PBDC), where after\nbuying the bundle, the customer is allowed to return any subset of goods for\ntheir costs.\n  We provide two types of guarantees on the profit of PBDC mechanisms relative\nto the optimum in the presence of production costs, under the assumption that\ncustomers have valuations which are additive over the items and drawn\nindependently. We first provide a distribution-dependent guarantee which shows\nthat PBDC earns at least 1-6c^{2/3} of the optimal profit, where c denotes the\ncoefficient of variation of the welfare random variable. c approaches 0 if\nthere are a large number of items whose individual valuations have bounded\ncoefficients of variation, and our constants improve upon those from the\nclassical result of Bakos and Brynjolfsson (1999) without costs.\n  We then provide a distribution-free guarantee which shows that either PBDC or\nindividual sales earns at least 1/5.2 times the optimal profit, generalizing\nand improving the constant of 1/6 from the celebrated result of Babaioff et al.\n(2014). Conversely, we also provide the best-known upper bound on the\nperformance of any partitioning mechanism (which captures both individual sales\nand pure bundling), of 1/1.19 times the optimal profit, improving on the\npreviously-known upper bound of 1/1.08.\n  Finally, we conduct simulations under the same playing field as the extensive\nnumerical study of Chu et al.

We suppose a\ngenetic system analogous to the discrete noisy channel of Shannon, where the\nsignal emitted by the input (mother population) is a number of alleles that\nwill form the next generation (offspring). The alleles received at a given\ngeneration are conditional upon the previous generation. Knowledge of this\nconditional probability law allows us to track the evolution of the allele\nentropies and mutual information values from one generation to the next. We\napply these laws to numerical computer simulations and to real data\n(Stryphnodendron adstringens). We find that, due to the genetic sampling\nprocess, in the absence of new mutations the mutual information increases\nbetween generations toward a maximum value. Lastly, after sufficient\ngenerations the system has a level of mutual information equal to the entropy\n(diversity) that it had at the beginning of the process (mother population).\nThis implies no increase in genetic diversity in the absence of new mutations.\nNow, obviously, mutations are essential to the evolution of species. In\naddition, we observe that when a population shows at least a low level of\ngenetic diversity, the highest values of mutual information between the\ngenerations occurs when the system is neither too orderly nor too disorderly.\nWe also find that mutual information is a valid measure of allele fixation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 04:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 19:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

The objective is twofold: 1) maximizing the\nthroughput when the flow sources continuously inject packets into the network,\nand 2) minimizing the evacuation time when there are no future packet arrivals.\nThe prior work mostly employs the link-based approach, which leads to\nthroughput-efficient algorithms but often does not guarantee satisfactory\nevacuation time performance.

A trivial necessary\ncondition for noncontextuality and a precondition for most approaches to\nmeasuring contextuality is that the system is consistently connected, i.e., all\n$R_p^c,R_p^{c'},\\dots$ measuring the same property $p$ have the same\ndistribution.

Early detection of new\npromising accounts is useful for trend prediction, viral marketing, user\nrecommendation, and so on. New accounts are, however, difficult to evaluate\nbecause they have not established their reputations, and we cannot apply\nexisting link-based or other popularity-based account evaluation methods. Our\nmethod first finds \"early adopters\", i.e., users who often find new good\ninformation sources earlier than others. Our method then regards new accounts\nfollowed by good early adopters as promising, even if they do not have many\nfollowers now. In order to find good early adopters, we estimate the frequency\nof link propagation from each account, i.e., how many times the follow links\nfrom the account have been copied by its followers. If its followers have\ncopied many of its follow links in the past, the account must be an early\nadopter, who find good information sources earlier than its followers. We\ndevelop a method of inferring which links are created by copying which links.\nOne advantage of our method is that our method only uses information that can\nbe easily obtained only by crawling neighbors of the target accounts in the\ncurrent Twitter graph. We evaluated our method by an experiment on Twitter\ndata. We chose then-new accounts from an old snapshot of Twitter, compute their\nranking by our method, and compare it with the number of followers the accounts\ncurrently have. The result shows that our method produces better rankings than\nvarious baseline methods, especially for new accounts that have only a few\nfollowers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 06:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Theoretically, witnessing\nentanglement is by measuring a special Hermitian observable, called\nentanglement witness (EW), which has non-negative expected outcomes for all\nseparable states but can have negative expectations for certain entangled\nstates. In practice, an EW implementation may suffer from two problems. The\nfirst one is \\emph{reliability}. Due to unreliable realization devices, a\nseparable state could be falsely identified as an entangled one. The second\nproblem relates to \\emph{robustness}. A witness may not to optimal for a target\nstate and fail to identify its entanglement. To overcome the reliability\nproblem, we employ a recently proposed measurement-device-independent\nentanglement witness, in which the correctness of the conclusion is independent\nof the implemented measurement devices. In order to overcome the robustness\nproblem, we optimize the EW to draw a better conclusion given certain\nexperimental data. With the proposed EW scheme, where only data postprocessing\nneeds to be modified comparing to the original measurement-device-independent\nscheme, one can efficiently take advantage of the measurement results to\nmaximally draw reliable conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 06:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Hence,\nit is necessary to gain knowledge of the whole or partial topology of a complex\ndynamical network by taking into consideration communication delay. In this\npaper, topology identification of complex dynamical networks is investigated\nvia generalized synchronization of a two-layer network. Particularly, based on\nthe LaSalle-type invariance principle of stochastic differential delay\nequations, an adaptive control technique is proposed by constructing an\nauxiliary layer and designing proper control input and updating laws so that\nthe unknown topology can be recovered upon successful generalized\nsynchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The technique provides a certain\ntheoretical basis for topology inference of complex networks. In particular,\nwhen the considered network is composed of systems with high-dimension or\ncomplicated dynamics, a simpler response layer can be constructed, which is\nconducive to circuit design.

This paper\nfocuses on the performance of various lime-based alternative materials intended\nfor application in repairing historic structures when subjected to mechanical\nloading. Results of basic material tests indicate that the use of metakaolin as\na pozzolanic additive produces mortars with superior strength and sufficiently\nlow shrinkage. Moreover, mortar strength can be further enhanced by the\naddition of crushed brick fragments, which explains the longevity of Roman\nconcretes rich in pozzolans and aggregates from crushed clay products such as\ntiles, pottery, or bricks. An integrated experimental-numerical approach was\nused to identify key mortar parameters influencing the load-bearing capacity of\nmasonry piers subjected to a combination of compression and bending.

We\nstudied the evolution of the 2003-2004 outbursts in soft X-rays using RXTE\n(2.5-12 keV; ASM), and in hard X-rays with INTEGRAL (17-80 keV, IBIS/ISGRI).\nUsing data from the JEM-X monitor onboard INTEGRAL we detected 61 Type-I X-ray\nbursts, and confirm that the source displayed a quasi-periodic burst recurrence\ntime of about 2.3 hours.

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation. If the\nsolar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved\ninto icy planets of 1-10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow.\nIf the proto-Earth contained water of ~ 1 wt% as might be suggested by the\ndensity deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was\npossible with weaker turbulence and with earlier (> 0.5-2 Myr) snow-line\nmigration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 11:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 08:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 06:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

By making use of global symmetries, it is possible to do\nso without scarifying homogeneity of the pertinent bulk solutions, which we\nthus term as \"homogeneous holographic lattices.\" Due to their technical\nsimplicity, these configurations have received a great deal of attention in the\nlast few years and have been shown to correctly describe momentum relaxation\nand hence (finite) DC conductivities. However, it is not clear whether they are\nable to capture other lattice effects which are of interest in condensed\nmatter. In this paper we investigate this question focusing our attention on\nthe phenomenon of commensurability, which arises when the lattice scale is\ntuned to be equal to (an integer multiple of) another momentum scale in the\nsystem.

For example cell communication via a diffusible factor\nallows for information to travel across large distances within the population,\nand cell polarisation makes it possible to form structures with a particular\norientation, but how do these processes interact to produce a more robust and\nregulated structure? In this study we investigate the ability of cells with\ndifferent cellular characteristics to grow and maintain homeostatic structures.\nWe do this in the context of an individual-based model where cell behaviour is\ndriven by an intra-cellular network that determines the cell phenotype. More\nprecisely, we investigated evolution with 96 different permutations of our\nmodel, where cell motility, cell death, long-range growth factor (LGF),\nshort-range growth factor (SGF) and cell polarisation were either present or\nabsent. The results show that LGF has the largest positive impact on the\nfitness of the evolved solutions. SGF and polarisation also contribute, but all\nother capabilities essentially increase the search space, effectively making it\nmore difficult to achieve a solution. By perturbing the evolved solutions, we\nfound that they are highly robust to both mutations and wounding. In addition,\nwe observed that by evolving solutions in more unstable environments they\nproduce structures that were more robust and adaptive. In conclusion, our\nresults suggest that robust collective behaviour is most likely to evolve when\ncells are endowed with long range communication, cell polarisation, and\nselection pressure from an unstable environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 14:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 12:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

The\ninstanton partition functions for arbitrary $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills\ntheories with $A_n$ and $A^{(1)}_n$ type quiver diagrams are compactly\nexpressed as a product of four building blocks: Gaiotto state, dilatation,\nflavor vertex operator and intertwiner which are written in terms of SH$^c$ and\nthe orthogonal basis introduced by Alba, Fateev, Litvinov and Tarnopolskiy.\nThese building blocks are characterized by new conditions which generalize the\nknown ones on the Gaiotto state and the Carlsson-Okounkov vertex.

For these droplets, clogging at the hopper exit requires a narrow hopper\nopening only slightly larger than the droplet diameter. The second experiments\nuse soft hydrogel particles in a thin sample chamber, where we vary gravity by\nchanging the tilt angle of the chamber. For reduced gravity, clogging becomes\neasier, and can occur for larger hopper openings.

The fractional amount a single particle is deformed under its own\nweight is a useful parameter measuring particle softness.

Energy and\nmomentum conservation results in a single resonant peak in the tunnel\nconductance between two 2D layers as has been experimentally observed for two\nquantum wells (QW) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. The account for SOI in the\nlayers leads to a complex pattern in the tunneling characteristic with typical\nfeatures corresponding to SOI energy. For this manifestation of SOI to be\nobserved experimentally the characteristic energy should exceed the resonant\nbroadening related to the particles quantum lifetime in the layers. We perform\nan accurate analysis of the known experimental data on electron and hole 2D-2D\ntunneling in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures. It appears that for the electron\ntunneling the manifestation of SOI is difficult to observe, but for the holes\ntunneling the parameters of the real structures used in the experiments are\nvery close to those required by the resolution criteria. We also consider a new\npromising candidate for the effect to be observed, that is p-doped SiGe\nstrained heterostructures. The reported parameters of cubic Rashba SOI and\nquantum lifetime in strained Ge QWs fabricated up to date already match the\ncriteria for observing SOI in 2D-2D heavy holes tunneling. As supported by our\ncalculations small adjustments of the parameters for AlGaAs/GaAs p-type QWs or\nsimply designing a 2D-2D tunneling experiment for SiGe case are very likely to\nreveal the SOI features in the 2D-2D tunneling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 15:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

But this requires obtaining the distribution\nin the biologically relevant high-scoring region, where the probabilities are\nexponentially small. For gapless local alignments of infinitely long sequences\nthis distribution is known analytically to follow a Gumbel distribution.\nDistributions for gapped local alignments and global alignments of finite\nlengths can only be obtained numerically. To obtain result for the\nsmall-probability region, specific statistical mechanics-based rare-event\nalgorithms can be applied. In previous studies, this was achieved for pairwise\nalignments. They showed that, contrary to results from previous simple sampling\nstudies, strong deviations from the Gumbel distribution occur in case of finite\nsequence lengths. Here we extend the studies to the for practical applications\nin Molecular Biology much more relevant case of multiple sequence alignments\nwith gaps. We study the distributions of scores over a large range of the\nsupport, reaching probabilities as small as 10^-160, for global and local\n(sum-of-pair scores) multiple alignments. We find that even after suitable\nrescaling, eliminating the sequence-length dependence, the distributions for\nmultiple alignment differ from the pairwise alignment case. Furthermore, we\nalso show that the previously discussed Gaussian correction to the Gumbel\ndistribution needs to be refined, also for the case of pairwise alignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 16:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
