The lighter dark\nmatter candidate is protected from decaying into the standard model particles\nby a remnant $Z_2$ symmetry into which the abelian gauge symmetry gets\nspontaneously broken. If the mass of the dark matter particle is chosen to be\nwithin $31-40$ GeV, then this model can also explain the galactic center gamma\nray excess if the dark matter annihilation into $b\\bar{b}$ pairs has a cross\nsection of $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\simeq (1.4-2.0) \\times 10^{-26} \\;\n\\text{cm}^3/\\text{s}$.

Demographically, the\nrisk of occurrence increases until old age. Here we present a novel\ncomputational model to reproduce the probability of glioma incidence across the\nlifespan. Previous mathematical models explaining glioma incidence are framed\nin a rather abstract way, and do not directly relate to empirical findings. To\ndecrease this gap between theory and experimental observations, we incorporate\nrecent data on cellular and molecular factors underlying gliomagenesis. Since\nevidence implicates the adult neural stem cell as the likely cell-of-origin of\nglioma, we have incorporated empirically-determined estimates of neural stem\ncell number, cell division rate, mutation rate and oncogenic potential into our\nmodel. We demonstrate that our model yields results which match actual\ndemographic data in the human population. In particular, this model accounts\nfor the observed peak incidence of glioma at approximately 80 years of age,\nwithout the need to assert differential susceptibility throughout the\npopulation. Overall, our model supports the hypothesis that glioma is caused by\nrandomly-occurring oncogenic mutations within the neural stem cell population.\nBased on this model, we assess the influence of the (experimentally indicated)\ndecrease in the number of neural stem cells and increase of cell division rate\nduring aging. Our model provides multiple testable predictions, and suggests\nthat different temporal sequences of oncogenic mutations can lead to\ntumorigenesis. Finally, we conclude that four or five oncogenic mutations are\nsufficient for the formation of glioma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 17:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}

Numerical methods of the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)\ntype are considered for simulating waves that satisfy the Helmholtz and Maxwell\nequations. It is shown that these methods, when wrongly used, give rise to\nsingular systems for complex wavenumbers. A sufficient condition on the HDG\nstabilization parameter for guaranteeing unique solvability of the numerical\nHDG system, both for Helmholtz and Maxwell systems, is obtained for complex\nwavenumbers. For real wavenumbers, results from a dispersion analysis are\npresented. An asymptotic expansion of the dispersion relation, as the number of\nmesh elements per wave increase, reveal that some choices of the stabilization\nparameter are better than others. To summarize the findings, there are values\nof the HDG stabilization parameter that will cause the HDG method to fail for\ncomplex wavenumbers. However, this failure is remedied if the real part of the\nstabilization parameter has the opposite sign of the imaginary part of the\nwavenumber. When the wavenumber is real, values of the stabilization parameter\nthat asymptotically minimize the HDG wavenumber errors are found on the\nimaginary axis. Finally, a dispersion analysis of the mixed hybrid\nRaviart-Thomas method showed that its wavenumber errors are an order smaller\nthan those of the HDG method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 20:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}

In this paper, we analyze for\nseveral relay coding schemes the maximum energy gain provided by a relay,\ntaking into account the additional relay-generated interference to neighboring\ncells. First, we define spatial areas for relaying efficiency in log-normal\nshadowing environments and propose three easily-computable and tractable\nmodels. These models allow the prediction of 1) the probability of\nenergy-efficient relaying, 2) the spatial distribution of energy consumption\nwithin a cell and 3) the average interference generated by relays. Second, we\ndefine a new performance metric that jointly captures both aspects of energy\nand interference, and characterize the optimal number and location of relays.\nThese results are obtainable with significantly lower complexity and execution\ntime when applying the proposed models as compared to system simulations.We\nhighlight that energy-efficient relay deployment does not necessarily lead to\ninterference reduction and conversely, an interference-aware deployment is\nsuboptimal in the energy consumption. We then propose a map showing the optimal\nutilization of relay coding schemes across a cell. This map combines two-hop\nrelaying and energy-optimized partial decode-forward as a function of their\nrespective circuitry consumption. Such a combination not only alleviates the\ninterference issue, but also leads to a reduction in the number of relays\nrequired for the same performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 22:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

This prior\ninformation about the spatial sparseness of structural damage is exploited here\nby a hierarchical sparse Bayesian learning framework with the goal of reducing\nthe source of ill-conditioning in the stiffness loss inversion problem for\ndamage detection. Sparse Bayesian learning methodologies automatically prune\naway irrelevant or inactive features from a set of potential candidates, and so\nthey are effective probabilistic tools for producing sparse explanatory\nsubsets. We have previously proposed such an approach to establish the\nprobability of localized stiffness reductions that serve as a proxy for damage\nby using noisy incomplete modal data from before and after possible damage. The\ncore idea centers on a specific hierarchical Bayesian model that promotes\nspatial sparseness in the inferred stiffness reductions in a way that is\nconsistent with the Bayesian Ockham razor. In this paper, we improve the theory\nof our previously proposed sparse Bayesian learning approach by eliminating an\napproximation and, more importantly, incorporating a constraint on stiffness\nincreases. Our approach has many appealing features that are summarized at the\nend of the paper. We validate the approach by applying it to the Phase II\nsimulated and experimental benchmark studies sponsored by the IASC-ASCE Task\nGroup on Structural Health Monitoring.

A user might demand\nfor speed up (reduced wait time) for some of the jobs present in the queue at\nrun time. In such cases, it is required to accelerate (directly sending the job\nto the server) urgent jobs (requesting for speed up) ahead of other jobs\npresent in the queue for an earlier completion of urgent jobs.

While the generalized entropy theory (GET) explains the influence of\nvarious molecular details on polymer glass formation, the application of the\nGET has heretofore been limited to the use of the simplest polymer model in\nwhich all united atom groups within the monomers of a species interact with a\ncommon monomer averaged van der Waals energy. However, energetic\nheterogeneities are ubiquitous within the monomers of real polymers, and their\nimplications for polymer glass formation remain to be investigated\ntheoretically. This paper uses an extension of the GET to explore the influence\nof energetic heterogeneities within monomers upon the nature of polymer glass\nformation. The present paper focuses on establishing general trends for the\nvariation of characteristic properties of glass formation, such as the isobaric\nfragility parameter $m_P$ and the glass transition temperature $T_g$, with\nmolecular details, such as the specific interactions and chain stiffness. Our\ncomputations confirm that the previously used model with monomer averaged\ninteractions correctly captures general trends in the variation of $m_P$ and\n$T_g$ with various molecular parameters. More importantly, adjustment of the\nenergetic heterogeneities within monomers alone are shown to provide an\nefficient mechanism for tailoring the properties of glass-forming polymers. The\nvariations of polymer properties along iso-fragility and iso-$T_g$ lines are\nillustrated as important design tools for exhibiting the combined influence of\nspecific interactions and chain stiffness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 14:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Their spin periods (2-12 s) and spin-down rates (~10^{-13}-10^{-10}\ns/s) indicate external dipole fields of ~10^{13-15} G, and there is evidence\nthat even stronger magnetic fields are present inside the star and in\nnon-dipolar magnetospheric components.

In this\nfield-theoretic model, spin interactions are mediated by a single scalar gauge\nboson in its antisymmetric tensor formulation. We show that these long range\nspin interactions induce a gauge invariant photon mass in the one-loop\neffective action. The fermion loop generates a coupling between photons and the\nspin gauge boson, which acquires thus charge. This coupling represents also an\ninduced, gauge invariant, topological mass for the photons, leading to the\nMeissner effect. The one-loop effective equations of motion for the charged\nspin gauge boson are the London equations. We propose thus spin gauge\ninteractions as an alternative, topological mechanism for superconductivity in\nwhich no spontaneous symmetry breaking is involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 15:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Overall, our findings suggest that the level of\ninterconnection and position of institutions in the financial network are\nimportant elements to measure systemic risk and identify SIFIs.
