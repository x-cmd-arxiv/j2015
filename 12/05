We find significant scaling anisotropy with\nrespect to both these directions: the fluctuations are \"ribbon-like\" ---\nstatistically, they are elongated along both the mean magnetic field and the\nfluctuating field. The latter form of anisotropy is due to scale-dependent\nalignment of the fluctuating fields. The intermittent scalings of the\n$n$th-order conditional structure functions in the direction perpendicular to\nboth the local mean field and the fluctuations agree well with the theory of\nChandran et al. 2015, while the parallel scalings are consistent with those\nimplied by the critical-balance conjecture. We quantify the relationship\nbetween the perpendicular scalings and those in the fluctuation and parallel\ndirections, and find that the scaling exponent of the perpendicular anisotropy\n(i.e., of the aspect ratio of the Alfv\\'enic structures in the plane\nperpendicular to the mean magnetic field) depends on the amplitude of the\nfluctuations. This is shown to be equivalent to the anticorrelation of\nfluctuation amplitude and alignment at each scale. The dependence of the\nanisotropy on amplitude is shown to be more significant for the anisotropy\nbetween the perpendicular and fluctuation-direction scales than it is between\nthe perpendicular and parallel scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 16:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The distinguishing number $D(H)$\nis the least integer $d$ such that $H$ has a $d$-distinguishing coloring. A\n$d$-distinguishing coloring is a coloring $c:V(H)\\rightarrow\\{1,\\dots,d\\}$\ninvariant only under the trivial automorphism. In this paper, we continue the\nstudy of a game variant of this parameter, recently introduced. The\ndistinguishing game is a game with two players, Gentle and Rascal, with\nantagonist goals. This game is played on a graph $H$ with a fixed set of\n$d\\in\\mathbb N^*$ colors. Alternately, the two players choose a vertex of $H$\nand color it with one of the $d$ colors. The game ends when all the vertices\nhave been colored. Then Gentle wins if the coloring is $d$-distinguishing and\nRascal wins otherwise. This game defines two new invariants, which are the\nminimum numbers of colors needed to ensure that Gentle has a winning strategy,\ndepending who starts the game. The invariant could eventually be infinite. In\nthis paper, we focus on cartesian product, a graph operation well studied in\nthe classical case. We give sufficient conditions on the order of two connected\nfactors $H$ and $F$ relatively prime, which ensure that one of the game\ndistinguishing numbers of the cartesian product $H\\square F$ is finite. If $H$\nis a so-called involutive graph, we give an upper bound of order $D^2(H)$ for\none of the game distinguishing numbers of $H\\square F$. Finally, using in part\nthe previous result, we compute the exact value of these invariants for\ncartesian products of relatively prime cycles. It turns out that the value is\neither infinite or equal to $2$, depending on the parity of the product order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 16:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

A method commonly used in order\nto determine such functions is the so-called cloning algorithm which in its\nnon-constant population version essentially reduces to the determination of the\ngrowth rate of a population, averaged over many realizations of the dynamics.\nHowever, the averaging of populations is highly dependent not only on the\nnumber of realizations of the population dynamics, and on the initial\npopulation size but also on the cut-off time (or population) considered to stop\ntheir numerical evolution. This may result in an over-influence of discreteness\neffects at initial times, caused by small population size. We overcome these\neffects by introducing a (realization-dependent) time delay in the evolution of\npopulations, additional to the discarding of the initial transient regime of\nthe population growth where these discreteness effects are strong.

Here we show\nthat when the ac drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry\ndirection, it is possible to realize a transverse ratchet effect where a net dc\nflow of vortices is generated perpendicular to the ac drive. The conformal\ntransverse ratchet effect is distinct from previous versions of transverse\nratchets in that it occurs due to the generation of non-Gaussian transverse\nvortex velocity fluctuations by the plastic motion of vortices, so that the\nsystem behaves as a noise correlation ratchet. The transverse ratchet effect is\nmuch more pronounced in the conformal arrays than in random gradient arrays,\nand is absent in square gradient arrays due the different nature of the vortex\nflow in each geometry. We show that a series of reversals can occur in the\ntransverse ratchet effect due to changes in the vortex flow across the pinning\ngradient as a function of vortex filling, pinning strength, and ac amplitude.\nWe also consider the case where a dc drive applied perpendicular to the\nsubstrate asymmetry direction generates a net flow of vortices perpendicular to\nthe dc drive, producing a geometric or drift ratchet that arises due to\nnon-Gaussian dynamically generated fluctuations. The drift ratchet is more\nefficient than the ac driven ratchet and also exhibits a series of reversals\nfor varied parameters. Our results should be general to a wide class of systems\nundergoing nonequilibrium dynamics on conformal substrates, such as colloidal\nparticles on optical traps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 18:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Progressive segmentation of these continuous fields yields spatial\nnetworks with rank-size distributions having slopes near -1 for a wide range of\nthresholds. We consider a general explanation for this scaling that does not\nrequire different processes for each type of land cover.

Progressive segmentation of two types of random continuous\nfield results in progressions of growing spatial networks with components that\nachieve unity power law rank-size distributions immediately before explosive\npercolation occurs. This suggests that the scaling properties and uniform area\ndistribution implied by a unity power law rank-size distribution may be a\ngeneral characteristic of bounded spatial networks produced by segmenting some\ncontinuous fields.

A rough\nestimate of the width of these states, based on the mean free path of the\nexchanged mesons in the nuclei leads to very broad states with $\\Gamma \\sim$ 80\nand 110 MeV for N*-$^3$He and N*-$^{24}$Mg respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 20:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

This is a\nhighly automated code suitable for analyzing the spectra of large spectroscopic\nsurveys with low or medium spectral resolution (R=2,000-20,000). Methods: After\nthe astrophysical calibration of the oscillator strengths of 4643 absorption\nlines covering the wavelength ranges 5212-6860\\AA\\ and 8400-8924\\AA, we\nconstructed a library that contains the equivalent widths (EW) of these lines\nfor a grid of stellar parameters. The EWs of each line are fit by a polynomial\nfunction that describes the EW of the line as a function of the stellar\nparameters. The coefficients of these polynomial functions are stored in a\nlibrary called the \"$GCOG$ library\". SP_Ace, a code written in FORTRAN95, uses\nthe GCOG library to compute the EWs of the lines, constructs models of spectra\nas a function of the stellar parameters and abundances, and searches for the\nmodel that minimizes the $\\chi^2$ deviation when compared to the observed\nspectrum. The code has been tested on synthetic and real spectra for a wide\nrange of signal-to-noise and spectral resolutions. Results: SP_Ace derives\nstellar parameters such as Teff, log g, [M/H], and chemical abundances of up to\nten elements for low to medium resolution spectra of FGK-type stars with\nprecision comparable to the one usually obtained with spectra of higher\nresolution. Systematic errors in stellar parameters and chemical abundances are\npresented and identified with tests on synthetic and real spectra. Stochastic\nerrors are automatically estimated by the code for all the parameters.

In this paper, we show that\nunresolved multiple star systems can affect the ellipticity and size of the PSF\nand that this effect is not cancelled even when using many stars in the\nreconstruction process. We estimate the error in the reconstruction of the PSF\ndue to the binaries in the star sample both analytically and with image\nsimulations for different PSFs and stellar populations. The simulations support\nour analytical finding that the error on the size of the PSF is a function of\nthe multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of the\nPSF, i.e. if all stars were single. Similarly, the modification of each of the\ncomplex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiple\nstars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity. Using image simulations, we\nalso show that the predicted error in the PSF shape is a theoretical limit that\ncan be reached only if large number of stars (up to thousands) are used\ntogether to build the PSF at any desired spatial position. For a lower number\nof stars, the PSF reconstruction is worse.

The main site of production of the r-process\nelements (such as europium) has been debated for nearly 60 years. Initial\nstudies of chemical abundance trends in old Milky Way halo stars suggested\ncontinual r-process production, in sites like core-collapse supernovae. But\nevidence from the local Universe favors r-process production mainly during rare\nevents, such as neutron star mergers. The appearance of a europium abundance\nplateau in some dwarf spheroidal galaxies has been suggested as evidence for\nrare r-process enrichment in the early Universe, but only under the assumption\nof no gas accretion into the dwarf galaxies. Cosmologically motivated gas\naccretion favors continual r-process enrichment in these systems. Furthermore,\nthe universal r-process pattern has not been cleanly identified in dwarf\nspheroidals. The smaller, chemically simpler, and more ancient ultra-faint\ndwarf galaxies assembled shortly after the first stars formed, and are ideal\nsystems with which to study nucleosynthesis events such as the r-process.\nReticulum II is one such galaxy. The abundances of non-neutron-capture elements\nin this galaxy (and others like it) are similar to those of other old stars.\nHere, we report that seven of nine stars in Reticulum II observed with\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy show strong enhancements in heavy neutron-capture\nelements, with abundances that follow the universal r-process pattern above\nbarium. The enhancement in this \"r-process galaxy\" is 2-3 orders of magnitude\nhigher than that detected in any other ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. This implies\nthat a single rare event produced the r-process material in Reticulum II.

The interpixel capacitance (IPC) responsible for the crosstalk affects\nthe point-spread function (PSF) of the telescope, increasing the size and\nmodifying the shape of all objects in the images while correlating the Poisson\nnoise. Upcoming weak lensing surveys that use these detectors, such as WFIRST,\nplace stringent requirements on the PSF size and shape (and the level at which\nthese are known), which in turn must be translated into requirements on IPC. To\nfacilitate this process, we present a first study of the effect of IPC on\nWFIRST PSF sizes and shapes. Realistic PSFs are forward-simulated from physical\nprinciples for each WFIRST bandpass. We explore how the PSF size and shape\ndepends on the range of IPC coupling with pixels that are connected along an\nedge or corner; for the expected level of IPC in WFIRST, IPC increases the PSF\nsizes by $\\sim$5\\%. We present a linear fitting formula that describes the\nuncertainty in the PSF size or shape due to uncertainty in the IPC, which could\narise for example due to unknown time evolution of IPC as the detectors age or\ndue to spatial variation of IPC across the detector.

The\nfluids have different viscosities, but are density matched to focus on\nMarangoni effects. The fluids flow between two flat plates, which are\nmaintained at different solute concentrations. This establishes a constant flux\nof solute from one fluid to the other in the base state. A linear stability\nanalysis is performed, using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods.\nIn the creeping flow regime, Marangoni stresses destabilize the flow, provided\na concentration gradient is maintained across the fluids. One long wave and two\nshort wave Marangoni instability modes arise, in different regions of parameter\nspace. A well-defined condition for the long wave instability is determined in\nterms of the viscosity and thickness ratios of the fluids, and the direction of\nmass transfer. Energy budget calculations show that the Marangoni stresses that\ndrive long and short wave instabilities have distinct origins. The former is\ncaused by interface deformation while the latter is associated with convection\nby the disturbance flow. Consequently, even when the interface is non-deforming\n(in the large interfacial tension limit), the flow can become unstable to short\nwave disturbances. On increasing $Re$, the viscosity-induced interfacial\ninstability comes into play.

Step-selection analysis deals with this\nproblem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each used\nstep (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set\nof available steps randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or\ntheir characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach,\ntermed integrated step-selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit\nassumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their\ntemporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA\nrelies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource-selection parameters,\nthus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a\nmechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as\nwell as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations,\nwe evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to\ncurrently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general,\nflexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological\nhypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2015 03:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

In many situations, we wish to require that the sparsity patterns\nattained honor certain problem-specific constraints. Hierarchical sparse\nmodeling (HSM) refers to situations in which these constraints specify that one\nset of parameters be set to zero whenever another is set to zero. In recent\nyears, numerous papers have developed convex regularizers for this form of\nsparsity structure, which arises in many areas of statistics including\ninteraction modeling, time series analysis, and covariance estimation. In this\npaper, we observe that these methods fall into two frameworks, the group lasso\n(GL) and latent overlapping group lasso (LOG), which have not been\nsystematically compared in the context of HSM.

We present a recursively\nadaptive quantum state tomography (RAQST) protocol for finite dimensional\nquantum systems and experimentally implement the adaptive tomography protocol\non two-qubit systems. In this RAQST protocol, an adaptive measurement strategy\nand a recursive linear regression estimation algorithm are performed. Numerical\nresults show that our RAQST protocol can outperform the tomography protocols\nusing mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and the two-stage MUB adaptive strategy\neven with the simplest product measurements. When nonlocal measurements are\navailable, our RAQST can beat the Gill-Massar bound for a wide range of quantum\nstates with a modest number of copies. We use only the simplest product\nmeasurements to implement two-qubit tomography experiments. In the experiments,\nwe use error-compensation techniques to tackle systematic error due to\nmisalignments and imperfection of wave plates, and achieve about 100-fold\nreduction of the systematic error. The experimental results demonstrate that\nthe improvement of RAQST over nonadaptive tomography is significant for states\nwith a high level of purity.

The KD is therefore an important model system for\nunderstanding astrophysical magnetism. Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This\nsupersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the\nconcept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the\ndiffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being\nchaotic is given in either case.

We exploit this\ninteraction to directly measure the parity and Wigner functions of ion motional\nstates. The nonlinear coupling, combined with near perfect control of internal\nand motional states of trapped ions, can be applied to quantum computing,\nquantum thermodynamics, and even shed some light on the quantum information\naspects of Hawking radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2015 14:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-24"}

Fluctuations\nare unavoidable for a physical neutron star magnetosphere. Young pulsars have\nmeaningful braking indices, while old pulsars' and magnetars' fluctuation item\ndominates their frequency second derivatives.
