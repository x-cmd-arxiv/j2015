Both possibilities can be tested by measurements of\ncosmological structure formation. In this paper we elaborate the details of\nsuch tests using the Galileon model as a case study. We pay attention to the\npossibility that each new degree of freedom may have stochastically independent\ninitial conditions, generating different types of potential well in the early\nuniverse and breaking complete correlation between density and velocity power\nspectra. This 'stochastic bias' can confuse schemes to parametrize the\npredictions of modified gravity models, such as the use of the growth parameter\nf alone. Using data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey we show that it will be\npossible to obtain constraints using information about the cosmological-scale\nforce law embedded in the multipole power spectra of redshift-space\ndistortions. As an example, we obtain an upper limit on the strength of the\nconformal coupling to matter in the cubic Galileon model, giving |1/M| < 200 /\nMp. This allows the fifth-force to be stronger than gravity, but is consistent\nwith zero coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 16:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 09:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

As a\nresult, the field equations admit solutions describing wormholes whose throat\nsize is typically of the order of the inverse graviton mass. Hence, they are as\nlarge as the universe, so that in principle we might all live in a giant\nwormhole. The wormholes can be of two different types that we call W1 and W2.\nThe W1 wormholes interpolate between the AdS spaces and have Killing horizons\nshielding the throat. The Fierz-Pauli graviton mass for these solutions becomes\nimaginary in the AdS zone, hence the gravitons behave as tachyons, but since\nthe Breitenlohner-Freedman bound is fulfilled, there should be no tachyon\ninstability. For the W2 wormholes the g-geometry is globally regular and in the\nfar field zone it becomes the AdS up to subleading terms, its throat can be\ntraversed by timelike geodesics, while the f-geometry has a completely\ndifferent structure and is not geodesically complete.

Geometric and physical constraints on the absorber can be\ndeduced from the reprocessed AGN emission. In particular, the obscuring gas may\nreprocess the nuclear X-ray emission producing a narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ line and a\nCompton reflection hump. In recent years, models of the X-ray reflection from\nan obscuring torus have been computed; however, although the reflecting gas may\nbe dusty, the models do not yet take into account the effects of dust on the\npredicted spectrum. We study this problem by analyzing two sets of models, with\nand without the presence of dust, using the one dimensional photo-ionization\ncode Cloudy. The calculations are performed for a range of column densities\n($22 <{\\rm log}[N_H(\\rm cm^{-2})]< 24.5$ ) and hydrogen densities ( $6 <{\\rm\nlog}[n_H(\\rm cm^{-3})]< 8$). The calculations show the presence of dust can\nenhance the Fe K$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) in the reflected spectrum by\nfactors up to $\\approx$ 8 for Compton thick (CT) gas and a typical ISM grain\nsize distribution. The enhancement in EW with respect to the reflection\ncontinuum is due to the reduction in the reflected continuum intensity caused\nby the anisotropic scattering behaviour of dust grains. This effect will be\nmost relevant for reflection from distant, predominately neutral gas, and is a\npossible explanation for AGNs which show a strong Fe K$\\alpha$ EW and a\nrelatively weak reflection continuum. Our results show it is an important to\ntake into account dust while modeling the X-ray reflection spectrum, and that\ninferring a CT column density from an observed Fe K$\\alpha$ EW may not always\nbe valid.

For the seven PNe with the best UV line\ndetections, we conclude that summed abundances from direct diagnostics of ions\nwith measurable UV lines gives the most accurate values for the total elemental\nabundances of C and N. In some cases where significant discrepancies exist\nbetween our abundances and those from other studies, we show that the\ndifferences can often be attributed to their use of fluxes that are not\nco-spatial.

We interpret the formation\nprocess in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),\nwhich is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our\nsimulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is\ndivided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with\ntransverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is\ninduced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all\ntimes. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational\nacceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,\nand size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.\nBipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of\nparameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher\nstratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the\nturbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux\nconcentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The\nmagnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength\nuntil the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the\nturbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to\nbecome stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out\nto be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,\nwe find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is\nindicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux\nconcentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging\nflows. These findings imply that NEMPI is responsible for magnetic flux\nconcentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 20:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 00:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 13:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 12:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Upon injection of\ntwo photons (corresponding to weak coherent driving), the resonance\nfluorescence and photon correlations are shaped by the effective qubit\ntransition frequencies and decay rates, which are substantially modified by\ninterference effects. In contrast to the well-known result in an infinite\nwaveguide, photons reflected by a single 2LS coupled to a semi-infinite\nwaveguide are initially bunched, a result that can be simply explained by\nstimulated emission. As the number of 2LS increases (up to 10 are considered\nhere), rapid oscillations build up in the correlations that persist for a very\nlong time. For instance, when the incoming photons are slightly detuned, the\ntransmitted photons in the infinite waveguide are highly antibunched. On the\nother hand, upon resonant driving, incoherently reflected photons are mostly\ndistributed within the photonic band gap and several sharp side peaks. These\nfeatures can be explained by considering the poles of the single particle Green\nfunction in the Markovian regime combined with the time delay.

In the proposed multiscale method, additional multiscale basis functions\nare used to represent the long fractures, while short-size fractures are\ncollectively represented by a single basis functions. The procedure is\nautomatically done via local spectral problems. In this regard, our approach\nshares common concepts with several approaches proposed in the literature as we\ndiscuss. Numerical results are presented where we demonstrate how one can\nadaptively add basis functions in the regions of interest based on error\nindicators. We also discuss the use of randomized snapshots\n(\\cite{randomized2014}) which reduces the offline computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 21:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-16"}

The small-scale fluctuating dynamics are described by a\nmagnetically-modified quasi-geostrophic equation set, and the large-scale mean\ndynamics are governed by a diagnostic thermal wind balance. The model utilizes\nthree timescales that respectively characterize the convective timescale, the\nlarge-scale magnetic evolution timescale, and the large-scale thermal evolution\ntimescale. Distinct equations are derived for the cases of order one and low\nmagnetic Prandtl number. It is shown that the low magnetic Prandtl number model\nis characterized by a magnetic to kinetic energy ratio that is asymptotically\nlarge, with ohmic dissipation dominating viscous dissipation on the\nlarge-scales. For the order one magnetic Prandtl number model the magnetic and\nkinetic energies are equipartitioned and both ohmic and viscous dissipation are\nweak on the large-scales; large-scale ohmic dissipation occurs in thin magnetic\nboundary layers adjacent to the solid boundaries.

We give a simple procedure to construct rational homology\ncobordisms between plumbed 3-manifold. We introduce a family F of plumbed\n3-manifolds with first Betti number equal to 1. By adapting an obstruction\nbased on Donaldson's diagonalization theorem we characterize all manifolds in F\nthat bound rational homology $S^1\\times D^3$'s. For all these manifolds a\nrational homology cobordism to $S^1\\times S^2$ can be constructed via our\nprocedure. The family F is large enough to include all Seifert fibered spaces\nover the 2-sphere with vanishing Euler invariant. In a subsequent paper we\ndescribe applications to arborescent link concordance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:26:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 12:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

It is observed that for the global properties of rotating\nsuperfluid neutron stars in particular, the Kepler limit is modified compared\nwith the case that does not include the contribution of $\\rho$ mesons in the\nentrainment effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 09:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

To cope with demanding analysis such as optimization and\nreliability, surrogate models (a.k.a meta-models) have been increasingly\ninvestigated in the last decade. Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) and Kriging\nare two popular non-intrusive meta-modelling techniques. PCE surrogates the\ncomputational model with a series of orthonormal polynomials in the input\nvariables where polynomials are chosen in coherency with the probability\ndistributions of those input variables. On the other hand, Kriging assumes that\nthe computer model behaves as a realization of a Gaussian random process whose\nparameters are estimated from the available computer runs, i.e. input vectors\nand response values. These two techniques have been developed more or less in\nparallel so far with little interaction between the researchers in the two\nfields. In this paper, PC-Kriging is derived as a new non-intrusive\nmeta-modeling approach combining PCE and Kriging. A sparse set of orthonormal\npolynomials (PCE) approximates the global behavior of the computational model\nwhereas Kriging manages the local variability of the model output. An adaptive\nalgorithm similar to the least angle regression algorithm determines the\noptimal sparse set of polynomials. PC-Kriging is validated on various benchmark\nanalytical functions which are easy to sample for reference results. From the\nnumerical investigations it is concluded that PC-Kriging performs better than\nor at least as good as the two distinct meta-modeling techniques. A larger gain\nin accuracy is obtained when the experimental design has a limited size, which\nis an asset when dealing with demanding computational models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 10:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-16"}

To\nshed light on the nature of this phenomenon and provide a reference for future\ntheoretical work, we study the entire sample of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer\ndata of type II bursts from the Rapid Burster (MXB 1730-335). We find that type\nII bursts are Eddington-limited in flux, that a larger amount of energy goes in\nthe bursts than in the persistent emission, that type II bursts can be as short\nas 0.130 s, and that the distribution of recurrence times drops abruptly below\n15-18 s. We highlight the complicated feedback between type II bursts and the\nNS surface thermonuclear explosions known as type I bursts, and between type II\nbursts and the persistent emission. We review a number of models for type II\nbursts. While no model can reproduce all the observed burst properties and\nexplain the source uniqueness, models involving a gating role for the magnetic\nfield come closest to matching the properties of our sample. The uniqueness of\nthe source may be explained by a special combination of magnetic field\nstrength, stellar spin period and alignment between the magnetic field and the\nspin axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 10:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The propagation and damping of these waves may play relevant roles\nfor the transport and dissipation of energy in the solar atmospheric medium.\nHowever, in the atmospheric plasma dissipation of transverse MHD wave energy by\nviscosity or resistivity needs very small spatial scales to be efficient. Here,\nwe theoretically investigate the generation of small scales in nonuniform solar\nmagnetic flux tubes due to phase mixing of MHD kink waves. We go beyond the\nusual approach based on the existence of a global quasi-mode that is damped in\ntime due to resonant absorption. Instead, we use a modal expansion to express\nthe MHD kink wave as a superposition of Alfv\\'en continuum modes that are phase\nmixed as time evolves. The comparison of the two techniques evidences that the\nmodal analysis is more physically transparent and describes both the damping of\nglobal kink motions and the building up of small scales due to phase mixing. In\naddition, we discuss that the processes of resonant absorption and phase mixing\nare intimately linked. They represent two aspects of the same underlying\nphysical mechanism: the energy cascade from large scales to small scales due to\nnaturally occurring plasma and/or magnetic field inhomogeneities. This process\nmay provide the necessary scenario for efficient dissipation of transverse MHD\nwave energy in the solar atmospheric plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 11:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For GRGs with radio components offset from\nthe radio axis, there is a clear influence of the environment with lobes\nappearing to be deflected away from overdensities in the surrounding medium.\nFurthermore, the GRG lobes tend to be normal to the plane defined by the galaxy\nneighbourhood close to the host. This indicates the tendency for lobes to grow\nto giant sizes in directions that avoid dense regions on both small and large\nscales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 11:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-16"}

This\npaper analyzes to what extent provably effective and efficient preprocessing is\npossible for F-Minor-Free Deletion. Fomin et al. (FOCS 2012) showed that the\nspecial case Planar F-Deletion (when F contains at least one planar graph) has\na kernel of size f(F) * k^{g(F)} for some functions f and g. The degree g of\nthe polynomial grows very quickly; it is not even known to be computable. Fomin\net al. left open whether Planar F-Deletion has kernels whose size is uniformly\npolynomial, i.e., of the form f(F) * k^c for some universal constant c that\ndoes not depend on F. Our results in this paper are twofold. (1) We prove that\nsome Planar F-Deletion problems do not have uniformly polynomial kernels\n(unless NP is in coNP/poly). In particular, we prove that Treewidth-Eta\nDeletion does not have a kernel with O(k^{eta/4} - eps) vertices for any eps >\n0, unless NP is in coNP/poly.

However, we prove that\neven when F contains a path, the degree of the polynomial must, in general,\ndepend on the set F. (2) A canonical F-Minor-Free Deletion problem when F\ncontains a path is Treedepth-eta Deletion: can k vertices be removed to obtain\na graph of treedepth at most eta? We prove that Treedepth-eta Deletion admits\nuniformly polynomial kernels with O(k^6) vertices for every fixed eta.

On the other hand, the standard basis method is very effective for\nthe computation in a special kind of localized rings, but for a general\nsemigroup order the geometry of the localization of a positive-dimensional\nideal is difficult to interpret.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new ideal operation called extraction. For an\nideal $I$ in a polynomial ring $K[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ over a field $K$, we use\nanother ideal $J$ to control the primary components of $I$ and the result\n$\\beta(I,J)$ is called the extraction of $I$ by $J$.

In the first step, called the S-matrix bootstrap, the\nscattering matrix, is determined from its properties. In developing a defect\nform factor program the first step is the T-matrix bootstrap. Interacting\nintegrable defect theories are purely transmitting and topological. We analyze\nboth operators localized in the bulk and also on the defect. By finding their\nsolutions, the spectral representation of any correlator can be determined.\n  Next we consider the model on the lattice. The lattice approach allows to\nobtain both massive and massless excited TBA equations by studying the\ncontinuum scaling limit of the associated integrable lattice models. The most\nimportant input from the lattice approach is an insight into the analytic\nstructure of the excited state solutions of the TBA equations. Previously this\nstructure had to be guessed. In this thesis we turn our attention to the\nsimplest example of a non-unitary minimal theory, namely, the Lee-Yang minimal\nmodel M(2,5). We study the Lee-Yang model on the lattice.

Two dielectric signals are observed at high temperatures, the\n$\\alpha$-process and the relaxation process due to electrode polarization (the\nEP-process). The relaxation time of the EP-process has a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann\ntype of temperature dependence, and the glass transition temperature, $T_{\\rm\ng}$, evaluated from the EP-process agrees very well with the $T_{\\rm g}$\ndetermined from the thermal measurements. The fragility index derived from the\nEP-process increases with decreasing film thickness. The relaxation time and\nthe dielectric relaxation strength of the EP-process are described by a linear\nfunction of the film thickness $d$ for large values of $d$, which can be\nregarded as experimental evidence for the validity of attributing the observed\nsignal to the EP-process. Furthermore, there is distinct deviation from this\nlinear law for thicknesses smaller than a critical value. This deviation\nobserved in thinner films is associated with an increase in the mobility and/or\ndiffusion constant of the charge carriers responsible for the EP-process. The\n$\\alpha$-process is located in a high frequency region than the EP-process at\nhigh temperatures, but merges with the EP-process at lower temperatures near\nthe glass transition region. The thickness dependence of the relaxation time of\nthe $\\alpha$-process is different from that of the EP-process. This suggests\nthat there is decoupling between the segmental motion of the polymers and the\ntranslational motion of the charge carriers in confinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 13:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 07:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We focus here on the\nanalysis of ethylene glycol in the nearest and best studied hot core-like\nregion, Orion-KL. We use ALMA interferometric data because high spatial\nresolution observations allow us to reduce the line confusion problem with\nrespect to single-dish observations since different molecules are expected to\nexhibit different spatial distributions. Furthermore, a large spectral\nbandwidth is needed because many individual transitions are required to\nsecurely detect large organic molecules. Confusion and continuum subtraction\nare major issues and have been handled with care. We have detected the aGg'\nconformer of ethylene glycol in Orion-KL.

We aim to directly confront the simulation results with the infrared\nobservations. Methods: To numerically model the onset and full nonlinear\ndevelopment of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability we take the setup proposed to\ninterpret the observations, and adjust it to a full 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation that includes the dynamics of gas as well as dust. A dust grain\ndistribution with sizes between 5-250 nm is used, exploiting the gas+dust\nmodule of the MPI-AMRVAC code, in which the dust species are represented by\nseveral pressureless dust fluids. The evolution of the model is followed well\ninto the nonlinear phase. The output of these simulations is then used as input\nfor the SKIRT dust radiative transfer code to obtain infrared images at several\nstages of the evolution, which can be compared to the observations. Results: We\nconfirm that a 3D Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is able to develop in the\nproposed setup, and that the formation of the instability is not inhibited by\nthe addition of dust. Kelvin-Helmholtz billows form at the end of the linear\nphase, and synthetic observations of the billows show striking similarities to\nthe infrared observations. It is pointed out that the high density dust regions\npreferentially collect on the flanks of the billows. To get agreement with the\nobserved Kelvin-Helmholtz ripples, the assumed geometry between the background\nradiation, the billows and the observer is seen to be of critical importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 14:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

The asymmetry, which is presumed to be elemental, is\nrepresented by equations of motion and conservation laws that operate\ndifferently over time and space. If, however, the asymmetry was found to be due\nto deeper causes, this conventional view of time evolution would need\nreworking. Here we show, using a sum-over-paths formalism, that a violation of\ntime reversal (T) symmetry might be such a cause. If T symmetry is obeyed, the\nformalism treats time and space symmetrically such that states of matter are\nlocalised both in space and in time. In this case, equations of motion and\nconservation laws are undefined or inapplicable. However if T symmetry is\nviolated, the same sum over paths formalism yields states that are localised in\nspace and distributed without bound over time, creating an asymmetry between\ntime and space. Moreover, the states satisfy an equation of motion (the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation) and conservation laws apply. This suggests that the\ntime-space asymmetry is not elemental as currently presumed, and that T\nviolation may have a deep connection with time evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 14:48:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 03:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

As wind and solar technologies gradually begin to\nsupplant the use of fossil fuels as preferred means of energy production, new\nchallenges are emerging which are unique to the experience of decentralized\npower generation. One such challenge is the development of effective monitoring\ntechnologies to relay diagnostic information from remote energy systems to data\nanalysis centers. The ability to easily obtain, synthesize, and evaluate data\npertaining to the behavior of a potentially vast number of individual power\nsources is of critical importance to the maintainability of the next generation\nof intelligent grid infrastructure.

The United States and\nother industrialized nations in the so-called 'first world' are likely to be\nslow to seriously adopt renewable energy on account of the massive investment\nand infrastructural changes required for its integration into the existing\nelectrical grid.

The\nfrequency of those oscillations are related to the brain functions. However,\nlittle is know about how the oscillating frequency of neural system affects\nneural information transmission in them. In this paper, we investigated how the\nsignal processing in single neuron is modulated by subthreshold membrane\npotential oscillation generated by upstream rhythmic neural activities. We\nfound that the high frequency oscillations facilitate the transferring of\nstrong signals, whereas slow oscillations the weak signals. Though the capacity\nof information convey for weak signal is low in single neuron, it is greatly\nenhanced when weak signals are transferred by multiple pathways with different\noscillation phases. We provided a simple phase plane analysis to explain the\nmechanism for this stimulus-dependent frequency modulation in the leakage\nintegrate-and-fire neuron model. Those results provided a basic understanding\nof how the brain could modulate its information processing simply through\noscillating frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 07:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-30"}
