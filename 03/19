Our\nreference model is a ~10Msun inner shell with 10^51erg ramming into a ~3Msun\ncold outer shell (the circumstellar-medium, or CSM) that extends from 10^15cm\nto 2x10^16cm and moves at 100km/s. We discuss the light curve evolution, which\ncannot be captured adequately with a grey approach. In these interactions, the\nshock-crossing time through the optically-thick CSM is much longer than the\nphoton diffusion time. Radiation is thus continuously leaking from the shock\nthrough the CSM, in disagreement with the shell-shocked model that is often\ninvoked. Our spectra redden with time, with a peak distribution in the near-UV\nduring the first month gradually shifting to the optical range over the\nfollowing year. Initially Balmer lines exhibit a narrow line core and the broad\nline wings that are characteristic of electron scattering in the SNe IIn\natmospheres (CSM). At later times they also exhibit a broad blue shifted\ncomponent which arises from the cold dense shell. Our model results are broadly\nconsistent with the bolometric light curve and spectral evolution observed for\nSN2010jl. Invoking a prolate pole-to-equator density ratio in the CSM, we can\nalso reproduce the ~2% continuum polarisation, and line depolarisation,\nobserved in SN2010jl. By varying the inner shell kinetic energy and the mass\nand extent of the outer shell, a large range of peak luminosities and\ndurations, broadly compatible with super-luminous SNe IIn like 2010jl or\n2006gy, can be produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 16:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

CTA\nwill detect Cherenkov light emitted within an atmospheric shower of particles\ninitiated by cosmic-gamma rays or cosmic rays entering the Earth's atmosphere.\nFrom the combination of images the Cherenkov light produces in the telescopes,\none is able to infer the primary particle energy and direction. A correct\nenergy estimation can be thus performed only if the local atmosphere is well\ncharacterized. The atmosphere not only affects the shower development itself,\nbut also the Cherenkov photon transmission from the emission point in the\nparticle shower, at about 10-20 km above the ground, to the detector. Cherenkov\nlight on the ground is peaked in the UV-blue region, and therefore molecular\nand aerosol extinction phenomena are important. The goal of CTA is to control\nsystematics in energy reconstruction to better than 10%. For this reason, a\ncareful and continuous monitoring and characterization of the atmosphere is\nrequired. In addition, CTA will be operated as an observatory, with data made\npublic along with appropriate analysis tools.

The present work seeks to\nilluminate mechanisms leading to symmetry-breaking and limit cycle behavior\nthat are fundamental to these combustion modes. Specifically, four cases of\nlean premixed methane/air combustion -- two equivalence ratios (0.53 and 0.7)\nand two channel widths (2 and 5mm) -- are investigated in a 2D configuration\nwith constant channel length and bulk inlet velocity, where numerical\nsimulations are performed using detailed chemistry. External wall heating is\nsimulated by imposing a linear temperature gradient as a boundary condition on\nboth walls. In the 2mm-channel, both equivalence ratios produce flames that\nstabilize with symmetric flame fronts after propagating upstream. In the\n5mm-channel, flame fronts start symmetric, although symmetry is broken almost\nimmediately after ignition. Further, 5mm channels produce instationary\ncombustion modes with dramatically different limit cycles: : in the leaner case\n({\\phi} = 0.53), the asymmetric flame front flops periodically, whereas in the\nricher case ({\\phi} = 0.7), flames with repetitive extinctions and ignitions\n(FREI) are observed.

The basic units are: a. the nature of the\narguments involved; b. the membership relation in the set S of arguments; c.\nthe attack relation; and d. the choice of extensions.\n  Generically to add a new aspect (probabilistic, or fuzzy, or temporal, etc)\nto an argumentation network <S,R> can be done by adding this feature to each\ncomponent a-d.

There are two main methods of\ndetermining free flight drag coefficients, or equivalent ballistic\ncoefficients: 1) measuring near and far velocities over a known distance and 2)\nmeasuring a near velocity and time of flight over a known distance. Atmospheric\nconditions must also be known and nearly constant over the flight path. A\nnumber of tradeoffs are important when designing experiments to accurately\ndetermine drag coefficients. The flight distance must be large enough so that\nthe projectile's loss of velocity is significant compared with its initial\nvelocity and much larger than the uncertainty in the near and/or far velocity\nmeasurements. On the other hand, since drag coefficients and ballistic\ncoefficients both depend on velocity, the change in velocity over the flight\npath should be small enough that the average drag coefficient over the path\n(which is what is really determined) is a reasonable approximation to the value\nof drag coefficient at the near and far velocity. This paper considers these\ntradeoffs as well as practical considerations for obtaining accurate near and\nfar velocity measurements and the impact of different sources of error\n(velocity, distance, time, atmospheric conditions, etc.) on the resulting\naccuracy of drag coefficients and ballistic coefficients. For a given level of\naccuracy of various quantities, the method of using near and far velocities\nusually produces drag coefficients with about half the uncertainty of the\nmethod using a near velocity and time of flight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 17:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Different parametric\nand nonparametric models have been considered to address hyperspectral unmixing\nproblems. The simplest one is the linear mixing model. Nevertheless, it has\nbeen recognized that mixing phenomena can also be nonlinear. The corresponding\nnonlinear analysis techniques are necessarily more challenging and complex than\nthose employed for linear unmixing. Within this context, it makes sense to\ndetect the nonlinearly mixed pixels in an image prior to its analysis, and then\nemploy the simplest possible unmixing technique to analyze each pixel. In this\npaper, we propose a technique for detecting nonlinearly mixed pixels. The\ndetection approach is based on the comparison of the reconstruction errors\nusing both a Gaussian process regression model and a linear regression model.\nThe two errors are combined into a detection statistics for which a probability\ndensity function can be reasonably approximated. We also propose an iterative\nendmember extraction algorithm to be employed in combination with the detection\nalgorithm. The proposed Detect-then-Unmix strategy, which consists of\nextracting endmembers, detecting nonlinearly mixed pixels and unmixing, is\ntested with synthetic and real images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 18:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

Introduction.\nAdvanced image and video editing techniques are increasingly common in the\nimage processing and computer vision world, and are also starting to be used in\nmedia entertainment. One common and difficult task closely linked to the world\nof video editing is image and video \" inpainting \". Generally speaking, this is\nthe task of replacing the content of an image or video with some other content\nwhich is visually pleasing. This subject has been extensively studied in the\ncase of images, to such an extent that commercial image inpainting products\ndestined for the general public are available, such as Photoshop's \" Content\nAware fill \" [1]. However, while some impressive results have been obtained in\nthe case of videos, the subject has been studied far less extensively than\nimage inpainting. This relative lack of research can largely be attributed to\nhigh time complexity due to the added temporal dimension. Indeed, it has only\nvery recently become possible to produce good quality inpainting results on\nhigh definition videos, and this only in a semi-automatic manner. Nevertheless,\nhigh-quality video inpainting has many important and useful applications such\nas film restoration, professional post-production in cinema and video editing\nfor personal use. For this reason, we believe that an automatic, generic video\ninpainting algorithm would be extremely useful for both academic and\nprofessional communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 18:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 06:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

These families arise naturally in the study of\npiecewise rotations such as outer billiards. In some cases they exist on all\nscales and can be used to define the fractal dimension of the 'singularity\nset'. This is well-documented for regular N-gons such as the pentagon, octagon\nand dodecagon, whose algebraic complexity is 'quadratic' (EulerPhi[N]/2 = 2).\n  Recent evidence suggests that the geometry of these families is intrinsic to\nthe 'parent' polygon and can be derived independently of any mapping. It is the\npurpose of this paper to show how the First Family for any regular polygon\narises naturally from the geometry of the 'star polygons' first studied by\nThomas Bradwardine (1290-1349).\n  The nucleus of the First Family are the S[k] 'tiles'. Each S[k] tile has a\ncorresponding 'star-point' sk = tan(kPi/N) and a matching scale. Based on a\n1949 result by C.Siegel and S.Chowla, the primitive scales with gcd(k,N) = 1\nform a unit basis for the maximal real subfield of the cyclotomic field of N.\nTraditionally, this subfield has been the source of scaling and rotational\nparameters for affine piecewise rational rotations, and our results show that\nthe First Family scaling can serve as a 'natural' basis for such investigations\n- which include the outer billiards map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 19:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 05:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 18:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2016 19:48:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 17:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The\nanalytically derived spin Landau parameter $F_0^a$ for the half filled band\nuncovers the intrinsic instability of the nondegenerate Hubbard model towards\nferromagnetism --- negative intersite exchange interaction triggers a\nferromagnetic instability at half filling before the metal-insulator\ntransition, indicated by the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility at\n$F_0^a=-1$.

At low temperatures, their\ncharacteristic frequencies exceed the intralayer equilibration rate of the\nelectron liquid, and Coulomb drag may be treated in the collisionless\napproximation. As temperature is raised, the electron mean free path becomes\nshort due to electron-electron scattering. This leads to local equilibration of\nelectron liquid, and consequently drag is determined by hydrodynamic density\nmodes.

The cosmological recombination radiation not only allows\ndetermination of standard cosmological parameters, but also provides a direct\nobservational confirmation for one of the key ingredients of our cosmological\nmodel: the cosmological recombination history. We show that, with present\ntechnology, such experiments are futuristic but feasible. The potential rewards\nwon by opening this new window to the very early universe could be\nconsiderable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 21:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

A main point is that two different concepts, number and number\nvalue are combined in the usual representations of number structures. This is\nvalid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. It\nis not valid when different structures of each number type are being\nconsidered. Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by\nthemselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a\nnumber structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are\ndescribed. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number\nstructures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a\nreal or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as\nscalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. Connections are\ndescribed that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M\nlocations and at neighbor scaling levels. Scalar and vector structure valued\nfields are described and covariant derivatives of these fields are obtained.\nTwo complex vector fields, each with one real and one imaginary field, appear,\nwith one complex field associated with positions in $M$ and the other with\nposition dependent scaling factors. A derivation of the covariant derivative\nfor scalar and vector valued fields gives the same vector fields. The\nderivation shows that the complex vector field associated with scaling fiber\nlevels is the gradient of a complex scalar field. Use of these results in gauge\ntheory shows that the imaginary part of the vector field associated with M\npositions acts like the electromagnetic field.

Traditionally, the macroscopic moment of ordered\nspins in FMs is utilized to write information on magnetic media by a weak\nexternal magnetic field, and the FM stray field is used for reading. However,\nthe latest generation of magnetic random access memories demonstrates a new\nefficient approach in which magnetic fields are replaced by electrical means\nfor reading and writing. This concept may eventually leave the sensitivity of\nFMs to magnetic fields as a mere weakness for retention and the FM stray fields\nas a mere obstacle for high-density memory integration. In this paper we report\na room-temperature bistable antiferromagnetic (AFM) memory which produces\nnegligible stray fields and is inert in strong magnetic fields. We use a\nresistor made of an FeRh AFM whose transition to a FM order 100 degrees above\nroom-temperature, allows us to magnetically set different collective directions\nof Fe moments. Upon cooling to room-temperature, the AFM order sets in with the\ndirection the AFM moments pre-determined by the field and moment direction in\nthe high temperature FM state.

The LAMOST\n(Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope) Spectroscopic\nSurvey of the Galactic anti-center (LSS-GAC) follows a well-defined set of\ncriteria for selecting targets for observations.

Additionally, using an existing Monte Carlo population synthesis\ncode we simulate the population of single DA white dwarfs in the Galactic\nanti-center, under various assumptions. The synthetic populations are passed\nthrough the LSS-GAC selection criteria, taking into account all possible\nobservational biases.

We find that the LSS-GAC set of criteria\nis highly efficient in selecting white dwarfs for spectroscopic observations\n(80-85 per cent) and that, overall, our simulations reproduce well the observed\nluminosity function. However, they fail at reproducing an excess of massive\nwhite dwarfs present in the observed mass function. A plausible explanation for\nthis is that a sizable fraction of massive white dwarfs in the Galaxy are the\nproduct of white dwarf-white dwarf mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 00:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Two of the most important factors in understanding the\nevolution of these planets, and potentially determining whether they are\nhabitable, are the behaviour of the winds of the host star and the way in which\nthey interact with the planet. The purpose of this project is to reconstruct\nthe magnetic fields of planet hosting stars from spectropolarimetric\nobservations, and to use these magnetic field maps to inform simulations of the\nstellar winds in those systems using the Block Adaptive Tree Solar-wind Roe\nUpwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) code.

These simulations will give\ninformation about the velocity, pressure and density of the wind outward from\nthe host star. They will also allow us to determine what influence the winds\nwill have on the space weather environment of the planet. This paper presents\nthe preliminary results of these simulations for the star $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis,\nusing a newly reconstructed magnetic field map based on previously published\nobservations.

To address this issue, we propose a novel relay\nstrategy, termed compute-compress-and-forward (CCF). In CCF, source messages\nare encoded using nested lattice codes constructed on a chain of nested coding\nand shaping lattices. A key difference of CCF from CF is an extra compressing\nstage inserted in between the computing and forwarding stages of a relay, so as\nto reduce the forwarding information rate of the relay. The compressing stage\nat each relay consists of two operations: first to quantize the computed\nmessage combination on an appropriately chosen lattice (referred to as a\nquantization lattice), and then to take modulo on another lattice (referred to\nas a modulo lattice). We study the design of the quantization and modulo\nlattices and propose successive recovering algorithms to ensure the\nrecoverability of source messages at destination. Based on that, we formulate a\nsum-rate maximization problem that is in general an NP-hard mixed integer\nprogram.

However, a proprietary and closed way of operating\nhardwares in network equipments slows down the progress of new services\ndeployment and extension in IoV. Moreover, the tightly coupled control and data\nplanes in traditional networks significantly increase the complexity and cost\nof network management. By proposing a novel architecture, called\nSoftware-Defined Internet of Vehicles (SDIV), we adopt the software-defined\nnetwork (SDN) architecture to address these problems by leveraging its\nseparation of the control plane from the data plane and a uniform way to\nconfigure heterogeneous switches. However, the characteristics of IoV introduce\nthe very challenges in rule installation due to the limited size of Flow Tables\nat OpenFlow-enabled switches which are the main component of SDN. It is\nnecessary to build compact Flow Tables for the scalability of IoV. Accordingly,\nwe develop a rule optimization approach for real-time query service in SDIV.\nSpecifically, we separate wired data plane from wireless data plane and use\nmulticast address in wireless data plane. Furthermore, we introduce a\ndestination-driven model in wired data plane for reducing the number of rules\nat switches.

It is derived by approximating various large\nblocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker\nproduct of two much smaller matrices.

And unlike some previously proposed approximate\nnatural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature\nmatrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly\nstochastic optimization regimes.

A blind deconvolution problem is severely\nill-posed and, in order to reduce the extremely large number of possible\nsolutions, it is necessary to introduce sensible constraints on both the\nscientific target and the PSF. In a previous paper we proposed a sound\nmathematical approach based on a suitable inexact alternating minimization\nstrategy for minimizing the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence, assuring\nglobal convergence. In the framework of this method we showed that an important\nconstraint on the PSF is the upper bound which can be derived from the\nknowledge of its Strehl ratio. The efficacy of the approach was demonstrated by\nmeans of numerical simulations. In this paper, besides improving the previous\napproach by the use of a further constraint on the unknown scientific target,\nwe extend it to the case of multiple images of the same target obtained with\ndifferent PSFs. The main application we have in mind is to Fizeau\ninterferometry. As it is known this is a special feature of the Large Binocular\nTelescope (LBT). The method is applied to realistic simulations of imaging both\nby single mirrors and Fizeau interferometers. Successes and failures of the\nmethod in the imaging of stellar fields are demonstrated in simple cases. These\npreliminary results look promising at least in specific situations.

Lock-free data structures promise superior scalability by avoiding\nblocking synchronization primitives, but the \\emph{delete-min} operation is an\ninherent scalability bottleneck in concurrent priority queues. Recent work has\nfocused on alleviating this obstacle either by batching operations, or by\nrelaxing the requirements to the \\emph{delete-min} operation.\n  We present a new, lock-free priority queue that relaxes the \\emph{delete-min}\noperation so that it is allowed to delete \\emph{any} of the $\\rho+1$ smallest\nkeys, where $\\rho$ is a runtime configurable parameter.

This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics\ngenerates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible\nquantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions\nin the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of\ncontinuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad\nmaster equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which\nencodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed\ntotal observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates\ntrajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events\ninto the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an\ninteresting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different\nensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by\ntotal number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of\ndifferent thermodynamic ensembles, akin to \"grand-canonical\" and \"isobaric\",\nbut for trajectories. Here we prove that these trajectory ensembles are\nequivalent in a suitable limit of long time or large number of jumps. This is\nin direct analogy to equilibrium statistical mechanics where equivalence\nbetween ensembles is only strictly established in the thermodynamic limit. An\nintrinsic quantum feature is that the equivalence holds only for all\nobservables that commute with the number of quantum jumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 11:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

The proposed technique enables voltage\ntuning based on the observed frequency of the ROs, taken as a representation of\nthe device speed and used to estimate a safe minimum operating voltage at a\ngiven core frequency. A conservative linear relationship between RO frequency\nand silicon speed is used to approximate the critical path of the processor.\n  Using a multi-purpose RO not specifically implemented for critical path\ncharacterisation is a unique approach to voltage tuning. The parameters\ngoverning the relationship between RO and silicon speed are obtained through\nthe testing of a sample of processors from different wafer regions. These\nparameters can then be used on all devices of that model. The tuning method and\nsoftware control framework is demonstrated on a sample of XMOS XS1-U8A-64\nembedded microprocessors, yielding a dynamic power saving of up to 25% with no\nperformance reduction and no negative impact on the real-time constraints of\nthe embedded software running on the processor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 12:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

The result extends a claim\ndemonstrated only for seed trees with at most 8 taxa to arbitrary seed trees,\nexpanding the set of cases for which detailed enumerative properties of\ncoalescent histories can be determined. We introduce a procedure that computes\nfrom $t$ the constant $\\beta_t$ as well as the algebraic expression for the\ngenerating function of the sequence $(h_n)_{n\\geq 0}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 15:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

It is well-known that applying the\nEinstein's equations and spatial averaging do not commute and lead to the\naveraging problem. For the MG formalism applied to the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, this gives an extra\ndynamical term encapsulated as an averaging density parameter denoted\n$\\Omega_A$. An exact isotropic cosmological solution of MG for the flat FLRW\nmetric is already known in the literature, we derive here an anisotropic exact\nsolution. Using the isotropic solution, we compare the expansion history to\ncurrent data of distances to supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, CMB last\nscattering surface, and Hubble constant measurements, and find $-0.05 \\le\n\\Omega_A \\le 0.07$ (at the 95% CL). For the flat metric case this reduces to\n$-0.03 \\le \\Omega_A \\le 0.05$. We also find that the inclusion of this term in\nthe fits can shift the values of the usual cosmological parameters by a few to\nseveral percents. Next, we derive an equation for the growth rate of large\nscale structure in MG that includes a term due to the averaging and compare it\nto that of the LCDM concordance model. We find that an $\\Omega_A$ of an\namplitude range within the bounds above leads to a relative deviation of the\ngrowth from that of the LCDM of up to 2-4% at late times. Thus, the shift in\nthe growth could be of comparable amplitude to that caused by similar changes\nin cosmological parameters like the dark energy density parameter or its\nequation of state. The effect could also be comparable in amplitude to some\nsystematic effects considered for future surveys. This indicates that the\naveraging term and its possible effect need to be tightly constrained in future\nprecision cosmological studies.

We therefore\ntake into account the consistent post-inflationary evolution of the magnetic\nfields that are originated from vacuum fluctuations during inflation. In the\nmodel of our interest, the electromagnetic (EM) field is coupled to a\npseudo-scalar inflaton $\\phi$ through the characteristic term $\\phi F\\tilde F$,\nbreaking the conformal invariance. This interaction dynamically breaks the\nparity and enables a continuous production of only one of the polarization\nstates of the EM field through tachyonic instability. The produced magnetic\nfields are thus helical. We find that the dominant contribution to the observed\nmagnetic fields in this model comes from the modes that leave the horizon near\nthe end of inflation, further enhanced by the tachyonic instability right after\nthe end of inflation. The EM field is subsequently amplified by parametric\nresonance during the period of inflaton oscillation. Once the thermal plasma is\nformed (reheating), the produced helical magnetic fields undergo a turbulent\nprocess called inverse cascade, which shifts their peak correlation scales from\nsmaller to larger scales. We consistently take all these effects into account\nwithin the regime where the perturbation of $\\phi$ is negligible and obtain\n$B_{\\rm eff} \\sim 10^{-19}$G, indicating the necessity of additional mechanisms\nto accommodate the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 15:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 01:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

With an activity\nparameter $\\lambda$, each matching $M$ is assigned a weight $\\lambda^{|M|}$.\nThe counting problem is formulated as computing a partition function that gives\nthe sum of the weights of all matchings in a hypergraph. This problem unifies\ntwo extensively studied statistical physics models in approximate counting: the\nhardcore model (graph independent sets) and the monomer-dimer model (graph\nmatchings).\n  For this model, the critical activity $\\lambda_c= \\frac{d^d}{k (d-1)^{d+1}}$\nis the threshold for the uniqueness of Gibbs measures on the infinite\n$(d+1)$-uniform $(k+1)$-regular hypertree. Consider hypergraphs of maximum\ndegree at most $k+1$ and maximum size of hyperedges at most $d+1$. We show that\nwhen $\\lambda < \\lambda_c$, there is an FPTAS for computing the partition\nfunction; and when $\\lambda = \\lambda_c$, there is a PTAS for computing the\nlog-partition function. These algorithms are based on the decay of correlation\n(strong spatial mixing) property of Gibbs distributions. When $\\lambda >\n2\\lambda_c$, there is no PRAS for the partition function or the log-partition\nfunction unless NP$=$RP.\n  Towards obtaining a sharp transition of computational complexity of\napproximate counting, we study the local convergence from a sequence of finite\nhypergraphs to the infinite lattice with specified symmetry. We show a\nsurprising connection between the local convergence and the reversibility of a\nnatural random walk. This leads us to a barrier for the hardness result: The\nnon-uniqueness of infinite Gibbs measure is not realizable by any finite\ngadgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 15:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 16:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 08:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-09"}
