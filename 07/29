However, even for the setting of\nunsupervised domain adaptation, where the target domain is unlabelled,\ncollecting data for every possible target domain is still costly. In this\npaper, we propose a new domain adaptation method that has no need to access\neither data or labels of the target domain when it can be described by a\nparametrised vector and there exits several related source domains within the\nsame parametric space.

In particular geometries perfect\nreflection channels are created, and their large penetration depth into the\nturbid medium as well as the complete return of probe light to the input end\nwould greatly benefit sensing and imaging applications. Absorption along with\ngeometry can be further employed for tuning the decay length of energy flux\ninside the random system, which cannot be achieved in a common waveguide with\nuniform cross-section. Our approach relies solely on confined geometry and does\nnot require any modification of intrinsic disorder, thus it is applicable to a\nvariety of systems and also to other types of waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 17:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 00:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

Their definition of \"unexpected\"\nrefers to a wave that is not anticipated by a casual observer. Clearly,\nunexpected waves defined in this way are predictable in a statistical sense.\nThey can occur relatively often with a small or moderate crest height, but\nlarge unexpected waves that are rogue are rare. Here, this concept is\nelaborated and statistically described based on a third-order nonlinear model.\nIn particular, the conditional return period of an unexpected wave whose crest\nexceeds a given threshold is developed. This definition leads to greater return\nperiods or on average less frequent occurrences of unexpected waves than those\nimplied by the conventional return periods not conditioned on a reference\nthreshold. Ultimately, it appears that a rogue wave that is also unexpected\nwould have a lower occurrence frequency than that of a usual rogue wave.

However, the validity of their universal meaning for cities is\nhampered by the observation that different scaling regimes can be encountered\nfor the same territory, time and attribute, depending on the criteria used to\ndelineate cities. The aim of this paper is to present new insights concerning\nthis variation, coupled with a sensitivity analysis of urban scaling in France,\nfor several socio-economic and infrastructural attributes from data collected\nexhaustively at the local level. The sensitivity analysis considers different\naggregations of local units for which data are given by the Population Census.\nWe produce a large variety of definitions of cities (approximatively 5000) by\naggregating local Census units corresponding to the systematic combination of\nthree definitional criteria: density, commuting flows and population cutoffs.\nWe then measure the magnitude of scaling estimations and their sensitivity to\ncity definitions for several urban indicators, showing for example that simple\npopulation cutoffs impact dramatically on the results obtained for a given\nsystem and attribute. Variations are interpreted with respect to the meaning of\nthe attributes (socio-economic descriptors as well as infrastructure) and the\nurban definitions used (understood as the combination of the three criteria).\nBecause of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem and of the heterogeneous\nmorphologies and social landscapes in the cities internal space, scaling\nestimations are subject to large variations, distorting many of the conclusions\non which generative models are based. We conclude that examining scaling\nvariations might be an opportunity to understand better the inner composition\nof cities with regard to their size, i.e. to link the scales of the city-system\nwith the system of cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 13:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

While these materials are typically viewed as doped Mott\ninsulators, it is well known that they are Fermi liquids at high hole-dopant\nconcentrations. It was recently demonstrated that at moderate doping, in the\npseudogap region of the phase diagram, the charge carriers are also best\ndescribed as Fermi liquid. Nevertheless, the relationship between the two\nFermi-liquid regions and the nature of the strange-metal state at intermediate\ndoping have remained unsolved. Here we show in the case of the model cuprate\nsuperconductor HgBa2CuO4+{\\delta} that the scattering rate measured by the\ncotangent of the Hall angle remains quadratic in temperature across the\npseudogap temperature, upon entering the strange-metal state, and that it is\ndoping-independent below optimal doping. Analysis of the published results for\nother cuprates reveals that this behavior is universal throughout the entire\nphase diagram and points to a pervasive Fermi-liquid transport scattering rate.\nWe argue that these observations can be reconciled with other data upon\nconsidering the possibility that the pseudogap phenomenon signifies the\ncompletion of the gradual, non-uniform localization of one hole per planar CuO2\nunit upon cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:27:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 18:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Factors that influence livestock settlement distribution may affect\necosystem degradation. We hypothesize that surface and groundwater availability\ninfluence livestock settlements distribution. We evaluated this hypothesis with\na Monte Carlo based model to simulate Settlement Dynamics in Drylands (SeDD),\nwhich calculates probabilities on a gridded region based on six environmental\nfactors: groundwater depth, vegetation type, proximity to rivers, paved roads,\nold river beds, and existing settlements. A parameter sweep, including millions\nof simulations, was run with combinations of parameters related to these\nfactors. The sets of parameter values that minimized the residuals between\nsimulations and observations indicated the relative importance of each factors\non settlement distribution. Distances to rivers and old river beds were\ncritical to explain the current distribution of settlements, while vegetation,\npaved roads, and water table depths were not important. Spatial distribution of\nsimulated vegetation, which included degradation around livestock settlements,\ngenerally agreed with remotely sensed vegetation classes. The model could be a\nuseful tool to evaluate the effects of land use changes (water provision, river\nflows), on settlement distribution and vegetation degradation in arid\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

We present simulations of the orbital evolution of\nEuphrosyne family members from the time of breakup to the present day, focusing\non those members that move into near-Earth orbits. We find that family members\ntypically evolve into a specific region of orbital element-space, with\nsemimajor axes near ~3 AU, high inclinations, very large eccentricities, and\nTisserand parameters similar to Jupiter family comets. Filtering all known NEOs\nwith our derived orbital element limits, we find that the population of\ncandidate objects is significantly lower in albedo than the overall NEO\npopulation, although many of our candidates are also darker than the Euphrosyne\nfamily, and may have properties more similar to comet nuclei.

That includes \"prime\"\nspectrum at lower frequencies, which is also suitable for wide area coverage by\nlicensed cellular providers. While additional unlicensed spectrum would allow\nfor market expansion, it could influence competition among providers and\nincrease congestion (interference) among consumers of wireless services. We\nstudy the value (social welfare and consumer surplus) obtained by adding\nunlicensed spectrum to an existing allocation of licensed spectrum among\nincumbent service providers. We assume a population of customers who choose a\nprovider based on the minimum delivered price, given by the weighted sum of the\nprice of the service and a congestion cost, which depends on the number of\nsubscribers in a band. We consider models in which this weighting is uniform\nacross the customer population and where the weighting is either high or low,\nreflecting different sensitivities to latency. For the models considered, we\nfind that the social welfare depends on the amount of additional unlicensed\nspectrum, and can actually decrease over a significant range of unlicensed\nbandwidths. Furthermore, with nonuniform weighting, introducing unlicensed\nspectrum can also reduce consumer welfare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Studies of nearby starbursts have shown that Lyman continuum\nand line emission are absorbed by dust and that the Lyman-alpha is resonantly\nscattered by neutral hydrogen. A source of feedback is required to prevent\nscattering and allow the Lyman-alpha emission to escape. There are two X-ray\npoint sources embedded in the Lyman Break Analog (LBA) galaxy Haro 11. Haro 11\nX-1 is an extremely luminous (L$_{X} \\sim 10^{41}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), spatially\ncompact source with a hard X-ray spectrum. Haro 11 X-1 is similar to the\nextreme Black Hole Binary (BHB) M82 X-1. The hard X-ray spectrum indicates Haro\n11 X-1 may be a Black Hole Binary (BHB) in a low accretion state. The very high\nX-ray luminosity suggests an intermediate mass black hole that could be the\nseed for formation of a supermassive black hole.

We suggest that\nfeedback from X-ray binaries may play a significant role in allowing\nLyman-alpha emission to escape from galaxies in the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

By\nanalytically studying the quench dynamics in a prototypical one-dimensional\ncritical model, the massless free bosonic field theory, we find evidence of a\nnovel type of equilibration characterized by the preservation of an enormous\namount of memory of the initial state that is accessible by local measurements.\nIn particular, we show that the equilibration retains memory of non-Gaussian\ninitial correlations, in contrast to the case of massive free evolution which\nerases all such memory.

Multi-component S\\'{e}rsic galaxies resemble compact\npsuedobulges ($n\\sim$\\,2, $R_e \\sim$\\, 4 kpc) surrounded by extended\nGaussian-like outer structures ($R_e > 10$ kpc). 11\\% of galaxies ($N=52$)\nfeature a break in their outer profiles, indicating `truncated' or\n`anti-truncated' discs. Beyond the break radius, truncated galaxies are\nstructurally consistent with exponential discs, disfavouring physical\ntruncation as their formation mechanism. Bulge luminosity in anti-truncated\ngalaxies correlates strongly with galaxy luminosity, indicating a\nbulge-enhancing origin for these systems. Both types of broken disc are found\noverwhelmingly ($>70\\%$) in `barred' galaxies, despite a low measured bar\nfraction for Coma ($20\\pm2\\%$). Thus, galaxy bars play an important role in\nformation of broken disc structures. No strong variation in galaxy structure is\ndetected with projected cluster-centric radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 20:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

In this scenario, the LMC's gaseous disk has\nrecently experienced maximal ram pressure stripping, suggesting the current\nextent of its HI disk directly probes the medium in which it is moving. From\nthe observed stellar and HI distributions of the system we find evidence of a\ntruncated gas profile along the windward ``leading edge' of the LMC disk,\ndespite a far more extended stellar component. We explore the implications of\nthis ram pressure stripping signature, using both analytic prescriptions and\nfull 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the LMC.

Molecular nitrogen\n(N$_2$) constitutes the largest fraction of Earth$'$s atmosphere and is likely\nto be a major constituent of many terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. Due to its\nlack of significant absorption features, N$_2$ is extremely difficult to\nremotely detect. However, N$_2$ produces an N$_2$-N$_2$ collisional pair,\n(N$_2$)$_2$, which is spectrally active. Here we report the detection of\n(N$_2$)$_2$ in Earth$'$s disk-integrated spectrum. By comparing spectra from\nNASA$'$s EPOXI mission to synthetic spectra from the NASA Astrobiology\nInstitute$'$s Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth\nmodel, we find that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption produces a ~35$\\%$ decrease in flux\nat 4.15 $\\mu$m. Quantifying N$_2$ could provide a means of determining bulk\natmospheric composition for terrestrial exoplanets and could rule out abiotic\nO$_2$ generation, which is possible in rarefied atmospheres. To explore the\npotential effects of (N$_2$)$_2$ in exoplanet spectra, we used radiative\ntransfer models to generate synthetic emission and transit transmission spectra\nof self-consistent N$_2$-CO$_2$-H$_2$O atmospheres, and analytic N$_2$-H$_2$\nand N$_2$-H$_2$-CO$_2$ atmospheres.

This effective charge will experience a non-vanishing drag in an\nexternal electric field even in the absence of free charge carriers.

If meaningful confidence information can\nbe incorporated into a learning method, fewer patient instances may need to be\nlabeled to learn an accurate model. In addition, while accuracy of predictions\nis important for any inference model, a model of patients must be interpretable\nso that clinicians can understand how the model is making decisions. To these\nends, we develop a novel metric learning method called Confidence bAsed MEtric\nLearning (CAMEL) that supports inclusion of confidence labels, but also\nemphasizes interpretability in three ways. First, our method induces sparsity,\nthus producing simple models that use only a few features from patient EHRs.\nSecond, CAMEL naturally produces confidence scores that can be taken into\nconsideration when clinicians make treatment decisions.

We argue that such\nplanets would be ingested by tidal interaction with the host star on a\ntimescale $\\lesssim1\\,$Gyr, and that, in the case of a solar-type host, this\nwould cause the stellar spin to approach the direction of the ingested planet's\norbital axis even if the two were initially highly misaligned. Primordially\nmisaligned stars whose effective temperatures are $\\gtrsim6250\\,$K cannot be\nrealigned in this way because, in contrast with solar-type hosts, their angular\nmomenta are typically higher than the orbital angular momentum of the ingested\nplanet as a result of inefficient magnetic braking and of a comparatively large\nmoment of inertia.

The interest in performing accurate and\nlocalized measurements of vorticity reflects the fact that many of the\nquantities that characterize the dynamics of fluids are intimately bound\ntogether in the vorticity field, being an efficient descriptor of the velocity\nstatistics in many flow regimes. It describes the coherent structures and\nvortex interactions that are at the leading edge of laminar, transitional, and\nturbulent flows in nature. The measurement of vorticity is of paramount\nimportance in many research fields as diverse as biology microfluidics, complex\nmotions in the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers, and wake turbulence on\nfluid aerodynamics. However, the precise measurement of flow vorticity is\ndifficult. Here we put forward an optical sensing technique to obtain a direct\nmeasurement of vorticity in fluids using Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beams, optical\nbeams which show an azimuthal phase variation that is the origin of its\ncharacteristic non-zero orbital angular momentum. The key point is to make use\nof the transversal Doppler effect of the returned signal that depends only on\nthe azimuthal component of the flow velocity along the ring-shaped observation\nbeam. We found from a detailed analysis of the experimental method that probing\nthe fluid with LG beams is an effective and simple sensing technique capable to\nproduce accurate estimates of flow vorticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 23:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-30"}

If the number of\nentities is large, accounting for each individual is inefficient, and often\npartial differential equation (PDE) models are used in which the stochastic\nbehaviour of individuals is replaced by a description of the averaged, or mean\nbehaviour of the system. In some situations the number of individuals is large\nin certain regions and small in others. In such cases, a stochastic model may\nbe inefficient in one region, and a PDE model inaccurate in another. To\novercome this problem, we develop a scheme which couples a stochastic\nreaction-diffusion system in one part of the domain with its mean field\nanalogue, i.e. a discretised PDE model, in the other part of the domain. The\ninterface in between the two domains occupies exactly one lattice site and is\nchosen such that the mean field description is still accurate there.

Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally\nfriendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium,\n2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium\nand conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their\nbatteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green\nvehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce\nits cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as\ndistributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of\nEV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed\ninteger programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed\nclassification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be\neffectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy\ntrading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data\nare used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the\ntotal cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles\nincreases, and also that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater\nthan those in summer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 00:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-30"}

The gapless phase in the negative $J^{\\prime\\prime}$ region\nhas a $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ coplanar $120^\\circ$-AF order, with all the\nmoments of equal length and relative angles of $120^\\circ$. The other AF phase,\nin the positive $J^{\\prime\\prime}$ region, is found to exhibit a different\ncoplanar order with ordering wave vector ${\\bf q}=(0,0)$. Here, two magnetic\nmoments in a triangle are of same magnitude, but shorter than the third. While\nthe angle between the two short moments is $120^\\circ-2\\delta$, it is\n$120^\\circ+\\delta$ between a short and the long one. Only when\n$J^{\\prime\\prime}=J^\\prime$, their magnitudes become equal and the\nrelative-angles $120^\\circ$. This ${\\bf q}=(0,0)$ phase has the translational\nsymmetry of the Kagom\\'e lattice with isosceles triangular unit-cells.

The novelty in the posterior model consistency\nis that it depends not only on the priors for the model parameters through the\nBayes factor, but also on the model priors, so that it is a useful tool for\nchoosing priors for both models and model parameters. We have found that some\nclasses of priors typically used in variable selection yield posterior model\ninconsistency, while mixtures of these priors improve this undesirable\nbehavior.

More specifically, the conceptual system,\nword relations and communication are mathematically defined and classified such\nas ideal conceptual system, perfect communication and so on; relation between\nwords and sentences is also studied, which shows that knowledge are words.\nFurthermore, how conceptual systems and words depend on situations is\npresented, and how truth is defined is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 09:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 09:23:02 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 02:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 00:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 02:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 03:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 12:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 14:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 14:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 16:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 14:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 03:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 22:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 09:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

In this Paper we extend that study, taking into account the\nprevious binary evolution of the sources as well. The seven short-period\nblack-hole X-ray binaries that we use, are compact binaries consisting of a\nlow-mass star orbiting a black hole in a period less than $1$ day. We trace\ntheir binary evolution backwards in time, from the current observed state of\nmass-transfer, to the moment the black hole was formed, and we add the extra\ninformation on the kinematics of the binaries. We find that several systems\ncould be explained by no natal kick, just mass ejection, while for two systems\n(and possibly more) a high kick is required. So unless the latter have an\nalternative formation, such as within a globular cluster, we conclude that at\nleast some black holes get high kicks. This challenges the standard picture\nthat black hole kicks would be scaled down from neutron star kicks.\nFurthermore, we find that five systems could have formed with a non-zero natal\nkick but zero mass ejected (i.e. no supernova) at formation, as predicted by\nneutrino-driven natal kicks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 11:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

Aims. We explore\nthe probable chemical signature of planet formation in the remarkable binary\nsystem HD 80606 - HD 80607. The star HD 80606 hosts a giant planet with 4 MJup\ndetected by both transit and radial velocity techniques, being one of the most\neccentric planets detected to date. We study condensation temperature Tc trends\nof volatile and refractory element abundances to determine whether there is a\ndepletion of refractories that could be related to the terrestrial planet\nformation. Methods. We carried out a high-precision abundance determination in\nboth components of the binary system, using a line-by-line strictly\ndifferential approach, using the Sun as a reference and then using HD 80606 as\nreference. We used an updated version of the program FUNDPAR, together with\nATLAS9 model atmospheres and the MOOG code. Conclusions. From the study of Tc\ntrends, we concluded that the stars HD 80606 and HD 80607 do not seem to be\ndepleted in refractory elements, which is different for the case of the Sun.\nThen, the terrestrial planet formation would have been less efficient in the\ncomponents of this binary system than in the Sun. The lack of a trend for\nrefractory elements with Tc between both stars implies that the presence of a\ngiant planet do not neccesarily imprint a chemical signature in their host\nstars, similar to the recent result of Liu et al. (2014). This is also in\nagreement with Melendez et al. (2009), who suggest that the presence of\nclose-in giant planets might prevent the formation of terrestrial planets.\nFinally, we speculate about a possible planet around the star HD 80607.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 13:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

However, in practice, there are many datasets that do\nnot lie in the 2D Euclidean space, thus their IT structures cannot be\ngraphically presented.

The kinetic\naspects of plasma are fully incorporated using extensive particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations. It is turned out that the plasma behavior is characterized by both\nits density and the ratio of the pulse length to the plasma wavelength.\nAccording to exact analyses and direct simulation evidences, at ultra-low\ndensities the laser pulse is adiabatically depleted (absorbed) by the wake\nexcitation. And the depletion is accompanied by the overall radiation\nred-shift. At these densities, for pulse lengths larger than the plasma\nwavelength the Raman type scatterings also occur without causing instability.\nWhen the plasma density grows toward the critical density, a completely new\nregime appears with the main character of highly unsteady light propagation.\nHere, based on analyses and simulations, the radiation pressure induced wave\nbreaking (RPIWB) heavily destroys the oscillatory structure of the electron\nwave behind the first plasma period. On the other hand, the electron density\nprofile induced by the ponderomotive force ahead of the pulse begins to steepen\nand eventually acts as a flying mirror. As a result, the pulse becomes bake\nscattered and its penetration becomes limited. The radiation pressure of\nreflecting pulse sustains a longitudinal electric field which accelerates\nelectrons produced via RPIWB causing the plasma to undergo volumetric heating.\nMostly important, based on a newly proposed model it is shown that the\ninteraction becomes saturated at a definite time and that the overall\nabsorption and plasma heating are directly related to this time. Also it is\nfound that the saturation time decreases by a factor of ( , and are initial\nelectron density, critical density and initial laser gamma factor)...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 14:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2015 07:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2015 10:31:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

The fundamental\nchallenge in CCSN theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to\nexplode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions. Burrows & Goshy suggested that the solutions above this\ncurve are dynamic and explosive. In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve. The illuminating\ndifference is that there is a direct relationship between $\\Psi$ and $v_s$.\nBelow the critical curve, $\\Psi$ may be negative, positive, and zero, which\ncorresponds to receding, expanding, and stalled-shock solutions. At the\ncritical curve, the minimum $\\Psi$ solution is zero; above the critical curve,\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$, and all steady solutions have $v_s > 0$. Using\none-dimensional simulations, we confirm our primary assumptions and verify that\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$ is a reliable and accurate explosion diagnostic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 19:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 22:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}
