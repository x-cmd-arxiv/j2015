In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundations of the\nquantum approach to cognition that we developed in Brussels. These foundations\nrest on the results of two decade studies on the axiomatic and\noperational-realistic approaches to the foundations of quantum physics. The\ndeep analogies between the foundations of physics and cognition lead us to\ninvestigate the validity of quantum theory as a general and unitary framework\nfor cognitive processes, and the empirical success of the Hilbert space models\nderived by such investigation provides a strong theoretical confirmation of\nthis validity. However, two situations in the cognitive realm, 'question order\neffects' and 'response replicability', indicate that even the Hilbert space\nframework could be insufficient to reproduce the collected data. This does not\nmean that the mentioned operational-realistic approach would be incorrect, but\nsimply that a larger class of measurements would be in force in human\ncognition, so that an extended quantum formalism may be needed to deal with all\nof them. As we will explain, the recently derived 'extended Bloch\nrepresentation' of quantum theory (and the associated 'general\ntension-reduction' model) precisely provides such extended formalism, while\nremaining within the same unitary interpretative framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 16:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

However, it is intrinsically difficult to\nestimate changes in extreme events from the short observational record. In this\nwork we use millennial runs from the CCSM3 in equilibrated pre-industrial and\npossible future conditions to examine both how extremes change in this model\nand how well these changes can be estimated as a function of run length. We\nestimate changes to distributions of future temperature extremes (annual minima\nand annual maxima) in the contiguous United States by fitting generalized\nextreme value (GEV) distributions. Using 1000-year pre-industrial and future\ntime series, we show that the magnitude of warm extremes largely shifts in\naccordance with mean shifts in summertime temperatures. In contrast, cold\nextremes warm more than mean shifts in wintertime temperatures, but changes in\nGEV location parameters are largely explainable by mean shifts combined with\nreduced wintertime temperature variability. In addition, changes in the spread\nand shape of the GEV distributions of cold extremes at inland locations can\nlead to discernible changes in tail behavior. We then examine uncertainties\nthat result from using shorter model runs. In principle, the GEV distribution\nprovides theoretical justification to predict infrequent events using time\nseries shorter than the recurrence frequency of those events.

Although the first Weyl semimetal\nwas recently discovered in TaAs, research progress is still significantly\nhindered due to the lack of robust and ideal materials candidates. In order to\nobserve the many predicted exotic phenomena that arise from Weyl fermions, it\nis of critical importance to find robust and ideal Weyl semimetals, which have\nfewer Weyl nodes and more importantly whose Weyl nodes are well separated in\nmomentum space and are located close to the chemical potential in energy. In\nthis paper, we propose by far the most robust and ideal Weyl semimetal\ncandidate in the inversion breaking, single crystalline compound tantalum\nsulfide Ta$_3$S$_2$ with new and novel properties beyond TaAs. We find that\nTa$_3$S$_2$ has only 8 Weyl nodes, all of which have the same energy that is\nmerely 10 meV below the chemical potential. Crucially, our results show that\nTa$_3$S$_2$ has the largest $k$-space separation between Weyl nodes among known\nWeyl semimetal candidates, which is about twice larger than TaAs and twenty\ntimes larger than the predicted value in WTe$_2$. Moreover, we predict that\nincreasing the lattice by $<4\\%$ can annihilate all Weyl nodes, driving a novel\ntopological metal-to-insulator transition from a Weyl semimetal state to a\ntopological insulator state. We further discover that changing the lattice\nconstant can move the Weyl nodes and the van Hove singularities with enhanced\ndensity of states to the chemical potential. Our prediction provides a\ncritically needed robust candidate for this rapidly developing field. The well\nseparated Weyl nodes, the topological metal-to-insulator transition and the\nremarkable tunabilities suggest Ta$_3$S$_2$'s potential as the ideal platform\nin future device-applications based on Weyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 20:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 23:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

The comet has drawn the attention of astronomers since its historic\noutburst in 2007, and this occasion was its first perihelion passage since\nthen. We analyzed the obtained data using aperture photometry package and\nderived the Afrho parameter, a proxy for the dust production rate. We found\nthat Afrho showed asymmetric properties with respect to the perihelion passage:\nit increased moderately from 100 cm at the heliocentric distance r_h=2.6-3.1 AU\nto a maximal value of 185 cm at r_h = 2.2 AU (near the perihelion) during the\ninbound orbit, while dropping rapidly to 35 cm at r_h = 3.2 AU during the\noutbound orbit. We applied a model for characterizing dust production rates as\na function of r_h and found that the fractional active area of the cometary\nnucleus had dropped from 20%-40% in 2008-2011 (around the aphelion) to\n0.1%-0.3% in 2014-2015 (around the perihelion).

Using extreme-value form statistics to test against\nsparse alternatives and using quadratic form statistics to test against dense\nalternatives are two important testing procedures for high-dimensional\nindependence. However, quadratic form statistics suffer from low power against\nsparse alternatives, and extreme-value form statistics suffer from low power\nagainst dense alternatives with small disturbances and may have size\ndistortions due to its slow convergence. For real-world applications, it is\nimportant to derive powerful testing procedures against more general\nalternatives. Based on intermediate limiting distributions, we derive\n(model-free) joint limiting laws of extreme-value form and quadratic form\nstatistics, and surprisingly, we prove that they are asymptotically\nindependent. Given such asymptotic independencies, we propose (model-free)\ntesting procedures to boost the power against general alternatives and also\nretain the correct asymptotic size. Under the high-dimensional setting, we\nderive the closed-form limiting null distributions, and obtain their explicit\nrates of uniform convergence. We prove their consistent statistical powers\nagainst general alternatives. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed\ntest statistics in simulation studies.

In such\nscenarios, the thin brane behaviour is manifested when the extra dimension is\noutside the compact domain, where the energy density is non-trivial, instead of\nasymptotically as in the usual thick brane models. The zero mode is trapped in\nthe brane, as required. The massive modes, although are not localized in the\nbrane, have important phenomenological implications such as corrections to the\nNewton's law. We study such corrections in the usual thick domain wall and in\nthe hybrid brane scenarios. By means of suitable numerical methods, we attain\nthe mass spectrum for the graviton and the corresponding wavefunctions. The\nspectra possess the usual linearly increasing behaviour from the Kaluza-Klein\ntheories. Further, we show that the 4D gravitational force is slightly\nincreased at short distances. The first eigenstate contributes highly for the\ncorrection to the Newton's law. The subsequent normalized solutions have\ndiminishing contributions. Moreover, we find out that the phenomenology of the\nhybrid brane is not different from the usual thick domain wall. The use of\nnumerical techniques for solving the equations of the massive modes is useful\nfor matching possible phenomenological measurements in the gravitational law as\na probe to warped extra dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 03:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

Based upon an oracle model of computation, which\ncaptures the interactions between algorithms and data, we establish a general\nlower bound that explicitly connects the minimum testing risk under\ncomputational budget constraints with the intrinsic probabilistic and\ncombinatorial structures of statistical problems. This lower bound mirrors the\nclassical statistical lower bound by Le Cam (1986) and allows us to quantify\nthe optimal statistical performance achievable given limited computational\nbudgets in a systematic fashion. Under this unified framework, we sharply\ncharacterize the statistical-computational phase transition for two testing\nproblems, namely, normal mean detection and sparse principal component\ndetection. For normal mean detection, we consider two combinatorial structures,\nnamely, sparse set and perfect matching. For these problems we identify\nsignificant gaps between the optimal statistical accuracy that is achievable\nunder computational tractability constraints and the classical statistical\nlower bounds. Compared with existing works on computational lower bounds for\nstatistical problems, which consider general polynomial-time algorithms on\nTuring machines, and rely on computational hardness hypotheses on problems like\nplanted clique detection, we focus on the oracle computational model, which\ncovers a broad range of popular algorithms, and do not rely on unproven\nhypotheses.

One byproduct of our result is a lower\nbound for a strict generalization of the matrix permanent problem, which is of\nindependent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 06:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

In binary star systems, they play a key role during\nthe early and late phases of planetary formation, as well as for the dynamical\nstability of a planetary system. In this study, we aim to correlate the\npresence of orbital resonances with the rate of icy asteroids crossing the\nhabitable zone (HZ), from a circumprimary disk of planetesimals in various\nbinary star systems. We modelled a belt of small bodies in the inner and outer\nregions, interior and exterior to the orbit of a gas giant planet,\nrespectively. The planetesimals are equally placed around a primary G-type star\nand move under the gravitational influence of the two stars and the gas giant.\nWe numerically integrated the system for 50 Myr, considering various parameters\nfor the secondary star. Its stellar type varies from a M- to F-type; its\nsemimajor axis is either 50 au or 100 au, and its eccentricity is either 0.1 or\n0.3. For comparison, we also varied the gas giant's orbital and physical\nparameters. Our simulations highlight that a disk of planetesimals will suffer\nfrom perturbations owing to a perturbed gas giant, mean motion, and secular\nresonances. We show that a secular resonance -- with location and width varying\naccording to the secondary star's characteristics -- can exist in the icy\nasteroid belt region and overlap with MMRs which have an impact on the\ndynamical lifetime of the disk. In addition, we point out that in any case, the\n2:1 MMR, the 5:3 MMR and the secular resonance are powerful perturbations for\nthe flux of icy asteroids towards the HZ and the transport of water therein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 08:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 10:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 10:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 12:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The Gaussian fluctuations have been taken into account in order to study\nthe spectrum of bound pairs in the strong coupling region. We found, in weak\ncoupling reagion, the condensation temperature increases with an increasing\nmagnetic field displaying the magnetic catalysis effect. In strong coupling\nregion, the inverse magnetic catalysis appears when the magnetic field is low\nand is replaced by the usual magnetic catalysis effect when magnetic field is\nsufficiently high, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case where the inverse\nmagnetic catalysis prevails in strong coupling region regardless of the\nstrength of the magnetic field. The resulting response to the magnetic field is\nthe consequence of the competition between the dimensional reduction by Landau\norbitals in pairing dynamics and the anisotropy of the kinetic spectrum of the\nbound pairs. We thus conclude that dimensional reduction dominates in weak\ndomain and strong coupling one except the small magnetic field region, where\nthe enhanced fluctuations dominates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 10:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 10:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

However, recent\nstudies have revealed that highly expressed genes evolve slowly because of\nfitness costs due to misfolded proteins. Here we study selection maintaining\nprotein stability.\n  Protein fitness is taken to be $s = \\kappa \\exp(\\beta\\Delta G) (1 -\n\\exp(\\beta\\Delta\\Delta G))$, where $s$ and $\\Delta\\Delta G$ are selective\nadvantage and stability change of a mutant protein, $\\Delta G$ is the folding\nfree energy of the wild-type protein, and $\\kappa$ represents protein abundance\nand indispensability. The distribution of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ is approximated to\nbe a bi-Gaussian function, which represents structurally slightly- or\nhighly-constrained sites. Also, the mean of the distribution is negatively\nproportional to $\\Delta G$.\n  The evolution of this gene has an equilibrium ($\\Delta G_e$) of protein\nstability, the range of which is consistent with experimental values. The\nprobability distribution of $K_a/K_s$, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous\nsubstitution rate per site, over fixed mutants in the vicinity of the\nequilibrium shows that nearly neutral selection is predominant only in\nlow-abundant, non-essential proteins of $\\Delta G_e > -2.5$ kcal/mol. In the\nother proteins, positive selection on stabilizing mutations is significant to\nmaintain protein stability at equilibrium as well as random drift on slightly\nnegative mutations, although the average $\\langle K_a/K_s \\rangle$ is less than\n1. Slow evolutionary rates can be caused by high protein\nabundance/indispensability, which produces positive shifts of $\\Delta\\Delta G$\nthrough decreasing $\\Delta G_e$, and by strong structural constraints, which\ndirectly make $\\Delta\\Delta G$ more positive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 11:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

In\na previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated\ngenotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of\ninterrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does\nnot cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study\nof quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the\nconclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by\nitself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of\nthe quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by\nthe addition of a further parameter ($\\nu$) to account for the action of\nretroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give\nsimulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues\nof quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the\nappearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to\nhow $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get\nstimulated, relate to each other. While for $\\nu>\\lambda$ the quasispecies\nsurvives at the expense of weakening the immune system significantly or even\ndestroying it, for $\\nu<\\lambda$ the fittest genotypes of the quasispecies\nbecome mimicked inside the immune system as pathogenic idiotypes. The latter is\nin agreement with the current understanding of the HIV quasispecies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 15:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-01"}

The overarching insight was that not only hidden Markov processes,\nbut also quantum random walks are finitary processes. Since finitary processes\nenjoy nice asymptotic properties, this also encourages to further investigate\nthe asymptotic properties of quantum random walks. Here, answers to all these\nquestions are given. Quantum random walks, hidden Markov processes and finitary\nprocesses are put into a unifying model context. In this context, quantum\nrandom walks are seen to not only enjoy nice ergodic properties in general, but\nalso intuitive quantum-style asymptotic properties.

The novelty of this\ninvestigation lies in the application of such a method, previously applied\n(Milton 1980; Bergman 1980) to problems involving cyclic loadings in the\nfrequency domain, to derive bounds in the time domain for the antiplane\nviscoelasticity case. The position of the poles and the residues matrices are\nthe variational parameters of the problem: the aim is to determine such\nparameters in order to have the minimum (or maximum) response at any given\nmoment in time. All the information about the composite is translated for each\nfixed pole configuration into constraints on the residues, the so-called sum\nrules. The linearity of the constraints, along with the observation that the\nresponse at a fixed time is linear in the residues, enables one to use the\ntheory of linear programming to reduce the problem to one involving relatively\nfew non-zero residues. Finally, bounds on the response are obtained by\nnumerically optimizing over the pole positions. In the examples studied, the\nresults turn out to be very accurate estimates: if sufficient information about\nthe composite is available, the bounds can be quite tight over the entire range\nof time, allowing one to predict the transient behavior of the composite.\nFurthermore, the bounds incorporating the volume fractions (and possibly\ntransverse isotropy) can be extremely tight at certain specific times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 06:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

The original representation assigns to each nucleotide base a\nprime integer quaternion of norm 7 and involves a function that associates with\neach codon, represented by three of these quaternions, another integer\nquaternion (amino acid type quaternion) in such a way that the essentials of\nthe standard genetic code (particulaty its degeneration) are preserved. To show\nthe advantages of such a quaternionic representation we have, in turn,\nassociated with each amino acid of a given protein, besides of the type\nquaternion, another real one according to its order along the protein (order\nquaternion) and have designed an algorithm to go from the primary to the\ntertiary structure of the protein by using type and order quaternions. In this\ncontext, we incorporate chirality in our representation by observing that the\nset of eight integer quaternions of norm 7 can be partitioned into a pair of\nsubsets of cardinality four each with their elements mutually conjugates and by\nputting they in correspondence one to one with the two sets of enantiomers (D\nand L) of the four nucleotide bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil,\nrespectively. Thus, guided by two diagrams proposed for the codes evolution, we\ndefine functions that in each case assign a L- (D-) amino acid type integer\nquaternion to the triplets of D- (L-) bases. The assignation is such that for a\ngiven D-amino acid, the associated integer quaternion is the conjugate of that\none corresponding to the enantiomer L. The chiral type quaternions obtained for\nthe amino acids are used, together with a common set of order quaternions, to\ndescribe the folding of the two classes, L and D, of homochiral proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 14:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}
