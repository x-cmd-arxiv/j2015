Our\nstudy shows that from 5$\\%$ up to 40$\\%$ of subjects adopt the majority opinion\nof strangers expressed in the comments. Using Bayes' theorem, we derive a\nflexible and interpretable family of models of social influence, in which each\nindividual forms posterior opinions stochastically following a logit model. The\nvariants of our mixture model that maximize Akaike information criterion\nrepresent two sub-populations, i.e., non-influenceable and influenceable\nindividuals. The prior opinions of the non-influenceable individuals are\nstrongly correlated with the external opinions and have low standard error,\nwhereas the prior opinions of influenceable individuals have high standard\nerror and become correlated with the external opinions due to social influence.\nOur findings suggest that opinions are random variables updated via Bayes' rule\nwhose standard deviation is correlated with opinion influenceability. Based on\nthese findings, we discuss how to hinder opinion manipulation and\nmisinformation diffusion in the online realm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 16:43:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 15:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

The percolation process\ndemonstrates a critical value such that the graph is either almost completely\naffected or almost completely unaffected based on the initial seed being larger\nor smaller than the critical value.\n  To analyze intervention strategies we provide the first analytic\ndetermination of the critical value for basic bootstrap percolation in random\ngraphs when the vertex thresholds are nonuniform and provide an efficient\nalgorithm. This result also helps solve the problem of \"Percolation with\nCoinflips\" when the infection process is not deterministic, which has been a\ncriticism about the model. We also extend the results to clustered random\ngraphs thereby extending the classes of graphs considered. In these graphs the\nvertices are grouped in a small number of clusters, the clusters model a fixed\ncommunication network and the edge probability is dependent if the vertices are\nin close or far clusters. We present simulations for both basic percolation and\ninterventions that support our theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 20:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

This\nmeans that only the most massive clusters at redshift z>0.5, and in particular\nz>0.7, are expected to enter into the catalogue, with a large number of systems\nin that redshift regime being expected around and just below that threshold. In\nthis paper, we follow-up a sample of SZ sources from the Planck SZ catalogues\nfrom 2013 and 2015. In the latter maps, we consider detections around and at\nlower significance than the threshold adopted by the Planck Collaboration. To\nkeep the contamination rate low, our 28 candidates are chosen to have\nsignificant WISE detections, in combination with non-detections in SDSS/DSS,\nwhich effectively selects galaxy cluster candidates at redshifts $z\\gtrsim0.5$.\nBy taking r- and z-band imaging with MegaCam@CFHT, we bridge the 4000A\nrest-frame break over a significant redshift range, thus allowing accurate\nredshift estimates of red-sequence cluster galaxies up to z~0.8.

The richnesses of these systems are generally\nlower than expected given the halo masses estimated from the Planck maps.\nHowever, when we follow a simplistic model to correct for Eddington bias in the\nSZ halo mass proxy, the richnesses are consistent with a reference\nmass-richness relation established for clusters detected at higher\nsignificance. This illustrates the benefit of an optical follow-up, not only to\nobtain redshift estimates, but also to provide an independent mass proxy that\nis not based on the same data the clusters are detected with, and thus not\nsubject to Eddington bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

To maintain sensitivity to very\nfaint galaxies, we restrict our sample to 0.0015 < z < 0.015, which defines a\ncomplete galaxy survey to L > 0.01 L* or stellar mass log M_* > 8 Msun. We\nreport two principal findings. First, for galaxies with impact parameter rho <\n1 rvir, C IV detection strongly depends on the luminosity/stellar mass of the\nnearby galaxy. C IV is preferentially associated with galaxies with log M_* >\n9.5 Msun; lower mass galaxies rarely exhibit significant C IV absorption\n(covering fraction f = 9 +12-6% for 11 galaxies with log M_* < 9.5 Msun).\nSecond, C IV detection within the log M_* > 9.5 Msun population depends on\nenvironment. Using a fixed-aperture environmental density metric for galaxies\nwith rho < 160 kpc at z < 0.055, we find that 57+/-12% (8/14) of galaxies in\nlow-density regions (regions with fewer than seven L > 0.15 L* galaxies within\n1.5 Mpc) have affiliated C IV absorption; however, none (0/7) of the galaxies\nin denser regions show C IV. Similarly, the C IV detection rate is lower for\ngalaxies residing in groups with dark-matter halo masses of log Mhalo > 12.5\nMsun. In contrast to C IV, H I is pervasive in the CGM without regard to mass\nor environment. These results indicate that C IV absorbers with log N(C IV) >\n13.5 cm^-2 trace the halos of log M_* > 9.5 Msun galaxies but also reflect\nlarger scale environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 19:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

The quantum algorithm can be used either to\nfind a valid assignment (or to certify that no solution exists) or to count the\ntotal number of valid assignments.

Remarkably, the proposed quantum\nalgorithm results to be faster than any known exact classical algorithm to\nsolve dense formulas of XSAT. As a concrete application, we provide the\nworst-case complexity for the Hamiltonian cycle problem obtained after mapping\nit to a suitable XSAT. Specifically, we show that the time complexity for the\nproposed quantum algorithm is bounded by $O(2^{n/4})$ for 3-regular undirected\ngraphs, where $n$ is the number of nodes. The same worst-case complexity holds\nfor $(3,3)$-regular bipartite graphs (the current best classical algorithm has\na (worst-case) running time bounded by $O(2^{31n/96})$).

We\naim to understand how a strong Lya emission line is able to escape from one of\nthose inclined disk galaxies, named Mrk1486 (z=0.0338). For that purpose we\nused a large set of HST imaging and spectroscopic data to investigate both the\nISM structure and the dominant source of Lya radiation inside Mrk1486.\nMoreover, we used a 3D Monte Carlo Lya radiation transfer code to study the\nradiative transfer of Lya and UV continuum photons inside a 3D geometry of\nneutral hydrogen (HI) and dust that models the ISM structure at the galaxy\ncenter. The analysis of IFU Halpha spectroscopic data of Mrk1486 indicates the\npresence of two bipolar galactic winds of HI gas above and bellow the disk\nplane of Mrk1486. Furthermore, comparing different diagnostic diagrams (such as\n[OIII]5007/Hbeta versus [OI]6300/Halpha) to photo- and shock-ionization models,\nwe find that the Lya production of Mrk1486 is dominated by photoionization\ninside the galaxy disk.

In particular we discuss the\ncharacteristic signatures in collider experiments from light familon Fields\nwith a non-Abelian family symmetry, and we show that run I of the LHC is\nalready testing this class of models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 21:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The question why this is the case\nis still unsolved, and has recently sparked several studies dedicated to the\nsearch for additional RR Lyraes in binary systems. Such systems are\nparticularly valuable because they might allow to constrain the stellar mass.\nMost of the recent studies, however, are based on photometry by finding a light\ntime effect in the timings of maximum light. This approach is a very promising\nand successful one, but it has a major drawback: by itself, it cannot serve as\na definite proof of binarity, because other phenomena such as the Blazhko\neffect or intrinsic period changes could lead to similar results. Spectroscopic\nradial velocity measurements, on the other hand, can serve as definite proof of\nbinarity.

We have obtained radial velocity\n(RV) curves with the 2.1m telescope at McDonald observatory. From these we\nderive systemic RVs which we will compare to previous measurements in order to\nfind changes induced by orbital motions.

The dominant\nsystematic error limiting such a measurement comes from spurious spin\nprecession caused by unintentional and unknown average radial magnetic field\n$B_r$ acting on the (vastly larger) magnetic dipole moments (MDM) of the\nprotons.

In this work, we characterize stable fixed points of general\nthreshold-linear networks with constant external drive, and discover\nconstraints on the co-existence of fixed points involving different subsets of\nactive neurons. In the case of symmetric networks, we prove the following\nantichain property: if a set of neurons $\\tau$ is the support of a stable fixed\npoint, then no proper subset or superset of $\\tau$ can support a stable fixed\npoint. Symmetric threshold-linear networks thus appear to be well suited for\npattern completion, since the dynamics are guaranteed not to get \"stuck\" in a\nsubset or superset of a stored pattern. We also show that for any graph G, we\ncan construct a network whose stable fixed points correspond precisely to the\nmaximal cliques of G.

We combine high resolution [CII] spectra taken with the\nHIFI spectrometer onboard the Herschel satellite with [CII] Herschel-PACS maps\nand ground-based observations of CO(2-1) and HI. All data are at a common\nspatial resolution of 50pc. Typically, the [CII] lines have widths intermediate\nbetween the narrower CO(2-1) and broader HI line profiles. We decomposed the\n[CII] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detected\nin CO(2-1) and HI, respectively. We find that the relative contribution of\nmolecular and atomic gas traced by CO(2-1) and HI varies depends mostly on the\nlocal physical conditions and geometry. We estimate that 11-60% and 5-34% of\nthe [CII] intensities in the center and in BCLMP302, respectively, arise at\nvelocities showing no CO(2-1) or HI emission and could arise in CO-dark\nmolecular gas. The deduced strong variation in the [CII] emission not\nassociated with CO and HI cannot be explained in terms of differences in A_v,\nfar-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studied\nregions. Hence the relative amounts of diffuse (CO-dark) and dense molecular\ngas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50pc.

The goal\nof unfolding is to make nonparametric inferences about a particle spectrum from\nmeasurements smeared by the finite resolution of the particle detectors.\nPrevious unfolding methods use ad hoc discretization and regularization,\nresulting in confidence intervals that can have significantly lower coverage\nthan their nominal level. Instead of regularizing using a roughness penalty or\nstopping iterative methods early, we impose physically motivated shape\nconstraints: positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. We quantify the\nuncertainty by constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true\nspectrum, consisting of all those spectra that satisfy the shape constraints\nand that predict the observations within an appropriately calibrated level of\nfit. Projecting that set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all\nfunctionals of the spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence\nintervals have guaranteed conservative frequentist finite-sample coverage in\nthe important and challenging class of unfolding problems for steeply falling\nparticle spectra. We demonstrate the method using simulations that mimic\nunfolding the inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. The\nshape-constrained intervals provide usefully tight conservative inferences,\nwhile the conventional methods suffer from severe undercoverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 23:46:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 01:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 16:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 01:43:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-09"}

This paper\npresents a new approach dubbed Innovation Pursuit (iPursuit) to the problem of\nsubspace clustering using a new geometrical idea whereby subspaces are\nidentified based on their relative novelties. We present two frameworks in\nwhich the idea of innovation pursuit is used to distinguish the subspaces.\nUnderlying the first framework is an iterative method that finds the subspaces\nconsecutively by solving a series of simple linear optimization problems, each\nsearching for a direction of innovation in the span of the data potentially\northogonal to all subspaces except for the one to be identified in one step of\nthe algorithm. A detailed mathematical analysis is provided establishing\nsufficient conditions for iPursuit to correctly cluster the data. The proposed\napproach can provably yield exact clustering even when the subspaces have\nsignificant intersections. It is shown that the complexity of the iterative\napproach scales only linearly in the number of data points and subspaces, and\nquadratically in the dimension of the subspaces. The second framework\nintegrates iPursuit with spectral clustering to yield a new variant of\nspectral-clustering-based algorithms. The numerical simulations with both real\nand synthetic data demonstrate that iPursuit can often outperform the\nstate-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms, more so for subspaces with\nsignificant intersections, and that it significantly improves the\nstate-of-the-art result for subspace-segmentation-based face clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 23:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 05:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 23:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 03:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2017 15:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

Thus, as most of the\nworld's cities continue to grow and develop, understanding the interplay\nbetween the characteristics of urban environments and the built form of cities\nis essential to achieve local and global sustainability goals. Here, we compile\nand analyze the most extensive data set of building shapes to date, covering\nmore than 4.8 million individual buildings across several major cities in North\nAmerica. We show that average building height increases systematically with\ncity size and follows theoretical predictions derived from urban scaling\ntheory. We also study the allometric relationship between surface area and\nvolume of buildings in terms of characteristic shape parameters. This allows us\nto demonstrate that the reported trend towards higher (and more voluminous)\nbuildings effectively decreases the average surface-to-volume ratio, suggesting\npotentially significant energy savings with growing city size. At the same\ntime, however, the surface-to-volume ratio increases in the downtown cores of\nlarge cities, due to shape effects and specifically to the proliferation of\ntall, needlelike buildings. Thus, the issue of changes in building shapes with\ncity size and associated energy management problem is highly heterogeneous.

Here we model how humans infer subgoals from\nobservations of complex action sequences using a nonparametric Bayesian model,\nwhich assumes that observed actions are generated by approximately rational\nplanning over unknown subgoal sequences. We test this model with a behavioral\nexperiment in which humans observed different series of goal-directed actions,\nand inferred both the number and composition of the subgoal sequences\nassociated with each goal. The Bayesian model predicts human subgoal inferences\nwith high accuracy, and significantly better than several alternative models\nand straightforward heuristics. Motivated by this result, we simulate how\nlearning and inference of subgoals can improve performance in an artificial\nuser assistance task. The Bayesian model learns the correct subgoals from fewer\nobservations, and better assists users by more rapidly and accurately inferring\nthe goal of their actions than alternative approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 06:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-28"}

Recently, its measurement speed, sensitivity, and precision have\nbeen shown to be significantly enhanced by using dual frequency combs. However,\nwide acceptance of this technique is hindered by its requirement for two\nfrequency combs and active stabilization of the combs. Here we overcome this\npredicament with a Kerr-lens mode-locked bidirectional ring laser that\ngenerates two frequency combs with slightly different pulse repetition rates\nand a tunable yet highly stable rate difference. This peculiar lasing principle\nbuilds on a slight difference in optical cavity length between two\ncounter-propagating lasing modes due to Kerr lensing. Since these combs are\nproduced by the one and same laser cavity, their relative coherence stays\npassively stable without the need for active stabilization. To show its\nutility, we demonstrate broadband dual-comb spectroscopy with the single laser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 07:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

While the matrix rank is often\napproximated by the convex nuclear norm, the use of nonconvex low-rank\nregularizers has demonstrated better recovery performance. However, the\nresultant optimization problem is much more challenging. A very recent\nstate-of-the-art is based on the proximal gradient algorithm. However, it\nrequires an expensive full SVD in each proximal step. In this paper, we show\nthat for many commonly-used nonconvex low-rank regularizers, a cutoff can be\nderived to automatically threshold the singular values obtained from the\nproximal operator. This allows the use of power method to approximate the SVD\nefficiently. Besides, the proximal operator can be reduced to that of a much\nsmaller matrix projected onto this leading subspace. Convergence, with a rate\nof O(1/T) where T is the number of iterations, can be guaranteed. Extensive\nexperiments are performed on matrix completion and robust principal component\nanalysis.

Early spectra present broad,\nasymmetric Balmer emissions, with super-imposed narrow lines with P-Cygni\nprofile, and He I features with asymmetric, broad emission components. The\nanalysis of the line profiles shows that the H and He broad components form in\nthe same region of the ejecta. By day +142, the Halpha profile dramatically\nchanges: the narrow P-Cygni profile disappears, and the Halpha is fitted by\nthree emission components, that will be detected over the remaining 15 yrs of\nthe SN monitoring campaign. Instead, the He I emissions become progressively\nnarrower and symmetric. A sudden increase in flux of all He I lines is observed\nbetween 300 and 600 days.

Our framework is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Wu and Verd\\'u\n(2010) on analog compression and encompasses, inter alia, inpainting,\ndeclipping, super-resolution, the recovery of signals corrupted by impulse\nnoise, and the separation of (e.g., audio or video) signals into two distinct\ncomponents. The main results we report are general achievability bounds for the\ncompression rate, i.e., the number of measurements relative to the dimension of\nthe ambient space the signals live in, under either measurability or H\\\"older\ncontinuity imposed on the separator. Furthermore, we find a matching converse\nfor sources of mixed discrete-continuous distribution. For measurable\nseparators our proofs are based on a new probabilistic uncertainty relation\nwhich shows that the intersection of generic subspaces with general sets of\nsufficiently small Minkowski dimension is empty. H\\\"older continuous separators\nare dealt with by introducing the concept of regularized probabilistic\nuncertainty relations. The probabilistic uncertainty relations we develop are\ninspired by embedding results in dynamical systems theory due to Sauer et al.\n(1991) and---conceptually---parallel classical Donoho-Stark and Elad-Bruckstein\nuncertainty principles at the heart of compressed sensing theory.\nOperationally, the new uncertainty relations take the theory of sparse signal\nseparation beyond traditional sparsity---as measured in terms of the number of\nnon-zero entries---to the more general notion of low description complexity as\nquantified by Minkowski dimension.

Indeed, 56% of visually impaired people in France declared having\nproblems concerning autonomous mobility. These problems often mean that\nvisually impaired people travel less, which influences their personal and\nprofessional life and can lead to exclusion from society. Therefore this issue\npresents a social challenge as well as an important research area. Accessible\ngeographic maps are helpful for acquiring knowledge about a city's or\nneighborhood's configuration, as well as selecting a route to reach a\ndestination. Traditionally, raised-line paper maps with braille text have been\nused. These maps have proved to be efficient for the acquisition of spatial\nknowledge by visually impaired people. Yet, these maps possess significant\nlimitations. For instance, due to the specificities of the tactile sense only a\nlimited amount of information can be displayed on a single map, which\ndramatically increases the number of maps that are needed. For the same reason,\nit is difficult to represent specific information such as distances. Finally,\nbraille labels are used for textual descriptions but only a small percentage of\nthe visually impaired population reads braille. In France 15% of blind people\nare braille readers and only 10% can read and write. In the United States,\nfewer than 10% of the legally blind people are braille readers and only 10% of\nblind children actually learn braille. Recent technological advances have\nenabled the design of interactive maps with the aim to overcome these\nlimitations. Indeed, interactive maps have the potential to provide a broad\nspectrum of the population with spatial knowledge, irrespective of age,\nimpairment, skill level, or other factors. To this regard, they might be an\nefficient means for providing visually impaired people with access to\ngeospatial information. In this paper we give an overview of our research on\nmaking geographic maps accessible to visually impaired people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 12:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

This\ncorrelation, which is known as the hardness-intensity correlation or the\nGolenetskii correlation, not only holds important clues to the physics of GRBs\nbut is thought to have the potential to determine redshifts of bursts. In this\npaper, I use a hierarchical Bayesian model to study the universality of the\nrest-frame Golenetskii correlation and in particular I assess its use as a\nredshift estimator for GRBs. I find that, using a power-law prescription of the\ncorrelation, the power-law indices cluster near a common value, but have a\nbroader variance than previously reported ($\\sim 1-2$). Furthermore, I find\nevidence that there is spread in intrinsic rest-frame correlation\nnormalizations for the GRBs in our sample ($\\sim 10^{51}-10^{53}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$). This points towards variable physical settings of the emission\n(magnetic field strength, number of emitting electrons, photospheric radius,\nviewing angle, etc.). Subsequently, these results eliminate the Golenetskii\ncorrelation as a useful tool for redshift determination and hence a\ncosmological probe. Nevertheless, the Bayesian method introduced in this paper\nallows for a better determination of the rest frame properties of the\ncorrelation, which in turn allows for more stringent limitations for physical\nmodels of the emission to be set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 12:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In this work, we demonstrate the coherent coupling of an\nexciton localized in a lithographically positioned, site-controlled\nsemiconductor quantum dot to an external resonant laser field. For strong\ncontinuous-wave driving we observe the characteristic Mollow triplet and\nanalyze the Rabi splitting and sideband widths as a function of driving\nstrength and temperature. The sideband widths increase linearly with\ntemperature and the square of the driving strength, which we explain via\ncoupling of the exciton to longitudinal acoustic phonons. We also find an\nincrease of the Rabi splitting with temperature, which indicates a temperature\ninduced delocalization of the excitonic wave function resulting in an increase\nof the oscillator strength. Finally, we demonstrate coherent control of the\nexciton excited state population via pulsed resonant excitation and observe a\ndamping of the Rabi oscillations with increasing pulse area, which is\nconsistent with our exciton-photon coupling model.

In a system with three (or more) bodies, however,\nthe number of degrees of freedom is more than that of the constants of motion.\nTherefore, the present paper discusses the evolution of the triangular system\nby directly treating the gravitational radiation reaction force to each body.\nThe perturbed equations of motion are solved by using the Laplace transform\ntechnique. It is found that the triangular configuration is adiabatically\nshrinking and is kept in equilibrium by increasing the orbital frequency due to\nthe radiation reaction if the mass ratios satisfy the Newtonian stability\ncondition. Long-term stability involving the first post-Newtonian corrections\nis also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 14:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 06:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 02:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-22"}

Understanding the advantages and limitations of\ndifferent network inference methods is key to their effective application in\ndifferent circumstances. The common structural properties shared by diverse\nnetworks naturally pose a challenge when it comes to devising accurate\ninference methods, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of comparison and\nevaluation methods. Historically, every new methodology has only been tested\nagainst \\textit{gold standard} (true values) purpose-designed synthetic and\nreal-world (validated) biological networks. In this paper we aim to assess the\nimpact of taking into consideration aspects of topological and information\ncontent in the evaluation of the final accuracy of an inference procedure.\nSpecifically, we will compare the best inference methods, in both\ngraph-theoretic and information-theoretic terms, for preserving topological\nproperties and the original information content of synthetic and biological\nnetworks. New methods for performance comparison are introduced by borrowing\nideas from gene set enrichment analysis and by applying concepts from\nalgorithmic complexity. Experimental results show that no individual algorithm\noutperforms all others in all cases, and that the challenging and non-trivial\nnature of network inference is evident in the struggle of some of the\nalgorithms to turn in a performance that is superior to random guesswork.\nTherefore special care should be taken to suit the method to the purpose at\nhand. Finally, we show that evaluations from data generated using different\nunderlying topologies have different signatures that can be used to better\nchoose a network reconstruction method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 14:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 18:54:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 18:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

Such extensive campaign allowed us to\ncharacterize the resulting time series of bandwidth as the addition of a\nstationary component and some infrequent excursions (typically, downtimes).\nWhile the former provides a description of the bandwidth users can expect in\nthe Cloud, the latter is closely related to the robustness of the Cloud (i.e.,\nthe occurrence of downtimes is correlated). Both components have been studied\nfurther by applying a factor analysis, specifically ANOVA, as a mechanism to\nformally compare data-centers' behaviors and extract generalities. The results\nshow that the stationary process is closely related to data-center locations\nand CSPs involved in transfers, which fortunately makes both the Cloud more\npredictable and the set of reported measurements extrapolate. On the other\nhand, although the correlation in the Cloud is low, i.e., only 10% of the\nmeasured pair of paths showed some correlation, we have found evidence that\nsuch correlation depends on the particular relationships between pairs of\ndata-centers with little link to more general factors. Positively, this implies\nthat data-centers either at the same area or CSP do not show qualitatively more\ncorrelation than others data-centers, which eases the deployment of robust\ninfrastructures. On the downside, this metric is barely generalizable and,\nconsequently, calls for exhaustive monitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 15:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

A spatially-coupled split-component ensemble is defined, generalizing\nfrom the most important codes of this class, staircase codes and braided block\ncodes, and preserving a deterministic partitioning of component-code bits over\ncode blocks. Our analysis focuses on low-complexity iterative algebraic\ndecoding, which, for the binary erasure channel, is equivalent to a\ngeneralization of the peeling decoder. Using the differential equation method,\nwe derive a vector recursion that tracks the expected residual graph evolution\nthroughout the decoding process. The threshold of the recursion is found using\npotential function analysis. We generalize the analysis to mixture ensembles\nconsisting of more than one type of component code, which provide increased\nflexibility of ensemble parameters and can improve performance. The analysis\nextends to the binary symmetric channel by assuming mis-correction-free\ncomponent-code decoding. Simple upper-bounds on the number of errors\ncorrectable by the ensemble are derived.
