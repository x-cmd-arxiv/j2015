On the contrary, the scenario with\nonly one nonzero vev turns out to be a successful model for cold dark matter\nphenomenology, which also turns out to be valid up to the Planck scale at the\nsame time. Stringent restrictions are obtained on the model parameter space in\neach case. Thus, the S3 symmetric scalar sector emerges as an ultraviolet\ncomplete theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 17:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 13:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

We first consider a point-to-point streaming and analyze how the\ntrade-off is affected by the frequency of block-wise feedback, whereby the\nsource receives full channel state feedback at periodic intervals. We show that\nfrequent feedback can drastically improve the throughput-smoothness trade-off.\nThen we consider the problem of multicasting a packet stream to two users.

In order to constrain the origin\nof this component, we exploit the different behaviors of these models above 10\nkeV. Ionized reflection covers a broad energy range, from the soft X-rays to\nthe hard X-rays, while Comptonization drops very quickly in the soft X-rays. We\npresent here the results of a study done on 102 Seyfert 1s (Sy 1.0, 1.2, 1.5\nand NLSy1) from the Swift/BAT 70-Month Hard X-ray Survey catalog. The joint\nspectral analysis of Swift/BAT and XMM-Newton data allows a hard X-ray view of\nthe soft excess that is present in about 80% of the objects of our sample. We\ndiscuss how the soft-excess strength is linked to the reflection at high\nenergy, to the photon index of the primary continuum and to the Eddington\nratio. In particular, we find a positive dependence of the soft-excess\nintensity on the Eddington ratio. We compare our results to simulations of\nblurred ionized-reflection models and show that they are in contradiction. By\nstacking both XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT spectra per soft-excess strength, we see\nthat the shape of reflection at hard X-rays stays constant when the soft excess\nvaries, showing an absence of link between reflection and soft excess.

However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing\nmetallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the\nso-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic\nchemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects\nthat of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer\nof chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should\nthen all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency\nand orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without\nover-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars,\nrespectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper\ndiscusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider\na similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically\nsignificant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,\nwhile four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and\nnormal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. The single\nstars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-C band'', while the\nbinaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. We conclude that the\nnucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in these\nancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted on\ntheir natal molecular clouds in the early Galactic ISM by an even earlier,\nexternal source, strongly indicating that the CEMP-no stars are likely bona\nfide second-generation stars. We discuss potential production sites for carbon\nand its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ISM, and\nimplications for the composition of high-redshift DLA systems.

We find the subhalo population is reproduced to\nwithin $\\lesssim10\\%$ for both dark matter only and non-radiative runs, with\nindividual objects showing code-to-code scatter of $\\lesssim0.1$ dex, although\nthe gas in non-radiative simulations shows significant scatter. Including\nfeedback physics significantly increases the diversity. Subhalo mass and\n$V_{max}$ distributions vary by $\\approx20\\%$. The galaxy populations also show\nstriking code-to-code variations. Although the Tully-Fisher relation is similar\nin almost all codes, the number of galaxies with $10^{9}M_\\odot/h\\lesssim\nM_*\\lesssim 10^{12}M_\\odot/h$ can differ by a factor of 4. Individual galaxies\nshow code-to-code scatter of $\\sim0.5$ dex in stellar mass. Moreover, strong\nsystematic differences exist, with some codes producing galaxies $70\\%$ smaller\nthan others. The diversity partially arises from the inclusion/absence of AGN\nfeedback. Our results combined with our companion papers demonstrate that\nsubgrid physics is not just subject to fine-tuning, but the complexity of\nbuilding galaxies in all environments remains a challenge. We argue even basic\ngalaxy properties, such as the stellar mass to halo mass, should be treated\nwith errors bars of $\\sim0.2-0.4$ dex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 00:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 23:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

In this case, the\nroles of infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators\n(MVNOs) can be logically separated and the resources (e.g., subchannels, power,\nand antennas) of a base station owned by an InP can be transparently shared by\nmultiple MVNOs, while each MVNO virtually owns the entire BS. Naturally, the\nissue of resource allocation arises. In particular, the InP is required to\nabstract the physical resources into isolated slices for each MVNO who then\nallocates the resources within the slice to its subscribed users. In this\npaper, we aim to address this two-level hierarchical resource allocation\nproblem while satisfying the requirements of efficient resource allocation,\nstrict inter-slice isolation, and the ability of intra-slice customization. To\nthis end, we design a hierarchical combinatorial auction mechanism, based on\nwhich a truthful and sub-efficient resource allocation framework is provided.\nSpecifically, winner determination problems (WDPs) are formulated for the InP\nand MVNOs, and computationally tractable algorithms are proposed to solve these\nWDPs. Also, pricing schemes are designed to ensure incentive compatibility. The\ndesigned mechanism can achieve social efficiency in each level even if each\nparty involved acts selfishly. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the\nproposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 00:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

However, the binding energies of electrons are sometimes neglected\nin extracting the known nuclear masses. The influence of binding energies of\nelectrons on nuclear mass predictions are carefully investigated in this work.\nIf the binding energies of electrons are directly subtracted from the\ntheoretical mass predictions, the rms deviations of nuclear mass predictions\nwith respect to the known data are increased by about $200$ keV for nuclei with\n$Z, N\\geqslant 8$. Furthermore, by using the Coulomb energies between protons\nto absorb the binding energies of electrons, their influence on the rms\ndeviations is significantly reduced to only about $10$ keV for nuclei with $Z,\nN\\geqslant 8$. However, the binding energies of electrons are still important\nfor the heavy nuclei, about $150$ keV for nuclei around $Z=100$ and up to about\n$500$ keV for nuclei around $Z=120$. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the\nbinding energies of electrons to reliably predict the masses of heavy nuclei at\nan accuracy of hundreds of keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 02:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 11:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

Existing deep models rely on a\nsingle sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for\nmatching.

To tackle this problem, we present a new\ndeep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence\nrepresentations.

The matching score is finally produced by\naggregating interactions between these different positional sentence\nrepresentations, through $k$-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron.

However, its multifrequency profiles cannot simply be fitted with\ntwo Gaussian functions, and a third component is always needed to fit the\nbridge region (between two peaks). This would introduce additional, redundant\nparameters. In this paper, through a comparison of five fitting functions\n(Gaussian, von Mises, hyperbolic secant, square hyperbolic secant, and\nLorentz), it is found that the square hyperbolic secant function can best\nreproduce the profile, yielding an improved fit. Moreover, a symmetric 2D\nradiation beam function, instead of a simple 1D Gaussian function, is used to\nfit the profile. Each profile with either well-resolved or not-so-well-resolved\npeaks could be fitted adequately using this beam function, and the bridge\nemission between the two peaks does not need to be a new component. Adopting\ninclination and impact angles based on polarization measurements, the opening\nangle ({\\theta}_{\\mu}0) of the radiation beam in a certain frequency band is\nderived from beam-function fitting. The corresponding radiation altitudes are\nthen calculated. Based on multi-frequency profiles, we also computed the\nLorentz factors of the particles and their dispersion at those locations in\nboth the curvature-radiation (CR) and inverse-Compton-scattering (ICS) models.\nWe found that the Lorentz factors of the particles decrease rapidly as the\nradiation altitude increases.

Fitting a warped, thin disk model to these\nmeasurements, we determine a Hubble Constant $H_{0}$ of 66.0 $\\pm$ 6.0 km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with the angular-diameter distance to NGC 5765b of 126.3\n$\\pm$ 11.6 Mpc.\n  Apart from the distance measurement, we also investigate some physical\nproperties related to the maser disk in NGC 5765b. The high-velocity features\nare spatially distributed into several clumps, which may indicate the existence\nof a spiral density wave associated with the accretion disk. For the\nred-shifted features, the envelope defined by the peak maser intensities\nincreases with radius. The profile of the systemic masers in NGC 5765b is\nsmooth and shows almost no structural changes over the two years of monitoring\ntime, which differs from the more variable case of NGC 4258.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 07:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

To achieve the perpetual\nnetwork operation and process the data with high importance, measured by Value\nof Information (VoI), the network has to operate under partial duty cycle and\nto improve the efficiency to consume the harvested energy. The challenging\nproblem is how to deal with the stochastic feature of the natural energy and\nthe variable data VoI. We consider the energy consumption during storing and\nthe diversity of the data process including sampling, transmitting and\nreceiving, which consume different power levels. The problem is then mapped as\nthe budget-dynamic Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) problem by treating the energy as the\nbudget and the data process as arm pulling. This paper proposes an\nOpportunistic Duty Cycling (ODC) scheme to improve the energy efficiency while\nsatisfying the perpetual network operation. ODC chooses the proper\nopportunities to store the harvested energy or to spend it on the data process\nbased on the historical information of the energy harvesting and the VoI of the\nprocessed data. With this scheme, each sensor node need only estimate the\nambient natural energy in short term so as to reduce the computation and the\nstorage for the historical information. It also can distributively adjust its\nown duty cycle according to its local historical information. This paper also\nconducts the extensive analysis on the performance of our scheme ODC, and the\ntheoretical results validate the regret, which is the difference between the\noptimal scheme and ours. Our experimental results also manifest the promising\nperformance of ODC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 09:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

In coated\nconductors, however, one often encounters problems due to weak or no\nstabilization and in such case, when the risk of burning the tape is high, the\n4-probe approach can fail. In other cases such as in HTS cable structures,\nbesides vulnerability and high risk of damage, it may also be difficult to\nachieve a high critical current level with a power supply that is normally used\nto characterize single strands. We therefore investigated an alternative method\nto determine the DC I-V curve, based on measuring the AC transport loss as a\nfunction of frequency in overcritical current range. In the AC regime, both the\nhysteretic loss component and the joule dissipation are present for applied\ntransport currents exceeding the critical current Ic. In this work, AC loss\nmeasurements at different frequencies are related to different electric fields\nin DC and a curve similar to the DC I-V is obtained. From this curve, the power\nindex N and Ic values are estimated. AC regime operation can be more beneficial\nfor two reasons: firstly, because very high currents can be achieved easily by\nusing a transformer; secondly, because the effective joule heat dissipation\nwith overcritical AC currents is much lower than that with DC of the same\namplitudes. In the experiment, we used a 4 mm wide YBCO reference tape with 20\n{\\mu}m of Cu-stabilization. For the comparison with AC transport loss, the\nsample was measured with the standard 4-probe technique and remained stable\neven in overload condition. To support our study, numerical simulations,\nreproducing both transient and stationary operation conditions, were performed.\nA similar relation between the AC current transport loss and the I-V curves was\nalso observed in the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 10:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

In order to\nbridge this gap, %based on \\textit{dynamic framed-slotted ALOHA} (DFSA)\nprotocol, we devote this paper to designing a generic framework of stable and\naccurate tag population estimation schemes based on Kalman filter for both\nstatic and dynamic RFID systems. %The objective is to devise estimation schemes\nand analyze the boundedness of estimation error.

We then solved the inverse problem to\ninfer the radial differential rotation profile using a RLS inversion and\nkernels from the best-fit stellar model.We found that the inversions for\nSun-like stars with solar-like radial differential rotation profiles are\ninsensitive to the uncertainties in the stellar models. We found that when the\nrotation rate below the convection zone is increased to six times that of the\nsurface rotation rate the inferred rotation profile excluded solid body\nrotation. With the current observational uncertainties, we found that\ninversions of subgiant stars are sensitive to the uncertainties in the stellar\nmodel. Our findings suggest that inversions for the radial differential\nrotation of subgiant stars would benefit from more tightly constrained stellar\nmodels. In Sun-like stars, the insensitivity of the inversions to stellar model\nuncertainties suggests that it may be possible to perform ensemble inversions\nfor the average radial differential rotation of many stars with a range of\nstellar types to better constrain the inversions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 12:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

In response, university managers are\nincreasingly attracted to simple indicators as guides to the dynamics of the\npositions of their various institutions in league tables.

Rather than accepting the rise and\nfall of universities, departments and individuals on a turbulent sea of\narbitrary measures, we suggest it is incumbent upon the scientific community\nitself to clarify their nature.

The estimator improves\nupon existing methods by using an approximate second-order expansion of the\nparameter functional, in addition to the first-order expansion employed by\nstandard doubly robust methods. This results in weaker assumptions about the\nconvergence rates necessary to establish consistency, local efficiency, and\nasymptotic linearity. The general estimation strategy is developed under the\ntargeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) framework. We present a\nsimulation comparing the sensitivity of the first and second order estimators\nto the convergence rate of the initial estimators of the outcome regression and\nmissingness score. In our simulation, the second-order TMLE improved the\ncoverage probability of a confidence interval by up to 85%. In addition, we\npresent a first-order estimator inspired by a second-order expansion of the\nparameter functional. This estimator only requires one-dimensional smoothing,\nwhereas implementation of the second-order TMLE generally requires kernel\nsmoothing on the covariate space. The first-order estimator proposed is\nexpected to have improved finite sample performance compared to existing\nfirst-order estimators.

Current approaches to text segmentation are similar in\nthat they all use word-frequency metrics to measure the similarity between two\nregions of text, so that a document is segmented based on the lexical cohesion\nbetween its words. Various NLP tasks are now moving towards the semantic web\nand ontologies, such as ontology-based IR systems, to capture the\nconceptualizations associated with user needs and contents. Text segmentation\nbased on lexical cohesion between words is hence not sufficient anymore for\nsuch tasks. This paper proposes OntoSeg, a novel approach to text segmentation\nbased on the ontological similarity between text blocks. The proposed method\nuses ontological similarity to explore conceptual relations between text\nsegments and a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm to\nrepresent the text as a tree-like hierarchy that is conceptually structured.\nThe rich structure of the created tree further allows the segmentation of text\nin a linear fashion at various levels of granularity.
