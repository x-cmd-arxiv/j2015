It is a snowball sampling procedure where the weight\nof the respondents is adjusted for the likelihood of being sampled due to\ndifferences in the number of contacts.

This\nfact has not gone unnoticed, with governments clamping down on this medium via\ncensorship, and circumvention researchers working to stay one step ahead.\n  In this paper, we explore a promising new avenue for covert channels:\nreal-time strategy-video games. Video games have two key features that make\nthem attractive cover protocols for censorship circumvention. First, due to the\npopularity of gaming platforms such as Steam, there are a lot of different\nvideo games, each with their own protocols and server infrastructure. Users of\nvideo-game-based censorship-circumvention tools can therefore diversify across\nmany games, making it difficult for the censor to respond by simply blocking a\nsingle cover protocol. Second, games in the same genre have many common\nfeatures and concepts. As a result, the same covert channel framework can be\neasily adapted to work with many different games. This means that circumvention\ntool developers can stay ahead of the censor by creating a diverse set of tools\nand by quickly adapting to blockades created by the censor.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing our coding\nscheme over two real-time strategy-games (including a very popular\nclosed-source game). We evaluate the security of our system prototype -- Castle\n-- by quantifying its resilience to a censor-adversary, its similarity to real\ngame traffic, and its ability to avoid common pitfalls in covert channel\ndesign.

Scenarios featuring superparticles with\ndetector-scale lifetimes have therefore remained a tantalizing possibility for\nsub-TeV SUSY, since explicit limits are relatively sparse. Nonetheless, the\nextremely low backgrounds of the few existing searches for collider-stable and\ndisplaced new particles facilitates recastings into powerful long-lived\nsuperparticle searches, even for models for which those searches are highly\nnon-optimized. In this paper, we assess the status of such models in the\ncontext of baryonic R-parity violation, gauge mediation, and mini-split SUSY.\nWe explore a number of common simplified spectra where hadronic decays can be\nimportant, employing recasts of LHC searches that utilize different detector\nsystems and final-state objects.

Unfortunately, the progenitors responsible\nhave left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. To\nconstrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminium\nabundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: NGC~1904, NGC~2808,\nand NGC~362. The present investigation along with our previous analysis of M12\nand M5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of Li and\nAl abundances. Our results indicate that Li production has occurred in each of\nthe three clusters. In NGC~362 we detected an M12-like behaviour, with first\nand second-generation stars sharing very similar Li abundances favouring a\nprogenitor that is able to produce Li, such as AGB stars. Multiple progenitor\ntypes are possible in NGC~1904 and NGC~2808, as they possess both an\nintermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars and\nalso an extreme population, that is enriched in Al but depleted in Li. A simple\ndilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. Finally, the internal\nLi variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element is\na function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relatively\nmetal-rich clusters are more adept at producing Li.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 20:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The two classical forces of evolution are\nmutation and selection. Assuming small mutation rates, evolution can be\npredicted based solely on the fitness differences between phenotypes.\nPredicting an evolutionary process under varying mutation rates as well as\nvarying fitness is still an open question. Experimental procedures, however, do\ninclude these complexities along with fluctuating population sizes and\nstochastic events such as extinctions. We investigate the mutational path\nprobabilities of systems having epistatic effects on both fitness and mutation\nrates using a theoretical and computational framework. In contrast to previous\nmodels, we do not limit ourselves to the typical strong selection, weak\nmutation (SSWM)-regime or to fixed population sizes. Rather we allow epistatic\ninteractions to also affect mutation rates. This can lead to qualitatively\nnon-trivial dynamics. Pathways, that are negligible in the SSWM-regime, can\novercome fitness valleys and become accessible. This finding has the potential\nto extend the traditional predictions based on the SSWM foundation and bring us\ncloser to what is observed in experimental systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 20:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}

The goal of\nthese methods is to map the given high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional\nspace preserving certain properties of the initial data. There are two kinds of\ntechniques for this purpose. The first, projective methods, builds an explicit\nlinear projection from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional one.\nOn the other hand, the nonlinear methods utilizes nonlinear and implicit\nmapping between the two spaces. In both cases, the methods considered in\nliterature have usually relied on computationally very intensive matrix\nfactorizations, frequently the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The\ncomputational burden of SVD quickly renders these dimension reduction methods\ninfeasible thanks to the ever-increasing sizes of the practical datasets.\n  In this paper, we present a new decomposition strategy, Reduced Basis\nDecomposition (RBD), which is inspired by the Reduced Basis Method (RBM). Given\n$X$ the high-dimensional data, the method approximates it by $Y \\, T (\\approx\nX)$ with $Y$ being the low-dimensional surrogate and $T$ the transformation\nmatrix. $Y$ is obtained through a greedy algorithm thus extremely efficient. In\nfact, it is significantly faster than SVD with comparable accuracy. $T$ can be\ncomputed on the fly. Moreover, unlike many compression algorithms, it easily\nfinds the mapping for an arbitrary ``out-of-sample'' vector and it comes with\nan ``error indicator'' certifying the accuracy of the compression. Numerical\nresults are shown validating these claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 21:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}

The need for observers is ubiquitous, with applications in\nfields ranging from engineering to biology to economics. The most widely used\nobserver is the Kalman filter, which is known to be the optimal estimator of\nthe state when the noise is additive and Gaussian. Because its performance is\nlimited by the sensors to which it is paired, it is natural to seek an optimal\nsensor for the Kalman filter. The problem is however not convex and, as a\nconsequence, many ad hoc methods have been used over the years to design\nsensors. We show in this paper how to characterize and obtain the optimal\nsensor for the Kalman filter. Precisely, we exhibit a positive definite\noperator which optimal sensors have to commute with. We furthermore provide a\ngradient flow to find optimal sensors, and prove the convergence of this\ngradient flow to the unique minimum in a broad range of applications. This\noptimal sensor yields the lowest possible estimation error for measurements\nwith a fixed signal to noise ratio. The results presented here also apply to\nthe dual problem of optimal actuator design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 23:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 15:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 15:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction\nof a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark\nmatter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a\nremapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.\nThis procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the\nparticle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the\nsolution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on\nthe Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have\nformed. Furthermore, the resulting scheme does not suffer from the unphysical,\nsmall-scale \"clumping\" phenomenon known to occur on the Pancake problem when\nthe perturbation wave vector is not aligned with one of the Cartesian\ncoordinate axes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 00:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 18:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

Indeed, persuasive\ncommunication has been estimated to account for almost a third of all economic\nactivity in the US. This paper examines persuasion through a computational\nlens, focusing on what is perhaps the most basic and fundamental model in this\nspace: the celebrated Bayesian persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow. Here\nthere are two players, a sender and a receiver. The receiver must take one of a\nnumber of actions with a-priori unknown payoff, and the sender has access to\nadditional information regarding the payoffs. The sender can commit to\nrevealing a noisy signal regarding the realization of the payoffs of various\nactions, and would like to do so as to maximize her own payoff assuming a\nperfectly rational receiver.\n  We examine the sender's optimization task in three of the most natural input\nmodels for this problem, and essentially pin down its computational complexity\nin each. When the payoff distributions of the different actions are i.i.d. and\ngiven explicitly, we exhibit a polynomial-time (exact) algorithm, and a\n\"simple\" $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm. Our optimal scheme for the i.i.d.\nsetting involves an analogy to auction theory, and makes use of Border's\ncharacterization of the space of reduced-forms for single-item auctions. When\naction payoffs are independent but non-identical with marginal distributions\ngiven explicitly, we show that it is #P-hard to compute the optimal expected\nsender utility. Finally, we consider a general (possibly correlated) joint\ndistribution of action payoffs presented by a black box sampling oracle, and\nexhibit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with a bi-criteria\nguarantee.

Selection functions appear in diverse areas of mathematics\nand computer science (especially game theory, proof theory and topology) but\nthe existing literature does not heavily emphasise the fact that the selection\nmonad is a CPS translation. In particular it has so far gone unnoticed that the\nselection monad has a call/cc-like operator with interesting similarities and\ndifferences to the usual call/cc, which we explore experimentally using\nHaskell.\n  Selection functions can be used whenever we find the intermediate result more\ninteresting than the final result.

In game theory we find the move\nchosen by a player more interesting than the outcome that results from that\nmove. The author and collaborators are developing a theory of games in which\nselection functions are viewed as generalised notions of rationality, used to\nmodel players.

Since the structure of\npartial separability and multipartite entanglement is getting complicated if\nthe number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an\nultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the\nrich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order\nstructure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps\ntowards this direction.\n  First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability\nclassification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A\n86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the\nentanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different\nkinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of\nthe partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this\nstructure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be\nmapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.\n  Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that\na given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of\nentanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement\nclasses. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and\npropose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite\ngeneralization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement\nentropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The\nmultipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to\nconsider the measures to be the different manifestations of some \"unified\"\nnotion of entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 13:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 11:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 20:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 16:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

In ITER,\ndisruptions are expected to generate REs mainly through knock-on collisions,\nwhere enough momentum can be transferred from existing runaways to slow\nelectrons to transport the latter beyond a critical momentum, setting off an\navalanche of REs. Since knock-on runaways are usually scattered off with a\nsignificant perpendicular component of the momentum with respect to the local\nmagnetic field direction, these particles are highly magnetized. Consequently,\nthe momentum dynamics require a full 3-D kinetic description, since these\nelectrons are highly sensitive to the magnetic non-uniformity of a toroidal\nconfiguration. A bounce-averaged knock-on source term is derived. The\ngeneration of REs from the combined effect of Dreicer mechanism and knock-on\ncollision process is studied with the code LUKE, a solver of the 3-D linearized\nbounce-averaged relativistic electron Fokker-Planck equation, through the\ncalculation of the response of the electron distribution function to a constant\nparallel electric field. This work shows that the avalanche effect can be\nimportant even in non-disruptive scenarios. RE formation through knock-on\ncollisions is found to be strongly reduced when taking place off the magnetic\naxis, since trapped electrons cannot contribute to the RE population. The\nrelative importance of the avalanche mechanism is investigated as a function of\nthe key parameters for RE formation; the plasma temperature and the electric\nfield strength. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the simulations show\nthat in low temperature and E-field knock-on collisions are the dominant source\nof REs and can play a significant role for RE generation, including in\nnon-disruptive scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 14:22:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}

In a second phase, an automated theorem prover tries\nto verify the answer candidates on the basis of their logical representations.\nIn a third phase - because the knowledge may be incomplete and inconsistent -,\nwe consider extensions of logical reasoning to improve the results. In this\ncontext, we work toward the application of techniques from human reasoning: We\nemploy defeasible reasoning to compare the answers w.r.t. specificity, deontic\nlogic, normative reasoning, and model construction. Moreover, we use integrated\ncase-based reasoning and machine learning techniques on the basis of the\nsemantic structure of the questions and answer candidates to learn giving the\nright answers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 14:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 08:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

The main aim\nof this study is to obtain the best quantitative shape for the flux rope axis\nand for the shock surface from in situ data obtained during spacecraft\ncrossings of these structures. We first compare the orientation of the flux\nropes axes and shock normals obtained from independent data analyses of the\nsame events, observed in situ at 1AU from the Sun. Then, we carry out an\noriginal statistical analysis of axes/shock normals by deriving the statistical\ndistributions of their orientations. We fit the observed distributions using\nthe distributions derived from several synthetic models describing these\nshapes. We show that the distributions of axis/shock orientations are very\nsensitive to their respective shape. One classical model, used to analyze\ninterplanetary imager data, is incompatible with the in situ data. Two other\nmodels are introduced, for which the results for axis and shock normals lead to\nvery similar shapes; the fact that the data for MCs and shocks are independent\nstrengthen this result. The model which best fit all the data sets has an\nellipsoidal shape with similar aspect ratio values for all the data sets. These\nderived shapes for the flux rope axis and shock surface have several potential\napplications. First, these shapes can be used to construct a consistent ICME\nmodel. Second, these generic shapes can be used to develop a quantitative model\nto analyze imager data, as well as constraining the output of numerical\nsimulations of ICMEs.

We show that the correlation functions and expectation\nvalues of operators at finite volume/temperature are not those of the free\ntheory, and that the TBA does not give enough information to calculate them.\nOur analysis is done using the Leclair-Mussardo formula for finite-volume\ncorrelators, and knowledge of the exact infinite-volume form factors. We\npresent analytical results for the one-point function of the energy-momentum\ntensor, and the two-point function of the renormalized field operator. The\nresults for the energy-momentum tensor can be used to define a nontrivial\npartition function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 19:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 15:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Instead of recording a bit on an\nensemble of random grains, BPM uses an array of lithographically defined\nisolated magnetic islands, each of which stores one bit. Fabrication of BPM is\nviewed as the greatest challenge for its commercialization. In this article we\ndescribe a BPM fabrication method which combines e-beam lithography, directed\nself-assembly of block copolymers, self-aligned double patterning, nanoimprint\nlithography, and ion milling to generate BPM based on CoCrPt alloys. This\ncombination of fabrication technologies achieves feature sizes of $<10 nm$,\nsignificantly smaller than what conventional semiconductor nanofabrication\nmethods can achieve. In contrast to earlier work which used hexagonal\nclose-packed arrays of round islands, our latest approach creates BPM with\nrectangular bitcells, which are advantageous for integration with existing hard\ndisk drive technology. The advantages of rectangular bits are analyzed from a\ntheoretical and modeling point of view, and system integration requirements\nsuch as servo patterns, implementation of write synchronization, and providing\nfor a stable head-disk interface are addressed in the context of experimental\nresults. Optimization of magnetic alloy materials for thermal stability,\nwriteability, and switching field distribution is discussed, and a new method\nfor growing BPM islands on a patterned template is presented. New recording\nresults at $1.6 Td/in^2$ (teradot/inch${}^2$, roughly equivalent to $1.3\nTb/in^2$) demonstrate a raw error rate $<10^{-2}$, which is consistent with the\nrecording system requirements of modern hard drives. Extendibility of BPM to\nhigher densities, and its eventual combination with energy assisted recording\nare explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 23:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

They are implemented in software applications used by\norganizations, and the activity of extracting them from software is known as\nbusiness rule mining. It has various purposes amongst which migration and\ngenerating documentation are the most common. However, apart from conventional\nsoftware, organizations also use spreadsheets for a large part of their\noperations and decision-making activities. Therefore we believe that\nspreadsheets are also rich in business rules. We thus propose to develop an\nautomated system for extracting business rules from spreadsheets in a human\ncomprehensible natural language format.
