A general strategy to undo the effect of these\naberrations is to apply wavefront correction with a deformable mirror (DM). In\nmost cases, the DM is placed conjugate to the microscope pupil, called pupil\nadaptive optics (AO). When the aberrations are spatially variant, an\nalternative configuration involves placing the DM conjugate to the main source\nof aberrations, called conjugate AO. We provide theoretical and experimental\ncomparison of both configurations for the simplified case where spatially\nvariant aberrations are produced by a well defined phase screen. We pay\nparticular attention to the resulting correction field of view (FOV). Conjugate\nAO is found to provide a significant FOV advantage.

There are two damping mechanisms which are considered to generate\nthe standing acoustic modes in coronal magnetic loops namely thermal conduction\nand radiation. The background temperature is assumed to change temporally due\nto optically thin radiation. In particular, the background plasma is assumed to\nbe radiatively cooling. The effects of cooling on longitudinal slow MHD modes\nis analytically evaluated by choosing a simple form of radiative function that\nensures the temperature evolution of the background plasma due to radiation\ncoincides with the observed cooling profile of coronal loops. The assumption of\nlow-beta plasma leads to neglect the magnetic field perturbation and eventually\nreduces the MHD equations to a 1D system modelling longitudinal MHD\noscillations in a cooling coronal loop. The cooling is assumed to occur on a\ncharacteristic time scale much larger than the oscillation period that\nsubsequently enables using the WKB theory to study the properties of standing\nwave. The governing equation describing the time-dependent amplitude of waves\nis obtained and solved analytically. The analytically derived solutions are\nnumerically evaluated to give further insight into the evolution of the\nstanding acoustic waves. We find that the plasma cooling gives rise to a\ndecrease in the amplitude of oscillations. In spite of the reduction in damping\nrate caused by rising the cooling, the damping scenario of slow standing MHD\nwaves strongly increases in hot coronal loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 16:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

We used\na dynamic, differentially rotating reference system to determine the best-fit\nannual values of the differential rotation parameters of active longitudes of\nsolar X-ray flares and sunspots in 1977-2012.\n  Results. The evolution of rotation of solar active longitudes obtained with\nX-ray flares and with sunspots is very similar.

However, the physical mechanism that leads to the complex\ntemporal distribution of gamma-ray pulses and X-ray flares is not understood.\nHere we show that the waiting time distribution (WTD) of pulses and flares\nexhibits a power-law tail extending over 4 decades with index ~2 and can be the\nmanifestation of a common time-dependent Poisson process.

The first\nplanets detected by microlensing were well described by the two-point-mass\nmodel of a star with one planet. By the end of 2014, four events involving\nthree-point-mass lenses had been announced. Two of the lenses were stars with\ntwo planetary companions each; two were binary stars with a planet orbiting one\ncomponent. While the two-point-mass model is well understood, the same cannot\nbe said for lenses with three or more components. Even the range of possible\ncritical-curve topologies and caustic geometries of the three-point-mass lens\nremains unknown. In this paper we provide new tools for mapping the\ncritical-curve topology and caustic cusp number in the parameter space of\nn-point-mass lenses. We perform our analysis in the image plane of the lens. We\nshow that all contours of the Jacobian are critical curves of re-scaled\nversions of the lens configuration. Utilizing this property further, we\nintroduce the cusp curve to identify cusp-image positions on all contours\nsimultaneously. In order to track cusp-number changes in caustic metamorphoses,\nwe define the morph curve, which pinpoints the positions of metamorphosis-point\nimages along the cusp curve. We demonstrate the usage of both curves on simple\ntwo- and three-point-mass lens examples. For the three simplest caustic\nmetamorphoses we illustrate the local structure of the image and source planes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 17:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 15:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

It is imperative that we\nrealize effective strategies to control the power consumption of the server and\nimprove the energy efficiency of data centers.

These scale-out workloads are latency-sensitive as they are user\ndriven. In order to meet strict latency constraints, they require massive\ncomputing infrastructure, which consume significant amount of energy and\ncontribute to operational costs. This cost is further aggravated by the lack of\nenergy proportionality in servers. As Internet services become even more\nubiquitous, scale-out workloads will need increasingly larger cluster\ninstallations. As such, we desire an investigation into the energy\nproportionality and the mechanisms to improve the power consumption of\nscale-out workloads.\n  Therefore, in this paper, we study the energy proportionality and power\nconsumption of clusters in the context of scale-out workloads. Towards this\nend, we evaluate the potential of power and resource provisioning to improve\nthe energy proportionality for this class of workloads. Using data serving, web\nsearching and data caching as our representative workloads, we first analyze\nthe component-level power distribution on a cluster. Second, we characterize\nhow these workloads utilize the cluster. Third, we analyze the potential of\npower provisioning techniques (i.e., active low-power, turbo and idle low-power\nmodes) to improve the energy proportionality of scale-out workloads. We then\ndescribe the ability of active low-power modes to provide trade-offs in power\nand latency. Finally, we compare and contrast power provisioning and resource\nprovisioning techniques.

Here we adopt a mesoscopic perspective and\npresent a principled framework to identify collective features at multiple\nscales and rank their importance for epidemic spread. We use tensor\ndecomposition techniques to build an additive representation of a temporal\nnetwork in terms of mesostructures, such as cohesive clusters and\ntemporally-localized mixing patterns. This representation allows to determine\nthe impact of individual mesostructures on epidemic spread and to assess the\neffect of targeted interventions that remove chosen structures. We illustrate\nthis approach using high-resolution social network data on face-to-face\ninteractions in a school and show that our method affords the design of\neffective mesoscale interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 19:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

Such situations include, for example, the moon in the solar wind\nwake and probes in magnetized laboratory plasmas. The instability drive\nmechanism can equivalently be considered drift down the potential-energy\ngradient or drift up the density-gradient. The gradients arise because the\nplasma wake has a region of depressed density and electrostatic potential into\nwhich ions are attracted along the field. The non-linear consequences of the\ninstability are analysed in this paper. At physical ratios of electron to ion\nmass, neither linear nor quasilinear treatment can explain the observation of\nlarge-amplitude perturbations that disrupt the ion streams well before they\nbecome ion-ion unstable. We show here, however, that electron holes, once\nformed, continue to grow, driven by the drift mechanism, and if they remain in\nthe wake may reach a maximum non-linearly stable size, beyond which their\nuncontrolled growth disrupts the ions. The hole growth calculations provide a\nquantitative prediction of hole profile and size evolution. Hole growth appears\nto explain the observations of recent particle-in-cell simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 19:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

In that case, the forcing term on the boundary\nhas amplitude O($\\epsilon$^2) and oscillates at a frequency O(1/$\\epsilon$).\nThe corresponding exact solution, which has been shown to exist on a time\ninterval that is independent of $\\epsilon$ $\\in$ (0,1], has amplitude\nO($\\epsilon$). In this paper, we deal with the exact same scaling, namely\nO($\\epsilon$^2) forcing term on the boundary and O($\\epsilon$) solution, for\nquasilinear problems. In analogy with [CGM03], this corresponds to a strongly\nnonlinear regime, and our main result proves solvability for the corresponding\nWKB cascade of equations, which yields existence of approximate solutions on a\ntime interval that is independent of $\\epsilon$ $\\in$ (0,1].

I use the age matching technique to study how\ncolor-selection effects may influence the cluster RSD signal, finding a ~10%\neffect due to redder satellites preferentially occupying higher mass halos, and\na ~5% effect due to assembly-biased colors of centrals. In order to use cluster\nRSD measurements to robustly constrain modified gravity, we likely will need to\ndevelop empirical galaxy formation models more sophisticated than any in the\ncurrent literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

In general, when the Lagrangian is expanded\naround the vacuum, the strong coupling scale is identified as the mass scale\nthat appears in non-renormalizable operators. In inflationary models, however,\nthe identification of the strong coupling scale is subtle, since the structures\nof the kinetic term as well as the interaction itself can be modified by the\nbackground inflationary dynamics.

We\ntrace the adiabatic evolution of the SNR shock until 50% of the remnant is\neither in the radiative phase or is slowed down below the SMBH Keplerian\nvelocity and is sheared apart. In this way, we obtain shapes and lifetimes of\nSNRs as a function of the explosion distance from the SMBH, the gas density\nprofile and the SMBH mass.

But this brute-force method quickly hits the complexity\nbarrier since the number of evaluated expressions increases exponentially. We\nrelate a combinatorial structure called Dyck paths to the action of a boson\nword (monomial) and a large class of monomial sums on a quantum state $\\psi$.\nThis allows us to cross the exponential gap and make the problem of a boson\nunitary operator evaluation computationally tractable by achieving\npolynomial-time complexity for an extensive family of physically interesting\nmultimode Hamiltonians. We further test our method on a cubic boson Hamiltonian\nwhose Taylor series is known to diverge for all nonzero values of the coupling\nconstant and an analytic continuation via a Pad\\'e approximant must be\nperformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 02:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 17:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 21:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 15:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

The basic idea of CRNs is to allow secondary users (SUs) access\nto licensed spectrum, under the condition that the interference perceived by\nthe primary users (PUs) is minimal. In CRNs, the channel availability is\nuncertainty due to the existence of PUs, resulting in intermittent\ncommunication. Transmission control protocol (TCP) performance may\nsignificantly degrade in such conditions. To address the challenges, some\ntransport protocols have been proposed for reliable transmission in CRNs. In\nthis paper we survey the state-of-the-art transport protocols for CRNs.

K.H. Hofmann and S.A. Morris introduced the class\nof pro-Lie groups which consists of projective limits of finite-dimensional Lie\ngroups and proved that it contains all compact groups, locally compact abelian\ngroups and connected locally compact groups and is closed under products and\nclosed subgroups. A topological group G is almost connected if the quotient\ngroup of G by the connected component of its identity is compact. We prove that\nan almost connected pro-Lie group is separable iff its weight is not greater\nthan c. It is deduced that an almost connected pro-Lie group is separable if\nand only if it is a subspace of a separable Hausdorff space. It is proved that\na locally compact (even feathered) topological group G which is a subgroup of a\nseparable Hausdorff topological group is separable, but the conclusion is false\nif it is assumed only that G is homeomorphic to a subspace of a separable\nTychonoff space. Every precompact topological group of weight less than or\nequal to c is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of a separable\npseudocompact group of weight c. This implies that there is a wealth of closed\nnonseparable subgroups of separable pseudocompact groups. An example is\npresented under CH of a separable countably compact abelian group which\ncontains a non-separable closed subgroup. It is proved that the following\nconditions are equivalent for an omega-narrow topological group G: (i) G is a\nsubspace of a separable regular space; (ii) G is a subgroup of a separable\ntopological group; (iii) G is a closed subgroup of a separable pathconnected\nlocally pathconnected group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 03:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between\ntransmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well-established that the\npassage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through the stator complex\nprovides the energy needed for torque generation. However, the physics involved\nin this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a\nmechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we\nidentify two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic\nand steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator,\nwhile steric forces comprise the actual 'power stroke'. Specifically, we\npredict that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline 'hinge' residue\nin an $\\alpha$-helix of the stator are directly responsible for generating the\npower stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a\nsingle-stator motor. Furthermore, we propose several experiments to elucidate\nthe torque-speed relationship in motors where the number of stators may not be\nconstant. The proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several\nfundamental features of the flagellar motor, including: torque-speed and\nspeed-ion motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes,\nand the puzzle of swarming experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 04:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In the first scenario, we study the case when half duplex (HD)\nusers, partitioned to either the uplink (UL) set or the downlink (DL) set,\nsimultaneously communicate with the FD BS. In the second scenario, we study the\ncase when FD users simultaneously communicate UL and DL data with the FD BS.\nUnlike conventional HD only systems, inter-user interference (within the cell)\nmay severely limit the DoF, and must be carefully taken into account. With the\ngoal of providing theoretical guidelines for designing such FD systems, we\ncompletely characterize the sum DoF of each of the two different FD cellular\nnetworks by developing an achievable scheme and obtaining a matching upper\nbound. The key idea of the proposed scheme is to carefully allocate UL and DL\ninformation streams using interference alignment and beamforming techniques. By\ncomparing the DoFs of the considered FD systems with those of the conventional\nHD systems, we establish the DoF gain by enabling FD operation in various\nconfigurations. As a consequence of the result, we show that the DoF can\napproach the two-fold gain over the HD systems when the number of users becomes\nlarge enough as compared to the number of antennas at the BS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 06:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

We use advanced 3D NLTE radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nthe solar atmosphere to carry out detailed tests of chromospheric diagnostics\nat millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. Methods. We focused on the\ndiagnostics of the thermal structure of the chromosphere in the wavelength\nbands from 0.4 mm up to 9.6 mm that can be accessed with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and investigated how these diagnostics\nare affected by the instrumental resolution. Results. We find that the\nformation height range of the millimeter radiation depends on the location in\nthe simulation domain and is related to the underlying magnetic structure.\nNonetheless, the brightness temperature is a reasonable measure of the gas\ntemperature at the effective formation height at a given location on the solar\nsurface. There is considerable scatter in this relationship, but this is\nsignificantly reduced when very weak magnetic fields are avoided. Our results\nindicate that although instrumental smearing reduces the correlation between\nbrightness and temperature, millimeter brightness can still be used to reliably\ndiagnose electron temperature up to a resolution of 1\". If the resolution is\nmore degraded, then the value of the diagnostic diminishes rapidly.\nConclusions.

In an appropriate limit,\nthe field theories decouple from the rest of string/M theory. Since these vacua\nare dual to conformal field theories (CFTs), this relates some of the\nobservables of these field theories on AdS to a subsector of the dual CFTs. We\nexemplify this `rigid holography' by studying in detail the 6d N=(2,0) A_{K-1}\nsuperconformal field theory (SCFT) on AdS_5xS^1, with equal radii for AdS_5 and\nfor S^1. We choose specific boundary conditions preserving sixteen supercharges\nthat arise when this theory is embedded into Type IIB string theory on\nAdS_5xS^5/Z_K. On R^{4,1}xS^1, this 6d theory has a 5(K-1)-dimensional moduli\nspace, with unbroken 5d SU(K) gauge symmetry at (and only at) the origin. On\nAdS_5xS^1, the theory has a 2(K-1)-dimensional `moduli space' of supersymmetric\nconfigurations. We argue that in this case the SU(K) gauge symmetry is unbroken\neverywhere in the `moduli space' and that this 5d gauge theory is coupled to a\n4d theory on the boundary of AdS_5 whose coupling constants depend on the\n`moduli'. This involves non-standard boundary conditions for the gauge fields\non AdS_5. Near the origin of the `moduli space', the theory on the boundary\ncontains a weakly coupled 4d N=2 supersymmetric SU(K) gauge theory. We show\nthat this implies large corrections to the metric on the `moduli space'. The\nembedding in string theory implies that the 6d N=(2,0) theory on AdS_5xS^1 with\nsources on the boundary is a subsector of the large N limit of various 4d N=2\nquiver SCFTs that remains non-trivial in the large N limit.

However, the here reported\ncombination of bulk magnetization and complementary in-depth local-probe\nelectron spin resonance and muon spin relaxation measurements, challenges this\nconjecture. While a ferromagnetic transition occurs around 700 K, it does so\nonly in additionally annealed samples and is accompanied by an extremely small\naverage value of the ordered magnetic moment. Furthermore, several additional\nmagnetic instabilities are detected at lower temperatures. These coincide with\nelectronic instabilities of the Fe-doped 3C-BaTiO$_{3-\\delta}$ pseudocubic\npolymorph. Moreover, the distribution of iron dopants with frozen magnetic\nmoments is found to be non-uniform.

The recovery of the Bekenstein-Hawking law\nand corrections to it is explained in some detail. After this, due attention is\npaid to the discussion of semiclassical issues. An important point in this\nrespect is the proper interpretation of the horizon area as the energy that\nshould appear in the statistical-mechanical treatment of the black hole model\npresented here. The chapter ends with a comparison between the microscopic and\nsemiclassical approaches to the computation of the entropy and discusses a\nnumber of issues regarding the relation between entanglement and statistical\nentropy and the possibility of comparing the subdominant (logarithmic)\ncorrections to the entropy obtained with the help of the Euclidean path\nintegral with the ones obtained in the present framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 11:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

The solution here provided holds in the case of a single\nunknown input. The first part of the work presents this analytic solution. As\nfor the observability rank condition, the proposed analytic criterion is based\non the computation of the observable codistribution. Similarly to the case of\nonly known inputs, the observable codistribution is obtained by recursively\ncomputing the Lie derivatives of the outputs along the vector fields that\ncharacterize the dynamics. However, in correspondence of the unknown input, the\ncorresponding vector field must be suitably rescaled. Additionally, the Lie\nderivatives of the outputs must also be computed along a new set of vector\nfields that are obtained by recursively performing suitable Lie bracketing of\nthe vector fields that define the dynamics. In practice, the entire observable\ncodistribution is obtained by a very simple recursive algorithm. Finally, it is\nshown that the recursive algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and\nthe criterion to establish that the convergence has been reached is provided.\nThe proposed analytic extension of the observability rank condition is\nillustrated by checking the weak local observability of several nonlinear\nsystems driven by multiple known inputs and a single unknown input. For these\nsystems, extensive simulations are also provided. It is shown that, a simple\nestimator based on an Extended Kalman Filter, provides results that agree with\nour observability analysis.

This description is the so-called\nshape dynamics description of gravity. The existence of relational first\nprinciples from which the shape dynamics description of gravity can be derived\nis a motivation to consider shape dynamics (rather than GR) as the fundamental\ndescription of gravity. Adopting this point of view leads to the question: What\nis the role of spacetime in the shape dynamics description of gravity? This\nquestion contains many aspects: Compatibility of shape dynamics with the\ndescription of gravity in terms of spacetime geometry, the role of local\nMinkowski space, universality of spacetime geometry and the nature of quantum\nparticles, which can no longer be assumed to be irreducible representations of\nthe Poincare group. In this contribution I derive effective spacetime\nstructures by considering how matter fluctuations evolve along with shape\ndynamics. This evolution reveals an \"experienced spacetime geometry.\" This\nleads (in an idealized approximation) to local Minkowski space and causal\nrelations. The small scale structure of the emergent geometric picture depends\non the specific probes used to experience spacetime, which limits the\napplicability of effective spacetime to describe shape dynamics.

Akin to the Peierls transition in\none-dimensional systems, the coupling of the lattice to the electronic degrees\nof freedom can stabilize a spontaneous deformation of the crystal. This\ndeformation corresponds to a breathing mode, which breaks the inversion\nsymmetry. We find that for intermediate values of the staggered strain, the\ninversion-symmetry broken phase realizes a topological Weyl semimetal. In the\ntemperature-elasticity phase diagram, the Weyl semimetal shows a reentrant\nphase behavior: it can be reached from a symmetric phase realized both at\nhigher and at lower temperatures. The symmetric phase is a Dirac semimetal,\nwhich is protected by the non-symmorphic space group of the pyrochlore lattice.\nBeyond a critical value of the staggered strain, the symmetry-broken phase is a\nfully gapped trivial insulator. The surface states of the Weyl semimetal form\nopen Fermi arcs and we observe that their connectivity depends on the\ntermination of the crystal.

Functionals are higher order abstractions that are\nuseful for the management of such large arrays.

We demonstrate the use of a high pressure\ngas cell, combined with variable temperature cooling and time-resolved data\ncollection, to the in situ study of clathrate hydrates under conditions\nrelevant to solar system environments. Clathrates formed and processed within\nthe cell are monitored in situ using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and\nRaman spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction allows the formation of clathrate\nhydrates to be observed as CO2 gas is applied to ice formed within the cell.\nComplete conversion is obtained by annealing at temperatures just below the ice\nmelting point. A subsequent rise in the quantity of clathrate is observed as\nthe cell is thermally cycled. Four regions between 100-5000cm-1 are present in\nthe Raman spectra that carry features characteristic of both ice and clathrate\nformation. This novel experimental arrangement is well suited to studying\nclathrate hydrates over a range of temperature (80-500K) and pressure\n(1-100bar) conditions and can be used with a variety of different gases and\nstarting aqueous compositions. We propose the increase in clathrate formation\nobserved during thermal cycling may be due to the formation of a quasi\nliquid-like phase that forms at temperatures below the ice melting point, but\nwhich allows easier formation of new clathrate cages, or the retention and\ndelocalisation of previously formed clathrate structures, possibly as amorphous\nclathrate. The structural similarities between hexagonal ice, the quasi\nliquid-like phase, and crystalline CO2 hydrate mean that differences in the\nRaman spectrum are subtle; however, all features out to 5000cm-1 are diagnostic\nof clathrate structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 15:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

As for IRC botnets, general security\ninstances like firewalls and IDSes do not provide by themselves a viable\nsolution to prevent them completely. These devices could not differentiate well\nbetween the legitimate and malicious traffic of the IRC protocol. So, this\npaper is proposing an IDS-based and multi-phase IRC botnet and botnet behavior\ndetection model based on C&C responses messages and malicious behaviors of the\nIRC bots inside the network environment. The proposed model has been evaluated\non five network traffic traces from two different network environments (Virtual\nnetwork and DARPA 2000 Windows NT Attack Data Set). The results show that the\nproposed model could detect all the infected IRC botnet member(s), state their\ncurrent status of attack, filter their malicious IRC messages, pass the other\nnormal IRC messages and detect the botnet behavior regardless of the botnet\ncommunication protocol with very low false positive rate. The proposed model\nhas been compared with some of the existing and well-known approaches,\nincluding BotHunter, BotSniffer and Rishi regarding botnet characteristics\ntaken in each approach. The comparison showed that the proposed model has made\na progress on the comparative models by not to rely on a certain time window or\nspecific bot signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 11:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

Despite extensive studies, how to\ncharacterize the maximum sum rate of the simplest version of random access,\nAloha, remains an open question. In this paper, a comprehensive study of the\nsum rate performance of slotted Aloha networks is presented. By extending the\nunified analytical framework proposed in [20], [21] from the classical\ncollision model to the capture model, the network steady-state point in\nsaturated conditions is derived as a function of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold which determines a\nfundamental tradeoff between the information encoding rate and the network\nthroughput. To maximize the sum rate, both the SINR threshold and backoff\nparameters of nodes should be properly selected. Explicit expressions of the\nmaximum sum rate and the optimal setting are obtained, which show that similar\nto the sum capacity of the multiple access channel, the maximum sum rate of\nslotted Aloha also logarithmically increases with the mean received\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but the high-SNR slope is only $e^{-1}$. Effects\nof backoff and power control on the sum rate performance of slotted Aloha\nnetworks are further discussed, which shed important light on the practical\nnetwork design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 11:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 10:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 08:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-18"}

Interactions\nbetween the two surfaces of a fracture, due to e.g. presence of asperities,\nfluid, or proppant, are described via the Schoenberg's linear slip model. The\nproposed TS sensing platform is formulated in the frequency domain, and entails\npoint-wise interrogation of the subsurface volume by infinitesimal fissures\nendowed with interfacial stiffness. For completeness, the featured elastic\npolarization tensor - central to the TS formula - is mathematically described\nin terms of the shear and normal specific stiffness (ks,kn) of a vanishing\nfracture. Simulations demonstrate that, irrespective of the contact condition\nbetween the faces of a hidden fracture, the TS (used as a waveform imaging\ntool) is capable of reconstructing its geometry and identifying the normal\nvector to the fracture surface without iterations. On the basis of such\ngeometrical information, it is further shown via asymptotic analysis --\nassuming \"low frequency\" elastic-wave illumination, that by certain choices of\n(ks,kn) characterizing the trial (infinitesimal) fracture, the ratio between\nthe shear and normal specific stiffness along the surface of a nearly-panar\n(finite) fracture can be qualitatively identified. This, in turn, provides a\nvaluable insight into the interfacial condition of a fracture at virtually no\nsurcharge -- beyond the computational effort required for its imaging. The\nproposed developments are integrated into a computational platform based on a\nregularized boundary integral equation (BIE) method for 3D elastodynamics, and\nillustrated via a set of numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 23:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 19:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

There have been decades of debate on how those values\n-and legal obligations- can be embedded into systems, preferably from the very\nbeginning of the design process.\n  One important element in this endeavour are technical mechanisms, known as\nprivacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Their effectiveness has been\ndemonstrated by researchers and in pilot implementations.

Furthermore, for unfolding\ntheir full benefit for privacy and data protection, PETs need to be rooted in a\ndata governance strategy to be applied in practice.\n  This report contributes to bridging the gap between the legal framework and\nthe available technological implementation measures by providing an inventory\nof existing approaches, privacy design strategies, and technical building\nblocks of various degrees of maturity from research and development. Starting\nfrom the privacy principles of the legislation, important elements are\npresented as a first step towards a design process for privacy-friendly systems\nand services. The report sketches a method to map legal obligations to design\nstrategies, which allow the system designer to select appropriate techniques\nfor implementing the identified privacy requirements.

The ultimate prize will be\njoint observation of a compact binary merger in both gravitational and\nelectromagnetic channels. However, GW sky locations that are uncertain by\nhundreds of square degrees will pose a challenge. I describe a real-time\ndetection pipeline and a rapid Bayesian parameter estimation code that will\nmake it possible to search promptly for optical counterparts in Advanced LIGO.\nHaving analyzed a comprehensive population of simulated GW sources, we describe\nthe sky localization accuracy that the GW detector network will achieve as each\ndetector comes online and progresses toward design sensitivity. Next, in\npreparation for the optical search with the intermediate Palomar Transient\nFactory (iPTF), we have developed a unique capability to detect optical\nafterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst\nMonitor (GBM). Its comparable error regions offer a close parallel to the\nAdvanced LIGO problem, but Fermi's unique access to MeV-GeV photons and its\nnear all-sky coverage may allow us to look at optical afterglows in a\nrelatively unexplored part of the GRB parameter space. We present the discovery\nand broadband follow-up observations of eight GBM-iPTF afterglows. Two of the\nbursts are at low redshift, are sub-luminous with respect to \"standard\"\ncosmological bursts, and have spectroscopically confirmed broad-line type Ic\nsupernovae. These two bursts are possibly consistent with mildly relativistic\nshocks breaking out from the progenitor envelopes rather than the standard\nmechanism of internal shocks within an ultra-relativistic jet. On a technical\nlevel, the GBM-iPTF effort is a prototype for locating and observing optical\ncounterparts of GW events in Advanced LIGO with the Zwicky Transient Facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 22:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-16"}
