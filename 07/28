The question remains whether an actively\naccreting disk is warm enough to have gas-phase water up to 50 AU radius. No\ndetailed studies have yet been performed on the extent of snowlines in an\nembedded accreting disk (Stage 0). Quantify the location of gas-phase volatiles\nin embedded actively accreting disk system. Two-dimensional physical and\nradiative transfer models have been used to calculate the temperature structure\nof embedded protostellar systems. Gas and ice abundances of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and\nCO are calculated using the density-dependent thermal desorption formulation.\nThe midplane water snowline increases from 3 to 55 AU for accretion rates\nthrough the disk onto the star between $10^{-9}$-$10^{-4} \\ M_{\\odot} \\ {\\rm\nyr^{-1}}$. CO$_2$ can remain in the solid phase within the disk for $\\dot{M}\n\\leq 10^{-5} \\ M_{\\odot} \\ {\\rm yr^{-1}}$ down to $\\sim 20$ AU. Most of the CO\nis in the gas phase within an actively accreting disk independent of disk\nproperties and accretion rate. The predicted optically thin water isotopolog\nemission is consistent with the detected H$_2^{18}$O emission toward the Stage\n0 embedded young stellar objects, originating from both the disk and the warm\ninner envelope (hot core). An accreting embedded disk can only account for\nwater emission arising from $R < 50$ AU, however, and the extent rapidly\ndecreases for low accretion rates.

The Sun is an active source of radio emission that is often\nassociated with energetic phenomena ranging from nanoflares to coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). At low radio frequencies (<100 MHz), numerous millisecond\nduration radio bursts have been reported, such as radio spikes or solar S\nbursts (where S stands for short). To date, these have neither been studied\nextensively nor imaged because of the instrumental limitations of previous\nradio telescopes. Aims. Here, Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations were\nused to study the spectral and spatial characteristics of a multitude of S\nbursts, as well as their origin and possible emission mechanisms. Methods. We\nused 170 simultaneous tied-array beams for spectroscopy and imaging of S\nbursts. Since S bursts have short timescales and fine frequency structures,\nhigh cadence (~50 ms) tied-array images were used instead of standard\ninterferometric imaging, that is currently limited to one image per second.\nResults. On 9 July 2013, over 3000 S bursts were observed over a time period of\n~8 hours. S bursts were found to appear as groups of short-lived (<1 s) and\nnarrow-bandwidth (~2.5 MHz) features, the majority drifting at ~3.5 MHz/s and a\nwide range of circular polarisation degrees (2-8 times more polarised than the\naccompanying Type III bursts). Extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field\nusing the potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that S bursts\nare associated with a trans-equatorial loop system that connects an active\nregion in the southern hemisphere to a bipolar region of plage in the northern\nhemisphere. Conclusions. We have identified polarised, short-lived solar radio\nbursts that have never been imaged before. They are observed at a height and\nfrequency range where plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism,\nhowever they possess some of the characteristics of electron-cyclotron maser\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 17:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

Spin squeezed states as well as\nnumber states have been produced following methods based either on coherent\nevolution in the presence of a non-linearity in the atomic field [3--5], or on\nquantum non-demolition measurement [6--8]. Among methods of the first kind,\ncavity feedback [5, 9] is one of the most promising: it has already allowed for\nthe creation of highly squeezed states [5] and the effective non-linearity\nintroduced by the atom-cavity coupling can be easily switched off, making it\nvery attractive for metrol-ogy applications. In this Letter, we analyze the\nentangled states that can be produced by cavity feedback in different coupling\nregimes from weak to strong, and derive the ultimate limits of the metrology\ngain, extending the optimization of squeezing to unexplored domains of\nparameters values. After optimization of both the coupling strength and the\natom number, we find a maximum squeezing limit that depends only on the atomic\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 18:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

In this paper we provide a\nsolution to this problem by means of Huygens' metasurfaces (HMSs), based on the\nequivalence principle. This principle states that a given excitation can be\ntransformed to a desirable aperture field by inducing suitable electric and\nmagnetic surface currents. Building on this concept, we propose and demonstrate\ncavity-excited HMS antennas, where the single-source cavity excitation is\ndesigned to optimize aperture illumination, while the HMS facilitates the\ncurrent distribution that ensures phase purity of aperture fields. The HMS\nbreaks the coupling between the excitation and radiation spectrum typical to\nstandard partially-reflecting surfaces, allowing tailoring of the aperture\nproperties to produce a desirable radiation pattern. As shown, a single\nsemianalytical formalism can be followed to achieve control of a variety of\nradiation features, such as the direction of the main beam or the side lobe\nlevel, by proper modification of the HMS and the source position. Relying on a\ncavity excitation, this can be achieved without incurring edge-taper losses and\nwithout any degradation of the aperture illumination for arbitrarily-large\napertures. With the recent demonstrations of Huygens' metasurfaces at\nmicrowave, terahertz, and optical frequencies, the proposed low-profile design\nmay find its use in a myriad of applications across the electromagnetic\nspectrum, from highly-directive antennas to highly-efficient quantum-dot\nemitters, reaching near-unity aperture efficiencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 19:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In this work, we\nexplore the relationship between two special forms of these techniques: stacked\nDFs (namely Auto-context) and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet). Our\nmain contribution is to show that Auto-context can be mapped to a deep ConvNet\nwith novel architecture, and thereby trained end-to-end. This mapping can be\nused as an initialization of a deep ConvNet, enabling training even in the face\nof very limited amounts of training data. We also demonstrate an approximate\nmapping back from the refined ConvNet to a second stacked DF, with improved\nperformance over the original. We experimentally verify that these mappings\noutperform stacked DFs for two different applications in computer vision and\nbiology: Kinect-based body part labeling from depth images, and somite\nsegmentation in microscopy images of developing zebrafish. Finally, we revisit\nthe core mapping from a Decision Tree (DT) to a NN, and show that it is also\npossible to map a fuzzy DT, with sigmoidal split decisions, to a NN.

We propose a novel analysis approach for acoustic\nphonetic data, where the aim will be to statistically model the acoustic\nproperties of spoken words. We explore phonetic variation and change using a\ntime-frequency representation, namely the log-spectrograms of speech\nrecordings.

We build models for the mean and covariances\n(taking into account the restrictions placed on the statistical analysis of\nsuch objects) and use these to define a phonetic transformation that models how\nan individual speaker would sound in a different language, allowing the\nexploration of phonetic differences between languages. Finally, we map back\nthese transformations to the domain of sound recordings, allowing us to listen\nto the output of the statistical analysis.

It is equipped with a\ngeneral adapted metric $g$, which is slightly more general than the adapted\nmetrics of Nagase and Brasselet-Hector-Saralegi. In particular, $g$ has a\ngeneral type, which is an extension of the type of an adapted metric. A\nrestriction on this general type is assumed, and then $g$ is called good. We\nconsider the maximum/minimun ideal boundary condition, $d_{\\text{\\rm\nmax/min}}$, of the compactly supported de~Rham complex on $M$, in the sense of\nBr\\\"uning-Lesch. Let $H^*_{\\text{\\rm max/min}}(M)$ and $\\Delta_{\\text{\\rm\nmax/min}}$ denote the cohomology and Laplacian of $d_{\\text{\\rm max/min}}$. The\nfirst main theorem states that $\\Delta_{\\text{\\rm max/min}}$ has a discrete\nspectrum satisfying a weak form of the Weyl's asymptotic formula. The second\nmain theorem is a version of Morse inequalities using $H_{\\text{\\rm\nmax/min}}^*(M)$ and what we call rel-Morse functions. An ingredient of the\nproofs of both theorems is a version for $d_{\\text{\\rm max/min}}$ of the\nWitten's perturbation of the de~Rham complex. Another ingredient is certain\nperturbation of the Dunkl harmonic oscillator previously studied by the authors\nusing classical perturbation theory.

This class of loops has received little attention\nin the literature. A cluster of such loops was observed on the solar disk in\nactive region NOAA11934, in the Si IV 1402.8 \\AA\\ spectral raster and 1400 \\AA\\\nslit-jaw (SJ) images. We divide the loops into three groups and study their\ndynamics and interaction. The first group comprises relatively stable loops,\nwith 382--626\\,km cross-sections. Observed Doppler velocities are suggestive of\nsiphon flows, gradually changing from -10 km/s at one end to 20 km/s at the\nother end of the loops. Nonthermal velocities from 15 to 25 km/s were\ndetermined. These physical properties suggest that these loops are impulsively\nheated by magnetic reconnection occurring at the blue-shifted footpoints where\nmagnetic cancellation with a rate of $10^{15}$ Mx/s is found. The released\nmagnetic energy is redistributed by the siphon flows. The second group\ncorresponds to two footpoints rooted in mixed-magnetic-polarity regions, where\nmagnetic cancellation occurred at a rate of $10^{15}$ Mx/s and line profiles\nwith enhanced wings of up to 200 km/s were observed. These are suggestive of\nexplosive-like events. The Doppler velocities combined with the SJ images\nsuggest possible anti-parallel flows in finer loop strands. In the third group,\ninteraction between two cool loop systems is observed. Evidence for magnetic\nreconnection between the two loop systems is reflected in the line profiles of\nexplosive events, and a magnetic cancellation rate of $3\\times10^{15}$ Mx/s\nobserved in the corresponding area. The IRIS observations have thus opened a\nnew window of opportunity for in-depth investigations of cool transition region\nloops. Further numerical experiments are crucial for understanding their\nphysics and their role in the coronal heating processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 22:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

This is in conservative agreement with theoretical predictions from\nmodels of binary SMBH populations. Simulated data sets, assuming stochastic\nvariability, also produce no equivalent candidates implying a low likelihood of\nspurious detections. The periodicity seen is likely attributable to either jet\nprecession, warped accretion disks or periodic accretion associated with a\nclose SMBH binary system. We also consider how other SMBH binary candidates in\nthe literature appear in CRTS data and show that none of these are equivalent\nto the identified objects. Finally, the distribution of objects found is\nconsistent with that expected from a gravitational wave-driven population. This\nimplies that circumbinary gas is present at small orbital radii and is being\nperturbed by the black holes. None of the sources is expected to merge within\nat least the next century.

This characterization allows us to relax the coding\nconstraints to a polytope and to derive two LP decoding problems. These two\nproblems are respectively formulated by relaxing the maximum likelihood\ndecoding problem and the minimum Chebyshev distance decoding problem.\n  Because these codes are non-linear, we also study efficient encoding and\ndecoding algorithms. We first describe an algorithm that maps consecutive\nintegers, one by one, to an ordered list of multipermutations. Based on this\nalgorithm, we develop an encoding algorithm for a code proposed by Shieh and\nTsai, a code that falls into our class of LP-decodable multipermutation codes.\nRegarding decoding algorithms, we propose an efficient distributed decoding\nalgorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).\nFinally, we observe from simulation results that the soft decoding techniques\nwe introduce can significantly outperform hard decoding techniques that are\nbased on quantized channel outputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 03:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

A hallmark\nof these systems is topological protection, i.e. the existence of propagative\nedge states that cannot be scattered by imperfections or disorder in the\nsystem. A different and less explored form of robust transport arises in\nnon-Hermitian systems in the presence of an {\\it imaginary} gauge field. As\ncompared to topologically-protected transport in quantum Hall and topological\ninsulator systems, robust non-Hermitian transport can be observed in {\\it\nlower} dimensional (i.e. one dimensional) systems. In this work the transport\nproperties of one-dimensional tight-binding lattices with an imaginary gauge\nfield are theoretically investigated, and the physical mechanism underlying\nrobust one-way transport is highlighted. Back scattering is here forbidden\nbecause reflected waves are evanescent rather than propagative. Remarkably, the\nspectral transmission of the non-Hermitian lattice is shown to be mapped into\nthe one of the corresponding Hermitian lattice, i.e. without the gauge field,\n{\\it but} computed in the complex plane. In particular, at large values of the\ngauge field the spectral transmittance becomes equal to one, even in the\npresence of disorder or lattice imperfections. This phenomenon can be referred\nto as {\\it one-way non-Hermitian transparency}. Robust one-way transport can be\nalso realized in a more realistic setting, namely in heterostructure systems,\nin which a non-Hermitian disordered lattice is embedded between two homogeneous\nHermitian lattices. Such a double heterostructure realizes asymmetric\n(non-reciprocal) wave transmission. A physical implementation of non-Hermtian\ntransparency, based on light transport in a chain of optical microring\nresonators, is suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 05:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 05:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

In particular, for systems with\nnon-zero thermodynamic inertia, the assumption of local equilibrium leads to\nnegative values of the entropy production, which is in contradiction with the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. In this paper we address this question by\nsuggesting a variational formulation of irreversible evolution of a system with\nnon-zero thermodynamic inertia. We introduce the Lagrangian, which depends on\nthe properties of the normal and the so-called \"mirror-image\" systems. We show\nthat the standard evolution equations, in particular the\nMaxwell-Cattaneo-Vernotte equation, can be derived from the variational\nprocedure without going beyond the assumption of local equilibrium. We also\nargue, that the second law of thermodynamics should be understood as a\nconsequence of the variational procedure and the property of local equilibrium.\nFor systems with instantaneous response this leads to the standard requirement\nof the local instantaneous entropy production being always positive. However,\nif a system is characterized by delayed response, the formulation of the second\nlaw of thermodynamics should be altered. In particular, the quantity, which is\nalways positive, is not the instantaneous entropy production, but the entropy\nproduction averaged over the period of the heat wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 06:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

This idea has gained increasing\ninterest in the artificial intelligence (AI) community, where it is used as a\nmethod to control a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with\nunknown behaviours. The idea is to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying\na possible behaviour for the other agents, and to plan our own actions with\nrespect to those types which we believe are most likely, given the observed\nactions of the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily\nin the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many AI applications\nhave a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this perspective\nin mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions pertaining to belief\nand truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three basic ways to incorporate\nevidence into posterior beliefs and show when the resulting beliefs are\ncorrect, and when they may fail to be correct. Moreover, we demonstrate that\nprior beliefs can have a significant impact on our ability to maximise payoffs\nin the long-term, and that they can be computed automatically with consistent\nperformance effects. Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are\nable complete our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised\ntypes. Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be\nascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 08:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 14:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 18:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

The\nbiological meaning of this phenomenon, known as codon usage bias, is still\ncontroversial. In order to shed light on this point, we propose a new codon\nbias index, $CompAI$, that is based on the competition between cognate and\nnear-cognate tRNAs during translation, without being tuned to the usage bias of\nhighly expressed genes. We perform a genome-wide evaluation of codon bias for\n$E.coli$, comparing $CompAI$ with other widely used indices: $tAI$, $CAI$, and\n$Nc$. We show that $CompAI$ and $tAI$ capture similar information by being\npositively correlated with gene conservation, measured by ERI, and\nessentiality, whereas, $CAI$ and $Nc$ appear to be less sensitive to\nevolutionary-functional parameters. Notably, the rate of variation of $tAI$ and\n$CompAI$ with ERI allows to obtain sets of genes that consistently belong to\nspecific clusters of orthologous genes (COGs). We also investigate the\ncorrelation of codon bias at the genomic level with the network features of\nprotein-protein interactions in $E.coli$. We find that the most densely\nconnected communities of the network share a similar level of codon bias (as\nmeasured by $CompAI$ and $tAI$). Conversely, a small difference in codon bias\nbetween two genes is, statistically, a prerequisite for the corresponding\nproteins to interact. Importantly, among all codon bias indices, $CompAI$ turns\nout to have the most coherent distribution over the communities of the\ninteractome, pointing to the significance of competition among cognate and\nnear-cognate tRNAs for explaining codon usage adaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 09:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

Spatially damped\npropagating sausage waves were recently observed in the solar atmosphere. We\nexamine how wave leakage influences the spatial damping of sausage waves\npropagating along coronal structures modeled by a cylindrical density\nenhancement embedded in a uniform magnetic field. Working in the framework of\ncold magnetohydrodynamics, we solve the dispersion relation (DR) governing\nsausage waves for complex-valued longitudinal wavenumber $k$ at given real\nangular frequencies $\\omega$. For validation purposes, we also provide\nanalytical approximations to the DR in the low-frequency limit and in the\nvicinity of $\\omega_{\\rm c}$, the critical angular frequency separating trapped\nfrom leaky waves. In contrast to the standing case, propagating sausage waves\nare allowed for $\\omega$ much lower than $\\omega_{\\rm c}$. However, while able\nto direct their energy upwards, these low-frequency waves are subject to\nsubstantial spatial attenuation. The spatial damping length shows little\ndependence on the density contrast between the cylinder and its surroundings,\nand depends only weakly on frequency. This spatial damping length is of the\norder of the cylinder radius for $\\omega \\lesssim 1.5 v_{\\rm Ai}/a$, where $a$\nand $v_{\\rm Ai}$ are the cylinder radius and the Alfv\\'en speed in the\ncylinder, respectively. We conclude that if a coronal cylinder is perturbed by\nsymmetric boundary drivers (e.g., granular motions) with a broadband spectrum,\nwave leakage efficiently filters out the low-frequency components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 11:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

Some of these newly\nexpressed genes may acquire coding or non-coding functions and be preserved by\nnatural selection. However, it is yet unclear which is the prevalence and\nunderlying mechanisms of de novo gene emergence. In order to obtain a\ncomprehensive view of this process we have performed in-depth sequencing of the\ntranscriptomes of four mammalian species, human, chimpanzee, macaque and mouse,\nand subsequently compared the assembled transcripts and the corresponding\nsyntenic genomic regions. This has resulted in the identification of over five\nthousand new transcriptional multiexonic events in human and/or chimpanzee that\nare not observed in the rest of species. By comparative genomics we show that\nthe expression of these transcripts is associated with the gain of regulatory\nmotifs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and of U1 snRNP sites\ndownstream of the TSS. We also find that the coding potential of the new genes\nis higher than expected by chance, consistent with the presence of\nprotein-coding genes in the dataset. Using available human tissue proteomics\nand ribosome profiling data we identify several de novo genes with translation\nevidence. These genes show significant purifying selection signatures,\nindicating that they are probably functional. Taken together, the data supports\na model in which frequently-occurring new transcriptional events in the genome\nprovide the raw material for the evolution of new proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 12:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 12:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

The conserved quantity can restrict the number of\nnon-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid. It is\nconcluded that the number of non-degenerate equilibria in the gravitational\nfield of an asteroid varies in pairs and is an odd number. In addition, the\nconserved quantity can also restrict the kinds of bifurcations of relative\nequilibria in the gravitational potential of an asteroid when the parameter\nvaries.

Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves,\nwith solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years,\nthe theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid\nsystems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of\nreconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated\nthe field for ~50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent,\nbursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation\nand ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model\nreconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm\nis that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the\nLundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual\nshift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently\nunstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current\nsheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first\nplace. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent\nreconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper\nprovides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in\nreconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework.\nWe briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected\napplications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at\nthe frontier of this subject. Amongst these are the analytical and numerical\nextension of the plasmoid instability to (i) 3D and (ii) non-MHD regimes.

Our\nmain goal is to derive ages of thousands of field stars using consistent\nrotation period measurements in different gyrochronology relations. Multiple\nrotation periods are interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). We\nre-analyze the sample of 24,124 Kepler stars from Reinhold et al. (2013) using\ndifferent approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Each quarter\n(Q1-Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally,\nthe full time series, and different segments thereof are analyzed. For more\nthan 18,500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from\nMcQuillan et al. (2014). Thereof, more than 12,300 stars show multiple\nsignificant peaks, which we interpret as DR. Gyrochronology ages between 100\nMyr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17,000 stars using different\ngyrochronology relations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between\n3200-4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using\nphotometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079\nstars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may\nbe associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other\nhalf might be due to pulsations. The derived gyrochronology ages are well\nconstrained since more than 93.0 % of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun\nwhere calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age\ndistribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The\nexistence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than\nthree years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar\ncompanions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely\nstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 13:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Here, we consider non-selective evolution in the case of\ngrowing populations that are of small size and have varying trait compositions\n(e.g. after a population bottleneck). We find that, in these conditions,\npopulations never fixate to a trait, but tend to a random limit composition,\nand that the distribution of compositions 'freezes' to a steady state This\nfinal state is crucially influenced by the initial conditions. We obtain these\nfindings from a combined theoretical and experimental approach, using multiple\nmixed subpopulations of two Pseudomonas putida strains in non-selective growth\nconditions as model system. The experimental results for the population\ndynamics match the theoretical predictions based on the P\\'olya urn model for\nall analyzed parameter regimes. In summary, we show that exponential growth\nstops genetic drift. This result contrasts with previous theoretical analyses\nof non-selective evolution (e.g. genetic drift), which investigated how traits\nspread and eventually take over populations (fixate). Moreover, our work\nhighlights how deeply growth influences non-selective evolution, and how it\nplays a key role in maintaining genetic variability. Consequently, it is of\nparticular importance in life-cycles models of periodically shrinking and\nexpanding populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 14:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-04"}

First, we test the\nrobustness of the matter bispectrum measured from N-body simulations using\ndifferent initial conditions generators. We run a suite of N-body simulations\nusing the Zel'dovich approximation and second-order Lagrangian perturbation\ntheory (2LPT) at different starting redshifts, and find that transients from\ninitial decaying modes systematically reduce the nonlinearities in the matter\nbispectrum.

We then compare various analytical formulas and\nempirical fitting functions for modeling the nonlinear matter bispectrum, and\ndiscuss the regimes for which each is valid.

This is accompanied by making manifest a\nhidden local conformal invariance. Revealing this local symmetry comes at the\ncost of preferring a parameterisation of the null hyper surfaces. More\nprecisely, a preferred ruling of the null surfaces by their generators needs to\nbe chosen so that the theory whose gauge symmetries are enhanced by Weyl\ninvariance restricted to preserve the foliation, is equivalent to general\nrelativity.\n  I therefore find a dual theory that is locally equivalent to general\nrelativity but possessing enhanced local gauge symmetries: Weyl local scale\ninvariance and diffeomorphism invariance, both of which are restricted to\npreserve the two families of null surfaces. This theory is constructed\nemploying the so called symmetry trading algorithm, which shall be described in\ndetail in this essay. Alternatively, the theory can also be seen as a `phase'\nof a particular Scalar-Tensor theory, because it is equivalent to a particular\nclass of configurations of a scalar field conformally coupled to general\nrelativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 17:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

To overcome this problem, we take into account cosmological constant\nas a thermodynamical variable. By this modification, we show that the ensemble\ndependency is eliminated and thermal stability conditions are the same in both\nensembles.

As a result, the\nbasic Klein-Gordon-Fock equation of a free massive elementary particle was\nderived, which implies a duality between the quantum mechanics equation and a\nmicroscopic geodesic description in the frame of general relativity.\nConsequently, Heisenberg inequalities are determined explicitly by the\nspace-time curvatures.

In this paper we analyse the properties of ice streams\nthat form in a coupled model of ice flow and subglacial hydrology. We see that\nthere is a natural length scale defining ice stream separation and width. This\narises as a result of the balance between effective pressure gradients driving\nmeltwater away from ice streams and the enhanced water production in the\nstreams due to the fast ice flow. We further discuss how the model interacts\nwith topography and we show that small perturbations to a uniform bed have a\nstrong effect on where ice streams emerge in the model. However, in many cases\nice streams then evolve to be closer to the dimensions defined by the natural\nlength scale of the unperturbed system. The non-dimensional parameter that\ndefines this length scale is therefore of fundamental importance in the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 09:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}
