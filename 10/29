In the quantum limit they are protected edge modes that separate\ntopologically inequivalent ground states and can also occur when the particle\ndensity rather than the field is made nonuniform. We examine the correspondence\nof snake trajectories in single-layer graphene in the quantum limit for two\nfamilies of domain walls: (a) a uniform doped carrier density in an\nantisymmetric field profile and (b) antisymmetric carrier distribution in a\nuniform field. These families support different internal symmetries but the\nsame pattern of boundary and interface currents. We demonstrate that these\nphysically different situations are gauge equivalent when rewritten in a Nambu\ndoubled formulation of the two limiting problems. Using gauge transformations\nin particle-hole space to connect these problems, we map the protected\ninterfacial modes to the Bogoliubov quasiparticles of an interfacial\none-dimensional p-wave paired state. A variational model is introduced to\ninterpret the interfacial solutions of both domain wall problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 16:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

The nematic\norientational order parameters <P2(cos{\\theta})> and <P4(cos{\\theta})> in the\nnematic phases of CB7CB and its mixtures with less than 20 wt% CB6CB reveal\nthat they both increase with decreasing temperature in the N phase. Both order\nparameters decrease upon entering the Ntb phase and <P4(cos{\\theta})> becomes\nnegative providing a direct confirmation of the conical molecular orientational\ndistribution. The heliconical tilt angle, estimated from the orientational\ndistribution functions (ODFs), in all cases increases from zero at the N - Ntb\ntransition to approximately 27{\\deg} at about 40 K below the transition, in\nexcellent agreement with freeze fracture transmission electron microscopy\nresults of Chen and the birefringence results of Meyer. The growth of the tilt\nangle in the Ntb phase follows a single power law with exponents between ~0.09\n+/- 0.01 to -0.12 +/- 0.01, which is far from the expected tricritical or mean\nfield exponents of 0.25 or 0.5. The temperature dependence of the tilt angle\ncalculated from the ODFs also is in good qualitative agreement with the values\nestimated from optical studies of their ropelike textures within adjacent\nblocks of left- and right-handed twist in homogeneously aligned cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 16:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

Further, it would be nice if the measure can\nnon-parametrically and efficiently capture both linear and non-linear\ncorrelations.\n  In this paper, we propose UDS, a multivariate correlation measure that\nfulfills all of these desiderata. In short, we define \\uds based on cumulative\nentropy and propose a principled normalization scheme to bring its scores\nacross different subspaces to the same domain, enabling universal correlation\nassessment. UDS is purely non-parametric as we make no assumption on data\ndistributions nor types of correlation. To compute it on empirical data, we\nintroduce an efficient and non-parametric method. Extensive experiments show\nthat UDS outperforms state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 17:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

Moreover, mass transfer causes the system to enter a\ncommon envelope phase within several orbits. Since the central star of the\nRotten Egg nebula is an AGB star, we conclude that such a common envelope phase\nmust have lead to a merger, so the observed companion must have been a tertiary\ncompanion of a binary that merged at the time of nebula ejection. Based on the\nmass and timescale of the simulated disc formed around the companion before the\ncommon envelope phase, we analytically estimate the properties of jets that\ncould be launched. Allowing for super-Eddington accretion rates, we find that\njets similar to those observed are plausible, provided that the putative lost\ncompanion was relatively massive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 19:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The triple-K integrals diverge when the\ndimensions of operators satisfy certain relations and we discuss how to obtain\nrenormalised 3-point functions in all cases.

Ultralocal divergences may be\nremoved using local counterterms and this results in new conformal anomalies.\nSemilocal divergences may be removed by renormalising the sources, and this\nresults in CFT correlators that satisfy Callan-Symanzik equations with beta\nfunctions. In the case of non-local divergences, it is the triple-K\nrepresentation that is singular, not the 3-point function. Here, the CFT\ncorrelator is the coefficient of the leading nonlocal singularity, which\nsatisfies all the expected conformal Ward identities. Such correlators exhibit\nenhanced symmetry: they are also invariant under dual conformal transformations\nwhere the momenta play the role of coordinates.

During this instability, Jupiter and Saturn's orbits\ndiverge, crossing their 2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR), and this\nresonance-crossing can excite the terrestrial planet orbits. Using a large\nensemble of simulations of this giant planet instability, we directly model the\nevolution of the terrestrial planet orbits during this process, paying special\nattention to systems that reproduce the basic features of the outer planets. In\nsystems that retain four giant planets and finish with Jupiter and Saturn\nbeyond their 2:1 MMR, we find at least an 85% probability that at least one\nterrestrial planet is lost. Moreover, systems that manage to retain all four\nterrestrial planets often finish with terrestrial planet eccentricities and\ninclinations larger than the observed ones. There is less than a ~5% chance\nthat the terrestrial planet orbits will have a level of excitation comparable\nto the observed orbits. If we factor in the probability that the outer\nplanetary orbits are well-replicated, we find a probability of 1% or less that\nthe orbital architectures of the inner and outer planets are simultaneously\nreproduced in the same system. These small probabilities raise the prospect\nthat the giant planet instability occurred before the terrestrial planets had\nformed. This scenario implies that the giant planet instability is not the\nsource of the Late Heavy Bombardment and that terrestrial planet formation\nfinished with the giant planets in their modern configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 20:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

From RV observations a dearth of\ncompanions with masses between 10-40 MJup has been noticed at close\nseparations, suggesting the possibility of a distinct formation mechanism for\nobjects above and below this range. We present a model for the substellar\ncompanion mass function (CMF). It consists of the superposition of the planet\nand BD companion mass distributions, assuming that we can extrapolate the RV\nmeasured companion mass function for planets to larger separations and the\nstellar companion mass-ratio distribution over all separations into the BD mass\nregime. By using both the results of the VLT/NaCo large program and the\ncomplementary archive datasets that probe the occurrence of planets and BDs on\nwide orbits around solar-type stars, we place some constraints on the planet\nand BD distributions. We developed a MC simulation tool to predict the outcome\nof a given survey, depending on the shape of the orbital parameter\ndistributions. Comparing the predictions with the results of the observations,\nwe calculate how likely different models are and which can be ruled out.\nCurrent observations are consistent with the proposed model for the CMF, as\nlong as a sufficiently small outer truncation radius is introduced for the\nplanet separation distribution. The results of the direct imaging surveys\nsearching for substellar companions around Sun-like stars are consistent with a\ncombined substellar mass spectrum of planets and BDs. This mass distribution\nhas a minimum between 10 and 50 MJup, in agreement with RV measurements. The\ndearth of objects in this mass range would naturally arise from the shape of\nthe mass distribution, without the introduction of any distinct formation\nmechanism for BDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 20:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

Here we study the emission from tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion\npropagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar\ndebris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation,\nand present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak\nbrightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a non local thermodynamic\nequilibrium treatment of the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen,\nhelium and oxygen (as a representative metal). Our calculations show how an\nextended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft x-rays and produce the\nobserved optical fluxes of order 10^43 ergs per second. Variations in the mass\nor size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time\nwith roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, x-rays can\nhighly ionize the reprocessing region and escape to be observed simultaneously\nwith the optical flux, producing an SED not described by a single blackbody.\nDue to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly\nsuppressed relative to helium line emission (with HeII-to-H line ratios of at\nleast 5:1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star.

While plausible for\ndecades, this model has only begun to be tested with statistical rigor in the\npast few years. Here we report on a Hubble Space Telescope study to test this\nhypothesis for $z=2$ quasars with high super-massive black hole masses\n($M_\\mathrm{BH}=10^9-10^{10}~M_\\odot{}$), which dominate cosmic black hole\ngrowth at this redshift. We compare Wide Field Camera 3 $F160W$ (rest-frame\n$V$-band) imaging of 19 point source-subtracted quasar hosts to a matched\nsample of 84 inactive galaxies, testing whether the quasar hosts have greater\nevidence for strong gravitational interactions. Using an expert ranking\nprocedure, we find that the quasar hosts are uniformly distributed within the\nmerger sequence of inactive galaxies, with no preference for quasars in\nhigh-distortion hosts. Using a merger/non-merger cutoff approach, we recover\ndistortion fractions of $f_\\mathrm{m,qso}=0.39\\pm{}0.11$ for quasar hosts and\n$f_\\mathrm{m,gal}=0.30\\pm{}0.05$ for inactive galaxies (distribution modes, 68%\nconfidence intervals), with both measurements subjected to the same\nobservational conditions and limitations. The slight enhancement in distorted\nfraction for quasar hosts over inactive galaxies is not significant, with a\nprobability that the quasar fraction is higher of\n$P(f_\\mathrm{m,qso}>f_\\mathrm{m,gal}) = 0.78$ ($0.78\\,\\sigma{}$), in line with\nresults for lower mass and lower $z$ AGN.

In contrast, in offset AGN the active BH is\ntypically more massive than its non-active counterpart. Furthermore, dual AGN\nin general accrete more gas from the intergalactic medium than offset AGN and\nnon-active BH pairs.

Here we investigate whether this mechanism can be inferred from\nobservations of young clusters. To address this question, we have computed SPH\nsimulations of the initial formation and evolution of a dynamically young star\ncluster through cold (sub-virial) collapse, starting with an ellipsoidal,\nturbulently seeded distribution of gas, and forming sink particles representing\n(proto)stars. While the initial density distributions of the clouds do not have\nlarge initial mass concentrations, gravitational focusing due to the global\nmorphology leads to cluster formation. We use the resulting structures to\nextract observable morphological and kinematic signatures for the case of\nsub-virial collapse. We find that the signatures of the initial conditions can\nbe erased rapidly as the gas and stars collapse, suggesting that kinematic\nobservations need to be made either early in cluster formation and/or at larger\nscales, away from the growing cluster core. Our results emphasize that a\ndynamically young system is inherently evolving on short timescales, so that it\ncan be highly misleading to use current-epoch conditions to study aspects such\nas star formation rates as a function of local density.

Many-fermion systems bound by hard walls display\nnon-trivial density profiles characterized by so-called Friedel oscillations\n(which are similar to those observed in harmonic traps). In non-interacting\nsystems, the characteristic length scale of the oscillations is set by (2\nkF)^(-1), where kF is the Fermi momentum, while repulsive interactions tend to\ngenerate Wigner-crystal oscillations of period (4 kF)^(-1). Based on the\nnon-interacting result, we find a remarkably simple parametrization of the\ndensity profiles of the attractively interacting case, which we generalize to\nthe one-body density matrix.

We propose a\nsymbolic framework for capturing symmetry patterns in parameterised systems\n(i.e. an infinite family of finite-state systems): two regular word transducers\nto represent, respectively, parameterised systems and symmetry patterns. The\nframework subsumes various types of symmetry relations ranging from weaker\nnotions (e.g. simulation preorders) to the strongest notion (i.e.\nisomorphisms). Our framework enjoys two algorithmic properties: (1) symmetry\nverification: given a transducer, we can automatically check whether it is a\nsymmetry pattern of a given system, and (2) symmetry synthesis: we can\nautomatically generate a symmetry pattern for a given system in the form of a\ntransducer. Furthermore, our symbolic language allows additional constraints\nthat the symmetry patterns need to satisfy to be easily incorporated in the\nverification/synthesis. We show how these properties can help identify symmetry\npatterns in examples like dining philosopher protocols, self-stabilising\nprotocols, and prioritised resource-allocator protocol.

However,\nreceivers are often heterogeneous, with widely varying receive rates.

Therefore, it\nis of great importance to find a more homogeneous effect measure that allows\nfor transportability of research results. For a binary outcome, applied\nresearchers often claim that the risk difference is more heterogeneous than the\nrisk ratio or odds ratio, because they find, based on evidence from surveys of\nmeta-analyses, that the null hypotheses of homogeneity are rejected more often\nfor the risk difference than for the risk ratio and odds ratio. However, the\nevidence for these claims are far from satisfactory, because of different\nstatistical powers of the homogeneity tests under different effect scales. For\nbinary treatment, covariate and outcome, we theoretically quantify the\nhomogeneity of different effect scales. Because when homogeneity holds the four\noutcome probabilities lie in a three dimensional sub-space of the four\ndimensional space, we can use results from differential geometry to compute the\nvolumes of these three dimensional spaces to compare the relative homogeneity\nof the risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio. We demonstrate that the\nhomogeneity space for the risk difference has the smallest volume, and the\nhomogeneity space for the odds ratio has the largest volume, providing some\nfurther evidence for the previous claim that the risk difference is more\nheterogeneous than the risk ratio and odds ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 01:19:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 20:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

In\nan effort to understand the connection between the morphology of SNRs and the\nGalactic magnetic field (GMF), we have examined the radio images of all known\nSNRs in our Galaxy and compiled a large sample that have an \"axisymmetric\"\nmorphology, which we define to mean SNRs with a \"bilateral\" or \"barrel\"-shaped\nmorphology, in addition to one-sided shells. We selected the cleanest examples\nand model each of these at their appropriate Galactic position using two GMF\nmodels, those of Jansson & Farrar (2012a), which includes a vertical halo\ncomponent, and Sun et al. (2008) that is oriented entirely parallel to the\nplane. Since the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetic field\nchanges with distance from the sun, we analyse a range of distances, from 0.5\nto 10 kpc in each case. Using a physically motivated model of a SNR expanding\ninto the ambient GMF, we find the models using Jansson & Farrar (2012a) are\nable to reproduce observed morphologies of many SNRs in our sample. These\nresults strongly support the presence of an off-plane, vertical component to\nthe GMF, and the importance of the Galactic field on SNR morphology. Our\napproach also provides a potential new method for determining distances to\nSNRs, or conversely, distances to features in the large-scale GMF if SNR\ndistances are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 01:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

In this paper, we study the single-field attractor behavior that\nthese models exhibit during inflation and quantify its strength and parameter\ndependence. We further demonstrate that the strong single-field attractor\nbehavior persists after the end of inflation. Preheating in such models\ntherefore generically avoids the \"de-phasing\" that typically affects multifield\nmodels with minimally coupled fields, allowing efficient transfer of energy\nfrom the oscillating inflaton condensate(s) to coupled perturbations across\nlarge portions of parameter space. We develop a doubly-covariant formalism for\nstudying the preheating phase in such models and identify several features\nspecific to multifield models with nonminimal couplings, including effects that\narise from the nontrivial field-space manifold. In papers II and III, we apply\nthis formalism to study how the amplification of adiabatic and isocurvature\nperturbations varies with parameters, highlighting several distinct regimes\ndepending on the magnitude of the nonminimal couplings $\\xi_I$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 03:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:48:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 17:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

It is a first-order method that processes the functions one at a time\nbased on their gradient information. The incremental Newton method, on the\nother hand, is a second-order variant which exploits additionally the curvature\ninformation of the underlying functions and can therefore be faster. In this\npaper, we focus on the case when the objective function is strongly convex and\npresent fast convergence results for the incremental gradient and incremental\nNewton methods under the constant and diminishing stepsizes.

This effect is\ninvestigated in this work on the basis of numerical gas-grain chemical\nmodeling. Major features of the grain motion effect in the typical environment\nof dark clouds (DC) can be summarised as follows: 1) decrease of gas-phase\n(both neutral and ionic) abundances and increase of surface abundances by up to\n2-3 orders of magnitude; 2) shifts of the existing chemical jumps to earlier\nevolution ages for gas-phase species and to later ages for surface species by\nfactors of about ten; 3) a few exceptional cases in which some species turn out\nto be insensitive to this effect and some other species can show opposite\nbehaviors too. These effects usually begin to emerge from a typical DC model\nage of about 10^5 yr. The grain motion in a typical cold neutral medium (CNM)\ncan help overcome the Coulomb repulsive barrier to enable effective accretion\nof cations onto positively charged grains. As a result, the grain motion\ngreatly enhances the abundances of some gas-phase and surface species by\nfactors up to 2-6 or more orders of magnitude in the CNM model. The grain\nmotion effect in a typical molecular cloud (MC) is intermediate between that of\nthe DC and CNM models, but with weaker strength.

In this thesis I\ntackle the question of suitable observables focusing on the effective dimension\nof discrete quantum geometries. For this purpose I give a purely combinatorial\ndescription of the discrete structures which these geometries have support on.\nAs a side topic, this allows to present an extension of group field theory to\ncover the combinatorially larger kinematical state space of loop quantum\ngravity. Moreover, I introduce a discrete calculus for fields on such\nfundamentally discrete geometries with a particular focus on the Laplacian.\nThis permits to define the effective-dimension observables for quantum\ngeometries. Analysing various classes of quantum geometries, I find as a\ngeneral result that the spectral dimension is more sensitive to the underlying\ncombinatorial structure than to the details of the additional geometric data\nthereon. Semiclassical states in loop quantum gravity approximate the classical\ngeometries they are peaking on rather well and there are no indications for\nstronger quantum effects. On the other hand, in the context of a more general\nmodel of states which are superposition over a large number of complexes, based\non analytic solutions, there is a flow of the spectral dimension from the\ntopological dimension $d$ on low energy scales to a real number $0<\\alpha<d$ on\nhigh energy scales.

The\nmagnetotransport reveals a considerably larger overlap of the conduction and\nvalence subbands than in known HgTe single quantum wells (QW), which may be\nregulated by an applied gate voltage $V_g$. This large overlap manifests itself\nin a much higher critical field $B_c$ separating the range above it where the\nquantum peculiarities shift linearly with $V_g$ and the range below with a\ncomplicated behavior. In the latter case the $N$-shaped and double-$N$-shaped\nstructures in the Hall magnetoresistance $\\rho_{xy}(B)$ are observed with their\nscale in field pronouncedly enlarged as compared to the pictures observed in an\nanalogous single QW.

A peculiar feature here is that the found\nelectron density $n$ remains almost constant in the whole range of investigated\n$V_g$ while the hole density $p$ drops down from the value a factor of 6 larger\nthan $n$ at extreme negative $V_g$ to almost zero at extreme positive $V_g$\npassing through the charge neutrality point.

The current\nQKD implementation with the highest long-distance secret-key rate meets this\nchallenge by transmitting no more than one photon per bit [Opt. Express 21,\n24550-24565 (2013)]. As a result, it cannot achieve the Gbps secret-key rate\nneeded for one-time pad encryption of large data files unless an impractically\nlarge amount of multiplexing is employed. We introduce floodlight QKD (FL-QKD),\nwhich floods the quantum channel with a high number of photons per bit\ndistributed over a much greater number of optical modes. FL-QKD offers security\nagainst the optimum frequency-domain collective attack by transmitting less\nthan one photon per mode and using photon-coincidence channel monitoring, and\nit is completely immune to passive eavesdropping.

Going in this direction, this paper introduces a\ncomputational model for simulating the interesting phenomena observed in\nnon-Newtonian shear thickening fluids, which are fluids where the viscosity\nincreases with increased stress. These fluids have unique and unconventional\nbehavior, and they often appear in real world scenarios such as when sinking in\nquicksand or when experimenting with popular cornstarch and water mixtures.\nWhile interesting behavior of shear thickening fluids can be easily observed in\nthe real world, the most interesting phenomena of these fluids have not been\nsimulated before in computer graphics. The fluid exhibits unique phase changes\nbetween solid and liquid states, great impact resistance in its solid state and\nstrong hysteresis effects. Our proposed approach builds on existing\nnon-Newtonian fluid models in computer graphics and introduces an efficient\nhistory-based stiffness term that is essential to produce the most interesting\nshear thickening phenomena. The history-based stiffness is formulated through\nthe use of fractional derivatives, leveraging the fractional calculus ability\nto depict both the viscoelastic behavior and the history effects of\nhistory-dependent systems. Simulations produced by our method are compared\nagainst real experiments and the results demonstrate that the proposed model\nsuccessfully captures key phenomena observed in shear thickening fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 23:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}
