The\nformer is a recently proposed paradigm that explains the diverse statistical\nproperties of blazars adopting minimal assumptions on blazars' physical and\ngeometrical properties. This view, tested through detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations, reproduces the main features of radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray blazar\nsurveys and also the extragalactic gamma-ray background at energies > 10 GeV.\nHere we add a hadronic component for neutrino production and estimate the\nneutrino emission from BL Lacs as a class, \"calibrated\" by fitting the spectral\nenergy distributions of a preselected sample of BL Lac objects and their\n(putative) neutrino spectra. Unlike all previous papers on this topic, the\nneutrino background is then derived by summing up at a given energy the fluxes\nof each BL Lac in the simulation, all characterised by their own redshift,\nsynchrotron peak energy, gamma-ray flux, etc. Our main result is that BL Lacs\nas a class can explain the neutrino background seen by IceCube above ~ 0.5 PeV\nwhile they only contribute ~ 10% at lower energies, leaving room to some other\npopulation(s)/physical mechanism. However, one cannot also exclude the\npossibility that individual BL Lacs still make a contribution at the ~ 20%\nlevel to the IceCube low-energy events.

Obtained solutions are singular solitons\npropagating with speed of light and having energy, momentum, and angular\nmomentum which can be calculated for explicit conditions. Such solitons will be\ncalled the lightlike ones. The soliton singularity has a form of moving\ntwo-dimensional surface or shell. The lightlike soliton can have a set of\ntubelike singular shells with the appropriate cavities. A twisted lightlike\nsoliton is considered. It is notable that its energy is proportional to its\nangular momentum in high-frequency approximation. A case with one tubelike\ncavity is considered. In this case the soliton shell is diffeomorphic to a\ncylindrical surface with threads by multifilar helix. The shell transverse size\nof the appropriate finite energy soliton can be converging to zero at infinity.\nThe ideal gas of such lightlike solitons with minimal twist parameter is\nconsidered in a finite volume.

Common is the (often\nillegitimate) approximation of the dynamical Love numbers with their static\ncounterparts. As the static Love numbers are, approximately, proportional to\nthe inverse rigidity, this renders a popular fallacy that the tidal evolution\nrate is determined by the product of the rigidity by the quality factor:\n$\\,k_l/Q\\propto 1/(\\mu Q)\\,$. In reality, the dynamical Love numbers depend on\nthe tidal frequency and all rheological parameters of the tidally perturbed\nbody (not just rigidity). We demonstrate that in asteroidal binaries the\nrigidity of their components plays virtually no role in tidal friction and\ntidal lagging, and thereby has almost no influence on the intensity of tidal\ninteractions (tidal torques, tidal dissipation, tidally induced changes of the\norbit). A key quantity that determines the tidal evolution is a product of the\neffective viscosity $\\,\\eta\\,$ by the tidal frequency $\\,\\chi\\,$. The\nfunctional form of the torque's dependence on this product depends on who wins\nin the competition between viscosity and self-gravitation. Hence a quantitative\ncriterion, to distinguish between two regimes. For higher values of\n$\\,\\eta\\chi\\,$ we get $\\,k_l/Q\\propto 1/(\\eta\\chi)\\;$; $\\,$while for lower\nvalues we obtain $\\,k_l/Q\\propto \\eta\\chi\\,$. Our study rests on an assumption\nthat asteroids can be treated as Maxwell bodies. Applicable to rigid rocks at\nlow frequencies, this approximation is used here also for rubble piles, due to\nthe lack of a better model. In the future, as we learn more about mechanics of\ngranular mixtures in a weak gravity field, we may have to amend the tidal\ntheory with other rheological parameters, ones that do not show up in the\ndescription of viscoelastic bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 17:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 00:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 18:56:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 23:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

We report measurements of\nthe DC magnetic susceptibility of three different types of nonmagnetic\nmaterials at room temperature: (I) solutions of paramagnetic salts and\ndiamagnetic liquids, (II) liquid gallium-indium alloys and (III) pressed powder\nmixtures of tungsten and bismuth.

Subtraction of the lensing B-modes,\nusually referred to as delensing, will be required for further improvement of\ndetection sensitivity of the gravitational waves. In such experiments,\nknowledge of statistical properties of the B-modes after delensing is\nindispensable to likelihood analysis particularly because the lensing B-modes\nare known to be non-Gaussian.

Assuming an experiment in which the quadratic delensing is an almost\noptimal method, we find that delensing reduces correlations of the lensing\nB-mode power spectra between different multipoles, and that the PDF of the\npower spectrum amplitude is well described as a normal distribution function\nwith a variance larger than that in the case of a Gaussian field.

There are two main technical\nchallenges. First, to get significant acceleration, the sail must be both\nextremely light weight and capable of operating at high intensities of the\nincident beam and the resulting high temperatures. Second, the transmitter must\nemit high power beams through huge apertures, many kilometers in diameter, in\norder to focus radiation on the sail across the long distances needed to\nachieve high final speeds. Existing proposals for the sail use carbon or\naluminum films, but aluminum is limited by a low melting point, and both have\nlow mechanical strength requiring either a distributed payload or complex\nrigging. We propose here a graphene sail, which offers high absorption per unit\nweight, high temperature operation, and the mechanical strength to support\nsimple rigging to a lumped mass payload. For the transmitter, existing\nproposals use a compact high power source, and focus the energy with a large\n(hundreds to thousands of km) space-based lens.

Instead we\npropose an active Fresnel lens, allowing smaller apertures of less mass, easier\npointing with fewer restrictions, and probe launch from the inner solar system.\nThe technologies for both the sail and the transmitter are already under\ndevelopment for other reasons. Worked examples, physically smaller and less\nmassive than those suggested so far, range from a 1kg payload launched to 10\\%\nof the speed of light by a transmitter only 25 times the mass of ISS, to a\nlarger system that can launch a 1000 kg payload to 50\\% of the speed of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 19:52:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 18:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}

Examples include small nematodes\nmoving through soil using whole-body undulations or spermatozoa swimming\nthrough mucus using flagellar waves. When self-propulsion occurs in a\nnon-Newtonian fluid, one fundamental question is whether locomotion will occur\nfaster or slower than in a Newtonian environment. Here we consider the general\nproblem of swimming using small-amplitude periodic waves in a viscoelastic\nfluid described by the classical Oldroyd-B constitutive relationship. Using\nTaylor's swimming sheet model, we show that if all travelling waves move in the\nsame direction, the locomotion speed of the organism is systematically\ndecreased. However, if we allow waves to travel in two opposite directions, we\nshow that this can lead to enhancement of the swimming speed, which is\nphysically interpreted as due to asymmetric viscoelastic damping of waves with\ndifferent frequencies. A change of the swimming direction is also possible. By\nanalysing in detail the cases of swimming using two or three travelling waves,\nwe demonstrate that swimming can be enhanced in a viscoelastic fluid for all\nDeborah numbers below a critical value or, for three waves or more, only for a\nfinite, non-zero range of Deborah numbers, in which case a finite amount of\nelasticity in the fluid is required to increase the swimming speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 20:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

To help identify other systems that can give rise to such\nphases we present in this work a detailed study of the effect of interactions\non Majorana zero modes bound to vortices in a superconducting surface of a 3D\ntopological insulator. This system is of interest because, as was recently\npointed out, it can be tuned into the regime of strong interactions.

As\nfitness landscapes are high-dimensional, their characterization relies on\nsimple measures of their structure, which can be used as statistics in\nempirical applications. Here we propose two new sets of measures that\nexplicitly capture two relevant features of fitness landscapes: epistasis and\nconstraints. The first set contains new measures for epistasis based on the\ncorrelation of fitness effects of mutations. They have a natural\ninterpretation, capture well the interaction between mutations, can be obtained\nanalytically for most landscape models and can therefore be used to\ndiscriminate between different models. The second set contains measures of\nevolutionary constraints based on \"chains\" of forced mutations along\nfitness-increasing paths. Some of these measures are non-monotonic in the\namount of epistatic interactions, but have instead a maximum for intermediate\nvalues. We further characterize the relationships of these measures to the ones\nthat were previous proposed (e.g. number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of\nnon-additive components, etc).

Furthermore, in finite dimensions we remove the surectivity assumption. A\nvariety of tools is used in order to achieve our goal, such as topological,\ngeometrical and linear algebra techniques. The famous two projections theorem\nfor two finite rank projections will be re-proven using linear algebraic\nmethods. A theorem of Gy\\\"ory and the second author on orthogonality preservers\non Grassmann spaces will be strengthened as well. This latter result will be\nobtained by using Chow's fundamental theorem of geometry of Grassmannians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 21:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 09:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

In this paper, we propose a new approach to\nreduce the computational burden of CV-based performance estimation. As opposed\nto all previous attempts, which are specific to a particular learning model or\nproblem domain, we propose a general method applicable to a large class of\nincremental learning algorithms, which are uniquely fitted to big data\nproblems. In particular, our method applies to a wide range of supervised and\nunsupervised learning tasks with different performance criteria, as long as the\nbase learning algorithm is incremental. We show that the running time of the\nalgorithm scales logarithmically, rather than linearly, in the number of CV\nfolds. Furthermore, the algorithm has favorable properties for parallel and\ndistributed implementation. Experiments with state-of-the-art incremental\nlearning algorithms confirm the practicality of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 23:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

A task is specified by an input/output relation, defining for each\nset of processes that may run concurrently, and each assignment of inputs to\nthe processes in the set, the valid outputs of the processes. An object is\nspecified by an automaton describing the outputs the object may produce when it\nis accessed sequentially. Thus, tasks explicitly state what may happen only\nwhen sets of processes run concurrently, while objects only specify what\nhappens when processes access the object sequentially.

By taking advantage of the\nconformal invariance of the model, a numerical method is introduced that tracks\nthe evolution of the object boundary in terms of a time-dependent Laurent\nseries. Simulations of a variety of dissolving objects are shown, which shrink\nand then collapse to a single point in finite time. The simulations reveal a\nsurprising exact relationship whereby the collapse point is the root of a\nnon-analytic function given in terms of the flow velocity and the Laurent\nseries coefficients describing the initial shape. This result is subsequently\nderived using residue calculus. The structure of the non-analytic function is\nexamined for three different test cases, and a practical approach to determine\nthe collapse point using a generalized Newton--Raphson root-finding algorithm\nis outlined. These examples also illustrate the possibility that the model\nbreaks down in finite time prior to complete collapse, due to a topological\nsingularity, as the dissolving boundary overlaps itself rather than breaking up\ninto multiple domains (analogous to droplet pinch-off in fluid mechanics). In\nsummary, the model raises fundamental mathematical questions about broken\nsymmetries in finite-time singularities of both continuous and stochastic\ndynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 01:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Detection and extraction of astrophysical information\nfrom gravitational-wave signals requires accurate waveform models. The\nEffective-One-Body and other phenomenological models interpolate between\nanalytic results and $10-30$ orbit numerical relativity (NR) merger\nsimulations. In this paper we study the accuracy of these models using new NR\nsimulations that span $36-88$ orbits, with mass-ratios and black hole spins\n$(q,\\chi_{BH}) = (7, \\pm 0.4), (7, \\pm 0.6)$, and $(5, -0.9)$. We find that:\n(i) the recently published SEOBNRv1 and SEOBNRv2 models of the\nEffective-One-Body family disagree with each other (mismatches of a few\npercent) for black hole spins $\\geq 0.5$ or $\\leq -0.3$, with waveform mismatch\naccumulating during early inspiral; (ii) comparison with numerical waveforms\nindicate that this disagreement is due to phasing errors of SEOBNRv1, with\nSEOBNRv2 in good agreement with all of our simulations; (iii) Phenomenological\nwaveforms disagree with SEOBNRv2 over most of the NSBH binary parameter space;\n(iv) comparison with NR waveforms shows that most of the model's dephasing\naccumulates near the frequency interval where it switches to a phenomenological\nphasing prescription; and finally (v) both SEOBNR and post-Newtonian (PN)\nmodels are effectual for NSBH systems, but PN waveforms will give a significant\nbias in parameter recovery. Our results suggest that future gravitational-wave\ndetection searches and parameter estimation efforts targeted at NSBH systems\nwith $q\\lesssim 7$ and $\\chi_\\mathrm{BH} \\approx [-0.9, +0.6]$ will benefit\nfrom using SEOBNRv2 templates. For larger black hole spins and/or binary\nmass-ratios, we recommend the models be further investigated as suitable NR\nsimulations become available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 05:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The\naggregated terrain type is formulated by the similar ground objects aggregated\ntogether. In this paper, a polarimetric hierarchical semantic model (PHSM) is\nfirstly proposed to overcome this disadvantage based on the constructions of a\nprimal-level and a middle-level semantic. The primal-level semantic is a\npolarimetric sketch map which consists of sketch segments as the sparse\nrepresentation of a PolSAR image. The middle-level semantic is a region map\nwhich can extract semantic homogenous regions from the sketch map by exploiting\nthe topological structure of sketch segments. Mapping the region map to the\nPolSAR image, a complex PolSAR scene is partitioned into aggregated, structural\nand homogenous pixel-level subspaces with the characteristics of relatively\ncoherent terrain types in each subspace. Then, according to the characteristics\nof three subspaces above, three specific methods are adopted, and furthermore\npolarimetric information is exploited to improve the segmentation result.\nExperimental results on PolSAR data sets with different bands and sensors\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art\nmethods in region homogeneity and edge preservation for terrain classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 05:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

Depending on the strength of the interactions, it is found\nthat the pairing symmetry prefers an extended $s$-wave for small $J_H$ and high\nconduction electron density but a chiral $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$-wave for large\n$J_H$ and low conduction electron density, which provides a phase diagram of\npairing symmetry from the calculations of the ground-state energy.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies\nover several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and\nrotation. During their Pre-Main-Sequence, all low-mass stars have an increase\nof the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation for a fixed angular velocity in\ntheir convective envelope until they reach a critical aspect and mass ratios.\nNext, the dissipation evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that\nbecomes maximum for $0.6M_{\\odot}$ K-type stars and that decreases by several\norders of magnitude with increasing stellar mass. Finally, the rotational\nevolution of low-mass stars strengthens the importance of tidal dissipation\nduring the Pre-Main-Sequence for star-planet and multiple star systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 09:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Using our own photometric observations as well as archival data, we\nlook for variations in orbital periods of seven massive eclipsing binary\nsystems in the Cygnus OB2 association and estimate their mass-loss rates and\nstellar parameters.\n  Methods. We use a Bayesian parameter estimation method to simultaneously fit\nthe period and period change to all available data and a stellar modelling tool\nto model the binary parameters from photometric and radial-velocity data.\n  Results. Four out of the seven selected binaries show non-zero period change\nvalues at two-sigma confidence level. We also report for the first time the\neclipsing nature of a star MT059.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 10:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

It can be considered a Bayesian version of machine learning tree\nensemble methods where the individual trees are the base learners. However for\ndata sets where the number of variables $p$ is large (e.g. $p>5,000$) the\nalgorithm can become prohibitively expensive, computationally.\n  Another method which is popular for high dimensional data is random forests,\na machine learning algorithm which grows trees using a greedy search for the\nbest split points. However, as it is not a statistical model, it cannot produce\nprobabilistic estimates or predictions.\n  We propose an alternative algorithm for BART called BART-BMA, which uses\nBayesian Model Averaging and a greedy search algorithm to produce a model which\nis much more efficient than BART for datasets with large $p$. BART-BMA\nincorporates elements of both BART and random forests to offer a model-based\nalgorithm which can deal with high-dimensional data.\n  We have found that BART-BMA can be run in a reasonable time on a standard\nlaptop for the \"small $n$ large $p$\" scenario which is common in many areas of\nbioinformatics.

Their\nexciting clusters are identified and their photometric distances estimated to\nbe 2.6 kpc and 1.75 kpc, respectively. We suggest that these regions formed in\ndense and flat structures that contain filaments. They have a central ionized\nregion and ionized lobes perpendicular to the parental cloud. The remains of\nthe parental cloud appear as dense (more than 10^4 per cm^3) and cold (14-17 K)\ncondensations. The dust in the PDR is warm (19-25 K). Dense massive clumps are\npresent around the central ionized region. G010.32-00.14 is especially\nremarkable because five clumps of several hundred solar masses surround the\ncentral HII region; their peak column density is a few 10^23 per cm^2, and the\nmean density in their central regions reaches several 10^5 per cm^3. Four of\nthem contain at least one massive YSO; these clumps also contain extended green\nobjects and Class II methanol masers.

Unfortunately, the efficient reduction\nof passive networks with many ports is still an open problem. Existing\ntechniques do not scale well with the number of ports, and lead to dense\nreduced models that burden subsequent simulations. In this paper, we propose\nTurboMOR, a novel MOR technique for the efficient reduction of passive RC\nnetworks. TurboMOR is based on moment-matching, achieved through efficient\ncongruence transformations based on Householder reflections. A novel feature of\nTurboMOR is the block-diagonal structure of the reduced models, that makes them\nmore efficient than the dense models produced by existing techniques. Moreover,\nthe model structure allows for an insightful interpretation of the reduction\nprocess in terms of system theory. Numerical results show that TurboMOR scales\nmore favourably than existing techniques in terms of reduction time, simulation\ntime and memory consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 13:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) P21/m insulating phase undergoes field induced transformation to\nferromagnetic (FM) Pnma metallic ground state below its AFM ordering\ntemperature (220K) in zero-field cooling (ZFC) from room temperature. At\ntemperature greater than 25K, the field induced FM Pnma phase remained\nirreversible even after complete removal of field. However, for T ( 39-65K),\nthe field induced transformation is partially reversible. This behaviour has\nbeen attributed to magnetic field induced devitrification of the glass-like\narrested AFM P21/m phase to FM Pnma equilibrium phase. The devitrified FM Pnma\nphase starts transforming back to AFM P21/m phase around ~39K on heating the\nsample under zero field. Our results corroborate the evidence of strong\nmagneto-structural coupling in this system. An H-T phase-diagram has been\nconstructed based on LTHM-XTD data, which resembles with the one made from\nmagnetic measurements. These results have been explained on the basis of\nkinetic arrest of first order phase transition and field induced\ndevitrification of the arrested phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 15:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 03:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 11:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-21"}

Heating the solar corona to several million degrees requires the\nconversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy. In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether an unstable magnetic thread within a coronal loop can\ndestabilise a neighbouring magnetic thread. Aims. By running a series of\nsimulations, we aim to understand under what conditions the destabilisation of\na single magnetic thread can also trigger a release of energy in a nearby\nthread. Methods. The 3D magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d, is used to simulate\nthe temporal evolution of coronal magnetic fields during a kink instability and\nthe subsequent relaxation process. We assume that a coronal magnetic loop\nconsists of non-potential magnetic threads that are initially in an equilibrium\nstate. Results. The non-linear kink instability in one magnetic thread forms a\nhelical current sheet and initiates magnetic reconnection. The current sheet\nfragments, and magnetic energy is released throughout that thread. We find\nthat, under certain conditions, this event can destabilise a nearby thread,\nwhich is a necessary requirement for starting an avalanche of energy release in\nmagnetic threads. Conclusions. It is possible to initiate an energy release in\na nearby, non-potential magnetic thread, because the energy released from one\nunstable magnetic thread can trigger energy release in nearby threads, provided\nthat the nearby structures are close to marginal stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 15:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

The two mechanisms add to the conventional charging\nby ambient plasma, produced in the cloud by CRs. We show that the CR-induced\nphotoemission can dramatically modify the charge distribution function for\nsubmicron grains. We demonstrate the importance of the obtained results for\ndust coagulation: While the charging by ambient plasma alone leads to a strong\nCoulomb repulsion between grains and inhibits their further coagulation, the\ncombination with the photoemission provides optimum conditions for the growth\nof large dust aggregates in a certain region of the cloud, corresponding to the\ndensities $n(\\mathrm{H_2})$ between $\\sim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and $\\sim10^6$\ncm$^{-3}$.

The sensor is based on a new concept for\nnarrowband mechanical-impact acoustic transmitters and matched resonant\nreceivers. The lightweight, compact, and low-cost transmitters produce\nhigh-power acoustic pulses at one or more discrete frequencies with little\ninput power. The energy for each pulse is accumulated over long times at low\npowers, like a mousetrap, and therefore can be operated with ordinary batteries\nand no power conditioning. A breadboard impact-transmitter and matched-receiver\nsystem that detected human motion through thick walls with only rudimentary\nsignal processing is described, and results are presented. A conceptual design\nis presented of an acoustic through-the-wall sensor, costing about $10,000 per\nunit and capable of remotely and non-intrusively scanning steel cargo\ncontainers for stowaways at a rate of two containers per minute. Advantages of\nacoustic through-the-wall sensors over radar are: Sound penetrates metal walls;\nand acoustic sensors are sensitive to small and slow motions, and so can detect\nstationary persons by breathing motion alone. Other attractive features\ninclude: high-resolution locating and tracking; portability; low cost; quick\nand easy preparation and deployment; and near-real-time data processing and\ndisplay. These features provide a robust stand-alone through-the-wall\nsurveillance capability or an excellent complement to a radar sensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 19:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}
