The tremendous cost\nof systemic risk requires the design and implementation of tools for the\nefficient macroprudential regulation of financial institutions. The current\npaper proposes a novel approach to measuring systemic risk.\n  Key to our construction is a rigorous derivation of systemic risk measures\nfrom the structure of the underlying system and the objectives of a financial\nregulator. The suggested systemic risk measures express systemic risk in terms\nof capital endowments of the financial firms. Their definition requires two\ningredients: a cash flow or value model that assigns to the capital allocations\nof the entities in the system a relevant stochastic outcome; and an\nacceptability criterion, i.e. a set of random outcomes that are acceptable to a\nregulatory authority. Systemic risk is measured by the set of allocations of\nadditional capital that lead to acceptable outcomes. We explain the conceptual\nframework and the definition of systemic risk measures, provide an algorithm\nfor their computation, and illustrate their application in numerical case\nstudies.\n  Many systemic risk measures in the literature can be viewed as the minimal\namount of capital that is needed to make the system acceptable after\naggregating individual risks, hence quantify the costs of a bail-out. In\ncontrast, our approach emphasizes operational systemic risk measures that\ninclude both ex post bailout costs as well as ex ante capital requirements and\nmay be used to prevent systemic crises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 16:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 13:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 21:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 14:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 22:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

This results in a heating mechanism that\nis only weakly sensitive to the local density, and therefore approximately\nspatially uniform, naturally producing an inverted temperature-density relation\nin underdense regions. In this paper we go beyond the approximation of uniform\nheating and quantify the heating rate fluctuations due to the clustered\ndistribution of blazars and how this impacts on the thermal history of the IGM.\nWe analytically compute a filtering function that relates the heating rate\nfluctuations to the underlying dark matter density field. We implement it in\nthe cosmological code GADGET-3 and perform large scale simulations to determine\nthe impact of inhomogeneous heating. We show that, because of blazar\nclustering, blazar heating is inhomogeneous for z>= 2. At high redshift, the\ntemperature-density relation shows an important scatter and presents a low\ntemperature envelope of unheated regions, in particular at low densities and\nwithin voids. However, the median temperature of the IGM is close to that in\nthe uniform case, albeit slightly lower at low redshift. We find that blazar\nheating is more complex than initially assumed and that the temperature-density\nrelation is not unique. Our analytic model for the heating rate fluctuations\ncouples well with large scale simulations and provides a cost-effective\nalternative to subgrid models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 17:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 14:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 14:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

In order to derive the disk-averaged surface\ndensities of gas and SFRs, we have used high-resolution RC observations to\nmeasure the radio sizes for all galaxies. We find that dense molecular gas (as\ntraced by HCN) has the tightest correlation with that of SFRs, and is linear in\n(N=1.01 +/- 0.02) across the full galaxy sample. The correlation between\ndensities of molecular gas (traced by CO) and SFRs is sensitive to the adopted\nvalue of the alpha_CO used to infer molecular gas masses from CO luminosities.\nFor a fixed value of alpha_CO, a slope of 1.14+/-0.02 is found. If instead we\nadopt values of 4.6 and 0.8 for disk galaxies and (U)LIRGs, respectively, we\nfind the two distinct relations. If applying a continuously varying alpha_CO to\nour sample, we recover a single relation with slope of 1.60+/-0.03. The SFRs is\na steeper function of total gas than that of molecular gas, and is tighter\namong low-luminosity galaxies. We find no correlation between SFRs and atomic\ngas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 18:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Second, we developed a process to create a rubber hand\nreplica of a human hand. To compare the skin softness of a human hand and\nartificial hands, a robotic indenter was employed to produce a softness map by\nrecording the displacement data when constant indentation force of 1 N was\napplied to 780 data points on the palmar side of the hand. Results showed that\nan artificial hand with skeletal structure is as soft as a human hand. Lastly,\nthe participants arms were touched with human and artificial hands, but they\nwere prevented to see the hand that touched them.

This\n\\hlt{metastring theory} is formulated in such a way that stringy symmetries\n(such as T-duality) are realized linearly.

These include a formulation of the moduli space of\nLorentzian worldsheets, a careful study of the symplectic structure and\nconsequently consistent closed and open boundary conditions, and the string\nspectrum and operator algebra. What emerges from these studies is a new quantum\nnotion of space-time that we refer to as a quantum Lagrangian or equivalently a\n\\hlt{modular space-time}. This concept embodies the standard tenets of quantum\ntheory and implements in a precise way a notion of {relative locality}.

A regular equipment is a `cartesian\nequipment' satisfying certain axioms, and a cartesian equipment is a slight\ngeneralization of a cartesian bicategory.\n  This is done by defining a tricategory Biprof whose objects are bicategories\nand whose morphisms are category-valued profunctors, and then defining an\nequipment to be a pseudo-monad in this tricategory. The resulting notion of\nequipment is compared to several existing ones. Most importantly, this involves\nshowing that every pseudo-monad in Biprof has a Kleisli object. A strict\n2-category of equipments, over locally discrete base bicategories, is\nidentified, and cartesian equipments are defined to be the cartesian objects in\nthis 2-category.

The formation\nof soap bubbles from thin films is accompanied by topological transitions, and\nthus the natural question arises whether this concept is applicable to the\ngeneration of other topological states. Here we show how a magnetic topological\nstructure, namely a skyrmion bubble, can be generated in a solid state system\nin a similar manner. Beyond enabling the investigation of complex\nsurface-tension driven dynamics in a novel physical system, this observation\nhas also practical implications, since the topological charge of magnetic\nskyrmions has been envisioned as an information carrier for new data processing\ntechnologies. A main goal towards this end is the experimental creation and\nmanipulation of individual mobile skyrmions at room temperature. By utilizing\nan inhomogeneous in-plane current in a system with broken inversion asymmetry,\nwe experimentally blow magnetic skyrmion bubbles through a geometrical\nconstriction. The presence of a spatially divergent spin-orbit torque gives\nrise to instabilities of the magnetic domain structures that are reminiscent of\nRayleigh-Plateau instabilities in fluid flows. Experimentally we can determine\nthe electric current versus magnetic field phase diagram for skyrmion formation\nand we reveal the efficient manipulation of these dynamically created\nskyrmions, including depinning and motion. The demonstrated current-driven\ntransformation from stripe domains to magnetic skyrmion bubbles could provide\nadditional avenues for implementing skyrmion-based spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 19:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-07"}

Objects in evolved stages of massive star formation such as protostars,\nhot molecular cores, and ultracompact HII regions have been studied in more\ndetail than earlier, colder objects. With this in mind, the APEX Telescope\nLarge Area Survey of the whole inner Galactic plane at 870 micron (ATLASGAL)\nhas been carried out to provide a global view of cold dust and star formation\nat submillimetre wavelengths. To derive kinematic distances to a large sample\nof ATLASGAL clumps we divided them into groups of sources, which are located\nclose together, mostly within a radius of 2 pc, and have velocities in a\nsimilar range with a median velocity dispersion of ~ 1 km/s. Using NH3, N2H+\nand CS velocities we calculate near and far kinematic distances to 296 groups\nof ATLASGAL sources in the first quadrant and 393 groups in the fourth\nquadrant. We analyse HI self-absorption and HI absorption to resolve the\nkinematic distance ambiguity. We obtain a scale height of ~ 28+/-2 pc and\ndisplacement below the Galactic midplane of ~ -7+/-1 pc.

This is consistent with the\nslope derived for clusters and with that of the stellar initial mass function.\nExamining the power-law index for different galactocentric distances and\nvarious source samples shows that it is independent of environment and\nevolutionary phase. Fitting the mass-size relationship by a power law gives a\nslope of 1.76+/-0.01 for cold sources such as IRDCs and warm clumps associated\nwith HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Our experiments on a database of about 3000\nmusical track pairs show that the new feature space characterization produces\nsignificant improvements over standard baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 21:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In\nthe absence of known microscopic interaction mechanisms, phenomenological\nansatzes are usually proposed in order to describe such models. In this paper,\nwe derive a generalization of one of the most frequently used of such\nansatzes:the one based on a initial proposal of Shapiro, Sol\\`a, Espa\\~na-Bonet\nand Ruiz-Lapuente who described a time-dependent cosmological \"constant\" whose\nvariation arises from quantum effects near the Planck scale [I. L. Shapiro, J.\nSol\\`a, C. Espa\\~na-Bonet, and P. Ruiz-Lapuente, (2003). This physically\nmotivated model was based on a single free parameter $\\nu$, and was\nsubsequently studied by Wang and Meng (2005), under the pure phenomenological\nreasoning that the vacuum decay would slightly modify the exponent describing\nhow the energy density of dark matter decreases with the scale factor. This\nmodification is described by a single parameter $\\varepsilon$ (= 3 $\\nu$ of the\nformer paper). The generalization derived in the present article requires two\nfree parameters ($\\varepsilon_{1}$, $\\varepsilon_{2}$). We show that this\nextension is dynamically equivalent to the ansatz proposed by Barrow and\nClifton (2006) which deals with the transfer of energy between any two fluids\nusing a two-parameter scheme ($\\alpha_{1}$, $\\alpha_{2}$) and that has the\nadvantage of exhibiting explicitly the form of the interaction factor appearing\nin the continuity equation of each fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 23:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 21:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 20:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

For large values of $\\beta$,\nyielding a good approximation to a continuous distribution, spatially\nsynchronized temporal oscillations dominate the system. For the four-strategy\ngame the system is always neutrally stable, but different regimes emerge,\ndepending on the size of the system and the level of discretization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 03:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 18:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-25"}

However,\nmodelling and predicting user-perceived reliability of black-box services\nremain an open research problem. Software services, such as Web services and\nWeb APIs, generally provide black-box functionalities to users through the\nInternet, thus leading to a lack of their internal information for reliability\nanalysis. Furthermore, the user-perceived service reliability depends not only\non the service itself, but also heavily on the invocation context (e.g.,\nservice workloads, network conditions), whereby traditional reliability models\nbecome ineffective and inappropriate. To address these new challenges posed by\nblackbox services, in this paper, we propose CARP, a new contextaware\nreliability prediction approach, which leverages historical usage data from\nusers to construct context-aware reliability models and further provides online\nreliability prediction results to users. Through context-aware reliability\nmodelling, CARP is able to alleviate the data sparsity problem that heavily\nlimits the prediction accuracy of other existing approaches.

Also, there\nis no overall optimization of the coding of basic units. This paper proposes a\nnew region-based rate-control scheme for H.264/AVC to improve the coding\nefficiency. The inter-frame information is explored to objectively divide one\nframe into multiple regions based on their rate-distortion behaviors. The MBs\nwith the similar characteristics are classified into the same region, and the\nentire region instead of a single MB or a group of contiguous MBs is treated as\na basic unit for rate-control. A linear rate-quantization stepsize model and a\nlinear distortion-quantization stepsize model are proposed to accurately\ndescribe the rate-distortion characteristics for the region-based basic units.\nMoreover, based on the above linear models, an overall optimization model is\nproposed to obtain suitable Quantization Parameters (QPs) for the region-based\nbasic units. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed region-based\nrate-control approach can achieve both better subjective and objective quality\nby performing the rate-control adaptively with the content, compared to the\nconventional rate-control approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 11:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Evidence of a violation may lead\nto the discovery of a new force. The best torsion balance experiments have\nruled it out to 10^-13. Cold-atom drop tests have reached 10^-7 and promise to\ndo 7 to 10 orders of magnitude better, on the ground or in space. They are\nlimited by the random shot noise, which depends on the number N of atoms in the\nclouds. As mass-dropping experiments in the non-uniform gravitational field of\nEarth, they are sensitive to the initial conditions. Random accelerations due\nto initial condition errors of the clouds are designed to be at the same level\nas shot noise, so that they can be reduced with the number of drops along with\nit. This sets the requirements for the initial position and velocity spreads of\nthe clouds with given N. In the STE-QUEST space mission proposal aiming at\n2x10^-15 they must be about a factor 8 above Heisenberg's principle limit, and\nthe integration time required to reduce both errors is 3 years, with a mission\nduration of 5 years. Instead, offset errors at release between different atom\nclouds are systematic and give rise to a systematic effect which mimics a\nviolation. Such offsets must be demonstrated to be as small as required in all\ndrops, must be small by design and must be measured. For STE-QUEST to meet its\ngoal they must be several orders of magnitude smaller than the size of each\nindividual cloud, which in its turn must be at most 8 times larger than the\nuncertainty principle limit. Even if all technical problems are solved and the\nclouds are released with negligible systematic errors, still they must be\nmeasured. Then, Heisenberg's principle dictates that the measurement lasts as\nlong as the experiment and the systematic nature of the effect requires many\nmeasurements for it to be ruled out as a source of violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 16:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 15:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 07:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 23:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In practice, due to the pile-up effect of the detector, it's\ndifficult to directly measure the spectrum of a CT scanner using an energy\nresolved detector. An alternative solution is to estimate the spectrum using\ntransmission measurements with a step phantom or other CT phantom. In this\nwork, we present a new spectrum estimation method based on indirect\ntransmission measurement and model spectra mixture approach. The estimated\nx-ray spectrum was expressed as weighted summation of a set of model spectra,\nwhich can significantly reduce the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the spectrum\nestimation problem. Next, an estimated projection can be calculated with the\nassumed spectrum. By iteratively updating the unknown weights, we minimized the\ndifference between the estimated projection data and the raw projection data.\nThe final spectrum was calculated with these calibrated weights and the model\nspectra. Both simulation and experimental data were used to evaluate the\nproposed method. In the simulation study, the estimated spectra were compared\nto the raw spectra which were used to generate the raw projection data. For the\nexperimental study, the ground truth measurement of the raw x-ray spectrum was\nnot available. Therefore, the estimated spectrum was compared against spectra\ngenerated using the SpekCalc software with tube configurations provided by the\nscanner manufacturer. The results show the proposed method has potential to\naccurately estimate x-ray spectra using the raw projection data. The difference\nbetween the mean energy of the raw spectra and the mean energy of the estimated\nspectra were smaller than 0.5 keV for both simulation and experimental data.\nFurther tests show the method was robust with respect to the model spectra\ngenerator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 01:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

Computational prediction\nof ligand binding sites (LBS) is a well-established protein function assignment\nmethod. Here we apply the specific LBS detection algorithm we recently\ndescribed (Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a) to some 801\nfunctionally unannotated experimental structures in the Protein Data Bank by\nscreening for the binding sites (BS) of 6 biologically important ligands: GTP\nin small Ras-type G-proteins, ATP in ser/thr protein kinases, sialic acid\n(SIA), retinoic acid (REA), and heme-bound and unbound (free) nitric oxide\n(hNO, fNO). Validation of the algorithm for the GTP- and ATP-binding sites has\nbeen previously described in detail (ibid.); here, validation for the BSs of\nthe 4 other ligands shows both good specificity and sensitivity. Of the 801\nstructures screened, 8 tested positive for GTP binding, 61 for ATP binding, 35\nfor SIA binding, 132 for REA binding, 33 for hNO binding, and 10 for fNO\nbinding. Using the cutting plane and tangent sphere methods we described\npreviously, (Reyes, V.M., 2015b), we also determined the depth of burial of the\nLBSs detected above and compared the values with those from the respective\ntraining structures, and the degree of similarity between the two values taken\nas a further validation of the predicted LBSs. Applying this criterion, we were\nable to narrow down the predicted GTP-binding proteins to 2, the ATP-binding\nproteins to 13, the SIA-binding proteins to 2, the REA-binding proteins to 14,\nthe hNO-binding proteins to 4, and the fNO-binding proteins to 1. We believe\nthis further criterion increases the confidence level of our LBS predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 04:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}
