As\nDoD interests desire to field wearable sensors as blast dosimeters, shock tubes\nmay also serve for calibration and testing of these devices. The high blast\npressures needed for experimental testing of candidate armors are unnecessary\nto test these sensors. An inexpensive, efficient, and easily available way of\ntesting these pressure sensors is desirable. It is known that releasing\ncompressed gas suddenly can create a repeatable shock front, and the pressures\ncan be finely tuned by changing the pressure to which the gas is compressed. A\nCrosman 0.177 caliber air pistol was used (without loading any pellets) to\ncompress and release air in one end of a 24 inch long 3/4 inch diameter\nstandard pipe nipple to simulate a blast wave at the other end of the tube. A\nvariable number of pumps were used to vary the peak blast pressure. As\nexpected, the trials where 10 pumps were used to compress the air resulted in\nthe largest average peak pressure of 101.99 kPa (+/- 2.63 kPa). The design with\n7 pumps had the second biggest peak pressure, with an average peak pressure of\n89.11 kPa (+/-1.77 kPa). The design with 5 pumps had the third largest peak\npressure, with an average peak pressure of 78.80 kPa (+/-1.74 kPa). 3 pumps\nproduced an average peak pressure of 61.37 kPa (+/-2.20 kPa). 2 pumps produced\nan average peak pressure of 48.11 kPa (+/-1.57 kPa). The design with just 1\npump had the smallest peak pressure and produced an average peak pressure of\n30.13 kPa (+/-0.79 kPa). This inexpensive shock tube design had a shot-to-shot\ncycle time of between 30 and 45 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2015 16:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

This is an extension of previous studies of the interaction\nbetween a polarizable atom and a wedge, in which repulsion occurs if the atom\nis sufficiently anisotropic and close enough to the symmetry plane of the\nwedge. A similar repulsion occurs if such an atom passes a thin cylinder or a\nwire. An obvious extension is to compute the interaction between such an atom\nand two facing wedges, which includes as a special case the interaction of an\natom with a conducting screen possessing a slit, or between two parallel wires.\nTo this end we further extend the electromagnetic multiple-scattering formalism\nfor three-body interactions. To test this machinery we reinvestigate the\ninteraction of a polarizable atom between two parallel conducting plates. In\nthat case, three-body effects are shown to be small, and are dominated by\nthree- and four-scattering terms. The atom-wedge calculation is illustrated by\nan analogous scalar situation, described in the Appendix. The wedge-wedge-atom\ngeometry is difficult to analyze because this is a scale-free problem. But it\nis not so hard to investigate the three-body corrections to the interaction\nbetween an anisotropic atom or nanoparticle and a pair of parallel conducting\ncylinders, and show that the three-body effects are very small and do not\naffect the Casimir-Polder repulsion at large distances between the cylinders.\nFinally, we consider whether such highly anisotropic atoms needed for repulsion\nare practically realizable. Since this appears rather difficult to accomplish,\nit may be more feasible to observe such effects with highly anisotropic nano\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2015 18:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

The lepton anomaly indicates the existence of a nearby e+/- source.\nIt has been proposed that high-energy positrons can be produced inside nearby\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) via interactions of CR hadrons with the ambient\nmedium. A distinctive prediction of this mechanism is a high-energy rise of the\nboron-to-carbon ratio, which has not been observed. It also requires old SNRs\nat work (with ineffective magnetic field amplification and slow shock speed),\nthat cannot account for the CR hadronic spectra observed up to the knee\nenergies (~5 PeV). We propose a new picture where, in addition to such a nearby\nCR accelerator, the high-energy spectrum of CR hadrons is provided by the\nlarge-scale population of SNRs, on average younger, that can efficiently\naccelerate CRs up to the knee. Under this scenario, the spectral hardening of\nCR hadrons can be naturally interpreted as the transition between the two\ncomponents.

It is therefore essential to evaluate the performance of IVWSNs\nunder interference from WiFi and Bluetooth devices, especially when these\ndevices are inside the vehicle.\n  In this paper, we report the results of a comprehensive experimental study of\nIVWSNs based on ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy under WiFi and Bluetooth\ninterference. The impact of the interference from Bluetooth and WiFi devices\ncan be clearly observed from the experiments. The results of the experiments\nconducted suggest that Bluetooth Low Energy technology outperforms ZigBee\ntechnology in the context of IVWSNs when WiFi interference exists in the car.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 06:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

SPARCS can be applied to high\ndimensional prediction problems in experimental science, medicine, finance, and\nengineering, as illustrated by the following. Suppose one wishes to run a\nsequence of experiments to learn a sparse multivariate predictor of a dependent\nvariable $Y$ (disease prognosis for instance) based on a $p$ dimensional set of\nindependent variables $\\mathbf X=[X_1,\\ldots, X_p]^T$ (assayed biomarkers).\nAssume that the cost of acquiring the full set of variables $\\mathbf X$\nincreases linearly in its dimension. SPARCS breaks the data collection into two\nstages in order to achieve an optimal tradeoff between sampling cost and\npredictor performance. In the first stage we collect a few ($n$) expensive\nsamples $\\{y_i,\\mathbf x_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, at the full dimension $p\\gg n$ of\n$\\mathbf X$, winnowing the number of variables down to a smaller dimension $l <\np$ using a type of cross-correlation or regression coefficient screening. In\nthe second stage we collect a larger number $(t-n)$ of cheaper samples of the\n$l$ variables that passed the screening of the first stage. At the second\nstage, a low dimensional predictor is constructed by solving the standard\nregression problem using all $t$ samples of the selected variables. SPARCS is\nan adaptive online algorithm that implements false positive control on the\nselected variables, is well suited to small sample sizes, and is scalable to\nhigh dimensions. We establish asymptotic bounds for the Familywise Error Rate\n(FWER), specify high dimensional convergence rates for support recovery, and\nestablish optimal sample allocation rules to the first and second stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 06:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 01:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Specifically, we can always fill up all\nthe holes of at least one polygon, transforming it into a simple polygon, and\nstill obtain exactly the same Minkowski sum.

Given a sequence of null hypotheses\n$\\mathcal{H}(n) = (H_1,..., H_n)$, Benjamini and Hochberg\n\\cite{benjamini1995controlling} introduced the false discovery rate (FDR)\ncriterion, which is the expected proportion of false positives among rejected\nnull hypotheses, and proposed a testing procedure that controls FDR below a\npre-assigned significance level.

It is therefore possible to view\nstate preparation in general as being the output of some appropriately chosen\n(notional) quantum game. This reverse engineering approach in which we seek to\nconstruct a suitable notional game that produces some desired output state as\nits equilibrium state may lead to different methodologies and insights. With\nthis goal in mind we examine the notion of preference in quantum games since if\nwe are interested in the production of a particular equilibrium output state,\nit is the competing preferences of the players that determine this equilibrium\nstate. We show that preferences on output states can be viewed in certain cases\nas being induced by measurement with an appropriate set of numerical\nweightings, or payoffs, attached to the results of that measurement. In\nparticular we show that a distance-based preference measure on the output\nstates is equivalent to a having a strictly-competitive set of payoffs on the\nresults of some measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 10:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

These flows have proved\nuseful to tackle theoretically and numerically non-linear diffusion equations\nthat model for instance porous media or crowd evolutions. These gradient flows\ndefine a suitable notion of weak solutions for these evolutions and they can be\napproximated in a stable way using discrete flows. These discrete flows are\nimplicit Euler time stepping according to the Wasserstein metric. A bottleneck\nof these approaches is the high computational load induced by the resolution of\neach step. Indeed, this corresponds to the resolution of a convex optimization\nproblem involving a Wasserstein distance to the previous iterate. Following\nseveral recent works on the approximation of Wasserstein distances, we consider\na discrete flow induced by an entropic regularization of the transportation\ncoupling. This entropic regularization allows one to trade the initial\nWasserstein fidelity term for a Kulback-Leibler divergence, which is easier to\ndeal with numerically. We show how KL proximal schemes, and in particular\nDykstra's algorithm, can be used to compute each step of the regularized flow.\nThe resulting algorithm is both fast, parallelizable and versatile, because it\nonly requires multiplications by a Gibbs kernel. On Euclidean domains\ndiscretized on an uniform grid, this corresponds to a linear filtering (for\ninstance a Gaussian filtering when $c$ is the squared Euclidean distance) which\ncan be computed in nearly linear time.

Thus no (or\nby far not enough) abnormal training samples are available and we need to find\nabnormalities in test data without actually knowing what they are.\nNevertheless, the prevailing concept of the field is to directly search for\nindividual abnormal local patches or image regions independent of another. To\naddress this problem, we propose a method for joint detection of abnormalities\nin videos by spatio-temporal video parsing. The goal of video parsing is to\nfind a set of indispensable normal spatio-temporal object hypotheses that\njointly explain all the foreground of a video, while, at the same time, being\nsupported by normal training samples. Consequently, we avoid a direct detection\nof abnormalities and discover them indirectly as those hypotheses which are\nneeded for covering the foreground without finding an explanation for\nthemselves by normal samples. Abnormalities are localized by MAP inference in a\ngraphical model and we solve it efficiently by formulating it as a convex\noptimization problem.

It shows that although the symbols epsilon\nand delta were initially introduced in 1823 by Cauchy, no functional\nrelationship for delta as a function of epsilon was ever specified by Cauchy.\nIt was only in 1861 that the epsilon-delta method manifested itself to the full\nin Weierstrass' definition of a limit. The article gives various\ninterpretations of these issues later provided by mathematicians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 13:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The problem of logical rigor in definitions was considered by Arnauld\nand Nicole in \"Logique ou l'art de penser\". They were the first, who\ndistinguished between the volume of the concept and its structure. They created\na tradition which was strong in math till XIX century, especially in France.\nThe definitions were in binomial nomenclature mostly, but another type of\ndefinition appears in Cantor theory - it was the descriptive definition. As it\nused to be in human sciences, first the object had only one characteristic,\nthen as the research continued it enriched with new characteristics so we have\nfull-fledged conception. In this way the mathematics acquired its own\ncreativity. In 1915 Lusin laid down a new principle of the descriptive theory:\na structural characteristic is done, the analytical form had to be found. New\nschools of descriptive set theory appeared in Moscow in the first half of the\n20th century.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 13:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}
