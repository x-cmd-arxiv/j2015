The space of such regularizers\nin Gaussian noise settings is well studied; however, non-Gaussian noise models\nlead to data-fit expressions for which entirely different families of\nregularizers may be effective. These regularizers have received less attention\nin the literature because they yield non-convex optimization problems in\nGaussian noise settings.

While\nthey provide inference procedures that are more robust to parametric\nmisspecification bias, they may be quite sensitive to tuning parameter choices.\nWe study the effects of bias correction on confidence interval coverage in the\ncontext of kernel density and local polynomial regression estimation, and prove\nthat bias correction can be preferred to undersmoothing for minimizing coverage\nerror and increasing robustness to tuning parameter choice. This is achieved\nusing a novel, yet simple, Studentization, which leads to a new way of\nconstructing kernel-based bias-corrected confidence intervals. In addition, for\npractical cases, we derive coverage error optimal bandwidths and discuss\neasy-to-implement bandwidth selectors. For interior points, we show that the\nMSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator (before bias correction)\ndelivers the fastest coverage error decay rate after bias correction when\nsecond-order (equivalent) kernels are employed, but is otherwise suboptimal\nbecause it is too \"large\". Finally, for odd-degree local polynomial regression,\nwe show that, as with point estimation, coverage error adapts to boundary\npoints automatically when appropriate Studentization is used; however, the\nMSE-optimal bandwidth for the original point estimator is suboptimal. All the\nresults are established using valid Edgeworth expansions and illustrated with\nsimulated data.

This research seeks to fill this gap by\nexploring local search on a network representation of proteins and to probe the\nsource of navigability in proteins. Previously, we confirmed that proteins are\nnavigable small-world networks and observed that local search paths exhibit\ndifferent characteristics from global search paths. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the biological relevance of the differences in path characteristics\non a type III receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT). A chief difference that works in\nfavour of local search paths as intra-protein communication pathways is their\nweaker proclivity, compared to global search paths, for traversing long-range\nedges. Long-range edges tend to be less stable and their inclusion tends to\ndecrease the communication propensity of a path. The source of protein\nnavigability is traced to clustering provided by short-range edges. The\nmajority of a protein's short-range edges reside within structures deemed\nimportant for long-range energy transport and modulation of allosteric\ncommunication in proteins. Therefore, the disruption of intra-protein\ncommunication as a result of the destruction of these structures via random\nrewiring is expected. A local search perspective leads us to this expected\nconclusion while a global search perspective does not.

When using\nstandard discretization techniques, the size of the linear system grows\nexponentially with the number of dimensions, making the use of classic\niterative solvers infeasible. During the last few years, low-rank tensor\napproaches have been developed that allow to mitigate this curse of\ndimensionality by exploiting the underlying structure of the linear operator.\nIn this work, we focus on tensors represented in the Tucker and tensor train\nformats. We propose two preconditioned gradient methods on the corresponding\nlow-rank tensor manifolds: A Riemannian version of the preconditioned\nRichardson method as well as an approximate Newton scheme based on the\nRiemannian Hessian. For the latter, considerable attention is given to the\nefficient solution of the resulting Newton equation. In numerical experiments,\nwe compare the efficiency of our Riemannian algorithms with other established\ntensor-based approaches such as a truncated preconditioned Richardson method\nand the alternating linear scheme. The results show that our approximate\nRiemannian Newton scheme is significantly faster in cases when the application\nof the linear operator is expensive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 16:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-13"}

We find that the data favor a broken power law to a pure power law with\nodds ratios of 22 and 2.2 to one for the McWilliams and Sesana prior models,\nrespectively. The McWilliams model is essentially ruled out by the data, and\nthe Sesana model is in tension with the data under the assumption of a pure\npower law. Using the broken power-law analysis we construct posterior\ndistributions on environmental factors that drive the binary to the GW-driven\nregime including the stellar mass density for stellar-scattering, mass\naccretion rate for circumbinary disk interaction, and orbital eccentricity for\neccentric binaries, marking the first time that the shape of the GWB spectrum\nhas been used to make astrophysical inferences. We then place the most\nstringent limits so far on the energy density of relic GWs,\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{gw}(f)\\,h^2 < 4.2 \\times 10^{-10}$, yielding a limit on the\nHubble parameter during inflation of $H_*=1.6\\times10^{-2}~m_{Pl}$, where\n$m_{Pl}$ is the Planck mass. Our limit on the cosmic string GWB,\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{gw}(f)\\, h^2 < 2.2 \\times 10^{-10}$, translates to a\nconservative limit of $G\\mu<3.3\\times 10^{-8}$ - a factor of 4 better than the\njoint Planck and high-$l$ CMB data from other experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 18:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

Light sails offer an\nattractive alternative in which fuel is not carried by the spacecraft, with\nacceleration being provided by an external source of light. By artificially\nilluminating the spacecraft with beamed radiation, speeds are only limited by\nthe area of the sail, heat resistance of its material, and power use of the\naccelerating apparatus. In this paper, we show that leakage from a light sail\npropulsion apparatus in operation around a solar system analogue would be\ndetectable. To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave\nbeam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around\na single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz.\nLeakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and\ndurations of tens of seconds at 100 pc. Because most travel within a planetary\nsystem would be conducted between the habitable worlds within that system,\nmultiply-transiting exoplanetary systems offer the greatest chance of\ndetection, especially when the planets are in projected conjunction as viewed\nfrom Earth. If interplanetary travel via beam-driven light sails is commonly\nemployed in our galaxy, this activity could be revealed by radio follow-up of\nnearby transiting exoplanetary systems.

Furthermore, previously proposed\nmemory-interference mitigation techniques are not designed to precisely control\napplication performance.\n  This dissertation seeks to achieve high and controllable performance in\nmulticore systems by mitigating and quantifying the impact of shared resource\ninterference. First, towards mitigating memory interference and achieving high\nperformance, we propose the Blacklisting memory scheduler that achieves high\nperformance and fairness at low complexity. Next, towards quantifying the\nimpact of memory interference and achieving controllable performance in the\npresence of memory bandwidth interference, we propose the Memory Interference\ninduced Slowdown Estimation (MISE) model.

Moreover, optical spectroscopy of GRB afterglows\nimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gas\nalong the GRB line-of-sight. Here we report the first ever 21 cm line\nobservations of GRB host galaxies, using the Australia Telescope Compact Array,\nimplying high levels of atomic hydrogen (HI), which suggests that the\nconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previously\nthought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas\n(or with very efficient HI-to-H2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of molecular\ngas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible.

This dual nature of friction\nwhich influences both system operation and its terminal limit results in the\nmaximum relative frictional work to lie at intermediate friction coefficients\nand not at the extremes of frictional limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 01:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

Recently, many database research efforts have\nintegrated probabilistic models into databases to support tasks such as\ninformation extraction and labeling. Many of these efforts are based on batch\noriented inference which inhibits a realtime workflow. One important task is\nentity resolution (ER). ER is the process of determining records (mentions) in\na database that correspond to the same real-world entity. Traditional pairwise\nER methods can lead to inconsistencies and low accuracy due to localized\ndecisions. Leading ER systems solve this problem by collectively resolving all\nrecords using a probabilistic graphical model and Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) inference. However, for large datasets this is an extremely expensive\nprocess. One key observation is that, such exhaustive ER process incurs a huge\nup-front cost, which is wasteful in practice because most users are interested\nin only a small subset of entities. In this paper, we advocate pay-as-you-go\nentity resolution by developing a number of query-driven collective ER\ntechniques. We introduce two classes of SQL queries that involve ER operators\n--- selection-driven ER and join-driven ER. We implement novel variations of\nthe MCMC Metropolis Hastings algorithm to generate biased samples and\nselectivity-based scheduling algorithms to support the two classes of ER\nqueries. Finally, we show that query-driven ER algorithms can converge and\nreturn results within minutes over a database populated with the extraction\nfrom a newswire dataset containing 71 million mentions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 04:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

The\ncongestion is of the processor sharing type in the sense that all users in the\nsystem at any given time are served simultaneously. However, in contrast to\nclassical processor sharing congestion models, the processing slowdown is\nproportional to the number of users in the system at any time. That is, the\nrate of service experienced by all users is linearly decreasing with the number\nof users. For each user there is an ideal departure time (due date). A\ncentralized scheduling goal is then to select arrival times so as to minimize\nthe total penalty due to deviations from ideal times weighted with sojourn\ntimes. Each deviation is assumed quadratic, or more generally convex. But due\nto the dynamics of the system, the scheduling objective function is non-convex.\nSpecifically, the system objective function is a non-smooth piecewise convex\nfunction. Nevertheless, we are able to leverage the structure of the problem to\nderive an algorithm that finds the global optimum in a (large but) finite\nnumber of steps, each involving the solution of a constrained convex program.\nFurther, we put forward several heuristics. The first is the traversal of\nneighbouring constrained convex programming problems, that is guaranteed to\nreach a local minimum of the centralized problem. This is a form of a \"local\nsearch\", where we use the problem structure in a novel manner. The second is a\none-coordinate \"global search\", used in coordinate pivot iteration. We then\nmerge these two heuristics into a unified \"local-global\" heuristic, and\nnumerically illustrate the effectiveness of this heuristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 07:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 06:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 06:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

We explore the range of accretion rates that allow a white dwarf\n(WD) to secularly grow in mass, and derive limits on the accretion rate and on\nthe initial mass that will allow it to reach $1.4M_\\odot$ --- the Chandrasekhar\nmass. We follow the evolution through a long series of hydrogen flashes, during\nwhich a thick helium shell accumulates. This determines the effective helium\nmass accretion rate for long-term, self-consistent evolutionary runs with\nhelium flashes. We find that net mass accumulation always occurs despite helium\nflashes. Although the amount of mass lost during the first few helium shell\nflashes is a significant fraction of that accumulated prior to the flash, that\nfraction decreases with repeated helium shell flashes. Eventually no mass is\nejected at all during subsequent flashes. This unexpected result occurs because\nof continual heating of the WD interior by the helium shell flashes near its\nsurface. The effect of heating is to lower the electron degeneracy throughout\nthe WD, and especially in the outer layers. This key result yields helium\nburning that is quasi-steady state, instead of explosive.

Current solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation models describe\nthe effects of interplanetary plasma turbulence on SEPs as diffusion, using a\nFokker-Planck (FP) equation. However, FP models cannot explain the observed\nfast access of SEPs across the average magnetic field to regions that are\nwidely separated in longitude within the heliosphere without using\nunrealistically strong cross-field diffusion.\n  Aims. We study whether the recently suggested early non-diffusive phase of\nSEP propagation can explain the wide SEP events with realistic particle\ntransport parameters.\n  Methods. We used a novel model that accounts for the SEP propagation along\nfield lines that meander as a result of plasma turbulence. Such a non-diffusive\npropagation mode has been shown to dominate the SEP cross-field propagation\nearly in the SEP event history. We compare the new model to the traditional\napproach, and to SEP observations.\n  Results. Using the new model, we reproduce the observed longitudinal extent\nof SEP peak fluxes that are characterised by a Gaussian profile with\n$\\sigma=30-50^\\circ$, while current diffusion theory can only explain extents\nof 11$^\\circ$ with realistic diffusion coefficients. Our model also reproduces\nthe timing of SEP arrival at distant longitudes, which cannot be explained\nusing the diffusion model.\n  Conclusions. The early onset of SEPs over a wide range of longitudes can be\nunderstood as a result of the effects of magnetic field-line random walk in the\ninterplanetary medium and requires an SEP transport model that properly\ndescribes the non-diffusive early phase of SEP cross-field propagation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 10:03:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 13:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

The origin of these tidal features is discussed,\neither coming from a satellite infall or caused by residuals of an ancient,\ngas-rich major merger. By modelling the formation of the peculiar features\nobserved in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET -2\nwith implemented gas cooling, star formation, and feedback, we have modelled\nthe overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major\nmerger occurring 2.7-4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy\nproperties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp,\nboxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 mum luminosity distribution. High gas\nfractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and\nthick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed. A major merger is able\nto reproduce the overall NGC 4013 system, including the warp strength, the red\ncolour and the high stellar mass density of the loop, while a minor merger\nmodel cannot. Because the gas-rich model suffices to create a pseudo-bulge with\na small fraction of the light, NGC 4013 is perhaps the archetype of a late-type\ngalaxy formed by a relatively recent merger. Then late type, pseudo-bulge\nspirals are not mandatorily made through secular evolution, and the NGC 4013\nproperties also illustrate that strong warps in isolated galaxies may well\noccur at a late phase of a gas-rich major merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 11:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

A major component of\npersonalized medicine is the estimation of individualized treatment rules\n(ITRs). Recently, Zhao et al. (2012) proposed outcome weighted learning (OWL)\nto construct ITRs that directly optimize the clinical outcome. Although OWL\nopens the door to introducing machine learning techniques to optimal treatment\nregimes, it still has some problems in performance. In this article, we propose\na general framework, called Residual Weighted Learning (RWL), to improve finite\nsample performance. Unlike OWL which weights misclassification errors by\nclinical outcomes, RWL weights these errors by residuals of the outcome from a\nregression fit on clinical covariates excluding treatment assignment. We\nutilize the smoothed ramp loss function in RWL, and provide a difference of\nconvex (d.c.) algorithm to solve the corresponding non-convex optimization\nproblem. By estimating residuals with linear models or generalized linear\nmodels, RWL can effectively deal with different types of outcomes, such as\ncontinuous, binary and count outcomes. We also propose variable selection\nmethods for linear and nonlinear rules, respectively, to further improve the\nperformance. We show that the resulting estimator of the treatment rule is\nconsistent. We further obtain a rate of convergence for the difference between\nthe expected outcome using the estimated ITR and that of the optimal treatment\nrule. The performance of the proposed RWL methods is illustrated in simulation\nstudies and in an analysis of cystic fibrosis clinical trial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 11:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

Sensitivity to initial states in quantum systems, stemming\nfrom such non-linear dynamics, is a promising perspective for applications.\nHere we demonstrate that chaotic behaviour is a rather generic feature in state\nselective protocols: exponential sensitivity can exist for all initial states\nin an experimentally realisable optical scheme. Moreover, any complex rational\npolynomial map, including the example of the Mandelbrot set, can be directly\nrealised. In state selective protocols, one needs an ensemble of initial\nstates, the size of which decreases with each iteration. We prove that\nexponential sensitivity to initial states in any quantum system have to be\nrelated to downsizing the initial ensemble also exponentially. Our results show\nthat magnifying initial differences of quantum states (a Schr\\\"odinger\nmicroscope) is possible, however, there is a strict bound on the number of\ncopies needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 12:16:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

The maximum splitting is seen when the polarization axis is chosen\nalong and perpendicular to the [110] crystallographic direction.

It is nontrivial that Ostrogradsky's scalar\nghosts are absent in these fully nonlinear theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 15:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 15:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2018 08:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Further analysis\nthrough flow visualization indicates that the follower saves energy when the\nphase difference corresponds to the situation that the follower flaps in the\nsame direction of the flow field induced by the vortex dipole shedding by the\nleader.

The maps constructed by\nthis method, are related to the symplectic Cayley's transformation and belong\nto a continuous space of dimension n(2n+1). Applying the implicit map to the\ndiscrete Hamilton equations we obtain the generalized symplectic Euler scheme.\nWe show the relations of the elements of this family with other discrete\nsymplectic mapping, in particular 1) with the mappings obtained by generating\nfunctions of type I, II, and III and IV; 2) with the symplectic Euler methods A\nand B; and 3) with the mid-point rule.
