Though on average smaller than the heating\nrates due to cosmic rays and the photoelectric effect on dust grains, the\nturbulent cascade can channel large amounts of energy into a relatively small\nfraction of the gas that consequently undergoes significant heating and\nchemical enrichment. In particular, this mechanism has been proposed as a\nsolution to the long-standing problem of the high abundance of CH+ along\ndiffuse molecular sight lines, which steady-state, low temperature models\nunder-produce by over an order of magnitude. While much work has been done on\nthe structure and chemistry of these small-scale dissipation zones,\ncomparatively little attention has been paid to relating these zones to the\nproperties of the large-scale turbulence. In this paper, we attempt to bridge\nthis gap by estimating the temperature and CH+ column density along diffuse\nmolecular sight-lines by post-processing 3-dimensional MHD turbulence\nsimulations. Assuming reasonable values for the cloud density (30 / cm^3), size\n(20 pc), and velocity dispersion (2.3 km / s), we find that our computed\nabundances compare well with CH+ column density observations, as well as with\nobservations of emission lines from rotationally excited H2 molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 18:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

Recently, it has been suggested that the smallest and fastest\n(Type II) spicules are identical to intermittent jets observed by the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph. These jets appear to expand out along open\nmagnetic field lines rooted in unipolar network regions of coronal holes. In\nthis paper we revisit a thirty-year-old idea that spicules may be caused by\nupward forces associated with Alfven waves. These forces involve the conversion\nof transverse Alfven waves into compressive acoustic-like waves that steepen\ninto shocks. The repeated buffeting due to upward shock propagation causes\nnonthermal expansion of the chromosphere and a transient levitation of the\ntransition region. Some older models of wave-driven spicules assumed sinusoidal\nwave inputs, but the solar atmosphere is highly turbulent and stochastic. Thus,\nwe model this process using the output of a time-dependent simulation of\nreduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting mode-converted\ncompressive waves are strongly variable in time, with a higher transition\nregion occurring when the amplitudes are large and a lower transition region\nwhen the amplitudes are small. In this picture, the transition region bobs up\nand down by several Mm on timescales less than a minute. These motions produce\nnarrow, intermittent extensions of the chromosphere that have similar\nproperties as the observed jets and Type II spicules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 18:43:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The quasi-potential, and its characterization through a\nvariational problem, lies at the core of the Freidlin-Wentzell large deviations\ntheory%.~\\cite{freidlin1984}.In many interacting particle systems, the particle\ndensity is described by fluctuating hydrodynamics governed by Macroscopic\nFluctuation Theory%, ~\\cite{bertini2014},which formally fits within\nFreidlin-Wentzell's framework with a weak noise proportional to $1/\\sqrt{N}$,\nwhere $N$ is the number of particles. The quasi-potential then appears as a\nnatural generalization of the equilibrium free energy to non-equilibrium\nparticle systems. A key physical and practical issue is to actually compute\nquasi-potentials from their variational characterization for non-equilibrium\nsystems for which detailed balance does not hold.

In this\npaper, we address the more refined question of how many vertices that will be\nmisclassified on average. We consider the binary form of the stochastic block\nmodel, where $n$ vertices are partitioned into two clusters with edge\nprobability $a/n$ within the first cluster, $c/n$ within the second cluster,\nand $b/n$ across clusters. Suppose that as $n \\to \\infty$, $a= b+ \\mu \\sqrt{ b}\n$, $c=b+ \\nu \\sqrt{ b} $ for two fixed constants $\\mu, \\nu$, and $b \\to \\infty$\nwith $b=n^{o(1)}$.

Depending on the context, locality is embodied in the conditions of\nseparability, local causality, factorizability, relativistic causality, and\nnon-contextuality. We show that separability, characterized by the constraint\nof zero covariance, is equivalent to local causality which leads to\nfactorizability through the measurement process. Factorizability is the\nconjunction of parameter independence and outcome independence. It is commonly\nbelieved that relativistic causality is equivalent to parameter independence,\nwhich is satisfied by quantum mechanics. According to our approach, however,\nthis is unjustified due to the second step analysis of EPRB experiment,\nincluding the measurement on the first particle. We define non-contextuality\nbased on preparation procedure and measurement process. Preparation-based\nnon-contextuality is an independent assumption, but non-locality within the\nframework of a separable model can be interpreted as measurement-based\ncontextuality. Finally, we show that any fundamental theory consistent with\nquantum mechanics, should refute outcome independence in its framework of\ndescription.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 19:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

Our theory is based on the tensile blob picture of Pincus in which the\nfront of the tensile force propagates through the backbone of the polymer, as\nsuggested by Sakaue and recently applied to study a completely flexible polymer\nwith self-avoidance, by Dubbledam et al. For a semi-flexible polymer with a\npersistence length P , its statistics is self-avoiding for a very long chain.\nAs the local force increases, the blob size starts to decrease. At the blob\nsize P/a^2 , where a is the size of a monomer, the statistics becomes that of\nan ideal chain. As the blob size further decreases to below the persistence\nlength P, the statistics is that of a rigid rod. We argue that semi-flexible\npolymer in translocation should include the three regions: a self-avoiding\nregion, an ideal chain region and a rigid rod region, under uneven tension\npropagation, instead of a uniform scaling picture as in the case of a\ncompletely flexible polymer. In various regimes under the effect of weak,\nintermediate and strong driving forces we derive equations from which we can\ncalculate the translocation time of the polymer. The translocation exponent is\ngiven by \\alpha=1+\\mu, where \\mu is an effective exponent for the end-to-end\ndistance of the semi-flexible polymer, having a value between 1/2 and 3/5,\ndepending on the total contour length of the polymer.

To facilitate this investigation we use the recently\ndeveloped MCMC based EoR analysis tool 21CMMC (Greig & Mesinger).

Here we present an analysis of the problem based on the\nself-organizing map, a method of mapping the distribution of data in a\nhigh-dimensional space and projecting it onto a lower-dimensional\nrepresentation. We apply this method to existing photometric data from the\nCOSMOS survey selected to approximate the anticipated Euclid weak lensing\nsample, enabling us to robustly map the empirical distribution of galaxies in\nthe multidimensional color space defined by the expected Euclid filters.\nMapping this multicolor distribution lets us determine where - in galaxy color\nspace - redshifts from current spectroscopic surveys exist and where they are\nsystematically missing. Crucially, the method lets us determine whether a\nspectroscopic training sample is representative of the full photometric space\noccupied by the galaxies in a survey. We explore optimal sampling techniques\nand estimate the additional spectroscopy needed to map out the color-redshift\nrelation, finding that sampling the galaxy distribution in color space in a\nsystematic way can efficiently meet the calibration requirements.

The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc.

In manipulator and legged robots, it can form the basis of an\neffective nonlinear control strategy by providing a robot with both accurate\npositional tracking and active compliance. In biomechanics applications,\ninverse dynamics control can approximately determine the net torques applied at\nanatomical joints that correspond to an observed motion.\n  In the context of robot control, using inverse dynamics requires knowledge of\nall contact forces acting on the robot; accurately perceiving external forces\napplied to the robot requires filtering and thus significant time delay. An\nalternative approach has been suggested in recent literature: predicting\ncontact and actuator forces simultaneously under the assumptions of rigid body\ndynamics, rigid contact, and friction. Existing such inverse dynamics\napproaches have used approximations to the contact models, which permits use of\nfast numerical linear algebra algorithms.

In this process, vortices contained in the vortex\nstate domain are trapped by pinning centers distributing in the material. A\nnumber of trapped fluxes can be evaluated by using the analogy with the\nbeam-target collision event, where beams and a target correspond to pinning\ncenters and the vortex state domain, respectively.

The basis functions here are taken to be the\nlocalized B-splines for the two finite non-periodic dimensions and the plane\nwaves for the third periodic direction. This approach will significantly reduce\nthe number of the basis and therefore is computationally efficient for the\ndiagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. For 1D systems, B-spline\npolynomials are particularly useful and efficient in two-dimensional spatial\nintegrations involved in the calculations because of their absolute\nlocalization. Moreover, B-splines are not associated with atomic positions when\nthe geometry structure is optimized, making the geometry optimization easy to\nimplement. With such a basis set we can directly calculate the total energy of\nthe isolated system instead of using the conventional supercell model with\nartificial vacuum regions among the replicas along the two non-periodic\ndirections. The spurious Coulomb interaction between the charged defect and its\nrepeated images by the supercell approach for charged systems can also be\navoided. A rigorous formalism for the long-range Coulomb potential of both\nneutral and charged 1D systems under the mixed basis scheme will be derived. To\ntest the present method, we apply it to study the infinite carbon-dimmer chain,\ngraphene nanoribbon, carbon nanotube and positively-charged carbon-dimmer\nchain.

A tropical complex\n$\\Gamma$ is a $\\Delta$-complex equipped with certain algebraic data. Divisors\nin a tropical complex are formal linear combinations of ridges, and\npiecewise-linear functions on a tropical complex give rise in a natural way to\ndivisors. Divisors that arise from PL-functions are called principal, and\ndivisors that are locally principal are called Cartier. Two divisors that\ndiffer by a principal divisor are said to be linearly equivalent. The linear\nequivalence classes of Cartier divisors on a tropical complex $\\Gamma$ form a\ngroup called the Picard group of $\\Gamma$, by analogy to the definition of the\nPicard group of a variety in algebraic geometry.\n  Every graph has a unique tropical complex structure. If $G$ and $H$ are\ngraphs, and $\\Gamma$ is a triangulation of their product, then $\\Gamma$ has a\nweak tropical complex structure that is compatible with the tropical complex\nstructures on $G$ and $H$. Thus, divisors on $\\Gamma$ can be thought of as\nstates in a higher-dimensional chip-firing game on $\\Gamma$. Cartwright\nconjectured that the Picard groups of $\\Gamma$, $G$, and $H$ were closely\nrelated. Let $Pic(\\Gamma)$ be the tropical Picard group of $\\Gamma$, and\n$Pic(G)$ and $Pic(H)$ be the tropical Picard groups of $G$ and $H$. Then, it\nwas conjectured that there is a map $\\gamma: Pic(G) \\times Pic(H) \\to\nPic(\\Gamma)$ that is always injective and is surjective if at least one of $G$\nor $H$ is a tree.\n  In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In preparation, we discuss some basic\nproperties of tropical complexes, along with some properties specific to the\nproduct-of-graphs case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 03:14:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 21:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 19:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

One potential origin for the crossover behavior is a\nliquid-to-liquid phase transition (LLPT). Although a LLPT is thought to exist\nin all forms of liquids, structural evidence for this, particularly in\nsupercooled liquids, is scarce, elusive, and in many cases controversial. A key\nchallenge to the search for a LLPT in a supercooled liquid is the interference\nof crystallization during cooling. Crystallization induces major structural\nchanges, which can overwhelm and therefore mask the more subtle changes\nassociated with a LLPT. Here, we report the results of an in-situ containerless\nsynchrotron study of a metallic-glass-forming liquid (Zr57Nb5Al10Cu15.4Ni12.6)\nthat show distinct changes in the liquid structure at ~1000 K, a temperature\nwell below the melting temperature of the liquid and 150 K above the\ncrystallization temperature. The structural transition is characterized by\ngrowing short- and extended-range order below the transition temperature, and\nis accompanied by a concurrent change in density. These data provide strong\nevidence for a LLPT in the supercooled metallic liquid, particularly in the\nlight of a recent computer simulation study.

Specifically, the phases of the QAM modulated data symbols\nare manipulated before transmission in order to make them more immune to the\nrandom rotational effects of phase noise. At the receiver, a two-stage detector\nis implemented, which first detects the amplitude of the transmitted symbols\nfrom a nonlinear combination of the received signal amplitudes. Then in the\nsecond stage, the detector performs phase detection. The studied signaling\nmethod does not require transmission of any known symbols that act as pilots.\nFurthermore, no phase noise estimator (or a tracker) is needed at the receiver\nto compensate the effect of phase noise.

Weather and climate\nmodels with parametrized convection produce large errors in rainfall in\ntropical coastal regions, most commonly underestimating rainfall over land and\noverestimating it over the ocean. Building on an algorithm to objectively\nidentify rainfall that is associated with land-sea interaction we investigate\nwhether the relationship between rainfall in coastal regions and the\nlarge-scale atmosphere differs from that over the open ocean or over inland\nareas.

As superpositions are unnecessary before and after each such gate\n(inputs and outputs are bits), the dephasing time only needs to exceed a single\ngate operation time, while fault tolerance should be achieved with low\noverhead, by classical coding.

These systems share\ncommon features originating from their intrinsically out-of-equilibrium nature.\nIt remains elusive how energy dissipation affects the state selection in such\nnon-equilibrium states. As a simple model system, we consider a non-equilibrium\nstationary state maintained by continuous energy input, relevant to industrial\nprocessing of granular materials by vibration and/or flow. More specifically,\nwe experimentally study roles of dissipation in self-organization of a driven\ngranular particle monolayer. We find that the introduction of strong\ninelasticity entirely changes the nature of the liquid-solid transition from\ntwo-step (nearly) continuous transitions (liquid-hexatic-solid) to a strongly\ndiscontinuous first-order-like one (liquid-solid), where the two phases with\ndifferent effective temperatures can coexist, unlike thermal systems, under a\nbalance between energy input and dissipation. Our finding indicates a pivotal\nrole of energy dissipation and suggests a novel principle in the\nself-organization of systems far from equilibrium. A similar principle may\napply to active matter, which is another important class of out-of-equilibrium\nsystems. On noting that interaction forces in active matter, and particularly\nin living systems, are often non-conservative and dissipative, our finding may\nalso shed new light on the state selection in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 09:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

In two-dimensional systems, the precession frequency renormalization for\na single electron spin with defined wave vector shows logarithmic divergences\nsimilar to those also known from the Kondo problem in metals.

The analysis of\nDWS data requires knowledge of the path length distribution of photons\ntraveling through the sample. While for flat sample cells this path length\ndistribution can be readily expressed in analytical form, no such expression is\navailable for cylindrical sample cells. DWS measurements have therefore\ntypically relied on dedicated setups that use flat sample cells. Here we show\nhow DWS measurements, in particular DWS-based microrheology measurements, can\nbe performed in standard dynamic light scattering setups that use cylindrical\nsample cells. To do so we perform simple random walk simulations which yield\nnumerical predictions of the path length distribution as a function of both the\ntransport mean free path and the detection angle. This information is used in\nexperiments to extract the mean-square displacement of tracer particles in the\nmaterial, as well as the resulting frequency-dependent viscoelastic response.\nAn important advantage of our approach is that by measuring at different\ndetection angles, the average photon path length can be varied. Using a single\nsample cell, this gives access to a wider range of length and time scales than\nobtained in a conventional DWS setup. Such angle-dependent measurements also\noffer an important consistency check, as for all detection angles the DWS\nanalysis should yield the same tracer dynamics, even though the respective path\nlength distributions are very different. We validate our approach by performing\nmeasurements both on aqueous suspensions of tracer particles and on solid-like\ngelatin samples, for which we find our DWS-based microrheology data to be in\nexcellent agreement with rheological measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 10:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2016 23:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

The transient dynamics is marked out\nby one or two well separated characteristic times, depending on the considered\ncase (i.e., mono- or multi-stable). We evaluate these times for a dot\non-resonance or off-resonance. It turns out that the characteristic time scales\nare long in comparison to the period of the uncoupled oscillator, particularly\nat low bias, suggesting that the predicted transient dynamics may be observed\nin state-of-the-art experimental setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 12:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

For example, for the\nConstellation-X mission there is the need of realizing up to 14 identical\nmodules (12 flight modules plus two spares) which can be replicated by the same\nseries of mandrels. The Ni replication approach is derived from the method\nalready successfully used for making the Au coated soft X-ray mirrors with good\nimaging performances of the missions BeppoSAX, XMM-Newton and Swift. In the\ntechnological extension of the process to the multilayer optics fabrication, it\nwould be convenient to overcoat the external surface of mandrels (normally in\nKanigen) with a layer made of a very hard material. This would help to maintain\nthe very low roughness level requested by the application (typically less than\na couple of Angstroms for a 1 micrometer scan length with AFM) also after many\nreplications and successive cleaning of the mandrel.

On the other\nhand, to obtain large collecting area, large mirror diameters (< 350 mm) are\nnecessary. This implies that mirrors with focal lengths >10 m shall be produced\nand tested. Full-illumination tests of such mirrors are usually performed with\non- ground X-ray facilities, aimed at measuring their effective area and the\nangular resolution; however, they in general suffer from effects of the finite\ndistance of the X-ray source, e.g. a loss of effective area for double\nreflection. These effects increase with the focal length of the mirror under\ntest; hence a \"partial\" full-illumination measurement might not be fully\nrepresentative of the in-flight performances. Indeed, a pencil beam test can be\nadopted to overcome this shortcoming, because a sector at a time is exposed to\nthe X-ray flux, and the compensation of the beam divergence is achieved by\ntilting the optic.

If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion. This feature invokes fake CP-asymmetry\nlike the SM matter effect and can severely affect the leptonic CP-violation\nsearches in long-baseline experiments.

These\naugmentations satisfy the Reidemeister move relevant for the polymer with\nrespect to the rod. The topologically constrained polymer partition function is\nnow constructed using the combinatorics of allowed arc additions and their\nappropriate statistical weights. We illustrate how, for winding number 1, we\ncan formally derive expressions for lower and upper bounds on the partition\nfunction. Using the lower bound approximation we investigate a flexible polymer\nloop wound between two slits, calculating the force on the slit as well as the\naverage numbers of arc types in dependence of slit width and separation.\nResults may be extended to higher winding numbers.

These often need to\nbe benchmarked against optimal/theoretical results obtained by running\ncommercial optimization solvers. The usual way to do this is to have the\nsimulator run in a standalone mode and generate (few) snapshots, which are then\nfed to the optimization solvers. This allows one to compare the optimal and\nsuboptimal solutions in the snapshots, but does not allow to assess how the\nsystem being studied would evolve over time if the optimal solution was\nenforced every time.

The goal of\nthis tutorial is to show how to integrate a commercial solver (CPLEX) into the\nsimulation loop of the OMNeT++ environment.

One of\nthe explanations of this disagreement may be found in the treatment of the\ntransport of radiation from the solar core to the surface. As the same\nframework is used for other stars, it is important to check precisely the\nreliability of the interacting cross sections of photons with each species in\norder to ensure the energy transport for temperature T > 2 - 10$^6$ K and\ndensity $\\rho$ > 0.2 g/cm$^3$. In this paper, we propose a new technique to\nreach the domain of temperature and density found in the solar radiative\ninterior. This technique called the Double Ablation Front (DAF) is based on a\nhigh conversion of the laser energy into X-rays thanks to moderated Z material\nirradiated by laser intensity between 1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ W/cm$^2$ and 4\n$\\times$ 10$^{15}$ W/cm$^2$.

The\nprimary goal of this study is to provide quantitative evidence of the\nevolutionary linkages, with emphasis on character usage, among different period\ngenres of classical Chinese poetry. Specifically, various statistical analyses\nare performed to find and compare the patterns of character usage in the poems\nof nine period genres, including shi jing, chu ci, Han shi , Jin shi, Tang shi,\nSong shi, Yuan shi, Ming shi, and Qing shi. The result of analysis indicates\nthat each of nine period genres has unique patterns of character usage, with\nsome Chinese characters that are preferably used in the poems of a particular\nperiod genre. The analysis on the general pattern of character preference\nimplies a decreasing trend in the use of Chinese characters that rarely occur\nin modern Chinese literature along the timeline of dynastic types of classical\nChinese poetry.

We formulate the\nproblem as an optimal experimental design for Bayesian inferences of the limit\nstate (i.e., the failure boundary) and propose an efficient numerical scheme to\nsolve the resulting optimization problem. In particular, the proposed\nlimit-state inference method is capable of determining multiple sampling points\nat a time, and thus it is well suited for problems where multiple computer\nsimulations can be performed in parallel. The accuracy and performance of the\nproposed method is demonstrated by both academic and practical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 04:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The latter might\nreach much higher energies and could produce a second component in the\ngamma-ray spectrum at TeV energies. We perform follow-up observations of\nselected novae and dwarf novae in search of the second component in TeV energy\ngamma rays.

We have performed observations with the MAGIC\ntelescopes of 3 sources, a symbiotic nova YY Her, a dwarf nova ASASSN-13ax and\na classical nova V339 Del, shortly after their outbursts.

It is powered by one of the\nhighest spin-down power pulsars known (5\\% of Crab pulsar) and it has been\ncompared to the Crab Nebula due to its morphology. This object was previously\nobserved by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (Whipple, VERITAS and\nMAGIC), and upper limit of 2.4\\% Crab Unit (C.U.) at VHE. It was detected by\nFermi-LAT with a spectrum extending beyond 100 GeV. We analyzed 81 hours of 3C\n58 data taken with the MAGIC telescopes and we detected VHE gamma-ray emission\nwith a significance of 5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65\\% C.U. above 1\nTeV. We report the first significant detection of PWN 3C 58 at TeV energies.\nAccording to our results 3C 58 is the least luminous VHE gamma-ray PWN ever\ndetected at VHE and the one with the lowest flux at VHE to date. We compare our\nresults with the expectations of time-dependent models in which electrons\nup-scatter photon fields. The best representation favors a distance to the PWN\nof 2 kpc and Far Infrared (FIR) comparable to CMB photon fields. If we consider\nan unexpectedly high FIR density according to GALPROP, the data can also be\nreproduced by models assuming a 3.2 kpc distance. A low magnetic field, far\nfrom equipartition, is required to explain the VHE data. Hadronic contribution\nfrom the hosting supernova remnant (SNR) requires an unrealistic energy budget\ngiven the density of the medium, disfavoring cosmic ray acceleration in the SNR\nas origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 07:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}
