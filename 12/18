The field origin is an extension of the gauge freedom for basis\nchoice in gauge theories to the underlying scalar field. The extension is based\non the idea that the value of a number at one space time point does not\ndetermine the value at another point. This, combined with the description of\nmathematical systems as structures of different types, results in the presence\nof separate number fields and vector spaces, both as structures, at different\nspace time locations. Complex number structures and vector spaces at each\nlocation, are scaled by a complex space time dependent scaling factor. The\neffect of this scaling factor on several physical and geometric quantities has\nbeen described in other work. Here the emphasis is on quantum mechanics of one\nand two particles, their states and properties. Multiparticle states are also\nbriefly described. The effect shows as a complex, nonunitary, scalar field\nconnection on a fiber bundle description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\nThe lack of physical evidence for the presence of this field so far means that\nthe coupling constant of this field to fermions is very small. It also means\nthat the gradient of the field must be very small in a local region of\ncosmological space and time. Outside this region there are no restrictions on\nthe field gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 16:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

The rule groups are decided on the basis of selective\ngrouping of rules by virtue of anuvrtti. The grouping of rules results in an\ninheritance network of rules which is a directed acyclic graph. Every rule\ngroup has a head rule and the head rule notifies all the direct member rules of\nthe group about the environment which contains all the details about data\nentities, participating in the derivation process.

Instead, we examine whether such fields could remain in\nthe interior of a low mass object for a significant time, and whether they\nwould have any other obvious signatures. First, we estimate timescales for the\nloss of strong fields by magnetic buoyancy instabilities. We consider a range\nof field strengths and simple morphologies, including both idealized flux tubes\nand smooth layers of field. We confirm some of our analytical estimates using\nthin flux tube magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the rise of buoyant\nfields in a fully-convective M-dwarf. Separately, we consider the Ohmic\ndissipation of such fields. We find that dissipation provides a complementary\nconstraint to buoyancy: while small-scale, fibril fields might be regenerated\nfaster than they rise, the dissipative heating associated with such fields\nwould in some cases greatly exceed the luminosity of the star. We show how\nthese constraints combine to yield limits on the internal field strength and\nmorphology in low-mass stars. In particular, we find that for stars of 0.3\nsolar masses, no fields in flux tubes stronger than about 800 kG are\nsimultaneously consistent with both constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 17:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

We start with an\nanalytical study of a general two-planet system, showing that a planet on an\nelliptical orbit transfers all of its eccentricity to an initially circular\nplanet if the two planets have comparable orbital angular momenta. Application\nto the single Super-Earth system HD38858 shows that an additional hypothetical\nplanet below current radial velocity (RV) constraints with\n{\\textit{Msini}}=3-10M$_\\oplus$, semi-major axis 1-10au and eccentricity\n0.2-0.8 is unlikely to be present from the eccentricity that would be excited\nin the known planet (albeit cyclically). However, additional planets in\nproximity to the known planet could stabilise the system against secular\nperturbations from outer planets. Moreover these additional planets can have an\n{\\textit{Msini}} below RV sensitivity and still affect their neighbours. For\nexample, application to the two Super-Earth system 61Vir shows that an\nadditional hypothetical planet cannot excite high eccentricities in the known\nplanets, unless its mass and orbit lie in a restricted area of parameter space.\nInner planets in HD38858 below RV sensitivity would also modify conclusions\nabove about excluded parameter space. This suggests that it may be possible to\ninfer the presence of additional stabilising planets in systems with an\neccentric outer planet and an inner planet on an otherwise suspiciously\ncircular orbit.

However, recently, a regime of\n$C_{4}$-symmetric magnetic order has been reported in certain hole-doped\niron-based superconductors. This novel magnetic ground state can be understood\nas a double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ spin density wave characterized by two order\nparameters $\\mathbf{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{M}_{2}$ related to each of the two\n$\\mathbf{Q}$ vectors. Depending on the relative orientations of the order\nparameters, either a noncollinear spin-vortex crystal or a nonuniform\ncharge-spin density wave could form. Experimentally, M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy,\nneutron scattering, and muon spin rotation established the latter as the\nmagnetic configuration of some of these optimally hole-doped iron-based\nsuperconductors. Theoretically, low-energy itinerant models do support a\ntransition from single-$\\mathbf{Q}$ to double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic order, but\nwith nearly-degenerate spin-vortex crystal and charge-spin density wave states.\nIn fact, extensions of these low-energy models including additional electronic\ninteractions tip the balance in favor of the spin-vortex crystal, in apparent\ncontradiction with the recent experimental findings. In this paper, we revisit\nthe phase diagram of magnetic ground states of low-energy multi-band models in\nthe presence of weak disorder. We show that impurity scattering not only\npromotes the transition from $C_{2}$ to $C_{4}$-magnetic order, but it also\nfavors the charge-spin density wave over the spin-vortex crystal phase.\nAdditionally, in the single-$\\mathbf{Q}$ phase, our analysis of the nematic\ncoupling constant in the presence of disorder supports the experimental finding\nthat the splitting between the structural and stripe-magnetic transition is\nenhanced by disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 20:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

If pair\nproduced it forms a quirky bound state, which promptly annihilates into gluons,\nphotons, v-gluons and possibly SM fermions. This is an extremely minimal model\nto explain the excess, but is already in some tension with existing displaced\nsearches, as well as dilepton and dijet resonance bounds. We therefore propose\na hybrid Quirk-Scalar model, in which the fermion of the simple $\\phi \\bar X X$\ntoy model is charged under the additional $SU(3)_v$ confining gauge group.\nConstraints on the new heavy fermion $X$ are then significantly relaxed. The\nmain additional signals of this model are possible dilepton, dijet and diphoton\nresonances at $\\sim$ 2 TeV or more from quirk annihilation, and the production\nof v-glueballs through quirk annihilation and $\\phi$ decay. The glueballs can\ngive rise to spectacular signatures, including displaced vertices and events\nwith leptons, photons and $Z$-bosons.

This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and\nphonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental\nquestion on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article\nreviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing\ncomprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and\nelucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the\nelectron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an\nunconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A\ndriving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions,\ncharacterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction\nand a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a\nsubtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and\nHund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction\nleads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules,\nwhich enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially\nrelies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits\nfrom the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic\nenergy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in\nagreement with previous model calculations. This confirms that the alkali-doped\nfullerides are a new type of unconventional superconductors, where the unusual\nsynergy between the phonons and Coulomb interactions drives the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 20:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 14:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

Multi-dimensional\nrepresentations of the extended point group are associated with degenerate wave\nvectors. Electronic properties such as (nodal) band degeneracies and\ntopological character can be straightforwardly addressed, and often follow\ndirectly.

In this paper, we aim\nto improve its computational efficiency by reducing the number of coordinate\ndescent iterations.

Such effect algebras are algebraic models of\nquantitative logic, in which double negation holds. Effects in quantum theory\nand fuzzy predicates in probability theory form examples of effect algebras.\n  This text is an account of the basics of effectus theory. It includes the\nfundamental duality between states and effects, with the associated Born rule\nfor validity of an effect (predicate) in a particular state. A basic result\nsays that effectuses can be described equivalently in both `total' and\n`partial' form. So-called `commutative' and `Boolean' effectuses are\ndistinguished, for probabilistic and classical models. It is shown how these\nBoolean effectuses are essentially extensive categories.

To encourage users to select good passwords, enterprises\noften enforce policies. Such policies have been proven to be ineffectual in\npractice. Accurate assessment of a password's resistance to cracking attacks is\nstill an unsolved problem, and our work addresses this challenge. Although the\nbest way to determine how difficult it may be to crack a user-selected password\nis to check its resistance to cracking attacks employed by attackers in the\nwild, implementing such a strategy at an enterprise would be infeasible in\npractice. We first formalize the concepts of password complexity and strength\nwith concrete definitions emphasizing their differences. Our framework captures\nhuman biases and many known techniques attackers use to recover stolen\ncredentials in real life, such as brute-force attacks. Building on our\ndefinitions, we develop a general framework for calculating password complexity\nand strength that could be used in practice. Our approach is based on the key\ninsight that an attacker's success at cracking a password must be defined by\nits available computational resources, time, function used to store that\npassword, as well as the topology that bounds that attacker's search space\nbased on that attacker's available inputs, transformations it can use to tweak\nand explore its inputs, and the path of exploration which can be based on the\nattacker's perceived probability of success. We also provide a general\nframework for assessing the accuracy of password complexity and strength\nestimators that can be used to compare other tools available in the wild.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 22:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

We show that a direct discretization of the\nSchroedinger equation by central finite differences leads to a non-symmetric\nHamiltonian matrix. Because diagonalization of such matrices is more complex it\nis advantageous to transform it in a symmetric form. This can be done by the\nLiouville-like transformation proposed by Rizea et al. (Comp. Phys. Comm. 179\n(2008) 466-478), which replaces the wave function psi(rho) with the function\nF(rho)=psi(rho)sqrt(rho) and transforms the Hamiltonian accordingly. Even\nthough a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix is produced by this procedure, the\ncomputed wave functions are found to be inaccurate near the origin, and the\naccuracy of the energy levels is not very high. In order to improve on this, we\ndevised a finite-difference scheme which discretizes the Schroedinger equation\nin the first step, and then applies the Liouville-like transformation to the\ndifference equation. Such a procedure gives a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix,\nresulting in an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the finite element\nmethod. The superior efficiency of the new finite-difference (FDM) scheme is\ndemonstrated for a few rho-dependent one-dimensional potentials which are\nusually employed to model the electron states in free-standing and core-shell\nquantum wires. The new scheme is compared with the other FDM schemes for\nsolving the effective-mass Schroedinger equation, and is found to deliver\nenergy levels with much smaller numerical error for all the analyzed\npotentials.

In each case, observations of people's past choices can inform\nour inferences about their likes and preferences. If we assume that choices are\napproximately optimal according to some utility function, we can treat\npreference inference as Bayesian inverse planning. That is, given a prior on\nutility functions and some observed choices, we invert an optimal\ndecision-making process to infer a posterior distribution on utility functions.\nHowever, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false\nbeliefs, their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally\ninconsistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other biases. We demonstrate how\nto incorporate these deviations into algorithms for preference inference by\nconstructing generative models of planning for agents who are subject to false\nbeliefs and time inconsistency. We explore the inferences these models make\nabout preferences, beliefs, and biases. We present a behavioral experiment in\nwhich human subjects perform preference inference given the same observations\nof choices as our model.

This finding can be theoretically\nexplained by a combination of radial drift and gas drag of intermediate-sized\ndust grains. Using a simple parametric model to approximate the different\ndistributions of the gas and dust components, we calculate and examine the\nimpact of radial drift on the global dust temperature structure. We find that\nthe removal of large grains beyond the \"truncation radius\" allows this region\nto become significantly warmer from reprocessed stellar radiation shining down\nfrom the disk upper layers, increasing the outer disk temperature by\n$\\sim10-30\\%$. This change is sufficient to raise the local temperature to a\nvalue exceeding the CO desorption temperature. These findings imply that the\ndisk density structures induced by radial drift are able to create multiple CO\nsnow-lines. The inner disk CO is in the gas phase, freezing out near the\nclassical snow-line at $R\\sim20-40$ AU. Moving outward, the CO sublimates once\nagain beyond the truncation radius (80 AU in our models) and subsequently\nre-freezes out at sufficiently large stellar distances, beyond\n$R\\gtrsim130-200$ AU. We find that thermal desorption of CO in the outer disk\nbecomes competitive with external UV photodesorption and that this additional\ntransition from solid state CO to the gas-phase has significant implications\nfor the C/O ratio in the outer disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 00:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

The exact complex trajectories for the Eckart potential\nbarrier and the soft potential step, plotted in a previous work, show that more\ntrajectories link the left and right regions of the barrier, when the energy is\nincreased. In this paper, we evaluate the reflection probability using a new\nansatz based on these observations, as the ratio between the total\nprobabilities of reflected and incident trajectories. While doing this, we also\nput to test the complex-extended probability density previously postulated for\nthese quantum trajectories. The new ansatz is preferred since the evaluation is\nsolely done with the help of the complex-extended probability density along the\nimaginary direction and the trajectory pattern itself. The calculations are\nperformed for a rectangular potential barrier, symmetric Eckart and Morse\nbarriers, and a soft potential step. The predictions are in perfect agreement\nwith the standard results for potentials such as the rectangular potential\nbarrier. For the other potentials, there is very good agreement with standard\nresults, but it is exact only for low and high energies. For moderate energies,\nthere are slight deviations. These deviations result from the periodicity of\nthe trajectory pattern along the imaginary axis and have a maximum value only\nas much as $0.1 \\%$ of the standard value. Measurement of such deviation shall\nprovide an opportunity to falsify the ansatz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 05:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

The social cost of a candidate is the sum of its distances to\neach voter. Some of our work assumes that these points can be modeled on a real\nline, but other results of ours are more general.\n  A question closely related to candidate selection is that of minimizing the\nsum of distances for facility location. The difference is that in our setting\nthere is a fixed set of candidates, whereas the large body of work on facility\nlocation seems to consider every point in the metric space to be a possible\ncandidate. This gives rise to three types of mechanisms which differ in the\ngranularity of their input space (voting, ranking and location mechanisms). We\nstudy the relationships between these three classes of mechanisms.\n  While it may seem that Black's 1948 median algorithm is optimal for candidate\nselection on the line, this is not the case. We give matching upper and lower\nbounds for a variety of settings. In particular, when candidates and voters are\non the line, our universally truthful spike mechanism gives a [tight]\napproximation of two. When assessing candidate selection mechanisms, we seek\nseveral desirable properties: (a) efficiency (minimizing the social cost) (b)\ntruthfulness (dominant strategy incentive compatibility) and (c) simplicity (a\nsmaller input space). We quantify the effect that truthfulness and simplicity\nimpose on the efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 07:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

Three different scenarios are investigated: the\nO-helium scenario, milli- interacting dark matter and dark anti-atoms. In each\nof them, dark matter interacts sufficiently strongly with terrestrial matter to\nbe stopped in it before reaching underground detectors. As they drift towards\nthe center of the earth by gravity, these thermal dark atoms are radiatively\ncaptured by the atoms of the active medium of underground detectors, which\ncauses the emission of photons that produce the signals through their\ninteractions with the electrons of the medium. This provides a way of\nreinterpreting the results in terms of electron recoils instead of nuclear\nrecoils. The detailed study of the interactions of O-helium with ordinary\nmatter shows that it is not an acceptable candidate for dark matter because of\nthe absence of a repulsion mechanism preventing it from falling into the deep\nnuclear wells of nuclei.

This hot dust may have escaped our\ndetection limits. Follow-up, more sensitive millimeter observations are needed\nto improve our understanding of the triggering mechanisms of EXor type\noutbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 11:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In particular, several specific examples of\nthe perfect ORKHSs are presented. We apply the theory of ORKHSs to sampling and\nregularized learning, where operator-valued data are considered. Specifically,\na general complete reconstruction formula from linear operators values is\nestablished in the framework of ORKHSs.

For\nthe global dynamics, we start from a two-stage time-stepping scheme, expressing\nthe fact that in most real materials plastic flow is much slower than elastic\ndeformations, and then perform a detailed analysis of the slow-loading limit\npassage. In this limit, a rate-independent evolution can be expected, but this\nbrings with it the possibility of jumps (relative to the \"slow\" time).\nTraditionally, the dynamics on the jump transients often remain unspecified,\nwhich leads to ambiguity and deficiencies in the energy balance. In order to\nremedy this, the present approach precisely describes the energetics on the\njump transients as the limit of the rate-dependent evolutions at \"singular\npoints\". It turns out that rate-dependent behavior may (but does not have to)\nprevail on the jump transients.

In particular, Blasiak \\emph{et al.} defined combinatorial objects\nallowing to interpret the number of $S_{\\bf{r,s}}(k)$ appearing in the identity\n$(a^\\dag)^{r_n}a^{s_n}\\cdots(a^\\dag)^{r_1}a^{s_1}=(a^\\dag)^\\alpha\\displaystyle\\sum\nS_{\\bf{r,s}}(k)(a^\\dag)^k a^k$, where $\\alpha$ is assumed to be non-negative.\nThese objects are used to define a combinatorial Hopf algebra which specializes\nto the enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra. Here, we propose a new\nvariant of this construction which admits a realization with variables. This\nmeans that we construct our algebra from a free algebra $\\mathbb{C}\\langle A\n\\rangle$ using quotient and shifted product. The combinatorial objects\n(B-diagrams) are slightly different from those proposed by Blasiak \\emph{et\nal.}, but give also a combinatorial interpretation of the generalized Stirling\nnumbers together with a combinatorial Hopf algebra related to Heisenberg Lie\nalgebra. The main difference comes from the fact that the B-diagrams have the\nsame number of inputs and outputs. After studying the combinatorics and the\nenumeration of B-diagrams, we propose two constructions of algebras called\nFusion algebra $\\mathcal{F}$, defined using formal variable and another algebra\n$\\mathcal{B}$ constructed directly from the B-diagrams. We show the connection\nbetween these two algebras and that $\\mathcal{B}$ can be endowed with a Hopf\nstructure. We recognize two already known combinatorial Hopf subalgebras of\n$\\mathcal{B}$ : $\\mathrm{WSym}$ the algebra of word symmetric functions indexed\nby set partitions and $\\mathrm{BWSym}$ the algebra of biword symmetric\nfunctions indexed by set partitions into lists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 13:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 15:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

Although popular in practice, prior to this work the\nfuzzy $K$-means problem has not been studied from a complexity theoretic or\nalgorithmic perspective. We show that optimal solutions for fuzzy $K$-means\ncannot, in general, be expressed by radicals over the input points.\nSurprisingly, this already holds for very simple inputs in one-dimensional\nspace. Hence, one cannot expect to compute optimal solutions exactly. We give\nthe first $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for the fuzzy $K$-means\nproblem. First, we present a deterministic approximation algorithm whose\nruntime is polynomial in $N$ and linear in the dimension $D$ of the input set,\ngiven that $K$ is constant, i.e. a polynomial time approximation algorithm\ngiven a fixed $K$. We achieve this result by showing that for each soft\nclustering there exists a hard clustering with comparable properties. Second,\nby using techniques known from coreset constructions for the $K$-means problem,\nwe develop a deterministic approximation algorithm that runs in time almost\nlinear in $N$ but exponential in the dimension $D$. We complement these results\nwith a randomized algorithm which imposes some natural restrictions on the\ninput set and whose runtime is comparable to some of the most efficient\napproximation algorithms for $K$-means, i.e. linear in the number of points and\nthe dimension, but exponential in the number of clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 13:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

At temperatures below 7 K\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations with two frequencies appear in the resistivity.\nThese oscillations have non-trivial Berry phase, which is a distinguished\nfeature of Dirac fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 14:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-14"}

Preceding studies have discussed the prospects of\ncontinuous phase-locking in the linear wakefield regime.

Einstein (1915) for\n4-dimensional elasticity, both with a variational procedure introduced by C.\nLanczos (1949,1962) in order to relate potentials to Lagrange multipliers.\nUsing the methods of Algebraic Analysis, namely mixing differential geometry\nwith homological algebra and combining the double duality test involved with\nthe Spencer cohomology, we shall be able to extend these results to an\narbitrary situation with an arbitrary dimension n.

To characterize the anisotropic property of the biased\ngraphene, the resistive part of the unit circuit is replaced by a resistor in\nseries with current control voltage sources (CCVSs). The CCVSs account for the\noff-diagonal parts of the surface conductivity tensor for the magnetized\ngraphene. Furthermore, the definitions of the absorption cross section and the\nscattering cross section are revisited to make them feasible for derived\ncircuit analysis. This proposed method is benchmarked with several numerical\nexamples.

On the other hand, half of the stellar debris in\nprinciple are unbound and can stream to a great distance, but so far there is\nno clear evidence that this \"unbound debris stream\" (UDS) exists. Motivated by\nthe fact that the circum-nuclear region around SMBHs is usually filled with\ndense molecular clouds (MCs), here we investigate the observational signatures\nresulting from the collision between an UDS and a MC, which is likely to happen\nhundreds of years after a TDE. We focus on $\\gamma$-ray emission ($0.1-10^5$\nGeV), which comes from the encounter of shock-accelerated cosmic rays with\nbackground protons and, more importantly, is not subject to extinction. We show\nthat because of the high proton density inside a MC, the peak $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity, about $10^{39}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, is at least $100$ times greater\nthan that in the case without a MC (only with a smooth interstellar medium).\nThe luminosity decays on a time-scale of decades, depending on the distance of\nthe MC, and about a dozen of these \"TDE afterglows\" could be detected within a\ndistance of about $16$ Mpc by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array.

Therefore it is instructive,\nwhen dealing with the non-integrable PDEs, to combine the qualitative treatment\nwith numerical simulations. In this report we are going to present the results\nof studying compacton solutions in the continual models for granular\npre-stressed chains. The model is shown to possess a pair of compacton TW\nsolutions which are the bright and dark compactons. First we consider the\nstability properties of the compacton solutions and show that both the bright\nand the dark compactons pass the stability test.

Prior work\nhas shown that the Double Centroid Reduced Representation (DCRR) model is a\nuseful geometric representation for protein structure with respect to visual\nmodels, reducing the quantity of modeled information for each amino acid, yet\nretaining the most important geometrical and chemical features of each: the\ncentroids of the backbone and of the side-chain. DCRR has not yet been applied\nin the calculation of geometric structural similarity. Meanwhile,\nmulti-dimensional indexing (MDI) of protein structure combines protein\nstructural analysis with distance metrics to facilitate structural similarity\nqueries and is also used for clustering protein structures into related groups.\nIn this respect, the combination of geometric models with MDI has been shown to\nbe effective. Prior work, notably Distance and Density based Protein Indexing\n(DDPIn), applies MDI to protein models based on the geometry of the CA\nbackbone. DDPIn distance metrics are based on radial and density functions that\nincorporate spherical-based metrics, and the indices are built from metric tree\n(M-tree) structures. This work combines DCRR with DDPIn for the development of\nnew DCRR centroid-based metrics: spherical binning distance and inter-centroid\nspherical distance. The use of DCRR models will provide additional significant\nstructural information via the inclusion of side-chain centroids. Additionally,\nthe newly developed distance metric functions combined with DCRR and M-tree\nindexing attempt to improve upon the performance of prior work (DDPIn), given\nthe same data set, with respect to both individual k-nearest neighbor (kNN)\nsearch queries as well as clustering all proteins in the index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 07:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}
