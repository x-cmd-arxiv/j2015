More precisely $S$ is a $C$-semianalytic subset of a real analytic\nspace $(X,{\\mathcal O}_X)$ if each point of $X$ has a neighborhood $U$ such\nthat $S\\cap U$ is a finite boolean combinations of global analytic equalities\nand strict inequalities on $X$. By means of paracompactness $C$-semianalytic\nsets are the locally finite unions of finite boolean combinations of global\nanalytic equalities and strict inequalities on $X$.\n  The family of $C$-semianalytic sets is closed under the same operations as\nthe family of semianalytic sets: locally finite unions and intersections,\ncomplement, closure, interior, connected components, inverse images under\nanalytic maps, sets of points of dimension $k$, etc. although they are defined\ninvolving only global analytic functions. In addition, we characterize\nsubanalytic sets as the images under proper analytic maps of $C$-semianalytic\nsets.\n  We prove also that the image of a $C$-semianalytic set $S$ under a proper\nholomorphic map between Stein spaces is again a $C$-semianalytic set.

The framework is constructed\nusing the new concept of a 'formal narrative' which is a sequence of cognitive\nstates inferred from sense data. First we propose that human cognition uses a\nhierarchy of narratives to predict changes in the natural and social\nenvironment. Each layer in the hierarchy represents a distinct 'view of the\nworld', but it also contributes to a global unitary perspective. Second, the\ngenerative models used for cognitive inference can create new narratives from\nthose states already experienced by an individual. We hypothesise that when a\nthreat is recognised, narratives are generated as a cognitive model of possible\nthreat scenarios. Using this framework, we suggest that OCD arises from a\ndysfunction in sub-surface levels of inference while the global unitary\nperspective remains intact. The failure of inference is felt as the external\nworld being 'not just right', and its automatic correction by the perceptual\nsystem is experienced as compulsion. Ordering and symmetry obsessions are the\neffects of the perceptual system trying to achieve precise inference. Checking\nbehaviour arises because the security system attempts to finesse inference as\npart of its protection behaviour. Similarly, fear of harm and distressing\nthoughts occur because the failure of inference results in an indistinct view\nof the past or the future. A wide variety of symptoms in OCD is thus explained\nby a single dysfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 16:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

Two distinct TI phases emerge: one phase\nis due to band inversion between the Bi $p$ and Na $s$ bands, and the other\nphase (under pressure) is induced by inversion of the Bi $p$ and Ba $d$ bands.\nBoth phases exhibit Dirac-cone-type surface states, but they have opposite spin\ntextures. In the upper cone, a left-handed spin texture exists for the $s$-$p$\ninverted phase (similar to a common TI, e.g., Bi$_2$Se$_3$), whereas a\nright-handed spin texture appears for the $p$-$d$ inverted phase. NaBaBi\npresents a prototype model of a TI that exhibits different spin textures in the\nsame material. In addition, NaBaBi may exhibit the introduction of correlation\neffects to the topological state owing to the existence of $d$ states in the\nband inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 16:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

This may be either by confinement or by constriction. Closed\ncompletely bound states are labeled by two integers: the number of\noscillations, $n$, and the number of times it winds the cylinder, $p$, the\nlatter a topological invariant. We examine the behavior of these states as the\nlength of the loop is increased by evaluating the energy, the conserved axial\ntorque and the contact force. The ground state for a given $p$ is the state\nwith $n=1$; a short loop with $p=1$ is an elliptic deformation of a parallel;\nas its length increases it elongates along the cylinder axis, with two hairpin\nends. Excited states with $n\\geq2$ and $p=1$ possess $n$-fold axial symmetry.\nShort (long) loops possess energies $\\approx p E_0$ ($nE_0$), with $E_0$ the\nenergy of a circular loop with same radius as the cylinder; in long loops the\naxial torque vanishes. Confined bound excited states are initially unstable;\nhowever, above a critical length each $n$-fold state becomes stable: the folded\nhairpin cannot be unfolded. The ground state for each $p$ is also initially\nunstable with respect to deformations rotating the loop off the surface into\nthe interior. A closed planar elastic curve aligned along the cylinder axis\nmaking contact with the cylinder on its two sides is identified as the ground\nstate of a confined loop. Exterior bound states behave very differently, if\nfree to unbind, as signaled by the reversal in the sign of the contact force.\nIf $p=1$, all such states are unstable. If $p \\geq 2$, however, a topological\nobstruction to complete unbinding exists. If the loop is short, the bound state\nwith $p=2$ and $n=1$ provides a stable constriction of the cylinder, partially\nunbinding as the length is increased.

The presence of clouds on these\nexoplanets significantly alters their planetary albedo spectra. We confirm that\nnon-uniform cloud coverage on the dayside of tidally locked exoplanets will\nmanifest as changes to the magnitude and shift of the phase curve. In this\nwork, we first investigate a test case of our model using a Jupiter-like\nplanet, at temperatures consistent to 2.0 AU insolation from a solar type star,\nto consider the effect of H2O clouds. We then extend our application of the\nmodel to the exoplanet Kepler-7b and consider the effect of varying cloud\nspecies, sedimentation efficiency, particle size, and cloud altitude. We show\nthat, depending on the observational filter, the largest possible shift of the\nphase curve maximum will be 2-10 deg for a Jupiter-like planet, and up to 30\ndeg (0.08 in fractional orbital phase) for hot-Jupiter exoplanets at visible\nwavelengths as a function of dayside cloud distribution with a uniformly\naveraged thermal profile. Finally, we tailor our model for comparison with, and\nconfirmation of, the recent optical phase-curve observations of Kepler-7b with\nthe Kepler space telescope. The average planetary albedo can vary between\n0.1-0.6 for the 1300 cloud scenarios that were compared to the observations. We\nobserve that smaller particle size and increasing cloud altitude have a strong\neffect on increasing albedo. In particular, we show that a set of models where\nKepler-7b has roughly half of its dayside covered in small-particle clouds high\nin the atmosphere, made of bright minerals like MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4, provide the\nbest fits to the observed offset and magnitude of the phase-curve, whereas Fe\nclouds are found to have too dark to fit the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 17:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

While donor electron spins in\nsilicon provide extremely long coherence times and access to the nuclear spin\nvia the hyperfine interaction, quantum dots have the complementary advantages\nof fast electrical operations, tunability and scalability. Here we present an\napproach to a novel hybrid double quantum dot by coupling a donor to a\nlithographically patterned artificial atom. Using gate-based rf reflectometry,\nwe probe the charge stability of this double quantum dot system and the\nvariation of quantum capacitance at the interdot charge transition. Using\nmicrowave spectroscopy, we find a tunnel coupling of 2.7 GHz and characterise\nthe charge dynamics, which reveals a charge T2* of 200 ps and a relaxation time\nT1 of 100 ns. Additionally, we demonstrate spin blockade at the inderdot\ntransition, opening up the possibility to operate this coupled system as a\nsinglet-triplet qubit or to transfer a coherent spin state between the quantum\ndot and the donor electron and nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 18:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 10:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

These systems are notoriously\ndifficult to optimize due to the complex structure of the optimal solution and\nthe curse of dimensionality, having resisted solution for over 40 years.\nRecently, so-called Tailored Base-Surge (TBS) policies have been proposed as a\nheuristic for the dual-sourcing problem. Under such a policy, a constant order\nis placed at the regular source in each period, while the order placed at the\nexpress source follows a simple order-up-to rule. Numerical experiments by\nseveral authors have suggested that such policies perform well as the lead time\ndifference between the two sources grows large, which is exactly the setting in\nwhich the curse of dimensionality leads to the problem becoming intractable.\nHowever, providing a theoretical foundation for this phenomenon has remained a\nmajor open problem.\n  In this paper, we provide such a theoretical foundation by proving that a\nsimple TBS policy is indeed asymptotically optimal as the lead time of the\nregular source grows large, with the lead time of the express source held\nfixed. Our main proof technique combines novel convexity and lower-bounding\narguments, an explicit implementation of the vanishing discount factor approach\nto analyzing infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, and ideas from the\ntheory of random walks and queues, significantly extending the methodology and\napplicability of a novel framework for analyzing inventory models with large\nlead times recently introduced by Goldberg and co-authors in the context of\nlost-sales models with positive lead times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 19:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 21:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

For example, it has been shown that the performance of a device\ncan be significantly affected by several degrees of freedom when programming\nthe device; a common example being gauge selection. To date, no\nexperimentally-tested strategy exists to select the best programming\nspecifications. We developed a score function that can be calculated from a\nnumber of readouts much smaller than the number of readouts required to find\nthe desired solution.

The temperature in the iron core will thereby be raised, splitting up\nthe iron into smaller nuclei.

The main advantage of the proposed method is that the BS\nselection conflict problem is prevented, while selected users are guaranteed to\ncommunicate with their two closest BSs in any irregular BS topology. With the\nproposed coordination method, analytical expressions for the rate distribution\nand the ergodic spectral efficiency are derived as a function of relevant\nsystem parameters in a fixed irregular network model. In a random network model\nwith a homogeneous Poisson point process, a lower bound on the ergodic spectral\nefficiency is characterized. Through system level simulations, the performance\nof the proposed method is compared with that of conventional coordination\nmethods: dynamic clustering and static clustering.

Recent high-resolution Chandra observations\nhave shown that $\\sim 1 - 4$ kpc extended, hot galactic coronae are ubiquitous\nin group and cluster galaxies.

In the scheme\nof characterization by angular momentum, conventional charge and spin density\nwaves correspond to zero angular momentum. Here we explore a class of exotic\ndensity wave states that have topological properties observed in recently\ndiscovered topological insulators. These rich topological density wave states\ndeserve closer attention in not only high temperature superconductors but in\nother correlated electron states, as in heavy fermions, of which an explicit\nexample will be discussed.The state discussed has non-trivial charge $2e$\nskyrmionic spin texture. These skyrmions can condense into a charged\nsuperfluid. Alternately, they can fractionalize into merons and anti-merons.\nThe fractionalized particles that are confined in skyrmions in the insulating\nphase, can emerge at a deconfined quantum critical point, which separates the\ninsulating and the superconducting phases. These fractional particles form a\ntwo-component spin-singlet chiral $(d_{x^2-y^2}\\pm id_{xy})$ wave\nsuperconducting state that breaks time reversal symmetry. Possible connections\nof this exotic order to the superconducting state in the heavy-fermion material\nURu$_2$Si$_2$ are suggested. The direct evidence of such a chiral\nsuperconducting state is polar Kerr effect that was observed recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 21:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

For a planet located at a resolvable\nangular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to several\norders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography. In addition, the\nremaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion spectroscopy,\nutilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion\nspectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can in principle reach\ncontrast limits of ~1e-5 x 1e-5, although in practice this will be limited by\nphoton noise and/or sky-background.\n  Methods: We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both\nprobing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight\nreflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared\nsimulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument,\nwith the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R=100,000 IFS. We\ninclude realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric\ntransmission and emission. For the optical simulation we also assume R=100,000\nIFS with adaptive optics capabilities at the E-ELT.\n  Results: One night of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT at 4.8 um (d_lambda\n= 0.07 um) can detect a planet orbiting alpha Cen A with a radius of R=1.5\nR_earth and a twin-Earth thermal spectrum of T_eq=300 K at a signal-to-noise\n(S/N) of 5.

The presentations of the conference speakers and the reports of the\nworking groups are reviewed. Multiple themes emerged for K-16 education from\nthe perspective of the history and philosophy of science. Key ones were that:\nstudents need to understand that central to science is argumentation,\ncriticism, and analysis; students should be educated to appreciate science as\npart of our culture; students should be educated to be science literate; what\nis meant by the nature of science as discussed in much of the science education\nliterature must be broadened to accommodate a science literacy that includes\npreparation for socioscientific issues; teaching for science literacy requires\nthe development of new assessment tools; and, it is difficult to change what\nscience teachers do in their classrooms. The principal conclusions drawn by the\neditors are that: to prepare students to be citizens in a participatory\ndemocracy, science education must be embedded in a liberal arts education;\nscience teachers alone cannot be expected to prepare students to be\nscientifically literate; and, to educate students for scientific literacy will\nrequire a new curriculum that is coordinated across the humanities,\nhistory/social studies, and science classrooms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 23:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

The\nrippling morphology of graphene, discovered also in other 2D materials, has a\nprofound impact on its electronic, mechanical and chemical properties.\nActually, before the discovery of graphene, rippling phenomena are widely\nobserved: for example, the roughing transition of crystalline interface, the\nrippled phase in biomembrane, and crumpling of flexible sheet polymers modeled\nby tethered surfaces. The fascinating truth that ripples exist in so many\ndifferent membrane-like materials implies possible existence of a universal\nphysical mechanism which was unclear. We consider the ripples in suspended\ngraphene as two parts, characterizing the first part by the spontaneous\ncurvature k which stabilizes the possible soft ZA modes, and the second part by\nthe thermal curvature kt which is caused directly by height fluctuation. By\nchoosing k as the order parameter of the system, we establish the Landau theory\nmodified by thermal fluctuation for wrinkling transition of large sized\ngraphene. We find that as temperature rises from 0K, a second order phase\ntransition occurs at a size dependent critical temperature Tc, which\ncorresponds to a change of equilibrium configuration from a flat state to a\nrippling state. Interestingly, the order parameter is stablized as temperature\nincreases, and the phase transition is associated with a jump of equilibrium\nbond length as well as a vanishing intrinsic bending rigidity. The results\nobtained suggest that the interplay between the rippling morphology and the\nelementary excitations is vital for understanding the behavior of 2D materials.\nThe concepts and theory developed here is of general significance at least for\ntethered membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 00:54:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 23:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

They key steps are to find a $K$-means clustering using\n$K_\\ell$ clusters where $K_\\ell \\gg K$ and then joins these small clusters by\nusing single linkage clustering. The second stage stabilizes the result of\nstage one by reclustering via the `membership matrix' under Hamming distance to\ngenerate a dendrogram. The third stage is to cut the dendrogram to get $K^*$\nclusters where $K^* \\geq K$ and then prune back to $K$ to give a final\nclustering. A variant on our technique also gives a reasonable estimate for\n$K_T$, the true number of clusters.\n  We provide a series of arguments to justify the steps in the stages of our\nmethods and we provide numerous examples involving real and simulated data to\ncompare our technique with other related techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 01:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 22:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The interference among remote radio heads\n(RRHs) can be suppressed with centralized cooperative processing in the base\nband unit (BBU) pool, while the intertier interference between RRHs and macro\nbase stations (MBSs) is still challenging in H-CRANs. In this paper, to\nmitigate this inter-tier interference, a contract-based interference\ncoordination framework is proposed, where three scheduling schemes are\ninvolved, and the downlink transmission interval is divided into three phases\naccordingly. The core idea of the proposed framework is that the BBU pool\ncovering all RRHs is selected as the principal that would offer a contract to\nthe MBS, and the MBS as the agent decides whether to accept the contract or not\naccording to an individual rational constraint. An optimal contract design that\nmaximizes the rate-based utility is derived when perfect channel state\ninformation (CSI) is acquired at both principal and agent. Furthermore,\ncontract optimization under the situation where only the partial CSI can be\nobtained from practical channel estimation is addressed as well. Monte Carlo\nsimulations are provided to confirm the analysis, and simulation results show\nthat the proposed framework can significantly increase the transmission data\nrates over baselines, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed\ncontract-based solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 01:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The basic model\nstudied here is that of a two-level system (TLS), whose energy is periodically\nmodulated while the system is coupled to thermal baths. When the modulation\ninterval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath\ncorrelations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS,\ndepending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS\ncoupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine\n(QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the\nmodulation rate. We find their efficiency and power-output bounds and the\nconditions for attaining these bounds. An extension of this model to multilevel\nsystems shows that the QHM power output can be boosted by the multilevel\ndegeneracy.\n  These results are used to scrutinize basic thermodynamic principles: (i)\nExternally-driven/modulated QHMs may attain the Carnot efficiency bound, but\nwhen the driving is done by a quantum device (\"piston\"), the efficiency\nstrongly depends on its initial quantum state. Such dependence has been unknown\nthus far.

An 80-mm diameter Si light detector based upon these design\nprinciples, with potential use in both dark matter and neutrinoless double beta\ndecay, has an estimated baseline energy resolution of 0.35 eV, 20$\\times$\nbetter than currently achievable. A 1.75 kg ZnMoO$_{4}$ large-mass calorimeter\nwould have a 3.5 eV baseline resolution, 1000$\\times$ better than currently\nachieved with NTDs with an estimated position dependence $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E}$\nof 6$\\times$10$^{-4}$. Such minimal position dependence is made possible by\nforcing the sensor bandwidth to be much smaller than the signal bandwidth.\nFurther, intrinsic event timing resolution is estimated to be $\\sim$170 $\\mu$s\nfor 3 MeV recoils in the phonon detector, satisfying the event-rate\nrequirements of large $Q_{\\beta \\beta}$ next-generation neutrinoless double\nbeta decay experiments. Quiescent bias power for both of these designs is found\nto be significantly larger than parasitic power loads achieved in the\nSPICA/SAFARI infrared bolometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 02:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 19:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Our combinatorial condition involves\nconstructing a chordal cover of a graph related to G and S (the Cayley graph\nCay($\\hat{G}$,S)) with maximal cliques related to T. Our result relies on two\nmain ingredients: the decomposition of sparse positive semidefinite matrices\nwith a chordal sparsity pattern, as well as a simple but key observation\nexploiting the structure of the Fourier basis elements of G.\n  We apply our general result to two examples. First, in the case where $G =\n\\mathbb{Z}_2^n$, by constructing a particular chordal cover of the half-cube\ngraph, we prove that any nonnegative quadratic form in n binary variables is a\nsum of squares of functions of degree at most $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$, establishing\na conjecture of Laurent.

We consider two firms in a market competing to\nmaximize the consumption of their products. Firms have a limited budget which\ncan be either invested on the quality of the product or spent on initial\nseeding in the network in order to better facilitate spread of the product.\nAfter the decision of firms, agents choose their consumptions following a\nmyopic best response dynamics which results in a local, linear update for their\nconsumption decision. We characterize the unique Nash equilibrium of the game\nbetween firms and study the effect of the budgets as well as the network\nstructure on the optimal allocation. We show that at the equilibrium, firms\ninvest more budget on quality when their budgets are close to each other.\nHowever, as the gap between budgets widens, competition in qualities becomes\nless effective and firms spend more of their budget on seeding. We also show\nthat given equal budget of firms, if seeding budget is nonzero for a balanced\ngraph, it will also be nonzero for any other graph, and if seeding budget is\nzero for a star graph it will be zero for any other graph as well. As a\npractical extension, we then consider a case where products have some preset\nqualities that can be only improved marginally. At some point in time, firms\nlearn about the network structure and decide to utilize a limited budget to\nmount their market share by either improving the quality or new seeding some\nagents to incline consumers towards their products. We show that the optimal\nbudget allocation in this case simplifies to a threshold strategy.\nInterestingly, we derive similar results to that of the original problem, in\nwhich preset qualities simulate the role that budgets had in the original\nsetup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 04:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

The key of our solution is\nto introduce a module consisting of an encoding layer and a temporal pyramid\npooling layer. The encoding layer maps the activation from previous layers to a\nfeature vector suitable for pooling while the temporal pyramid pooling layer\nconverts multiple frame-level activations into a fixed-length video-level\nrepresentation.

The significant improvement in reducing chi-square\nmainly comes from the better fitting of Planck temperature power spectrum\naround the third ($\\ell \\approx 800$) and sixth ($\\ell \\approx 1800$) acoustic\npeaks. The likelihood ratio test and the Akaike information criterion suggest\nthat the model of dark energy spike is strongly favored by the current\ncosmological observations over the conventional $\\Lambda\\textrm{CDM}$ model.\nHowever, based on the Bayesian information criterion which penalizes models\nwith more parameters, the strong evidence supporting the presence of dark\nenergy spike disappears. Our result emphasizes that the alternative\ncosmological parameter estimation with even better fitting of the same\nobservational data is allowed in the Einstein's gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 06:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

Building upon recent random\nmatrix advances in the area of robust statistics, we specifically show that the\nso-called Maronna M-estimator of scatter asymptotically behaves similar to\nwell-known random matrices when the population and sample sizes grow together\nto infinity. The introduction of outliers leads the robust estimator to behave\nasymptotically as the weighted sum of the sample outer products, with a\nconstant weight for all legitimate samples and different weights for the\noutliers. A fine analysis of this structure reveals importantly that the\npropensity of the M-estimator to attenuate (or enhance) the impact of outliers\nis mostly dictated by the alignment of the outliers with the inverse population\ncovariance matrix of the legitimate samples. Thus, robust M-estimators can\nbring substantial benefits over more simplistic estimators such as the\nper-sample normalized version of the sample covariance matrix, which is not\ncapable of differentiating the outlying samples. The analysis shows that,\nwithin the class of Maronna's estimators of scatter, the Huber estimator is\nmost favorable for rejecting outliers. On the contrary, estimators more similar\nto Tyler's scale invariant estimator (often preferred in the literature) run\nthe risk of inadvertently enhancing some outliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 07:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

For the OH + CH4 reaction, at low temperatures, T = 200 K, where\nthe quantum tunnelling effect is more important, RPMD overestimates the\nexperimental rate constants due to problems associated with PES-2014 in the\ndeep tunnelling regime and to the known overestimation of this method in\nasymmetric reactions, while VTST/MT presents a better agreement, differences\nabout 10%, due to compensation of several factors, inaccuracy of PES-2014 and\nignoring anharmonicity.

Previously, Martin proved a rigorous upper bound on the\ninelastic cross-section $\\sigma_{inel}$ which is one-fourth of the\ncorresponding upper bound on $\\sigma_{tot}$, and Wu, Martin,Roy and Singh\nimproved the bound by adding the constraint of a given $\\sigma_{tot}$.

Alternatively, their asymptotic forms,together with the\nMartin-Roy absolute bounds on pion-pion D-waves below threshold, yield absolute\nbounds on energy-averaged inelastic cross sections.

SGR 1745-2900 has a surface\ndipolar magnetic field of ~ 2x10^{14} G, and it is the neutron star closest to\na black hole ever observed. The new source was detected both in the radio and\nX-ray bands, with a peak X-ray luminosity L_X ~ 5x10^{35} erg s^{-1}. Here we\nreport on the long-term Chandra (25 observations) and XMM-Newton (8\nobservations) X-ray monitoring campaign of SGR 1745-2900, from the onset of the\noutburst in April 2013 until September 2014. This unprecedented dataset allows\nus to refine the timing properties of the source, as well as to study the\noutburst spectral evolution as a function of time and rotational phase. Our\ntiming analysis confirms the increase in the spin period derivative by a factor\nof ~2 around June 2013, and reveals that a further increase occurred between\n2013 Oct 30 and 2014 Feb 21. We find that the period derivative changed from\n6.6x10^{-12} s s^{-1} to 3.3x10^{-11} s s^{-1} in 1.5 yr. On the other hand,\nthis magnetar shows a slow flux decay compared to other magnetars and a rather\ninefficient surface cooling. In particular, starquake-induced crustal cooling\nmodels alone have difficulty in explaining the high luminosity of the source\nfor the first ~200 days of its outburst, and additional heating of the star\nsurface from currents flowing in a twisted magnetic bundle is probably playing\nan important role in the outburst evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 13:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

The enhancement by a factor of 1.2 compared to a\nreference sample is caused by the use of a hole transport layer (HTL) material\npossessing a low refractive index (1.52). The low refractive index reduces the\nin-plane wave vector of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excited at the\ninterface between the bottom opaque metallic electrode (anode) and the HTL. The\nshift of the SPP dispersion relation decreases the power dissipated into lost\nevanescent excitations and thus increases the outcoupling efficiency, although\nthe SPP remains constant in intensity. The proposed method is suitable for\nemitter materials owning isotropic orientation of the transition dipole moments\nas well as anisotropic, preferentially horizontal orientation, resulting in\ncomparable enhancement factors. Furthermore, for sufficiently low refractive\nindices of the HTL material, the SPP can be modeled as a propagating plane wave\nwithin other organic materials in the optical microcavity. Thus, by applying\nfurther extraction methods, such as micro lenses or Bragg gratings, it would\nbecome feasible to obtain even higher enhancements of the light extraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 13:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Usually, such a modular structure is uncovered by the optimization of\nsome quality function. Although flawed, modularity remains one of the most\npopular quality functions. The Louvain algorithm was originally developed for\noptimizing modularity, but has been applied to a variety of methods. As such,\nspeeding up the Louvain algorithm, enables the analysis of larger graphs in a\nshorter time for various methods. We here suggest to consider moving nodes to a\nrandom neighbor community, instead of the best neighbor community. Although\nincredibly simple, it reduces the theoretical runtime complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(m)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\langle k \\rangle)$ in networks with a\nclear community structure. In benchmark networks, it speeds up the algorithm\nroughly 2-3 times, while in some real networks it even reaches 10 times faster\nruntimes. This improvement is due to two factors: (1) a random neighbor is\nlikely to be in a \"good\" community; and (2) random neighbors are likely to be\nhubs, helping the convergence. Finally, the performance gain only slightly\ndiminishes the quality, especially for modularity, thus providing a good\nquality-performance ratio. However, these gains are less pronounced, or even\ndisappear, for some other measures such as significance or surprise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 14:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 10:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

While binary\norbits and stellar pulsations can provide much sharper constraints on the\nstellar mass, these methods are only rarely applicable to massive stars.\nUnfortunately, spectroscopic masses of massive stars heavily depend on the\ndetailed physics of model atmospheres. AIMS: We demonstrate the impact of a\nconsistent treatment of the radiative pressure on inferred gravities and\nspectroscopic masses of massive stars. Specifically, we investigate the\ncontribution of line and continuum transitions to the photospheric radiative\npressure. We further explore the effect of model parameters, e.g., abundances,\non the deduced spectroscopic mass. Lastly, we compare our results with the\nplane-parallel TLUSTY code, commonly used for the analysis of massive stars\nwith photospheric spectra. METHODS: We calculate a small set of O-star models\nwith the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code using different approaches for the\nquasi-hydrostatic part. These models allow us to quantify the effect of\naccounting for the radiative pressure consistently. We further use PoWR models\nto show how the Doppler widths of line profiles and abundances of elements such\nas iron affect the radiative pressure, and, as a consequence, the derived\nspectroscopic masses. RESULTS: Our study implies that errors on the order of a\nfactor of two in the inferred spectroscopic mass are to be expected when\nneglecting the contribution of line and continuum transitions to the radiative\nacceleration in the photosphere. Usage of implausible microturbulent\nvelocities, or the neglect of important opacity sources such as Fe, may result\nin errors of approximately 50% in the spectroscopic mass. A comparison with\nTLUSTY model atmospheres reveals a very good agreement with PoWR at the limit\nof low mass-loss rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 15:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

The essential feature is to encode the image via a sparse vector\nfield, ideally concentrating on a set of measure zero. An equivalent\nreformulation of the compression approach leads to a variational model\nresembling the ROF-model for image denoising, hence we further study the\nproperties of the effective regularization functional introduced by the novel\napproach and discuss similarities to TV and TGV functionals. Moreover we\ncomputationally investigate the behaviour of the model with sparse vector\nfields for compression in particular for high resolution images and give an\noutlook towards denoising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 23:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The theory follows the same paradigm as\nclassical sampling theory. We show that perfect recovery is possible for graph\nsignals bandlimited under the graph Fourier transform. The sampled signal\ncoefficients form a new graph signal, whose corresponding graph structure\npreserves the first-order difference of the original graph signal. For general\ngraphs, an optimal sampling operator based on experimentally designed sampling\nis proposed to guarantee perfect recovery and robustness to noise; for graphs\nwhose graph Fourier transforms are frames with maximal robustness to erasures\nas well as for Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, random sampling leads to perfect\nrecovery with high probability. We further establish the connection to the\nsampling theory of finite discrete-time signal processing and previous work on\nsignal recovery on graphs. To handle full-band graph signals, we propose a\ngraph filter bank based on sampling theory on graphs. Finally, we apply the\nproposed sampling theory to semi-supervised classification on online blogs and\ndigit images, where we achieve similar or better performance with fewer labeled\nsamples compared to previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 23:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 04:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The thermodynamics of non-rotating and\nrotating black hole solutions resembles similar solutions in Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory with the electric charge being replaced by a new mass dependent\ngravitational charge $Q = \\sqrt{\\alpha G_N}M$. This new mass dependent charge\nmodifies the effective Newtonian constant from $G_N$ to $G = G_N(1+\\alpha)$,\nand this in turn critically affects the thermodynamics of the black holes. We\nalso investigate the thermodynamics of regular solutions, and explore the\nlimiting case when no horizons forms. So, it is possible that the modified\ngravity can lead to the absence of black hole horizons in our universe.\nFinally, we analyze corrections to the thermodynamics of a non-rotating black\nhole and obtain the usual logarithmic correction term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 19:09:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 18:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}
