It focuses on the Minimum-weight Spanning Tree (MST)\nverification problem and establishes tight upper and lower bounds for the time\nand message complexities of this problem. Specifically, we provide an MST\nverification algorithm that achieves simultaneously O(m) messages and O($\\sqrt$\nn+D) time, where m is the number of edges in the given graph G, n is the number\nof nodes, and D is G's diameter. On the other hand, we show that any MST\nverification algorithm must send {\\Omega}(m) messages and incur\n{\\Omega}($\\sqrt$ n + D) time in worst case. Our upper bound result appears to\nindicate that the verification of an MST may be easier than its construction,\nsince for MST construction, both lower bounds of {\\Omega}(m) messages and\n{\\Omega}($\\sqrt$ n+D time hold, but at the moment there is no known distributed\nalgorithm that constructs an MST and achieves simultaneously O(m) messages and\nO($\\sqrt$ n + D) time. Specifically, the best known time-optimal algorithm\n(using O($\\sqrt$ n + D) time) requires O(m + n 3/2) messages, and the best\nknown message-optimal algorithm (using O(m) messages) requires O(n) time. On\nthe other hand, our lower bound results indicate that the verification of an\nMST is not significantly easier than its construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 16:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

The main question that arises on the origin of this\ninequality between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of\nfreedom. We answer this question in M-theory. In our model, first M0-branes are\ncompactified on one circle and then N D0-branes are created. Then, N D0-branes\njoin to each other, grow and form a D5-brane.

With the disappearance of this D1-brane, the number of degrees of freedom\nof boundary surface and bulk region becomes equal and inflation ends. At this\nstage, extra energies that are produced due to the compactification cause to an\nexpansion of universe and deceleration epoch.

We observe FWM signals with dephasing\ntimes up to 7 ns, strongly dependent on the excitation bandwidth to the Rydberg\nstate. The excitation to the Rydberg state is driven by a pulsed two-photon\ntransition on ns time scales. Combined with a third cw de-excitation laser, a\nstrongly directional and collective emission is generated according to a\ncombination of the phase matching effect and averaging over Doppler classes. In\ncontrast to a previous report [1] using off-resonant FWM, at a resonant FWM\nscheme we observe additional revivals of the signal shortly after the incident\npulse has ended. We infer that this is a revival of motion-induced constructive\ninterference between the coherent emissions of the thermal atoms.

Current efforts are starting\nto address the inclusion of a controllable level of dynamicity in real-time\nsystems to increase the degree of freedom or flexibility in the execution of\nreal-time systems. This is mainly achieved by imposing a set of bounds and\nlimitations to the allowed system structure and operations during a transition.\nThe ultimate goal is to time-bound the duration and result of the system state\ntransitions. One of the main obstacles for run-time transitions is the\ndifficulty in characterizing the different operations and phases of a run-time\nsystem transition to guarantee a time bound for each phase. In this paper, an\ninfrastructure is described to ensure the timely execution of state transitions\nthat can be safely incorporated and performed at run-time in a component-based\nreal-time system, preserving its temporal properties.

In Paper~I we showed\nthat new asteroseismic observations of these stars imply they have either very\nlarge convective cores or semiconvection/partially mixed zones that trap\ng-modes. We probe this mixing by inferring the relative lifetimes of asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) and horizontal branch (HB) from $R_2$, the observed ratio of\nthese stars in recent HST photometry of 48 Galactic globular clusters. Our new\ndeterminations of $R_2$ are more self-consistent than those of previous studies\nand our overall calculation of $R_2 = 0.117 \\pm 0.005$ is the most\nstatistically robust now available. We also establish that the luminosity\ndifference between the HB and the AGB clump is $\\Delta\n\\log{L}_\\text{HB}^\\text{AGB} = 0.455 \\pm 0.012$. Our results accord with\nearlier findings that standard models predict a lower $R_2$ than is observed.\nWe demonstrate that the dominant sources of uncertainty in models are the\nprescription for mixing and the stochastic effects that can result from its\nnumerical treatment. The luminosity probability density functions that we\nderive from observations feature a sharp peak near the AGB clump. This\nconstitutes a strong new argument against core breathing pulses, which broaden\nthe predicted width of the peak. We conclude that the two mixing schemes that\ncan match the asteroseismology are capable of matching globular cluster\nobservations, but only if (i) core breathing pulses are avoided in models with\na semiconvection/partially mixed zone, or (ii) that models with large\nconvective cores have a particular depth of mixing beneath the Schwarzschild\nboundary during subsequent early-AGB `gravonuclear' convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 16:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The simplicial depth,\n$\\sigma_P(q)$ of a point $q$ is the number of $d$-simplices with vertices in\n$P$ that contain $q$ in their convex hulls. The simplicial depth is a notion of\ndata depth with many applications in robust statistics and computational\ngeometry. Computing the simplicial depth of a point is known to be a\nchallenging problem. The trivial solution requires $O(n^{d+1})$ time whereas it\nis generally believed that one cannot do better than $O(n^{d-1})$. In this\npaper, we consider approximation algorithms for computing the simplicial depth\nof a point. For $d=2$, we present a new data structure that can approximate the\nsimplicial depth in polylogarithmic time, using polylogarithmic query time. In\n3D, we can approximate the simplicial depth of a given point in near-linear\ntime, which is clearly optimal up to polylogarithmic factors. For higher\ndimensions, we consider two approximation algorithms with different worst-case\nscenarios. By combining these approaches, we compute a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation of the simplicial depth in time\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{d/2 + 1})$ ignoring polylogarithmic factor. All of these\nalgorithms are Monte Carlo algorithms. Furthermore, we present a simple\nstrategy to compute the simplicial depth exactly in $O(n^d \\log n)$ time, which\nprovides the first improvement over the trivial $O(n^{d+1})$ time algorithm for\n$d>4$. Finally, we show that computing the simplicial depth exactly is\n#P-complete and W[1]-hard if the dimension is part of the input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 17:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 10:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The objective is to sense the environment, learn the normal\nsystem state, and then periodically classify whether the instantaneous state\ndeviates from the normal one or not. A flexible and cost-effective way of\nmonitoring a system state is to use a wireless sensor network. In the\ntraditional approach, the sensors encode their observations and transmit them\nto a fusion center by means of some interference avoiding channel access\nmethod. The fusion center then decodes all the data and classifies the\ncorresponding system state. As this approach can be highly inefficient in terms\nof energy consumption, in this paper we propose a transmission scheme that\nexploits interference for carrying out the anomaly detection directly in the\nair. In other words, the wireless channel helps the fusion center to retrieve\nthe sought classification outcome immediately from the channel output. To\nachieve this, the chosen learning model is linear support vector machines.\nAfter discussing the proposed scheme and proving its reliability, we present\nnumerical examples demonstrating that the scheme reduces the energy consumption\nfor anomaly detection by up to 53% compared to a strategy that uses time\ndivision multiple-access.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 17:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

This model takes Lambertian\nreflection, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler boosting into\naccount. CoRoT-1b shows a non-negligible scattering albedo (0.11<AS<0.3 at 95%\nconfidence) as well as small day-night temperature contrasts, indicative of\nmoderate to high re-distribution of energy between dayside and nightside. These\nvalues are contrary to previous secondary eclipse and phase curve analyses. In\nthe case of HAT-P-7b, model results suggest relatively high scattering albedo\n(AS=0.3). This confirms previous phase curve analysis, however, it is in slight\ncontradiction to values inferred from secondary eclipse data. For TrES-2b, both\napproaches yield very similar estimates of albedo and heat recirculation.\nDiscrepancies between recirculation and albedo values as inferred from\nsecondary eclipse and optical phase curve analyses might be interpreted as a\nhint that optical and IR observations probe different atmospheric layers, and\nhence temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 19:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Here, we obtain a peculiar drop shape from the\nrupture of a long liquid filament sitting on a solid substrate, and analyze its\nshape and contact angles by means of goniometric and refractive techniques.

While existing theory typically\nfeatures equilibrium conditions, emerging methodology requires an analytical\nunderstanding of the build-up of the allele frequencies over time. In this\nwork, we use the framework of Poisson random fields to derive new\nrepresentations of the non-equilibrium AFS for the case of a Wright-Fisher\npopulation model with selection. In our approach, the AFS is a scaling-limit of\nthe expectation of a Poisson stochastic integral and the representation of the\nnon-equilibrium AFS arises in terms of a fixation time probability\ndistribution. The known duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion process and\na birth and death process generalizing Kingman's coalescent yields an\nadditional representation. The results carry over to the setting of a random\nsample drawn from the population and provide the non-equilibrium behavior of\nsample statistics. Our findings are consistent with and extend a previous\napproach where the non-equilibrium AFS solves a partial differential forward\nequation with a non-traditional boundary condition. Moreover, we provide a\nbridge to previous coalescent-based work, and hence tie several frameworks\ntogether. Since frequency-based summary statistics are widely used in\npopulation genetics, for example, to identify candidate loci of adaptive\nevolution, to infer the demographic history of a population, or to improve our\nunderstanding of the underlying mechanics of speciation events, the presented\nresults are potentially useful for a broad range of topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 20:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

The gas surface density near the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is\nwell represented by a power law, Sigma(b)=72 Msun/pc^2(b/pc)^{-5/8} for our\nentire range, 0.05<b/pc<8.5, of distance from the filament ridge. Essentially\nall protostars lie on the ISF or other filament ridges, while almost all\npre-main-sequence stars do not. Combined with the fact that protostars move <1\nkms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster, this\nimplies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from\nthe filaments. The ISF is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are\nprogressively moving south, with separations of a few Myr in time and 3 pc in\nspace. This, combined with the filament's observed undulations (spatial and\nvelocity), suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the\nfilament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected Orion\nA and B into stars in discrete episodes. We construct an axially symmetric gas\ndensity profile rho(r)=16 Msun/pc^3(r/pc)^{-13/8}. The model implies that the\nobserved magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed\nundulations, suggesting that the filament's transverse waves are magnetically\ninduced. Because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament\non larger scales, the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived.\nProtostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the\nprotostars, not the other way around. The model also implies that the ISF is\nkinematically young, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. The\nsouthern filament has a broken power law, which matches the ISF profile for\n2.5<b/pc<8.5, but is shallower closer in.

Flatter systems attain tighter spacings, a consequence of an\neccentricity equilibrium between gravitational scatterings, which increase\neccentricities, and mergers, which damp them. Dynamical friction by residual\ndisk gas plays a critical role in regulating mergers and in damping\ninclinations and eccentricities.

Our WIYN 3.5m data set spans a time\nbaseline of 11 years, a magnitude range of 12<=V<=16.5 (1.18-0.94 MSun), and a\n1 deg. diameter region on the sky. With the addition of a Dominion\nAstrophysical Observatory (DAO) data set we extend our bright limit to V = 10.8\nand, for some stars, extend our time baseline to 35 years. Our magnitude limits\ninclude solar-mass main-sequence stars, subgiants, giants, and blue stragglers\n(BSs), and our spatial coverage extends radially to 17 pc (~13 core radii). For\nthe WIYN data we find a measurement precision of 0.4 km/s for narrow-lined\nstars. We have measured RVs for 1046 stars in the direction of NGC 188, finding\n473 to be likely cluster members. We detect 124 velocity-variable cluster\nmembers, all of which are likely to be dynamically hard-binary stars. Using our\nsingle member stars, we find an average cluster RV of -42.36 +/- 0.04 km/s. We\nuse our precise RV and proper-motion membership data to greatly reduce\nfield-star contamination in our cleaned color-magnitude diagram, from which we\nidentify six stars of note that lie far from a standard single-star isochrone.\nWe find the binaries to be centrally concentrated, providing evidence for the\npresence of mass segregation in NGC 188. We observe the BSs to populate a\nbimodal spatial distribution that is not centrally concentrated, suggesting\nthat we may be observing two populations of BSs in NGC 188, including a\ncentrally concentrated distribution as well as a halo population. Finally, we\nfind NGC 188 to have a global RV dispersion of 0.64 +/- 0.04 km/s. When\ncorrected for unresolved binaries, the NGC 188 RV dispersion has a nearly\nisothermal radial distribution. We use this mean-corrected velocity dispersion\nto derive a virial mass of 2300 +/- 460 MSun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 21:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

However,\nafter being released by their parent sources, for instance supernova remnants\n(SNRs), CRs must cross the disc of the Galaxy, before entering the much lower\ndensity halo, in which they are believed to spend most of the time before\neventually escaping the Galaxy. In the near-source region, the CR propagation\nis shown to be dominated by the non-linear self-generation of waves. Here we\nshow that due to this effect, the time that CRs with energies up to $\\sim$ 10\nTeV spend within a distance $L_{c}\\sim 100$ pc from the sources is much larger\nthan naive estimates would suggest. The corresponding grammage is close to\ncurrent estimates of the total grammage traversed throughout the whole Galaxy.\nMoreover, there is an irreducible grammage that CRs traverse while trapped\ndownstream of the shock that accelerated them, though this contribution is\nrather uncertain. We conclude that at energies $\\lesssim 1$ TeV, the observed\ngrammage is heavily affected by the near-source non-linear trapping of CRs, and\nat energies $\\gtrsim 1$ TeV it is affected by the source grammage. As a result,\nthe measurement of the B/C ratio should be used very cautiously as an indicator\nof the propagation of CRs on large Galactic scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 22:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 20:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 15:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Here, we report the\nlarge-scale spatially controlled synthesis of the single-layer semiconductor\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS2) laterally in contact with conductive graphene.\nTransition electron microscope (TEM) studies reveal that the single-layer MoS2\nnucleates at the edge of the graphene, creating a lateral 2D heterostructure.\nWe demonstrate such chemically assembled 2D atomic transistors exhibit high\ntransconductance (10 uS), on-off ratios (10^6), and mobility (20 cm^2 V^-1\ns^-1). We assemble 2D logic circuits, such as a heterostructure NMOS inverter\nwith a high voltage gain, up to 70, enabled by the precise site selectivity\nfrom atomically thin conducting and semiconducting crystals. This scalable\nchemical assembly of 2D heterostructures may usher in a new era in\ntwo-dimensional electronic circuitry and computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 00:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

Applying the pulsar outer-magnetospheric particle accelerator\ntheory to black-hole magnetospheres, we demonstrate that an electric field is\nexerted along the magnetic field lines near the event horizon of a rotating\nblack hole. In this particle accelerator (or a gap), electrons and positrons\nare created by photon-photon collisions and accelerated in the opposite\ndirections by this electric field, efficiently emitting gamma-rays via\ncurvature and inverse-Compton processes. It is shown that a gap arises around\nthe null charge surface formed by the frame-dragging effect, provided that\nthere is no current injection across the gap boundaries. The gap is dissipating\na part of the hole's rotational energy, and the resultant gamma-ray luminosity\nincreases with decreasing plasma accretion from the surroundings.

It is found that\nthe curvature process dominates the inverse-Compton process in the\nmagnetosphere of IC~310, and that the observed power-law-like spectrum in VHE\ngamma-rays can be explained to some extent by a superposition of the curvature\nemissions with varying curvature radius.

The electronic shell levels are highly degenerate\nand therefore represent sharp peaks in the density of states. This can enable\nexceptionally strong electron pairing in certain clusters composed of tens to\nhundreds of atoms. In a finite system, such as a free nanocluster or a nucleus,\npairing is observed most clearly via its effect on the energy spectrum of the\nconstituent fermions. Accordingly, we performed a photoionization spectroscopy\nstudy of size-resolved aluminum nanoclusters and observed a rapid rise of the\nnear-threshold density of states of several clusters ($Al_{37,44,66,68}$) with\ndecreasing temperature. The characteristics of this behavior are consistent\nwith compression of the density of states by a pairing transition into a\nhigh-temperature superconducting state with $T_c$>~100 K. This value exceeds\nthat of bulk aluminum by two orders of magnitude. These results highlight the\npotential of novel pairing effects in size-quantized systems and the\npossibility to attain even higher critical temperatures by optimizing the\nparticles' size and composition. As a new class of high-temperature\nsuperconductors, such metal nanocluster particles are promising building blocks\nfor high-$T_c$ materials, devices, and networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 03:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

By drawing ideas from Gallager\nand Nakibo\\u{g}lu's work for the direct part and the meta-converse for the\nconverse part, we establish the $\\varepsilon$-capacity and show that it depends\non $\\varepsilon$ in general and so the strong converse fails to hold.\nFurthermore, we provide bounds on the second-order term in the asymptotic\nexpansion.

Under shear,\nADAMTS13 activity on full-length VWF arises without denaturing agent as\nevidenced by FCS and gel-based multimer analysis. In agreement with Brownian\nhydrodynamics simulations, we find a sigmoidal increase of the enzymatic rate\nas a function of shear at a threshold shear rate 5522/s. The same flow-rate\ndependence of ADAMTS13 activity we also observe in blood plasma, which is\nrelevant to predict hemostatic dysfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 10:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

We have\nalso run several test-particle simulations to understand and guide our\ninterpretation of the different features we see in the Aquarius streams. Our\ngoal is both to establish which deviations of the expected action-angle\nbehaviour of streams exist because of the approximations made on the potential,\nbut also to derive to what degree we can use these coordinates to model streams\nreliably.\n  We have found that many of the Aquarius streams wrap in angle space along\nrelatively straight lines, and also in frequency space.

In frequency space\nstreams typically become thicker and somewhat distorted. Therefore, our\nanalysis explains most of the features seen in the approximate angle and\nfrequency spaces for the Aquarius streams with the exception of their somewhat\n`noisy' and `patchy' morphologies. These are likely due to the interactions\nwith the large number of dark matter subhalos present in the cosmological\nsimulations.

Using $ {\\Theta}_{{\\underline{M}}}$ we show that the curves\n$({\\alpha},\\varphi_{{\\underline{M}}}({\\alpha}))$ hit the diagonal $\\{({\\beta},\n{\\beta}): 0.5< {\\beta}<1 \\}$ almost perpendicularly if $({\\beta}, {\\beta})$ is\nclose to $(1,1)$. Answering a question asked by M. Misiurewicz at a conference\nwe show that these curves are not necessarily exactly orthogonal to the\ndiagonal, for example for $ {\\underline{M}}=RLLRC$ the curve $(\\alpha,\n{\\varphi}_{{\\underline{M}}}({\\alpha}))$ is not orthogonal to the diagonal. On\nthe other hand, for $ {\\underline{M}}=RLC$ it is. With different\nparametrization properties of equi-kneading maps for skew tent maps were\nconsidered by J.C. Marcuard, M. Misiurewicz and E. Visinescu.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 12:32:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 08:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

IRIS is able to\nspectrally resolve Fe xxi emission from cold chromospheric brightenings, so can\nbe used to infer the amount of Fe xxi emission in 131 channel. Aims: We use\nobservations of two small solar flares seen by IRIS and SDO to compare the EMs\ndeduced from the IRIS Fe xxi line and the AIA 131 channel to determine the\nfraction of Fe xxi emission in flare kernels in the 131 channel of AIA.\nMethods: Cotemporal and cospatial pseudo-raster AIA images are compared with\nthe IRIS results.We use multi-Gaussian line fitting to separate the blending\nchromospheric emission so as to derive Fe xxi intensities and Doppler shifts in\nIRIS spectra. Results: We define loop and kernel regions based on the\nbrightness of the 131 and 1600 {\\AA} intensities. In the loop regions the Fe\nxxi EMs are typically 80% of the 131 ones, and range from 67% to 92%. Much of\nthe scatter is due to small misalignments but the largest site with low Fe xxi\ncontributions was probably affected by a recent injection of cool plasma into\nthe loop. In flare kernels the contribution of Fe xxi increases from less than\n10% at the low intensity 131 sites to 40-80% in the brighter kernels. Here the\nFe xxi is superimposed on bright chromospheric emission and the Fe xxi line\nshows blue shifts, sometimes extending up to the edge of the spectral window,\n200 km/s. Conclusions: The AIA 131 emission in flare loops is due to Fe xxi\nemission with a 10-20% contribution from continuum, Fe xxiii, and cooler\nbackground plasma emission. In bright flare kernels up to 52% of the 131 is\nfrom cooler plasma. The wide range seen in the kernels is caused by significant\nstructure in the kernels which is seen as sharp gradients in Fe xxi EM at sites\nof molecular and transition region emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 12:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In 2+1 dimensions and with quadratic nonlinearity, this equation is\nintegrable through a novel IST, and it has been recently shown to be a\nprototype model equation in the description of the two dimensional wave\nbreaking of localized initial data. In higher dimensions and with higher\nnonlinearity, the generalized dKP equations are not integrable, but their\ninvariance under motions on the paraboloid allows one to construct in this\npaper a family of exact solutions describing waves constant on their\nparaboloidal wave front and breaking simultaneously in all points of it,\ndeveloping after breaking either multivaluedness or single valued discontinuous\nshocks. Then such exact solutions are used to build the longtime behavior of\nthe solutions of the Cauchy problem, for small and localized initial data,\nshowing that wave breaking of small initial data takes place in the longtime\nregime if and only if $m(n-1)\\le 2$. At last, the analytic aspects of such a\nwave breaking are investigated in detail in terms of the small initial data, in\nboth cases in which the solution becomes multivalued after breaking or it\ndevelops a discontinuous shock.

It is well known that the laser intensity should to\nexceed certain threshold in order to generate HHG, when noble gas atoms in\ntheir ground state are used as an active medium. One way to enhance the\ncoherent light coming from a conventional laser oscillator is to take advantage\nof the amplification obtained by the so-called surface plasmon polaritons,\ncreated when a low intensity laser field is focused onto a metallic\nnanostructure. The main limitation of this scheme is the low damage threshold\nof the materials employed in the nanostructures engineering. In this work we\npropose to use Rydberg atoms, driven by spatially inhomogeneous,\nplasmonic-enhanced laser fields, for HHG. We exhaustively discuss the behaviour\nand efficiency of these systems in the generation of coherent harmonic\nemission. To this aim we numerically solve the time-dependent Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for an atom with an electron initially in a highly excited $n$-th\nRydberg state, located in the vicinity of a metallic nanostructure, where the\nelectric field changes spatially on the scales relevant for the dynamics of the\nlaser-ionized electron. We first use a one-dimensional model to investigate the\nphenomena systematically. We then employ a more realistic situation, when the\ninteraction of a plasmonic-enhanced laser field with a three-dimensional\nHydrogen atom is modelled. We discuss the scaling of the relevant input\nparameters with the principal quantum number $n$ of the Rydberg state in\nquestion, and demonstrate that harmonic emission could be achieved from Rydberg\natoms well below the damage threshold, thus without deteriorating the geometry\nand properties of the metallic nanostructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 15:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

While in DMRG, the many-body states in nested Fock\nsubspaces are successively renormalized, in Hilbert space renormalization,\nmany-body states in nested Hilbert subspaces undergo renormalization. This\nprovides a new way to classify and combine configurations. The underlying\nwavefunction ansatz, namely the Hilbert space matrix product state (HS-MPS),\nhas a very rich and flexible mathematical structure.

Recently both in vivo\nand in silico studies have tried to better understand hemodynamics at varying\nstages of vertebrate cardiogenesis. In particular, the intracardial\nhemodynamics during the onset of trabeculation is notably complex - the\ninertial and viscous fluid forces are approximately equal at this stage and\nsmall perturbations in morphology, scale, and steadiness of the flow can lead\nto significant changes in bulk flow structures, shear stress distributions, and\nchemical morphogen gradients. The immersed boundary method was used to solve\nthe computational fluid dynamics problem involving fluid flow moving through\nthe trabeculated ventricles of 72, 80, and 120 hours post fertilization wild\ntype zebrafish embryos and ErbB2-inhibited embryos at 7 days post\nfertilization. An idealized trabeculated ventricular model was explored to map\nthe bifurcations in flow structure that occur as a result of the unsteadiness\nof flow, trabeculae height, and fluid scale ($Re$). Vortex formation occurred\nin intertrabecular regions for biologically relevant parameter spaces, wherein\nflow velocities increased. This indicates that trabecular morphology may alter\nintracardial flow patterns and hence ventricular shear stresses and morphogen\ngradients. A potential implication of this work is that the onset of vortical\n(disturbed) flows can upregulate Notch1 expression in endothelial cells in\nvitro and hence impacts chamber morphogensis, valvulogenesis, and the formation\nof the trabeculae themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 19:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

For this, a central scheme of finite volume method without dimensional\nsplit and no Riemann solvers (a Nessyahu-Tadmor method) was implemented. Thus,\nwe were able to obtain stable numerical solutions with spurious oscillations\nunder control and no excessive numerical dissipation. We setup a magnetized\naccretion disk uncharged plasma surrounding a central Schwarzschild BH immersed\nin a magnetosphere which evolve to the ejection of matter in the form of jet\nwith its substructures over a distance of almost twenty times the BH radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 12:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}
