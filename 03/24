A natural mathematical representation of activity videos is in form\nof parameterized trajectories on the covariance manifold, i.e. the set of\nsymmetric, positive-definite matrices (SPDMs). The variable execution-rates of\nactions implies variable parameterizations of the resulting trajectories, and\ncomplicates their classification. Since action classes are invariant to\nexecution rates, one requires rate-invariant metrics for comparing\ntrajectories. A recent paper represented trajectories using their transported\nsquare-root vector fields (TSRVFs), defined by parallel translating\nscaled-velocity vectors of trajectories to a reference tangent space on the\nmanifold. To avoid arbitrariness of selecting the reference and to reduce\ndistortion introduced during this mapping, we develop a purely intrinsic\napproach where SPDM trajectories are represented by redefining their TSRVFs at\nthe starting points of the trajectories, and analyzed as elements of a vector\nbundle on the manifold. Using a natural Riemannain metric on vector bundles of\nSPDMs, we compute geodesic paths and geodesic distances between trajectories in\nthe quotient space of this vector bundle, with respect to the\nre-parameterization group. This makes the resulting comparison of trajectories\ninvariant to their re-parameterization. We demonstrate this framework on two\napplications involving video classification: visual speech recognition or\nlip-reading and hand-gesture recognition. In both cases we achieve results\neither comparable to or better than the current literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 16:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 20:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-13"}

Assuming spherical fragments at\nscission, the Coulomb interaction energy between fragments (C_sph) is higher\nthan the Q-value, the available energy. Therefore at scission the fragments\nmust be deformed, so that the Coulomb interaction energy does not exceed the\nQ-value. The fact that the even-odd effects in the maximum total kinetic energy\nas a function of the charge and mass, respectively, are lower than the even-odd\neffects of Q is consistent with the assumption that odd mass fragments are\nsofter than the even-even fragments. Even-odd effects of charge distribution in\nsuper asymmetric fragmentation also are interpreted with the Coulomb effect\nhypothesis. Because the difference between C_sph and Q increases with\nasymmetry, fragmentations require higher total deformation energy to occur.\nHigher deformation energy of the fragments implies lower free energy to break\npairs of nucleons. This explains why in the asymmetric fragmentation region,\nthe even-odd effects of the distribution of proton number and neutron number\nincreases with asymmetry. Based on a similar reasoning, a prediction of a\nrelatively high even-odd effect in symmetric fragmentations is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 16:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

We use a four orbital\ntight-binding model that includes the full atomic spin-orbit coupling and we\ncalculate the $Z_{2}$ topological invariant of the bulk states as well as the\nedge states of semi-infinite crystals with armchair termination. For\nhomogeneous multilayers we find that even when the spin-orbit interaction opens\na gap for all the possible stackings, only those with odd number of layers host\ngapless edge states while those with even number of layers are trivial\ninsulators. For the heterostructures where graphene is encapsulated by trivial\ninsulators, it turns out that the interlayer coupling is able to induce a\ntopological gap whose size is controlled by the spin-orbit coupling of the\nencapsulating materials, indicating that the quantum spin Hall phase can be\ninduced by proximity to trivial insulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 17:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

Based on the HST\nspectra of 24 He II quasars, we find that the majority of them display a\nproximity profile, corresponding to an ionization radius as large as 20 Mpc in\nthe source's rest frame. In comparison with those in the H i spectra of the\nquasars at z~6, the He II proximity effect is more prominent and is observed\nover a considerably longer period of reionization. The He II proximity zone\nsizes decrease at higher redshifts, particularly at z > 3.3. This trend is\nsimilar to that for H I, signaling an onset of He II reionization at z~4.\n  For quasar SDSS1253+6817 (z=3.48), the He II absorption trough displays a\ngradual decline and serves a good case for modeling the He II reionization. To\nmodel such a broad profile requires a quasar radiation field whose distribution\nbetween 4 and 1 Rydberg is considerably harder than normally assumed.

The high satellite quenched fraction observed in the Local Group\ndemands an extremely short quenching timescale (~ 2 Gyr) for dwarf satellites\nin the mass range Mstar ~ 10^6-10^8 Msun. This quenching timescale is\nsignificantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction of\nmore massive satellites (~ 8 Gyr), both in the Local Group and in more massive\nhost halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenching\nmechanism at Mstar < 10^8 Msun. Combining our work with the results of\ncomplementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression of\nstar formation in massive satellites (Mstar ~ 10^8 - 10^11 Msun) is broadly\nconsistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenching\ntimescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. Below a critical stellar\nmass scale of ~ 10^8 Msun, however, the required quenching times are much\nshorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. Instead, quenching must act\non a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo.

Due to the non-linear nature of the AC\npower-flow equations, the OPF problem is known to be non-convex, therefore hard\nto solve. Most proposed methods for solving the OPF rely on approximations that\nrender the problem convex, but that may yield inexact solutions. Recently,\nFarivar and Low proposed a method that is claimed to be exact for radial\ndistribution systems, despite no apparent approximations. In our work, we show\nthat it is, in fact, not exact. On one hand, there is a misinterpretation of\nthe physical network model related to the ampacity constraint of the lines'\ncurrent flows. On the other hand, the proof of the exactness of the proposed\nrelaxation requires unrealistic assumptions related to the unboundedness of\nspecific control variables. We also show that the extension of this approach to\naccount for exact line models might provide physically infeasible solutions.\nRecently, several contributions have proposed OPF algorithms that rely on the\nuse of the alternating-direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, as we\nshow in this work, there are cases for which the ADMM-based solution of the\nnon-relaxed OPF problem fails to converge. To overcome the aforementioned\nlimitations, we propose an algorithm for the solution of a non-approximated,\nnon-convex OPF problem in radial distribution systems that is based on the\nmethod of multipliers, and on a primal decomposition of the OPF. This work is\ndivided in two parts. In Part I, we specifically discuss the limitations of BFM\nand ADMM to solve the OPF problem.

The curvature of the\ncylinders enters this linear relationship through the slope and additive\nconstant. For a given length-to-gap aspect ratio there is a critical Rayleigh\nnumber beyond which the laminar flow in the finite system is convective and so\nthe behaviour is entirely different from the periodic case. The criterion does\nnot depend on the Prandtl number and appears quite robust with respect to the\nReynolds number. In particular, it continues to work reasonably in the\nturbulent regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 20:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 08:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

To describe a\ngeneral scenario, we allow for both Rashba and Dresselhaus type spin-orbit\ncoupling. Our results are obtained via the quasiclassical theory of\nsuperconductivity, extended to include spin-orbit coupling in the Usadel\nequation and Kupriyanov--Lukichev boundary conditions. Unlike previous works,\nwe have derived a Riccati parametrization of the Usadel equation with\nspin-orbit coupling which allows us to address the full proximity regime.\nFirst, we consider the density of states in both SF bilayers and SFS trilayers,\nwhere the spectroscopic features in the latter case are sensitive to the phase\ndifference between the two superconductors. We find that the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling leaves clear spectroscopic fingerprints in the density of\nstates due to its role in creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Unlike SF and SFS\nstructures without spin-orbit coupling, the density of states in the present\ncase depends strongly on the direction of magnetization. We show that the\nspin-orbit coupling can stabilize singlet superconductivity even in the\npresence of a strong exchange field $h \\gg \\Delta$. This leads to the\npossibility of a magnetically tunable minigap: changing the direction of the\nexchange field opens and closes the minigap. We also determine how the critical\ntemperature $T_c$ of an SF bilayer is affected by spin-orbit coupling and\ndemonstrate that one can achieve a spin-valve effect with a single ferromagnet.\nWe find that $T_c$ displays highly non-monotonic behavior both as a function of\nthe magnetization direction and the type and direction of the spin-orbit\ncoupling, offering a new way to exert control over the superconductivity of\nproximity structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 21:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 09:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

Storage is different from the conventional generators\nthat have traditionally balanced supply and demand on fast time scales due to\nits hard energy capacity constraints, dynamic coupling, and low marginal costs.\nThese differences are leading system operators to propose new mechanisms for\nenabling storage to participate in reserve and real-time energy markets. The\npersistence of market power and gaming in electricity markets suggests that\nthese changes will expose new vulnerabilities.\n  We develop a new model of strategic behavior among storages in energy\nbalancing markets. Our model is a two-stage game that generalizes a classic\nmodel of capacity followed by Bertrand-Edgeworth price competition by\nexplicitly modeling storage dynamics and uncertainty in the pricing stage. By\napplying the model to balancing markets with storage, we are able to compare\ncapacity and energy-based pricing schemes, and to analyze the dynamic effects\nof the market horizon and energy losses due to leakage.

Each\ndomain wall separates two regions with the director tilted in opposite\nazimuthal directions. At the centre of the wall, the director remains parallel\nto the bonding plates. The domain walls can be easily removed by applying a\nmodest electric field. The anchoring transition is explained by the balance of\n(a) the intrinsic perpendicular surface anchoring produced by the polyimide\naligning layer and (b) tangential alignment caused by ionic impurities forming\nelectric double layers. The model is supported by the fact that the temperature\nof the tangential-tilted anchoring transition decreases as the cell thickness\nincreases and as the concentration of ionic species (added salt) increases.

By constructing the Darboux transformation for discrete nonlocal\nNLS equations including the cases of focusing and defocusing, we derive their\ndiscrete soliton solutions, which differ from the ones obtained by using the\nscattering transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 04:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Instead of keeping track of\nthe trajectories of individual loads, the aggregate modeling problem focuses on\ncharacterizing the density evolution of the load population. Most existing\nmodels are only applicable to Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL) with\nfirst-order linear dynamics. This paper develops a unified aggregate modeling\napproach that can be used for general TCLs as well as deferrable loads. We\npropose a deterministic hybrid system model to describe individual load\ndynamics under demand response rules, and develop a general stochastic hybrid\nsystem (SHS) model to capture the population dynamics. We also derive a set of\npartial differential equations (PDE) that governs the probability density\nevolution of the SHS. Our results cannot be obtained using the exiting SHS\ntools in the literature as the proposed SHS model involves both random and\ndeterministic switchings with general switching surfaces in multi-dimensional\ndomains.

Our scheme shows these effects in the context of optical cavities\nstarting off in a maximally entangled W and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\ntripartite states. In Lorentzian cases we find that the far detuned double\nLorentzian baths with small coupling strengths and for ohmic type baths\nsuper-ohmic environments with smaller cutoff frequencies are the best\ncandidates for preserving entanglement among cavities for significant amount of\ntime. A non-Markovian quantum jump approach is employed to understand the\nentanglement dynamics in these cases, especially to recognize the collapse and\nrevival of the entanglement in both W and GHZ states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-30"}

Such a drawing can be viewed as a tiling of a triangle using\ntriangles with the input graph as skeletal structure. In this paper we present\na characterization of graphs that have an SLTR. The characterization is based\non flat angle assignments, i.e., selections of angles of the graph that have\nsize~$\\pi$ in the representation. We also provide a second characterization in\nterms of contact systems of pseudosegments. With the aid of discrete harmonic\nfunctions we show that contact systems of pseudosegments that respect certain\nconditions are stretchable. The stretching procedure is then used to get\nstraight line triangle representations. Since the discrete harmonic function\napproach is quite flexible it allows further applications, we mention some of\nthem. The drawback of the characterization of SLTRs is that we are not able to\neffectively check whether a given graph admits a flat angle assignment that\nfulfills the conditions. Hence it is still open to decide whether the\nrecognition of graphs that admit straight line triangle representation is\npolynomially tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 10:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

My principle aim in writing that paper was to try to bridge the\ngap between two interpretational camps, whom I call 'operationalists' and\n'realists', by pointing out that they use the phrase \"Bell's theorem\" to mean\ndifferent things: his 1964 theorem (assuming locality and determinism) and his\n1976 theorem (assuming local causality), respectively. Thus, it is heartening\nthat at least one person from one side has taken one step on my bridge. That\nsaid, there are several issues of contention with Norsen, which we (the two\nauthors) address after discussing the extent of our agreement with Norsen.

Electric\ncharges on the original lattice and on the dual lattice obey mutually anyonic\nstatistics with the statistics angle $\\frac{2 \\pi}{k}$. Non-Abelian $U(k)$\nBerry gauge fields that arise from the self-adjoint extension parameters may be\ninteresting in the context of quantum information processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

This establishes an equivalence between the\npath ordered integral of the non-Abelian gauge fields with an integral over an\nAbelian restricted gauge field which is tractable both theoretically and\nnumerically in lattice QCD. We circumvent path ordering without needing an\nadditional path integral. By using Stokes' theorem, we can compute the Wilson\nLoop in terms of a surface integral over a restricted field strength, and show\nthat the restricted field strength may be dominated by certain structures,\nwhich occur when one of the quantities parametrising the colour field $n$ winds\nitself around a non-analyticity in the colour field.

Spectra of M dwarf flares in the optical and\nnear-ultraviolet wavelength regimes have revealed three continuum components\nduring the impulsive phase: 1) an energetically dominant blackbody component\nwith a color temperature of T $\\sim$ 10,000 K in the blue-optical, 2) a smaller\namount of Balmer continuum emission in the near-ultraviolet at lambda $<$ 3646\nAngstroms and 3) an apparent pseudo-continuum of blended high-order Balmer\nlines. These properties are not reproduced by models that employ a typical\n\"solar-type\" flare heating level in nonthermal electrons, and therefore our\nunderstanding of these spectra is limited to a phenomenological interpretation.\nWe present a new 1D radiative-hydrodynamic model of an M dwarf flare from\nprecipitating nonthermal electrons with a large energy flux of $10^{13}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The simulation produces bright continuum emission from a\ndense, hot chromospheric condensation. For the first time, the observed color\ntemperature and Balmer jump ratio are produced self-consistently in a\nradiative-hydrodynamic flare model. We find that a T $\\sim$ 10,000 K\nblackbody-like continuum component and a small Balmer jump ratio result from\noptically thick Balmer and Paschen recombination radiation, and thus the\nproperties of the flux spectrum are caused by blue light escaping over a larger\nphysical depth range compared to red and near-ultraviolet light. To model the\nnear-ultraviolet pseudo-continuum previously attributed to overlapping Balmer\nlines, we include the extra Balmer continuum opacity from Landau-Zener\ntransitions that result from merged, high order energy levels of hydrogen in a\ndense, partially ionized atmosphere. This reveals a new diagnostic of ambient\ncharge density in the densest regions of the atmosphere that are heated during\ndMe and solar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 14:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 13:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For a slowly rotating black hole the ISCO\nparameters are obtained up to quadratic in $a$ and particle's spin $s$ terms.\nFrom the formulae obtained it is seen that the spin-orbital coupling has\nattractive character when spin and angular momentum are parallel and repulsive\nwhen they are antiparallel.

However, the pseudo-marginal Markov chain can exhibit poor mixing\nand slow convergence towards its target. As an alternative, a subtly different\nMarkov chain can be simulated, where better mixing is possible but the\nexactness property is sacrificed. This is the noisy algorithm, initially\nconceptualised as Monte Carlo within Metropolis (MCWM), which has also been\nstudied but to a lesser extent. The present article provides a further\ncharacterisation of the noisy algorithm, with a focus on fundamental stability\nproperties like positive recurrence and geometric ergodicity.

Some\nhydrotropes, such as low molecular weight alcohols and amines, can solubilize\nhydrophobic compounds in aqueous solutions at a mesoscopic scale, around 100\nnm, with formation of long lived mesoscale droplets. In this work, we report on\nthe studies of near critical and phase behavior of binary, 2,6-lutidine - H2O,\nand quasibinary, 2,6-lutidine - H2O - D2O, and tert-butanol - 2-butanol - H2O\nsolutions in the presence of a solubilized hydrophobic impurity, cyclohexane.\nIn additional to visual observation of fluid phase equilibria, two experimental\ntechniques were used - light scattering and small - angle neutron scattering.\nIt was found that the increase of the tert-butanol to 2-butanol ratio affects\nthe liquid - liquid equilibria in the quasi-binary system at ambient pressure\nin the same way as the increase of pressure modifies the phase behavior of\nbinary 2-butanol - H2O solutions. The correlation length of critical\nfluctuations near the liquid-liquid separation and the size of mesoscale\ndroplets of solubilized cyclohexane were obtained by dynamic light scattering\nand by small - angle neutron scattering. It is shown that the effect of the\npresence of small amounts of cyclohexane on the near - critical phase behavior\nis twofold - the transition temperature changes towards increasing the\ntwo-phase domain, and long-lived mesoscopic inhomogeneities emerge in the\nmacroscopically homogeneous domain. These homogeneities remain unchanged upon\napproach to the critical point of macroscopic phase separation and do not alter\nthe universal nature of criticality. However, a larger amount of cyclohexane\ngenerates additional liquid-liquid phase separation at lower temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 15:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

We conduct an overhaul of SC atomics in C11,\nreducing the associated axioms in both number and complexity. A consequence of\nour simplification is that the SC operations in an execution no longer need to\nbe totally ordered. This relaxation enables, for the first time, efficient and\nexhaustive simulation of litmus tests that use SC atomics. We extend our\nimproved C11 model to obtain the first rigorous memory model formalisation for\nOpenCL (which extends C11 with support for heterogeneous many-core\nprogramming). In the OpenCL setting, we refine the SC axioms still further to\ngive a sensible semantics to SC operations that employ a 'memory scope' to\nrestrict their visibility to specific threads. Our overhaul requires slight\nstrengthenings of both the C11 and the OpenCL memory models, causing some\nbehaviours to become disallowed. We argue that these strengthenings are\nnatural, and that all of the formalised C11 and OpenCL compilation schemes of\nwhich we are aware (Power and x86 CPUs for C11, AMD GPUs for OpenCL) remain\nvalid in our revised models. Using the Herd memory model simulator, we show\nthat our overhaul leads to an exponential improvement in simulation time for\nC11 litmus tests compared with the original model, making exhaustive simulation\ncompetitive, time-wise, with the non-exhaustive CDSChecker tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 15:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 09:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 14:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In\na classical facility game, each agent wants to be as close to a facility as\npossible, and the cost of an agent can be defined as the distance between her\nlocation and the closest facility. In an obnoxious facility game, each agent\nwants to be far away from all facilities, and her utility is the distance from\nher location to the facility set. The objective of each agent is to minimize\nher cost or maximize her utility. An agent may lie if, by doing so, more\nbenefit can be obtained. We are interested in social choice mechanisms that do\nnot utilize payments. The game designer aims at a mechanism that is\nstrategy-proof, in the sense that any agent cannot benefit by misreporting her\naddress, or, even better, group strategy-proof, in the sense that any coalition\nof agents cannot all benefit by lying. Meanwhile, it is desirable to have the\nmechanism to be approximately optimal with respect to a chosen objective\nfunction. Several models for such approximation mechanism design without money\nfor facility games have been proposed. In this paper we briefly review these\nmodels and related results for both deterministic and randomized mechanisms,\nand meanwhile we present a general framework for approximation mechanism design\nwithout money for facility games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 05:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

The growth of\nperturbations in the scalar field model is substantially faster than in the\ncold dark matter model. When the wavelength of the pertubations approaches the\ncosmological horizon (Hubble length), a relativistic treatment is mandatory.

It involves screening for pairs of tetrahedra\nrepresenting interacting amino acids at the interface of the protein-protein\ncomplex, with one tetrahedron on each protomer. H-bonds and VDW interactions at\ntheir interface are first determined and then interacting tetrahedral motifs\n(one from each protomer) representing backbone or side chain centroids of the\ninteracting amino acids, are then built. The method requires that the protein\nprotomers be transformed first into double-centroid reduced representation\n(Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a). The method is applied to\na set of 801 protein structures in the PDB with unknown functions, which were\nscreened for pairs of tetrahedral motifs characteristic of nine binary\ncomplexes, namely: (1.) RAP-Gmppnp-cRAF1 Ras-binding domain; (2.) RHOA-protein\nkinase PKN/PRK1 effector domain; (3.) RAC-HOGD1; (4.) RAC-P67PHOX; (5.)\nkinase-associated phosphatase (KAP)-phosphoCDK2; (6.) Ig Fc-protein A fragment\nB; (7.) Ig light chain dimers; (8.) beta catenin-HTCF-4; and (9.) IL-2\nhomodimers. Our search method found 33, 297, 62, 63, 120, 0, 108, 16 and 504\nputative complexes, respectively. After considering the degree of interface\noverlap between the protomers, these numbers were significantly trimmed down to\n4, 2, 1, 8, 3, 0, 1, 1 and 1, respectively. Negative and positive control\nexperiments indicate that the screening process has acceptable specificity and\nsensitivity. The results were further validated by applying the CP and TS\nmethods (Reyes, V.M., 2015b) for the quantitative determination of interface\nburial and inter-protomer overlap in the complex. Our method is simple, fast\nand scalable, and once the partner interface 3D SMs are identified, they can be\nused to computationally dock the two protomers together to form the complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 01:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}
