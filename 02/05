More specifically, complex networks concepts\nand methods from dynamical systems theory have been successfully applied to\nrecognize stylistic patterns in written texts. Despite the large amount of\nstudies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a few studies\nhave assessed the relevance of attributes derived from the analysis of\nstylistic fluctuations. Because fluctuations represent a pivotal factor for\ncharacterizing a myriad of real systems, this study focused on the analysis of\nthe properties of stylistic fluctuations in texts via topological analysis of\ncomplex networks and intermittency measurements. The results showed that\ndifferent authors display distinct fluctuation patterns. In particular, it was\nfound that it is possible to identify the authorship of books using the\nintermittency of specific words. Taken together, the results described here\nsuggest that the patterns found in stylistic fluctuations could be used to\nanalyze other related complex systems. Furthermore, the discovery of novel\npatterns related to textual stylistic fluctuations indicates that these\npatterns could be useful to improve the state of the art of many\nstylistic-based natural language processing tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 16:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

Given appropriate\narchitectural descriptions, assume/guarantee contracts, and compositional\nreasoning rules, these techniques can be used to prove important safety\nproperties about the architecture prior to system construction. For these\nproofs to be meaningful, each leaf-level component contract must be realizable;\ni.e., it is possible to construct a component such that for any input allowed\nby the contract assumptions, there is some output value that the component can\nproduce that satisfies the contract guarantees. We have recently proposed (in\n[1]) a contract-based realizability checking algorithm for assume/guarantee\ncontracts over infinite theories supported by SMT solvers such as linear\ninteger/real arithmetic and uninterpreted functions. In that work, we used an\nSMT solver and an algorithm similar to k-induction to establish the\nrealizability of a contract, and justified our approach via a hand proof. Given\nthe central importance of realizability to our virtual integration approach, we\nwanted additional confidence that our approach was sound. This paper describes\na complete formalization of the approach in the Coq proof and specification\nlanguage. During formalization, we found several small mistakes and missing\nassumptions in our reasoning.

However, at T ~ 1100K, the\ntemperature below which chondrules collide as solids (and hence usually\nbounce), coalescence times for droplets of appropriate composition are measured\nin tens of seconds. Even at 1025K, at which temperature theory predicts that\nthe chondrules must have collided extremely slowly to have stuck together, the\ncoalescence time scale is still less than an hour. These coalescence time\nscales are too short for the collision of molten chondrules to explain the\nobserved frequency of compound chondrules. We suggest instead a scenario where\nchondrules stuck together in slow collisions while fully solid; and the\nresulting chondrule pair was subsequently briefly heated to a temperature in\nthe range of 900-1025K. In that temperature window the coalescence time is\nfinite but long, covering a span of hours to a decade.

Moreover, recent developments indicate that magnetic\nreconnection in the corona likely occurs in highly fragmented current layers,\nand that this typically leads to a dramatic increase in the topological\ncomplexity beyond that of the equilibrium field. In this paper we investigate\nthe consequences of reconnection at the open-closed flux boundary (\"interchange\nreconnection\") in a fragmented current layer. We demonstrate that it leads to a\nsituation in which magnetic flux (and therefore plasma) from open and closed\nfield regions is efficiently mixed together. This corresponds to an increase in\nthe length and complexity of the open-closed boundary. Thus, whenever\nreconnection occurs at a null point or separator of the open-closed boundary,\nthe associated separatrix arc of the so-called \"S-web\" in the high corona\nbecomes not a single line but a band of finite thickness within which the\nopen-closed flux boundary is highly structured.

We find that if scenario (i) had been pursued the lifetime of the\nepidemic would have been three months shorter and the total number of infected\nindividuals 80\\% less than in scenario (ii). Our projection under scenario (ii)\nis that the spreading will stop by mid-spring 2015.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 20:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 20:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 May 2015 03:05:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 31 May 2015 15:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 00:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

The method is based on\nBiot's theory of wave propagation in porous materials. Empirical relations and\na priori information is used to characterize snow as a porous material as a\nfunction of porosity. Plane wave theory and an equivalent pore fluid are used\nto solve Biot's differential equations and to asses the impact of the air and\nwater in the pore space. The liquid water in the pore space of a snow pack\nreduces the velocity of the first compressional wave by roughly 300 m/s for\nevery 0.1 increase in liquid water saturation. Also the attenuation of the\ncompressional waves is increased with increasing liquid water content. Two end\nmember models for compaction are evaluated to asses the importance of an\nindependent density measurement for an estimate of liquid pore water saturation\nin snow with acoustic waves. The two end members correspond to no compaction at\nall and to a melting sphere packing where the grains remain in contact. The\nchange of velocity for the first compressional wave was found to strongly\ndepend on the compaction model, while the velocity of the second compressional\nwave mainly depends on liquid water saturation. Also the attenuation for both\ncompressional waves depends mainly on the liquid water saturation and only\nlittle on the compaction model.

This is done applying appropriate canonical\nphase-space transformations to the NLO spin-spin Hamiltonian in\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) coordinates, and systematically adding \"effectiv\"\nquantities at NLO to all spin-squared terms appearing in the EOB Hamiltonian.\nAs required by consistency, the introduced quantities reduce to zero in the\ntest- mass limit. We expose the result both in a general gauge and in a\ngauge-fixed form. The last is chosen such as to minimize the number of new\ncoefficients that have to be inserted into the effective spin squared. As a\nresult, the 25 parameters that describe the ADM NLO spin-spin dynamics get\ncondensed into only 12 EOB terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In addition to advantages of the Lomb-Scargle method such as treatment of\nnon-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram\nsignificantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light\ncurves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES and LSST). The light curves in each band are\nmodeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared\nacross all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which\ndrives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all\nbands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base\nmodel and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the\neffective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. We use\nsimulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to\ndemonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the\nliterature, and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the\ncorrect period in the majority of LSST's bright RR Lyrae stars with as little\nas six months of LSST data.

Measuring star formation at a local scale is important to constrain\nstar formation laws.

Aims.\nWe want to understand the impact of the resolution on the determination of the\nspatially resolved star formation rate (SFR) and other directly associated\nphysical parameters such as the attenuation. Methods. We have carried out a\nmulti-scale, pixel-by-pixel study of the nearby galaxy M33.

We have found that there are strong,\nscale-dependent, discrepancies up to a factor 3 between monochromatic SFR\nestimators and Halpha+24 micron. The scaling factors between individual IR\nbands and the SFR show a strong dependence on the spatial scale and on the\nintensity of star formation. Finally, strong variations of the differential\nreddening between the nebular emission and the stellar continuum are seen,\ndepending on the specific SFR (sSFR) and on the resolution. At the finest\nspatial scales, there is little differential reddening at high sSFR. The\ndifferential reddening increases with decreasing sSFR. At the coarsest spatial\nscales the differential reddening is compatible with the canonical value found\nfor starburst galaxies. Conclusions. Our results confirm that monochromatic\nestimators of the SFR are unreliable at scales smaller than 1 kpc.

A large set of $2.5$D MHD simulations has been\ncarried out for axisymmetric viscous/diffusive disc accretion to rotating\nmagnetized stars for the purpose of assessing the conditions where the outflows\nor jets are asymmetric relative to the equatorial plane. We consider initial\nmagnetic fields that are symmetric about the equatorial plane and consist of a\nradially distributed field threading the disc (disc-field) and a stellar dipole\nfield.({\\bf 1}). For pure disc-fields the symmetry or asymmetry of the outflows\nis affected by the midplane plasma $\\beta$ of the disc (where $\\beta$ is the\nratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure). For the low density\ndiscs with small plasma $\\beta$ values, outflows are observed to be symmetric\nto within $10\\%$ over timescales of hundreds of inner disc orbits. For the\ndenser higher $\\beta$ discs, the coupling of the upper and lower coronal\nplasmas is broken, and quasi-periodic field motion in the two hemispheres\nbecomes different. This asymmetry leads to asymmetric episodic outflows. ({\\bf\n2.}) Accreting stars with a stellar dipole field and no disc-field exhibit\nepisodic, two component outflows - a magnetospheric wind and an inner disc wind\nfrom somewhat larger radial distances. Both are characterized by similar\nvelocity profiles but the magnetospheric wind has densities $\\gtrsim 10$ times\nthat of the disc wind. ({\\bf 3}.)Adding a disc-field parallel to the stellar\ndipole field acts to enhance the magnetospheric winds but suppress the disc\nwind. ({\\bf 4}.)

In this paper, we\naddress this problem in the framework of recently discovered 1-parameter\ndeformation of ${\\rm SO}(4,4)$ and ${\\rm SO}(5,3)$ dyonic gaugings, for which\nthe base point of the scalar manifold corresponds to an unstable de Sitter\ncritical point. In the gauge-field frame where the embedding tensor takes the\nvalue in the sum of the {\\bf 36} and {\\bf 36'} representations of ${\\rm\nSL}(8)$, we present a scheme that allows us to derive an analytic expression\nfor the scalar potential. With the help of this formalism, we derive the full\npotential and gauge coupling functions in analytic forms for the ${\\rm\nSO}(3)\\times {\\rm SO}(3)$-invariant subsectors of ${\\rm SO}(4,4)$ and ${\\rm\nSO}(5,3)$ gaugings, and argue that there exist no new critical points in\naddition to those discovered so far. For the ${\\rm SO}(4,4)$ gauging, we also\nstudy the behavior of 6-dimensional scalar fields in this sector near the\nDall'Agata-Inverso de Sitter critical point at which the negative eigenvalue of\nthe scalar mass square with the largest modulus goes to zero as the deformation\nparameter approaches a critical value. We find that when the deformation\nparameter is taken sufficiently close to the critical value, inflation lasts\nmore than 60 e-folds even if the initial point of the inflaton allows an\n$O(0.1)$ deviation in Planck units from the Dall'Agata-Inverso critical point.\nIt turns out that the spectral index $n_s$ of the curvature perturbation at the\ntime of the 60 e-folding number is always about 0.96 and within the $1\\sigma$\nrange $n_s=0.9639\\pm0.0047$ obtained by Planck, irrespective of the value of\nthe $\\eta$ parameter at the critical saddle point.

The layered neural networks thus represent a\nrobust and efficient technique to overcome the time-consuming simulations of a\ncalibrated model. The potential of neural networks consists in simple\nimplementation and high versatility in approximating nonlinear relationships.\nTherefore, there were several approaches proposed to accelerate the calibration\nof nonlinear models by neural networks.

The advantages and\ndrawbacks of particular strategies are demonstrated on the calibration of four\nparameters of the affinity hydration model from simulated data as well as from\nexperimental measurements. This model is highly nonlinear, but computationally\ncheap thus allowing its calibration without any approximation and better\nquantification of results obtained by the examined calibration strategies.

In most\nastrophysical environments the Reynolds numbers are large and therefore the\ntransition to turbulence is inevitable. This turbulence must be taken into\naccount for any theory of magnetic reconnection, since the initially laminar\nconfigurations can transit to the turbulence state, what is demonstrated by 3D\nhigh resolution numerical simulations. We discuss ideas of how turbulence can\nmodify reconnection with the focus on the Lazarian & Vishniac (1999)\nreconnection model and present numerical evidence supporting the model and\ndemonstrate that it is closely connected to the concept of Richardson diffusion\nand compatible with the Lagrangian dynamics of magnetized fluids. We point out\nthat the Generalized Ohm's Law, that accounts for turbulent motion, predicts\nthe subdominance of the microphysical plasma effects for a realistically\nturbulent media. We show that on of the most dramatic consequences of\nturbulence is the violation of the generally accepted notion of magnetic flux\nfreezing. This notion is a corner stone of most theories dealing with\nmagnetized plasmas and therefore its change induces fundamental shifts in\naccepted paradigms like turbulent reconnection entailing the diffusion process\nthat is essential for understanding star formation. We argue, that at\nsufficiently high Reynolds numbers the process of tearing reconnection should\ntransfer to turbulent reconnection. We discuss flares predicted by turbulent\nreconnection and relate them to solar flares and gamma ray bursts. We analyze\nsolar observations, measurements in the solar wind or heliospheric current\nsheet, and show their correspondence with turbulent reconnection predictions.\nFinally, we discuss 1st Order Fermi acceleration as a natural consequence of\nthe turbulent reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 00:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

A major limitation of\nprevious approaches is their inability to handle conditional and synergistic\ninteractions that emerge when collectively analysing genes subject to different\nregulatory mechanisms. This limitation reduces overall predictive power and\nthus the reliability of downstream biological inference.\n  Results: We introduce an analytical modelling framework (TREEOME: tree of\nmodels of expression) that integrates epigenetic and transcriptomic data by\nseparating genes into putative regulatory classes. Current predictive modelling\napproaches have found both DNA methylation and histone modification epigenetic\ndata to provide little or no improvement in accuracy of prediction of\ntranscript abundance despite, for example, distinct anti-correlation between\nmRNA levels and promoter-localised DNA methylation. To improve on this, in\nTREEOME we evaluate four possible methods of formulating gene-level DNA\nmethylation metrics, which provide a foundation for identifying gene-level\nmethylation events and subsequent differential analysis, whereas most previous\ntechniques operate at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides. We demonstrate\nTREEOME by integrating gene-level DNA methylation (bisulfite-seq) and histone\nmodification (ChIP-seq) data to accurately predict genome-wide mRNA transcript\nabundance (RNA-seq) for H1-hESC and GM12878 cell lines.\n  Availability: TREEOME is implemented using open-source software and made\navailable as a pre-configured bootable reference environment.

We collect a large-scale image and user\nbehavior dataset from Behance.net. The dataset consists of 1.9 million images\nand over 300 million view records from 1.9 million users. We validate our\nfeature learning paradigm on this dataset and find that the learned feature\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art image features in learning\nbetter image similarities. We also show that the learned feature performs\ncompetitively on various recognition benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 03:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2015 19:27:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 18:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-10"}

Energy-efficient routing of such\nvehicles is of great interest for both financial and environmental\nsustainability. Given a multi-capacity RGV working on a linear track in AFHS,\nwe consider its optimal routing under two-sided loading/unloading (TSLU)\noperations, in which energy consumption is minimized under conflict-avoidance\nand time window constraints. The energy consumption takes account of\nrouting-dependent gross weight and dynamics of the RGV, and the\nconflict-avoidance constraints ensure conflict-free transport service under\nTSLU operations. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program,\nand solved by incorporating valid inequalities that exploit structural\nproperties of the problem. The static problem model and solution approach are\nthen integrated with a rolling-horizon approach to solve the dynamic routing\nproblem where air cargo enters and departs from the system dynamically in time.\nSimulation results suggest that the proposed strategy is able to route an RGV\nto transport air cargo with an energy cost that is considerably lower than one\nof the most commonly used heuristic methods implemented in current practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 08:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

While a number of recent systems addressed the transportation\nmode detection problem using the ubiquitous mobile phones, these studies either\nleverage GPS, the inertial sensors, and/or multiple cell towers information.\nHowever, these different phone sensors have high energy consumption, limited to\na small subset of phones (e.g. high-end phones or phones that support\nneighbouring cell tower information), cannot work in certain areas (e.g. inside\ntunnels for GPS), and/or work only from the user side.\n  In this paper, we present a transportation mode detection system, MonoSense,\nthat leverages the phone serving cell information only. The basic idea is that\nthe phone speed can be correlated with features extracted from both the serving\ncell tower ID and the received signal strength from it. To achieve high\ndetection accuracy with this limited information, MonoSense leverages diversity\nalong multiple axes to extract novel features. Specifically, MonoSense extracts\nfeatures from both the time and frequency domain information available from the\nserving cell tower over different sliding widow sizes. More importantly, we\nshow also that both the logarithmic and linear RSS scales can provide different\ninformation about the movement of a phone, further enriching the feature space\nand leading to higher accuracy.\n  Evaluation of MonoSense using 135 hours of cellular traces covering 485 km\nand collected by four users using different Android phones shows that it can\nachieve an average precision and recall of 89.26% and 89.84% respectively in\ndifferentiating between the stationary, walking, and driving modes using only\nthe serving cell tower information, highlighting MonoSense ability to enable a\nwide set of intelligent transportation applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 08:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

A temporal abstraction\npattern defines an abstraction relation between an observation hypothesis and a\nset of observations constituting its evidence support. New observations are\ngenerated abductively from any subset of the evidence of a pattern, building an\nabstraction hierarchy of observations in which higher levels contain those\nobservations with greater interpretative value of the physiological processes\nunderlying a given signal. Non-monotonic reasoning techniques have been applied\nto this model in order to find the best interpretation of a set of initial\nobservations, permitting even to correct these observations by removing, adding\nor modifying them in order to make them consistent with the available domain\nknowledge. Some preliminary experiments have been conducted to apply this\nframework to a well known and bounded problem: the QRS detection on ECG\nsignals. The objective is not to provide a new better QRS detector, but to test\nthe validity of an abductive paradigm. These experiments show that a knowledge\nbase comprising just a few very simple rhythm abstraction patterns can enhance\nthe results of a state of the art algorithm by significantly improving its\ndetection F1-score, besides proving the ability of the abductive framework to\ncorrect both sensitivity and specificity failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 10:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

This feature has been used in several spectral\nstability analyses in order to reduce the complexity of the linear stability\nproblem. In these studies the factorization of the Evans function was\nestablished via geometric arguments that need to be customized for the specific\nequations and solutions under consideration.

By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes\nmore congested and, therefore, controlling of charging demands should be\ncarefully aligned with the available resources. This paper focuses on an EV\ncharging network equipped with different charging technologies and proposes two\nframeworks. In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV\npopulation is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty\nfleets. This which necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to\nprevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This\nframework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer\nrequest rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality\nof service. The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for\nsmaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of\nresources required to provide certain levels of quality of service to each\nclass. The results show that the proposed frameworks ensure grid reliability\nand lead to significant savings in capacity planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 12:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

In order to determine a small set of proposals with a high\nrecall, a common scheme is extracting multiple features followed by a ranking\nalgorithm which however, incurs two major challenges: {\\bf 1)} The ranking\nmodel often imposes pairwise constraints between each proposal, rendering the\nproblem away from an efficient training/testing phase; {\\bf 2)} Linear kernels\nare utilized due to the computational and memory bottleneck of training a\nkernelized model.\n  In this paper, we remedy these two issues by suggesting a {\\em kernelized\npartial ranking model}.

The first is the construction of\nwavelet transforms from B-spline scaling functions defined on a grid of\nnon-equispaced knots. The new construction extends the equispaced,\nbiorthogonal, compactly supported Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelets. The new\nconstruction is based on the factorisation of wavelet transforms into lifting\nsteps. The second and third contributions are new insights on how to use these\nand other wavelets in statistical applications. The second contribution is\nrelated to the bias of a wavelet representation. It is investigated how the\nfine scaling coefficients should be derived from the observations. In the\ncontext of equispaced data, it is common practice to simply take the\nobservations as fine scale coefficients. It is argued in this paper that this\nis not acceptable for non-interpolating wavelets on non-equidistant data.\nFinally, the third contribution is the study of the variance in a\nnon-orthogonal wavelet transform in a new framework, replacing the numerical\ncondition as a measure for non-orthogonality. By controlling the variances of\nthe reconstruction from the wavelet coefficients, the new framework allows us\nto design wavelet transforms on irregular point sets with a focus on their use\nfor smoothing or other applications in statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 13:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 11:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

It is\nthus becoming increasingly hard to collect sufficient training data to learn\nconventional models for each category. This issue may be ameliorated by the\nincreasingly popular 'zero-shot learning' (ZSL) paradigm. In this framework a\nmapping is constructed between visual features and a human interpretable\nsemantic description of each category, allowing categories to be recognised in\nthe absence of any training data. Existing ZSL studies focus primarily on image\ndata, and attribute-based semantic representations. In this paper, we address\nzero-shot recognition in contemporary video action recognition tasks, using\nsemantic word vector space as the common space to embed videos and category\nlabels. This is more challenging because the mapping between the semantic space\nand space-time features of videos containing complex actions is more complex\nand harder to learn. We demonstrate that a simple self-training and data\naugmentation strategy can significantly improve the efficacy of this mapping.\nExperiments on human action datasets including HMDB51 and UCF101 demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves the state-of-the-art zero-shot action recognition\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 13:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

The\nvoltage dependence of the magnetoresistance splits into three distinct regimes.\nThe first regime matches well known inorganic spintronic regimes, corresponding\nto barrier controlled spin injection or the well known conductivity mismatch\ncase. The second regime at intermediate voltages corresponds to strongly\nsuppressed magnetoresistance. The third regime develops at higher voltages and\naccounts for a novel paradigm.

We quantify the amplitude fluctuations of the time\naveraged mean squared displacement as function of the length of the time series\nand the lag time. In particular, we observe a weak ergodicity breaking of this\ngeneralised diffusion process: even in the long time limit the ensemble and\ntime averaged mean squared displacements are strictly disparate.

The structure of the paper is similar to that presented in\nthe 2013 Planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalization\nand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.\nThe in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on measurements performed\nduring observations of Jupiter. By stacking data from seven Jupiter transits,\nthe main beam profiles are measured down to -25 dB at 30 and 44 GHz, and down\nto -30 dB at 70 GHz. It has been confirmed that the agreement between the\nsimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency\nband (within the 20 dB contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and\n70 GHz; 0.2% at 44 GHz). Simulated polarized beams are used for the computation\nof the effective beam window functions. The error budget for the window\nfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, and\naccounts for the radiometer band shapes. The total uncertainties in the\neffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively\n(at $\\ell \\approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 GHz (at $\\ell \\approx 1000$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The algorithm is\nthe same as used for the 2013 release, apart from small changes in parameter\nsettings. We validate the procedure through simulations. Special emphasis is\nput on the control of systematics, which is particularly important for accurate\npolarization analysis. We also produce low-resolution versions of the maps, and\ncorresponding noise covariance matrices. These serve as input in later analysis\nsteps and parameter estimation.

The\ndata from the entire 2.5 year HFI mission include almost five independent\nfull-sky surveys. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from\n100 to 857 GHz. To obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such a\nlarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. The\n545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmospheric\nemission. The lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 GHz) are calibrated using the\ntime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the\n\"orbital dipole\". This source of calibration only depends on the satellite\nvelocity with respect to the solar system. Using a CMB temperature of 2.7255\n+/- 0.0006 K, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the CMB\nsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \\mu K) which is approximatively 1\\sigma\\ higher\nthan the WMAP measurement with a direction that is consistent between both\nexperiments. We describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity and\nlinear polarization from the HFI timelines, and the scheme used to set the zero\nlevel of the maps a posteriori. We also summarize the noise characteristics of\nthe HFI maps in the 2015 Planck data release and present some null tests to\nassess their quality. Finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and in\nparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors that\nleads to spurious polarization signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 16:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

For the temperature\nanalysis, we combine the Planck observations with the 9-year WMAP sky maps and\nthe Haslam et al. 408 MHz map to derive a joint model of CMB, synchrotron,\nfree-free, spinning dust, CO, line emission in the 94 and 100 GHz channels, and\nthermal dust emission. Full-sky maps are provided with angular resolutions\nvarying between 7.5 arcmin and 1 deg. Global parameters (monopoles, dipoles,\nrelative calibration, and bandpass errors) are fitted jointly with the sky\nmodel, and best-fit values are tabulated. For polarization, the model includes\nCMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust emission. These models provide excellent\nfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK\nover 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional\nerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky. The main limitations of\nthe temperature model at the lower frequencies are degeneracies among the\nspinning dust, free-free, and synchrotron components; additional observations\nfrom external low-frequency experiments will be essential to break these. The\nmain limitations of the temperature model at the higher frequencies are\nuncertainties in the 545 and 857 GHz calibration and zero-points. For\npolarization, the main outstanding issues are instrumental systematics in the\n100-353 GHz bands on large angular scales in the form of\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage, uncertainties in the analog-to-digital\nconversion, and very long time constant corrections, all of which are expected\nto improve in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 23:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

These data are consistent with the\nsix-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and\nlensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9)\nkm/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar\nspectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured\nparameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck\ntemperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a\nreionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with\nother astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective\nnumber of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is\nconstrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005.\nFor LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent\nwith the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck\n(BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We\nfind no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation\nof state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big\nbang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent\nagreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and\ndeviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics.\nThe Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the\nJLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher\nthan inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart\nfrom these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description\nof the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 13:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 14:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

We start with\ncases where the DE only directly affects the background evolution, considering\nTaylor expansions of the equation of state, principal component analysis and\nparameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar\nfield. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we significantly\nimprove present constraints. We then move to general parameterizations of the\nDE or MG perturbations that encompass both effective field theories and the\nphenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range\nof specific models, such as k-essence, f(R) theories and coupled DE. In\naddition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use baryonic\nacoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble\nconstant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological\nperturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational\nlensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and\nfor breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck\nand background data sets. All results that include only background\nparameterizations are in agreement with LCDM. When testing models that also\nchange perturbations (even when the background is fixed to LCDM), some tensions\nappear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is \\sim 2 sigma for Planck\nTT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials\nwith a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to at most 3 sigma when\nexternal data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB\nlensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 15:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Using three classes of optimal bispectrum estimators -\nseparable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and modal - we obtain consistent\nvalues for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes,\nquoting as our final result from temperature alone fNL^local=2.5+\\-5.7,\nfNL^equil=-16+\\-70 and fNL^ortho=-34+\\-33(68%CL). Combining temperature and\npolarization data we obtain fNL^local=0.8+\\-5.0, fNL^equil=-4+\\-43 and\nfNL^ortho=-26+\\-21 (68%CL). The results are based on cross-validation of these\nestimators on simulations, are stable across component separation techniques,\npass an extensive suite of tests, and are consistent with Minkowski functionals\nbased measurements. The effect of time-domain de-glitching systematics on the\nbispectrum is negligible. In spite of these test outcomes we conservatively\nlabel the results including polarization data as preliminary, owing to a known\nmismatch of the noise model in simulations and the data. Beyond fNL estimates,\nwe present model-independent reconstructions of the CMB bispectrum and derive\nconstraints on early universe scenarios that generate NG, including general\nsingle-field and axion inflation, initial state modifications, parity-violating\ntensor bispectra, and directionally dependent vector models. We also present a\nwide survey of scale-dependent oscillatory bispectra, and we look for\nisocurvature NG. Our constraint on the local primordial trispectrum amplitude\nis gNL^local=(-9.0+\\-7.7)x10^4 (68%CL), and we perform an analysis of\nadditional trispectrum shapes. The global picture is one of consistency with\nthe premises of the LambdaCDM cosmology, namely that the structure we observe\ntoday was sourced by adiabatic, passive, Gaussian, and primordial seed\nperturbations.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 09:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

We present the first searches using\nCMB polarization for correlations induced by a non-trivial topology with a\nfundamental domain intersecting, or nearly intersecting, the last scattering\nsurface (at comoving distance $\\chi_{rec}$). We specialize to flat spaces with\ntoroidal and slab topologies, finding that explicit searches for the latter are\nsensitive to other topologies with antipodal symmetry. These searches yield no\ndetection of a compact topology at a scale below the diameter of the last\nscattering surface. The limits on the radius $R_i$ of the largest sphere\ninscribed in the topological domain (at log-likelihood-ratio $\\Delta\\ln{L}>-5$\nrelative to a simply-connected flat Planck best-fit model) are\n$R_i>0.97\\chi_{rec}$ for the cubic torus and $R_i>0.56\\chi_{rec}$ for the slab.\nThe limit for the cubic torus from the matched-circles search is numerically\nequivalent, $R_i>0.97\\chi_{rec}$ (99% CL) from polarisation data alone. We also\nperform a Bayesian search for a Bianchi VII$_h$ geometry. In the non-physical\nsetting where the Bianchi cosmology is decoupled from the standard cosmology,\nPlanck temperature data favour the inclusion of a Bianchi component. However,\nthe cosmological parameters generating this pattern are in strong disagreement\nwith those found from CMB anisotropy data alone. Fitting the induced\npolarization pattern for this model to Planck data requires an amplitude of\n$-0.1\\pm0.04$ compared to +1 if the model were to be correct. In the physical\nsetting where the Bianchi parameters are fit simultaneously with the standard\ncosmological parameters, we find no evidence for a Bianchi VII$_h$ cosmology\nand constrain the vorticity of such models to $(\\omega/H)_0<7.6\\times10^{-10}$\n(95% CL).

Overall, Planck data constrain the amplitude\nof PMFs to less than a few nanogauss. In particular, individual limits coming\nfrom the analysis of the CMB angular power spectra, using the Planck\nlikelihood, are $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.4$ nG (where $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}$ is\nthe comoving field amplitude at a scale of 1 Mpc) at 95% confidence level,\nassuming zero helicity, and $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 5.6$ nG for a maximally\nhelical field.For nearly scale-invariant PMFs we obtain\n$B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}<2.0$ nG and $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}<0.9$ nG if the impact of\nPMFs on the ionization history of the Universe is included. From the analysis\nof magnetically-induced non-Gaussianity we obtain three different values,\ncorresponding to three applied methods, all below 5 nG. The constraint from the\nmagnetically-induced passive-tensor bispectrum is $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 2.8$\nnG. A search for preferred directions in the magnetically-induced passive\nbispectrum yields $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 4.5$ nG, whereas the the\ncompensated-scalar bispectrum gives $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 3$ nG. The analysis\nof the Faraday rotation of CMB polarization by PMFs uses the Planck power\nspectra in $EE$ and $BB$ at 70 GHz and gives $B_{1\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}}< 1380$ nG. In\nour final analysis, we consider the harmonic-space correlations produced by\nAlfv\\'en waves, finding no significant evidence for the presence of these\nwaves. Together, these results comprise a comprehensive set of constraints on\npossible PMFs with Planck data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 14:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

The CMB is cross-correlated with\ndifferent LSS tracers: the NVSS, SDSS and WISE catalogues, and the Planck 2015\nlensing map. This cross-correlation yields a detection at $4\\,\\sigma$, where\nmost of the signal-to-noise is due to the Planck lensing and NVSS. In fact, the\nISW effect is detected only from the Planck data (through the ISW-lensing\nbispectrum) at $\\approx 3\\,\\sigma$, which is similar to the detection level\nachieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming from all the\ncatalogues. The ISW signal allow us to detect $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ at more than\n$3\\,\\sigma$. This cross-correlation analysis is performed only with the Planck\ntemperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015 release\ndo not permit significant improvement of the CMB-LSS cross-correlation\ndetectability. Nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalously\nlarge ISW signal previously reported through the stacking of CMB features at\nthe locations of known superstructures. We find that the current Planck\npolarization data do not exclude that this signal could be caused by the ISW\neffect. In addition, the stacking of the Planck lensing map on the locations of\nsuperstructures exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scale\nstructures. Finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the ISW\ntemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all the\npreviously mentioned LSS tracers. In particular, we construct a map of the ISW\nsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained from\nsimulations. We also explore the reconstruction of the ISW anisotropies caused\nby the LSS traced by the 2MPZ survey by directly inverting the density field\ninto the gravitational potential field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 11:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected\nvia their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6,\nand is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology\nsample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible\nconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the\nlarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in\nredshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of\ngravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide\npriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $(1-b)$. In addition, we use lensing\nof cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck\nclusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various\ncalibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter\nfluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the Planck analysis\nof primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of $(1-b)$\nthe tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it\nremains substantial ($3.7\\,\\sigma$) for the largest estimated value. We also\nexamine constraints on extensions to the base flat $\\Lambda$CDM model by\ncombining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour\nnon-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the\noverall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the\nHubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current\nastrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations\nfrom the current 10%-level to 1% would significantly strengthen these combined\nanalyses and provide a stringent test of the base $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 08:04:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 16:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-20"}

It is based on the Planck 48 months mission\ndata that are currently being released to the astronomical community. The PGCC\ncatalogue is an observational catalogue consisting exclusively of Galactic cold\nsources.

After rejection of possible extragalactic\ncontaminants, the PGCC catalogue contains 13188 Galactic sources spread across\nthe whole sky, i.e., from the Galactic plane to high latitudes, following the\nspatial distribution of the main molecular cloud complexes. The median\ntemperature of PGCC sources lies between 13 and 14.5 K, depending on the\nquality of the flux density measurements, with a temperature ranging from 5.8\nto 20 K after removing sources with the 1% largest temperature estimates. Using\nseven independent methods, reliable distance estimates have been obtained for\n5574 sources, which allows us to derive their physical properties such as their\nmass, physical size, mean density and luminosity. The PGCC sources are located\nmainly in the solar neighbourhood, up to a distance of 10.5 kpc towards the\nGalactic centre, and range from low-mass cores to large molecular clouds.\nBecause of this diversity and because the PGCC catalogue contains sources in\nvery different environments, the catalogue is useful to investigate the\nevolution from molecular clouds to cores.

Thus, we highlight five features of neutrosophic\nuncertainty such as ambiguity, ignorance, contradiction, neutrality and\nsaturation. These five features are supplemented until a seven partition of\nunity by adding two features of neutrosophic certainty such as truth and\nfalsity.\n  The paper also presents the particular forms of neutrosophic entropy obtained\nin the case of bifuzzy representations, intuitionistic fuzzy representations,\nparaconsistent fuzzy representations and finally the case of fuzzy\nrepresentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 07:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}
