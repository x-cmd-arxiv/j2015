Based on the\nobservation that smoothness or textures within an image patch corresponds to\nsparse spectral components in the frequency domain, ALOHA exploits the\nexistence of annihilating filters and the associated rank-deficient Hankel\nmatrices in the image domain to estimate the missing pixels. By extending this\nidea, here we propose a novel impulse noise removal algorithm using sparse +\nlow rank decomposition of an annihilating filter-based Hankel matrix. The new\napproach, what we call the robust ALOHA, is motivated by the observation that\nan image corrupted with impulse noises has intact pixels; so the impulse noises\ncan be modeled as sparse components, whereas the underlying image can be still\nmodeled using a low-rank Hankel structured matrix. To solve the sparse + low\nrank decomposition problem, we propose an alternating direction method of\nmultiplier (ADMM) method with initial factorized matrices coming from low rank\nmatrix fitting (LMaFit) algorithm. To adapt the local image statistics that\nhave distinct spectral distributions, the robust ALOHA is applied patch by\npatch. Experimental results from two types of impulse noises - random valued\nimpulse noises and salt/pepper noises - for both single channel and\nmulti-channel color images demonstrate that the robust ALOHA outperforms the\nexisting algorithms up to 8dB in terms of the peak signal to noise ratio\n(PSNR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 16:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

The jet is assumed to be strongly collimated (half-opening angle\n$\\Theta\\sim 1\\deg$) and mildly relativistic (bulk velocity $\\beta=V_{b}/c\\sim\n0.03-0.3$). Its X-ray spectrum is found by integrating over thin slices of\nconstant temperature, radiating in optically thin coronal regime. The\ntemperature profile along the jet and corresponding differential emission\nmeasure distribution are calculated with full account for gas cooling due to\nexpansion and radiative losses. Since the model predicts both the spectral\nshape and luminosity of the jet's emission, its normalisation is not a free\nparameter if the source distance is known. We also explore the possibility of\nusing simple X-ray observables (such as flux ratios in different energy bands)\nto constrain physical parameters of the jet (e.g. gas temperature and density\nat its base) without broad-band fitting of high-resolution spectra.

By means of breaking the\ngeometric symmetry of the metamolecule, the toroidal mode can be excited by\nlinearly polarized light and appears as a Fano resonance dip in the forward\nscattered light. We provide simple optimization protocols for maximizing the\ntoroidal dipole mode excitation. This opens up possibilities for simplified\ncontrol and driving of metamaterial arrays consisting of toroidal dipole\nunit-cell resonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 18:18:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 16:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 15:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

The core developes a\nBonnor-Ebert (BE)-like density profile, while at the time of singularity (the\nprotostar) formation the envelope approaches a singular-isothermal-sphere\n(SIS)-like $r^-2$ density profile. However, these structures are never\nhydrostatic. In this case, the central flat region is characterized by an\ninfall speed, while the envelope is characterized by a uniform speed. This\nimplies that the hydrostatic SIS initial condition leading to Shu's classical\ninside-out solution is not expected to occur, and therefore neither should the\ninside-out solution. Instead, the solution collapses from the outside-in,\nnaturally explaining the observation of extended infall velocities. The core,\ndefined by the radius at which it merges with the background, has a\ntime-variable mass, and evolves along the locus of the ensemble of observed\nprestellar cores in a plot of $M/M_{BE}$ vs. $M$, where $M$ is the core's mass\nand $M_{BE}$ is the critical Bonnor-Ebert mass, spanning the range from the\n\"stable\" to the \"unstable\" regimes, even though it is collapsing at all times.\nWe conclude that the presence of an unstable background allows a core to evolve\ndynamically from the time when it first appears, even when it resembles a\npressure-confined, stable BE-sphere. The core can be thought of as a\nram-pressure confined BE-sphere, with an increasing mass due to the accretion\nfrom the unstable background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 18:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

Using high-resolution simulations\nof the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations and companion integrations of the\nbalanced quasi-geostrophic equations, we present evidence for a local route to\ndissipation of balanced energy directly through interior turbulent cascades.\nAnalysis of simulations presented in this study suggest that a developing\nbaroclinic instability can lead to secondary instabilities that can cascade a\nsmall fraction of the energy forward to unbalanced scales. Mesoscale shear and\nstrain resulting from the hydrostatic geostrophic baroclinic instability drive\nfrontogenesis. The fronts in turn support ageostrophic secondary circulation\nand instabilities. These two processes acting together lead to a quick rise in\ndissipation rate which then reaches a peak and begins to fall slowly when\nfrontogenesis slows down; eventually balanced and imbalanced modes decouple.\nDissipation of balanced energy by imbalanced processes scales exponentially\nwith Rossby number of the base flow.

First, a crystal theoretic analogue of the\nstatement that any two reduced expressions for the same Coxeter group element\nare related by Coxeter moves is proven for all lower intervals in a simply or\ndoubly laced crystal. On the other hand, it is shown that no finite set of\nmoves exists, even in type A, for arbitrary crystal graph intervals.

Recently, new measures of the resilience\nof dynamical systems have been developed in the complex system literature.\nBasin stability and survivability respectively assess the asymptotic and\ntransient behavior of a system when subjected to arbitrary, localized but large\nperturbations. To employ these methods to assess the resilience of power grids,\nwe need to choose a model of the power grid. So far the most popular model that\nhas been studied is the classical swing equation model for the frequency\nresponse of generators and motors. In this paper we study a more sophisticated\nmodel of synchronous machines that also takes voltage dynamics into account,\nand compare it to the previously studied model. This model has been found to\ngive an accurate picture of the long term evolution of synchronous machines in\nthe engineering literature for post fault studies. We find evidence that some\nstable fix points of the swing equation become unstable when we add voltage\ndynamics. If this occurs the asymptotic behavior of the system can be\ndramatically altered, and basin stability estimates obtained with the swing\nequation can be dramatically wrong. We also find that the survivability does\nnot change significantly when taking the voltage dynamics into account.\nFurther, the limit cycle type asymptotic behaviour is strongly correlated with\ntransient voltages that violate typical operational voltage bounds. Thus,\ntransient voltage bounds are dominated by transient frequency bounds and play\nno large role for realistic parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 09:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

To investigate the impact on LyA photons, we apply a\nnovel combination of analytic and numerical calculations to three scenarios:\n(i) the `bubble' model, where only diffuse HI outside ionized bubbles is\npresent; (ii) the `web' model, where HI exists only in overdense self-shielded\ngas; and (iii) the more realistic 'web-bubble' model, which contains both. Our\nanalysis confirms that there is a degeneracy between the ionization structure\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the HI fraction inferred from LyA\nsurveys, as the three models suppress LyA flux equally with very different HI\nfractions. We argue that a joint analysis of the LyA luminosity function and\nthe rest-frame equivalent width distribution/LyA fraction can break this\ndegeneracy and provide constraints on the reionization history and its\ntopology. We further show that constraints can improve if we consider the full\nshape of the M_UV-dependent redshift evolution of the LyA fraction of Lyman\nbreak galaxies. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that (i) a drop of LyA\nfraction larger for UV-faint than for UV-bright galaxies can be reproduced with\nweb and web-bubble models and therefore does not provide exclusive evidence of\npatchy reionization, and (ii) the IGM-transmission PDF is unimodal for bubble\nmodels and bimodal in web models. We further highlight the importance of\ngalaxy-absorber cross-correlation. Comparing our models to observations, the\nneutral fraction at z~7 is likely to be of order of tens of per cent when\ninterpreted with bubble or web-bubble models. Alternatively, we obtain a\nconservative lower limit ~1% in the web models, if we allow for a drop in the\nphotoionization rate by a factor of ~100 from the post-reionized universe.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 20:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors.

The stellar mass function of the star-forming\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passive\ngalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. The color distribution of the\nintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. The\nanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have\ntangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size\nrelation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,\nand its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies. Low-mass\ngalaxies are also more compact within the scale radius of 0.65 Mpc. The ratio\nbetween stellar and number density profiles shows a mass segregation in the\ncenter. The comparative analysis of the stellar and total density profiles\nindicates that this effect is due to dynamical friction. Our results are\nconsistent with a scenario in which the \"environmental quenching\" of low-mass\ngalaxies is due to mechanisms such as harassment out to R200, starvation and\nram-pressure stripping at smaller radii, as supported by the analysis of the\nmass function, of the dynamical orbits and of the mass-size relation of passive\nearly-types in different regions.

They usually perform\nfunctions by folding to a particular structure. Understanding the folding\nprocess could help the researchers to understand the functions of proteins and\ncould also help to develop supplemental proteins for people with deficiencies\nand gain more insight into diseases associated with troublesome folding\nproteins. Experimental methods are both expensive and time consuming. In this\nthesis I introduce a new machine learning based method to predict the protein\nstructure. The new method improves the performance from two directions:\ncreating accurate protein alignments and predicting accurate protein contacts.\nFirst, I present an alignment framework MRFalign which goes beyond\nstate-of-the-art methods and uses Markov Random Fields to model a protein\nfamily and align two proteins by aligning two MRFs together. Compared to other\nmethods, that can only model local-range residue correlation, MRFs can model\nlong-range residue interactions and thus, encodes global information in a\nprotein. Secondly, I present a Group Graphical Lasso method for contact\nprediction that integrates joint multi-family Evolutionary Coupling analysis\nand supervised learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence\nhomologs. Different from single-family EC analysis that uses residue\nco-evolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC\nanalysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target family and its related\nfamilies, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds. Our method can\nalso integrate supervised learning methods to further improve accuracy. We\nevaluate the performance of both methods including each of its components on\nlarge public benchmarks.

The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a\nshort-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term\nmemory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \\emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate\nthe physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of\nthese current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing\nreturns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to\nimplement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential\nlogic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full\nAdder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's\nshort-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the\ncarry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also\noutputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not\nphysically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port\nwith an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to\nunexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's\nslow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large\ncomputation with such slow operations speeds.

Compared with some present methods, the approach based\non trace distance can provide an optimal bound to the speed of the evolution.\nThe dynamical transition from no speed-up region to speed-up region takes on in\nthe spontaneous decay of an two-level atom with detuning. The evolution is\ncharacteristic of the alternating behavior between quantum speed-up and\nspeed-down in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime. Under the\noff-resonance condition, the dynamical evolution can be accelerated for short\nprevious times and then decelerated to a normal process either in the weak or\nstrong coupling regime. From the time-energy uncertainty relation, we\ndemonstrate that the potential capacity for quantum speed-up evolution is\nclosely related to the energy flow-back from the reservoir to the system. The\nnegative decay rate for short time intervals leads to the speed-up process\nwhere the photons previously emitted by the atom are reabsorbed at a later\ntime.

We find that for efficient formation of\nmolecular complexity, mobility about the surface is important and helps to\nbuild larger carbon chains on the surface than in the gas phase at low\ntemperatures. Finally, we show that the temperature of the surface strongly\ndetermines what kind of structures forms and that low turbulent environments\nare needed for efficient formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 08:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Thouless to investigate\nmelting and suprafluidity in two dimensions [Jour. of Phys. Cond. Matt.\n\\textbf{28}, 481001 (2016)]. The lack of broken symmetries proposed by D.\nMermin and H. Wagner is caused by long wavelength density fluctuations. Those\nfluctuations do not only have structural impact but additionally a dynamical\none: They cause the Lindemann criterion to fail in 2D and the mean squared\ndisplacement not to be limited. Comparing experimental data from 3D and 2D\namorphous solids with 2D crystals we disentangle Mermin-Wagner fluctuations\nfrom glassy structural relaxations. Furthermore we can demonstrate with\ncomputer simulations the logarithmic increase of displacements predicted by\nMermin and Wagner: periodicity is not a requirement for Mermin-Wagner\nfluctuations which conserve the homogeneity of space on long scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 09:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 12:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 18:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

In the absence of an accurate photometric\nmonitoring of these systems, it is not clear yet whether these variations are\nthe signature of a very low-mass companion, or of regular envelope pulsations.\nThe period - eccentricity (P - e) diagram for the 40 low-metallicity carbon\nstars with orbits now available shows no difference between CH and CEMP-s stars\n(the latter corresponding to those CEMP stars enriched in s-process elements,\nas are CH stars). We suggest that they must be considered as one and the same\nfamily and that their different names only stem from historical reasons.\nIndeed, these two families have as well very similar mass-function\ndistributions, corresponding to companions with masses in the range 0.5 - 0.7\nMsun, indicative of white-dwarf companions, adopting 0.8 - 0.9 Msun for the\nprimary component. This result confirms that CH and CEMP-s stars obey the same\nmass-transfer scenario as their higher-metallicity analogs, the barium stars.\nThe P - e diagrams of barium, CH and CEMP-s stars are indeed very similar. They\nreveal two different groups of systems: one with short orbital periods (P <\n1000 d) and mostly circular or almost circular orbits, and another with\nlonger-period and eccentric (e > 0.1) orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 11:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

We\nintroduce a notion of differential, called Carnot differential, for Carnot\nmanifolds maps (i.e., maps that are compatible with the Carnot manifold\nstructure). This differential is obtained as a group map between the\ncorresponding tangent groups. We prove that, at every point, a Carnot manifold\nmap is osculated in a very precise way by its Carnot differential at the point.\nWe also show that, in the case of maps between nilpotent graded groups, the\nCarnot differential is given by the Pansu derivative. Therefore, the Carnot\ndifferential is the natural generalization of the Pansu derivative to maps\nbetween general Carnot manifolds. Another main result is a construction of an\nanalogue for Carnot manifolds of Connes' tangent groupoid.

The model is solved in\ncoherent-potential approximation (CPA), for which a derivation is given. The\ntheory predicts an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the viscosity in\nthe vanishing-frequency limit, independent of the distribution of the\nactivation barriers. The theory implies that this activation energy is\ngenerally different from that of a diffusing particle with the same\nbarrier-height distribution. If the distribution of activation barriers is\nassumed to have Gaussian form, the finite-frequency version of the theory\ndescribes well the typical low-temperature alpha relaxation peak of glasses.\nBeta relaxation can be included by adding another Gaussian with center at much\nlower energies than that responsible for the alpha relaxation.

We\nhave used the latter to make the first determination of Saturn's Love number,\n$k_2=0.390 \\pm 0.024$, a value larger than the commonly used theoretical value\nof 0.341 (Gavrilov & Zharkov, 1977), but compatible with more recent models\n(Helled & Guillot, 2013) for which $k_2$ ranges from 0.355 to 0.382. Depending\non the assumed spin for Saturn's interior, the new constraint can lead to a\nreduction of up to 80% in the number of potential models, offering great\nopportunities to probe the planet's interior. In addition, significant tidal\ndissipation within Saturn is confirmed (Lainey et al., 2012) corresponding to a\nhigh present-day tidal ratio $k_2/Q=(1.59 \\pm 0.74) \\times 10^{-4}$ and\nimplying fast orbital expansions of the moons. This high dissipation, with no\nobvious variations for tidal frequencies corresponding to those of Enceladus\nand Dione, may be explained by viscous friction in a solid core, implying a\ncore viscosity typically ranging between $10^{14}$ and $10^{16}$ Pa.s (Remus et\nal., 2012). However, a dissipation increase by one order of magnitude at Rhea's\nfrequency could suggest the existence of an additional, frequency-dependent,\ndissipation process, possibly from turbulent friction acting on tidal waves in\nthe fluid envelope of Saturn (Ogilvie & Li, 2004).

For nearby comets, coma\ndust properties can be studied with their driving gases, measured\nsimultaneously with the same instrument or contemporaneously with another.\nStudies of water ice and gas in the distant Solar System will help us test our\nunderstanding of cometary interiors and coma evolution. The question of\ncometary activity in main-belt comets will be further explored with the\npossibility of a direct detection of coma gas. We explore the technical\napproaches to these science cases and provide simple tools for estimating comet\ndust and gas brightness. Finally, we consider the effects of the observatory's\nnon-sidereal tracking limits, and provide a list of potential comet targets\nduring the first 5 years of the mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 13:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Then we\nwill discuss how the parton-shower algorithm in Pythia 8 is modified in case of\nphoton beams and how the beam remnants are constructed. Finally a brief outlook\non future developments is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 13:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Heavy quarks are considered\neffective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a short\ntime scale, with respect to that of the QGP, and subsequently interact with it.\nMoreover, for a proper assessment of the characteristics of the matter produced\nin heavy-ion collisions, it is important to disentangle the final state effects\ndue to the formation of a QGP from the initial state effects due to the fact\nthat nuclei are present in the colliding system. Both initial and final state\neffects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of\ninterest. The measurement of charmed meson production in proton-nucleus\ncollisions allows to assess initial state effects present in nuclear\ncollisions, under the assumption that an extended deconfined medium is not\ncreated in this kind of interactions. The nuclear modification factor of $D$\nmesons in p-Pb collisions ($R_{\\rm pPb}$) is essential for a complete\nunderstanding of the modification of $D$ mesons momentum distributions observed\nin Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$= 2.76 TeV, which is interpreted as\ndue to the $c$-quark energy loss in the medium. In addition, some of the\nresults obtained from high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions at LHC, such as the\nridge structure in the two-particle correlation function, turned out to be\nunexpected, and have been interpreted in terms of final state effects such as\nhydrodynamic flow.

We do this by separating all the primes\nwhich are represented by points in n-dimension space by planes.
