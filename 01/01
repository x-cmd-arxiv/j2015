We first consider a robust reconstruction problem for polynomials from\nerroneous residues when the degrees of all residue errors are assumed small,\nnamely robust Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for polynomials. It basically\nsays that a polynomial can be reconstructed from erroneous residues such that\nthe degree of the reconstruction error is upper bounded by $\\tau$ whenever the\ndegrees of all residue errors are upper bounded by $\\tau$, where a sufficient\ncondition for $\\tau$ and a reconstruction algorithm are obtained. By releasing\nthe constraint that all residue errors have small degrees, another robust\nreconstruction is then presented when there are multiple unrestricted errors\nand an arbitrary number of errors with small degrees in the residues. By making\nfull use of redundancy in moduli, we obtain a stronger residue error correction\ncapability in the sense that apart from the number of errors that can be\ncorrected in the previous existing result, some errors with small degrees can\nbe also corrected in the residues. With this newly obtained result,\nimprovements in uncorrected error probability and burst error correction\ncapability in a data transmission are illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 16:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

In this paper, a practical algorithm for IFW and DBF to\nautomatically balance their traffic in licensed and unlicensed bands, based on\nthe real-time channel, interference and traffic conditions of both bands is\ndescribed.

Here, content can either be accessed\ndirectly from a back-end server (where content resides permanently) or be\nobtained from one of multiple in-network caches. To access a piece of content,\na user must decide whether to route its request to a cache or to the back-end\nserver. Additionally, caches must decide which content to cache. We investigate\nthe problem complexity of two problem formulations, where the direct path to\nthe back-end server is modeled as i) a congestion-sensitive or ii) a\ncongestion-insensitive path, reflecting whether or not the delay of the\nuncached path to the back-end server depends on the user request load,\nrespectively.

It is widely used to measure the amount of information and\ncalculate the lower bound for the variance for maximum likelihood estimation\n(MLE). In practice, we do not always know the actual FIM. This is often because\nobtaining the first or second-order derivatives of the log-likelihood function\nis difficult, or simply because the calculation of FIM is too formidable. In\nsuch cases, we need to utilize the approximation of FIM. In general, there are\ntwo ways to estimate FIM. One is to use the product of gradient and the\ntranspose of itself, and the other is to calculate the Hessian matrix and then\ntake negative sign. Mostly people use the latter method in practice. However,\nthis is not necessarily the optimal way. To find out which of the two methods\nis better, we need to conduct a theoretical study to compare their efficiency.\nIn this paper we mainly focus on the case where the unknown parameter that\nneeds to be estimated by MLE is scalar and the random variables we have are\nindependent.

For this purpose, we discuss a representation theory of\ncompletely positive (CP) instruments on arbitrary von Neumann algebras. We\nintroduce a condition called the normal extension property (NEP) and establish\na one-to-one correspondence between CP instruments with the NEP and statistical\nequivalence classes of measuring processes. We show that every CP instrument on\nan atomic von Neumann algebra has the NEP, extending the well-known result for\ntype I factors. Moreover, we show that every CP instrument on an injective von\nNeumann algebra is approximated by CP instruments with the NEP. The concept of\nposterior states is also discussed to show that the NEP is equivalent to the\nexistence of a strongly measurable family of posterior states for every normal\nstate. Two examples of CP instruments without the NEP are obtained from this\nresult. It is thus concluded that in local quantum physics not every CP\ninstrument represents a measuring process, but in most of physically relevant\ncases every CP instrument can be realized by a measuring process within\narbitrary error limits, as every approximately finite dimensional (AFD) von\nNeumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is injective. To conclude the\npaper, the concept of local measurement in algebraic quantum field theory is\nexamined in our framework. In the setting of the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts and\nDoplicher-Roberts (DHR-DR) theory describing local excitations, we show that an\ninstrument on a local algebra can be extended to a local instrument on the\nglobal algebra if and only if it is a CP instrument with the NEP, provided that\nthe split property holds for the net of local algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 2015 02:31:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 07:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 08:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

At a macroscopic level, these processes are adequately\ndescribed by fractional differential equations, which involves fractional\nderivatives in time or/and space. The fractional derivatives describe either\nhistory mechanism or long range interactions of particle motions at a\nmicroscopic level. The new physics can change dramatically the behavior of the\nforward problems. Naturally one expects that the new physics will impact\nrelated inverse problems in terms of uniqueness, stability, and degree of\nill-posedness. The last aspect is especially important from a practical point\nof view, i.e., stably reconstructing the quantities of interest.\n  In this paper, we employ a formal analytic and numerical way to examine the\ndegree of ill-posedness of several \"classical\" inverse problems for fractional\ndifferential equations involving a Djrbashian-Caputo fractional derivative in\neither time or space, which represent the fractional analogues of that for\nclassical integral order differential equations.

It has flexibility to address\nproblems for any choice of utility function and for a wide range of statistical\nmodels with different numbers of variables, numbers of runs and randomization\nrestrictions. In contrast to existing approaches to Bayesian design, the method\ncan find multi-variable designs in large numbers of runs without resorting to\nasymptotic approximations to the posterior distribution or expected utility.\nThe methodology is demonstrated on a variety of challenging examples of\npractical importance, including design for pharmacokinetic models and design\nfor mixed models with discrete data. For many of these models, Bayesian designs\nare not currently available. Comparisons are made to results from the\nliterature, and to designs obtained from asymptotic approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 2015 09:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 16:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 11:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 11:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-01"}

The basic concept is still\nthat of a line segment but its equivalent notion of betweenness is viewed as a\ntopological, not a metric concept. That leads quickly to the notion of\nconnectedness without any need to dwell on the definition of topology. In our\napproach line segments must be connected. Lines and planes are unified via the\nconcept of separation: lines are separated into two components by each point,\nplanes contain lines that separate them into two components as well. We add a\nsubgroup of bijections preserving line segments and establishing unique\nisomorphism of basic geometrical sets, and the axiomatic structure is complete.\nOf fundamental importance is the Fixed Point Theorem that allows for creation\nof the concepts of length and congruency of line segments. The resulting\nstructure is much more in sync with modern science than other axiomatic\napproaches to planar geometry. For instance, it leads naturally to the Erlangen\nProgram in geometry. Our Conditions of Homogeneity and Rigidity have two\ninterpretations. In physics, they correspond to the basic tenet that\nindependent observers should arrive at the same measurement and are related to\nboosts in special relativity. In geometry, they mean uniqueness of congruence\nfor certain geometrical figures.\n  Another thread of the paper is the introduction of boundary at infinity, an\nimportant concept of modern mathematics, and linking of Pasch Axiom to endowing\nboundaries at infinity with a natural relation of betweenness. That way\nspherical geometry can be viewed as geometry of boundaries at infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 2015 15:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 22:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 12:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

Our INS study reveals the presence of two well-defined crystal\nelectric field (CEF) excitations at 5.1 meV and 24.6 meV in the paramagnetic\nphase of CeAuAl3 which can be explained on the basis of the CEF theory.\nFurthermore, low energy quasi-elastic excitations show a Gaussian line shape\nbelow 30 K compared to a Lorentzian line shape above 30 K, indicating a\nslowdown of spin fluctuation below 30 K. We have estimated a Kondo temperature\nof TK=3.5 K from the quasi-elastic linewidth, which is in good agreement with\nthat estimated from the heat capacity.
