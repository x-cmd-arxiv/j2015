A Song-On-Demand task, with a\ntotal of 38117 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song, is used to\ntest the performance of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation, assuming\nno errors, the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among\nall tested approaches, returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on\naverage.

The observation that water and hydroxyl megamasers rarely\ncoexist in the same galaxy has given rise to a hypothesis that the two species\nappear in different phases of nuclear activity. The detection of simultaneous\nhydroxyl and water megamaser emission toward IC694 has called this hypothesis\ninto question but, because many megamasers have not been surveyed for emission\nin the other molecule, it remains unclear whether IC694 occupies a narrow phase\nof galaxy evolution or whether the relationship between megamaser species and\ngalactic processes is more complicated than previously believed. In this paper,\nwe present results of a systematic search for 22 GHz water maser emission among\nOH megamaser hosts to identify additional objects hosting both megamaser. Our\nwork roughly doubles the number of galaxies searched for emission in both\nmolecules which host at least one confirmed maser.

A mass\nratio of $0.1-0.3\\%$ between the very low angular momentum gas that free-falls\nto the sub-parsec region to accrete to the SMBH and the overall star formation\nrate is found.

For IC 1613 and Phoenix our data do not\nhave the radial extent to confirm a metallicity gradient for either galaxy.\n  We find the MDF of Leo I (dwarf spheroidal) to be very peaked with a steep\nmetal rich cutoff and an extended metal poor tail, while Leo II (dwarf\nspheroidal), Phoenix (dwarf transition) and IC 1613 (dwarf irregular) have\nwider, less peaked MDFs than Leo I. A simple CEM is not the best fit for any of\nour galaxies, therefore we also fit the `Best Accretion Model' of Lynden-Bell\n1975. For Leo II, IC 1613 and Phoenix we find similar accretion parameters for\nthe CEM, even though they all have different effective yields, masses, star\nformation histories and morphologies. We suggest that the dynamical history of\na galaxy is reflected in the MDF, where broad MDFs are seen in galaxies that\nhave chemically evolved in relative isolation and narrowly peaked MDFs are seen\nin galaxies that have experienced more complicated dynamical interactions\nconcurrent with their chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 20:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The LF of the\nbright clusters is well fit by a peaked distribution similar to those observed\nin the Milky Way (MW) and other galaxies. These bright clusters also have\nsimilar size (r_{eff}) and spatial distributions as MW GCs. The LF of the faint\nclusters, on the other hand, is well described by a power law, dN(L_V)/dL_V\nproportional to L_V^alpha with alpha = -2.6 plus or minus 0.3, similar to those\nobserved for young and intermediate-age cluster systems in star forming\ngalaxies. We find that the faint clusters have larger typical r_{eff} than the\nbright clusters, and have a flatter surface density profile, being more evenly\ndistributed, as we would expect for clusters associated with the disk. We use\nthe shape of the LF and predictions for mass-loss driven by two-body relaxation\nto constrain the ages of the faint clusters.

Since most large scale\napproaches make the assumption of observing static scenes, dynamic objects are\nrelegated to the noise modeling section of such systems. This is an approach of\nconvenience since the RANSAC based framework used to compute most multiview\ngeometric quantities for static scenes naturally confine dynamic objects to the\nclass of outlier measurements. However, reconstructing dynamic objects along\nwith the static environment helps us get a complete picture of an urban\nenvironment. Such understanding can then be used for important robotic tasks\nlike path planning for autonomous navigation, obstacle tracking and avoidance,\nand other areas. In this paper, we propose a system for robust SLAM that works\nin both static and dynamic environments. To overcome the challenge of dynamic\nobjects in the scene, we propose a new model to incorporate semantic\nconstraints into the reconstruction algorithm. While some of these constraints\nare based on multi-layered dense CRFs trained over appearance as well as motion\ncues, other proposed constraints can be expressed as additional terms in the\nbundle adjustment optimization process that does iterative refinement of 3D\nstructure and camera / object motion trajectories.

However, most of the studies involving spin transport,\nhave disregarded fundamental aspects such as the magnetic anisotropy of the\nmolecule and the excitation of spin-flip processes during electron transport.\nHere, we study a molecule containing a Co and an Fe atoms stacked between three\ncyclopentadienyl rings that presents a large magnetic anisotropy and a S=1.\nThese figures are superior to other molecules with the same transition metal,\nand improves the spin-filtering capacities of the molecule. Non-equilibrium\nGreen's functions calculations based on density functional theory predict\nexcellent spin-filtering properties both in tunnel and contact transport\nregimes. However, exciting the first magnetic state drastically reduces the\ncurrent's spin polarization. Furthermore, a difference of temperature between\nelectrodes leads to strong thermoelectric effects that also suppress spin\npolarization. Our study shows that in-principle good molecular candidates for\nspintronics need to be confronted with inelastic and thermoelectric effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 21:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

Inaccurate prediction by\ncustomers can result in over-provisioning of resources, or under-provisioning\nand poor job performance. Thanks to improved resource virtualization and\nmulti-tenant performance isolation, as well as common frameworks for batch\njobs, such as MapReduce, Cloud providers can predict job completion times more\naccurately. We offer a new definition of QoS-levels in terms of job completion\ntimes and we present a new QoS-based selling mechanism for batch jobs in a\nmulti-tenant OpenStack cluster.

However, currently, data\ncenters typically participate in EDR by turning on backup (diesel) generators,\nwhich is both expensive and environmentally unfriendly. In this paper, we focus\non \"greening\" demand response in multi-tenant data centers, i.e., colocation\ndata centers, by designing a pricing mechanism through which the data center\noperator can efficiently extract load reductions from tenants during emergency\nperiods to fulfill energy reduction requirement for EDR. In particular, we\npropose a pricing mechanism for both mandatory and voluntary EDR programs,\nColoEDR, that is based on parameterized supply function bidding and provides\nprovably near-optimal efficiency guarantees, both when tenants are price-taking\nand when they are price-anticipating. In addition to analytic results, we\nextend the literature on supply function mechanism design, and evaluate ColoEDR\nusing trace-based simulation studies. These validate the efficiency analysis\nand conclude that the pricing mechanism is both beneficial to the environment\nand to the data center operator (by decreasing the need for backup diesel\ngeneration), while also aiding tenants (by providing payments for load\nreductions).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 23:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

A corrected analysis of the dynamic forces is presented that are in\nagreement with earlier experiments by this author.

However they have poor mechanical, thermal and\nelectrical properties which are required to be enhanced in several applications\nwhere along with high strength, a quick heat transfer becomes a necessity.\nCarbon nanotubes (CNT) are excellent new materials having extraordinary\nmechanical and transport properties. In this paper we report results of\nfabricating composites of varying concentrations of CNTs with PMMA and PC and\nmeasurements of thermal conductivity data by a simple transient heat flow. The\nsamples in disk shapes of around 2 cm diameters and 0.2 cm thickness with CNT\nconcentrations varying up to 10 wt percent were fabricated. By keeping one end\nof the discs at steam temperature, the temperature of the other end was noted\nfor each sample after 10 s. The rise in temperature was correlated with thermal\nconductivity which was appropriately calibrated. We found that both PMMA and PC\nmeasured high thermal conductivity with increase in the concentration of CNTs.\nThe thermal conductivity of PMMA rose from about 0.2 W/mK to 0.4 W/mK at 10\nwtpercent of CNT whereas for PC, it rose from about 0.2 W/mK to 0.9 W/mK at 10\nwt percent of CNT. It is thus observed that modification in thermal properties\nis easily achieved by making CNT based composites using only up to 10 wt\npercent of CNTs in PMMA and PC and enabling quicker heat dissipation in these\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 07:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

This technique uses only local\ninformation of the communication graph topology and does not require\ncomputational effort to build routing table or equivalent data structures. A\nparticularly efficient implementation of this paradigm is greedy routing, where\nalong the data path the nodes forward the data to a neighboring node that is\ncloser to the destination. The decreasing distance to the destination implies\nthe success of the routing scheme. A related problem is to consider an abstract\ngraph and decide whether there exists an embedding of the graph in a metric\nspace, called a greedy embedding, such that greedy routing guarantees the\ndelivery of the data. In the present paper, we use a metric-free definition of\ngreedy path and we show that greedy routing is successful on planar\ntriangulations without considering the existence of greedy embedding.

Depending on the\ndriving force, the transition to coarsening exhibits different scenarios.\nFirst, for membranes under tension, small tensions can only lead to transient\ncoarsening or partial disordering, while above a finite threshold, membrane\noscillations disappear and perpetual coarsening is found. Second, potential\nasymmetry is relevant in the non-conserved case only, i.e. for permeable walls,\nwhere it induces a drift force on the kinks, leading to a fast coarsening\nprocess via kink-antikink annihilation. However, below some threshold, the\ndrift force can be balanced by the oscillatory interactions between kinks, and\nfrozen adhesion patches can still be observed. Finally, at long times, noise\nrestores coarsening with standard exponents depending on the permeability of\nthe walls.

We consider graphs with constant treewidth, and\nit is well-known that the control-flow graphs of most programs have constant\ntreewidth. Let $n$ denote the number of nodes of a graph, $m$ the number of\nedges (for constant treewidth graphs $m=O(n)$) and $W$ the largest absolute\nvalue of the weights.

We examine two\ndifferent methods for the correction, Gaussian decomposition and isothermal\nmethods, and find that they are consistent (maximum correction factor ~ 1.2)\nlikely due to the relatively low optical depth and insignificant contribution\nfrom the diffuse radio continuum emission for Perseus.

As a result, Sigma_H2/Sigma_HI and Sigma_HI+Sigma_H2 show a\ntight relation.

Most of the near-IR integrated colours of the\nlow-redshift 3CRR radio galaxies are similar to those of passive galaxies, so\nthat IR colours are poor indicators of radio activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 11:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

In this paper, we address the issue of\nwhether transitivity can be safely combined with decidable classes of\nexistential rules.\n  First, we prove that transitivity is incompatible with one of the simplest\ndecidable classes, namely aGRD (acyclic graph of rule dependencies), which\nclarifies the landscape of `finite expansion sets' of rules.\n  Second, we show that transitivity can be safely added to linear rules (a\nsubclass of guarded rules, which generalizes the description logic DL-Lite-R)\nin the case of atomic CQs, and also for general CQs if we place a minor\nsyntactic restriction on the rule set. This is shown by means of a novel query\nrewriting algorithm that is specially tailored to handle transitivity rules.\n  Third, for the identified decidable cases, we pinpoint the combined and data\ncomplexities of query entailment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 12:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 08:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

Alternatively, the model can also just be used to\nidentify the most reliably annotated images from the training set, which can\nthen be used for training any other segmentation method. By relying on \"deep\nfeatures\" in combination with a linear covariance function, our GP can be\nlearned and its hyperparameter determined efficiently using only matrix\noperations and gradient-based optimization.

We find emission intensity asymmetry\nin the positive and negative modulations, this is because the contribution\nfunction pertaining to the atomic emission process responds differently to\npositive and negative temperature variations. One may detect \\textbf{half}\nperiodicity close to the loop apex, where emission intensity modulation is\nrelatively small. The line-of-sight projection affects the observation of\nDoppler shift significantly. A more accurate estimate of the amplitude of\nvelocity perturbation is obtained by de-projecting the Doppler shift by a\nfactor of $1-2\\theta/\\pi$ rather than the traditionally used $\\cos\\theta$.\n\\textbf{If a loop is heated to the hotter wing, the intensity modulation could\nbe overwhelmed by background emission, while the Doppler shift velocity could\nstill be detected to a certain extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 13:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

It\ngoverns the physics of accretion and of the resulting high-energy emission in\naccreting pulsars. Studies of the cyclotron resonant scattering features\n(CRSFs) seen as absorption lines in the X-ray spectra of the pulsars permit\ndirect measuremets of the field strength. Aims: From an analysis of a number of\npointed observations with different instruments, the energy of CRSF, Ecyc, has\nrecently been found to decay in Her X-1, which is one of the best-studied\naccreting pulsars. We present our analysis of a homogeneous and almost\nuninterrupted monitoring of the line energy with Swift/BAT. Methods: We\nanalyzed the archival Swift/BAT observations of Her X-1 from 2005 to 2014. The\ndata were used to measure the CRSF energy averaged over several months.\nResults: The analysis confirms the long-term decay of the line energy. The\ndownward trend is highly significant and consistent with the trend measured\nwith the pointed observations: dEcyc/dt ~-0.3 keV per year. Conclusions: The\ndecay of Ecyc either indicates a local evolution of the magnetic field\nstructure in the polar regions of the neutron star or a geometrical\ndisplacement of the line-forming region due to long-term changes in the\nstructure of the X-ray emitting region. The shortness of the observed timescale\nof the decay, -Ecyc/(dEcyc/dt) ~ 100 yr, suggests that trend reversals and/or\njumps of the line energy might be observed in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 14:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We show that the dependence of the rate function on the stochastic\nweight matrix associated with the network is fully captured by its left\neigenvector corresponding to the unit eigenvalue. Further, when the sensors'\nobservations are Gaussian, the rate function admits a closed form expression.\nMotivated by these observations, we formulate the optimal network design\nproblem of finding the left eigenvector which achieves the highest value of the\nrate function, for a given target accuracy. This eigenvector therefore\nminimizes the time that the inference algorithm needs to reach the desired\naccuracy.
