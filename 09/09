The theorems show the\nun-achievable envelope, i.e., which combinations of the parameters of the three\nmodels make them impossible to achieve together. Next, we present the design of\na class of systems called PCAP that perform close to the envelope described by\nour theorems. In addition, these systems allow applications running on a single\ndata-center to specify either a latency SLA or a consistency SLA. The PCAP\nsystems automatically adapt, in real-time and under changing network\nconditions, to meet the SLA while optimizing the other C/A metric. We\nincorporate PCAP into two popular key-value stores -- Apache Cassandra and\nRiak. Our experiments with these two deployments, under realistic workloads,\nreveal that the PCAP system satisfactorily meets SLAs, and performs close to\nthe achievable envelope. We also extend PCAP from a single data-center to\nmultiple geo-distributed data-centers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 17:46:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2016 18:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

Once one location ignites, the flame propagates across\nthe surface of the star. Flame propagation is fundamental in order to\nunderstand burst properties like rise time and burst oscillations. Previous\nwork quantified the effects of rotation on the front, showing that the flame\npropagates as a deflagration and that the front strongly resembles a hurricane.\nHowever the effect of magnetic fields was not investigated, despite the fact\nthat magnetic fields strong enough to have an effect on the propagating flame\nare expected to be present on many bursters. In this paper we show how the\ncoupling between fluid layers introduced by an initially vertical magnetic\nfield plays a decisive role in determining the character of the fronts that are\nresponsible for the Type I bursts. In particular, on a star spinning at 450 Hz\n(typical among the bursters) we test seed magnetic fields of $10^{7} - 10^{10}$\nG and find that for the medium fields the magnetic stresses that develop during\nthe burst can speed up the velocity of the burning front, bringing the\nsimulated burst rise time close to the observed values. By contrast, in a\nmagnetic slow rotator like IGR J17480--2446, spinning at 11 Hz, a seed field\n$\\gtrsim 10^9$ G is required to allow localized ignition and the magnetic field\nplays an integral role in generating the burst oscillations observed during the\nbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 18:54:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 18:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-02"}

This yields two\nrobust features. First, the emission is significantly delayed compared with the\nisotropic case. This delay allows for the peak of the afterglow emission to\nappear while the source is still active, in contrast to the simplest isotropic\nmodel. Secondly, the flux decline after the source turns off is steeper than\nthe isotropic case. We find that these two features are realized in gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs): 1.

If the entire excess is due to temperature\nvariations alone, the observed fluctuation amplitude favors a late-ending but\nextended reionization process that was roughly half complete by z~9 and that\nended at z~6. In this scenario, the highest opacities occur in regions that\nreionized earliest, since they have had the most time to cool, while the lowest\nopacities occur in the warmer regions that reionized most recently.

It is shown that\nmodels with light stops which are also consistent with the thermal relic\ndensity constraints require stop coannihilation with the neutralino LSP. The\nanalysis shows that the residual set of parameter points with light stops\nsatisfying both the Higgs mass and the relic density constraints lie within a\nseries of thin strips in the $m_0-m_{1/2}$ plane for different values of\n$A_0/m_0$. Consequently, this region of minimal supergravity parameter space\nmakes a number of very precise predictions. It is found that light stops of\nmass down to 400~GeV or lower can exist consistent with all constraints. A\nsignal analysis for this class of models at LHC RUN-II is carried out and the\ndominant signals for their detection identified. Also computed is the minimum\nintegrated luminosity for $5\\sigma$ discovery of the models analyzed. If\nsupersymmetry is realized in this manner, the stop masses can be as low as\n400~GeV or lower, and the mass gap between the lightest neutralino and lightest\nstop will be approximately 30-40~GeV.

This approach reduces the\ncomputational cost to estimate thermodynamic properties from molecular\nsimulations for over 130,000 tested parameter combinations from over a thousand\nCPU years to tens of CPU days. This speed increase is achieved primarily by\ncomputing the potential energy as a linear combination of basis functions,\ncomputed from either modified simulation code or as the difference of energy\nbetween two reference states, which can be done without any simulation code\nmodification. The thermodynamic properties are then estimated with the\nMultistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) as a function of multiple model\nparameters without the need to define a priori how the states are connected by\na pathway.

With the use of\nnext-generation supercomputers, atmospheric simulations using horizontal grid\nintervals of O(100) m or less will gain popularity. At such high resolution\nmore of the steep gradients in mountainous terrain will be resolved, which may\nresult in large truncation errors in those models using terrain-following\ncoordinates. In this study, a new 3D Cartesian coordinate non-hydrostatic\natmospheric model is developed. A cut-cell representation of topography based\non finite-volume discretization is combined with a cell-merging approach, in\nwhich small cut-cells are merged with neighboring cells either vertically or\nhorizontally. In addition, a block-structured mesh-refinement technique is\nintroduced to achieve a variable resolution on the model grid with the finest\nresolution occurring close to the terrain surface. The model successfully\nreproduces a flow over a 3D bell-shaped hill that shows a good agreement with\nthe flow predicted by the linear theory.

The advantage of a locally\nrefined grid around a 3D hill, with cut-cells at the terrain surface, is also\ndemonstrated using the hemisphere-shaped hill.

For some sources, they\nfollow the `original' type of correlation which is described by a single\npower-law. Later it was found that some other sources follow a different\ncorrelation consisting of three power-law branches, with each branch having\ndifferent power-law indexes. In this work, we explain these two types of\ncorrelation under the coupled accretion--jet model. We attribute the difference\nbetween these two types of sources to the different value of viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha$. One possible reason for different $\\alpha$ is the different\nconfiguration of magnetic field in the accretion material coming from the\ncompanion stars. For the `single power-law' sources, their $\\alpha$ is high; so\ntheir accretion is always in the mode of advection-dominated accretion flow\n(ADAF) for the whole range of X-ray luminosity. For those `hybrid power-law'\nsources, the value of $\\alpha$ is small so their accretion mode changes from an\nADAF to a luminous hot accretion flow, and eventually to two-phase accretion as\nthe accretion rate increases. Because the dependence of radiative efficiency on\nthe mass accretion rate is different for these three accretion modes, different\npower-law indexes in the $L_R--L_X$ correlation are expected. Constraints on\nthe ratio of the mass loss rate into the jet and the mass accretion rate in the\naccretion flow are obtained, which can be tested in future by radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of jet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 01:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 15:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In this paper, we further the study by\ncharacterizing the conditions under which the AD-ADMM achieves linear\nconvergence. Our conditions as well as the resulting linear rates reveal the\nimpact that various algorithm parameters, network delay and network size have\non the algorithm performance. To demonstrate the superior time efficiency of\nthe proposed AD-ADMM, we test the AD-ADMM on a high-performance computer\ncluster by solving a large-scale logistic regression problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 02:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

This problem has a free boundary and\nthe boundary is characteristic. A necessary and sufficient condition is\nobtained for the linear stability of the rectilinear vortex sheets. More\nprecisely, it is shown that, besides the stable supersonic zone, the elasticity\nexerts an additional stable subsonic zone. A new feature for elastic flow is\nfound that there is a class of states in the interior of subsonic zone where\nthe stability of such states is weaker than the stability of other states in\nthe sense that there is an extra loss of tangential derivatives with respect to\nthe source terms. This is a new feature which Euler flows do not possess. One\nof the difficulties for the elastic flow is that the non-differentiable points\nof the eigenvalues may coincide with the roots of the Lopatinskii determinant.\nAs a result, the Kreiss symmetrization cannot be applied directly. Instead, we\nperform an upper triangularization of the system to separate only the outgoing\nmodes at all points in the frequency space, so that an exact estimate of the\noutgoing modes can be obtained.

In this way we can vary the degree of turbulence helicity from non\nhelical to maximally helical. We find that increasing the rate of helicity\ninjection does not change the energy flux. On the other hand the level of total\nenergy is strongly increased and the energy spectrum gets steeper. The energy\nspectrum spans from a Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-5/3}$ for a non-helical\nturbulence, to a non-Kolmogorov scaling law $k^{-7/3}$ for a maximally helical\nturbulence. In the later case we find that the characteristic time of the\nturbulence is not the turnover time but a time based on the helicity injection\nrate. We also analyse the results in terms of helical modes decomposition. For\na maximally helical turbulence one type of helical mode is found to be much\nmore energetic than the other one, by several orders of magnitude. The energy\ncascade of the most energetic type of helical mode results from the sum of two\nfluxes. One flux is negative and can be understood in terms of a decimated\nmodel.

The morphology of\nthe hybrid nanostructures can be steered by controlling the deposition\nparameters, the composition of the liquid phase and the type of substrate,\namorphous or crystalline. The carbonaceous phase of the hybrid nanostructures\nconsists of hydrogenated amorphous carbon in the case of nanoparticles and of\ncrystalline orthorhombic graphite of nanoscale thickness in the case of flakes\nand flowers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of\nthe fabrication of orthorhombic graphite with metal nano inclusions. The\nremarkable quality and regularity of the micron-sized nanoscale thickness\nsingle crystal flakes allows for cutting high resolution nano scale structures,\nwhich in combination with the metallic nano inclusions offer much design\nfreedom for creating novel devices for nano photonic applications. The\nencouraging properties of the nanomaterials with different composition, size\nand shape stimulate the development of efficient synthesis strategies aimed at\nfine-tuning the functionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 09:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

We computed the gravitational\nslopes for five regions on the nucleus that are representative of the different\nmorphologies observed on the surface, using two shape models computed from\nOSIRIS images by the stereo-photoclinometry (SPC) and stereo-photogrammetry\n(SPG) techniques. We estimated the tensile, shear, and compressive strengths\nusing different surface morphologies and mechanical considerations. The\ndifferent regions show a similar general pattern in terms of the relation\nbetween gravitational slopes and terrain morphology: i) low-slope terrains\n(0-20 deg) are covered by a fine material and contain a few large ($>$10 m) and\nisolated boulders, ii) intermediate-slope terrains (20-45 deg) are mainly\nfallen consolidated materials and debris fields, with numerous\nintermediate-size boulders from $<$1 m to 10 m for the majority of them, and\niii) high-slope terrains (45-90 deg) are cliffs that expose a consolidated\nmaterial and do not show boulders or fine materials. The best range for the\ntensile strength of overhangs is 3-15 Pa (upper limit of 150 Pa), 4-30 Pa for\nthe shear strength of fine surface materials and boulders, and 30-150 Pa for\nthe compressive strength of overhangs (upper limit of 1500 Pa). The\nstrength-to-gravity ratio is similar for 67P and weak rocks on Earth. As a\nresult of the low compressive strength, the interior of the nucleus may have\nbeen compressed sufficiently to initiate diagenesis, which could have\ncontributed to the formation of layers. Our value for the tensile strength is\ncomparable to that of dust aggregates formed by gravitational instability and\ntends to favor a formation of comets by the accrection of pebbles at low\nvelocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 10:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

But the\nliterature also claims that spinors _as such_ cannot be represented in\ncoordinates in a curved space-time. These commonplaces are inconsistent, so\nwhat is general covariance for fermions? In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nOgievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed spinors in coordinates in 1965,\nenhancing the unity of physics and helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Roughly and locally, OP spinors resemble the orthonormal basis\nor tetrad formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient and more economical. The tetrad formalism is thus\nde-Ockhamized, with six extra components and six compensating gauge symmetries.\nAs developed nonperturbatively by Bilyalov, OP spinors admit any coordinates at\na point, but 'time' must be listed first; 'time' is defined by an eigenvalue\nproblem involving the metric and diag(-1,1,1,1), the product of which must have\nno negative eigenvalues. Thus even formal general covariance requires\nreconsideration; admissible coordinates should be sensitive to the types and\n_values_ of the fields. Apart from coordinate order and the usual spinorial\ntwo-valuedness, (densitized) Ogievetsky-Polubarinov spinors form, with the\n(conformal part of the) metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and\ncovariant derivatives. The mild consequences of coordinate order are explored\nfor the conventionality of simultaneity in Special Relativity and the\nSchwarzschild solution in General Relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 10:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

The instrument has two channels, one for imaging and one for\nspectroscopy: it is both a thermal camera with full 2D imaging capabilities and\na slit spectrometer. THERMAP takes advantage of the recent technological\ndevelopments of uncooled microbolometers detectors, sensitive in the\nmid-infrared spectral range. THERMAP can acquire thermal images (8-18 {\\mu}m)\nof the surface and perform absolute temperature measurements with a precision\nbetter than 3.5 K above 200 K.

Therefore, the HEW up to 40 keV is\nrequired to be better than 30 arcsec, even though the IXO goal is to achieve an\nangular resolution as close as possible to 5 arcsec also at this energy. To\nthis end, the roughness of the reflecting surfaces has to not exceed a\ntolerance, expressed in terms of a surface roughness PSD\n(Power-Spectral-Density).

Due to some beautiful\nand effective features, this IT structure proves well suited for data\nclustering. Although there exist some redundant edges in IT, they usually have\nsalient features and thus it is not hard to remove them.\n  Subsequently, in order to prevent the seemingly redundant edges from\noccurring, we proposed the Nearest Neighbor Descent (NND) by adding the\n\"Neighborhood\" constraint on ND. Consequently, clusters automatically emerged,\nwithout the additional requirement of removing the redundant edges. However,\nNND proved still not perfect, since it brought in a new yet worse problem, the\n\"over-partitioning\" problem.\n  Now, in this paper, we propose a method, called the Hierarchical Nearest\nNeighbor Descent (H-NND), which overcomes the over-partitioning problem of NND\nvia using the hierarchical strategy. Specifically, H-NND uses ND to effectively\nmerge the over-segmented sub-graphs or clusters that NND produces. Like ND,\nH-NND also generates the IT structure, in which the redundant edges once again\nappear. This seemingly comes back to the situation that ND faces. However,\ncompared with ND, the redundant edges in the IT structure generated by H-NND\ngenerally become more salient, thus being much easier and more reliable to be\nidentified even by the simplest edge-removing method which takes the edge\nlength as the only measure. In other words, the IT structure constructed by\nH-NND becomes more fitted for data clustering. We prove this on several\nclustering datasets of varying shapes, dimensions and attributes. Besides,\ncompared with ND, H-NND generally takes less computation time to construct the\nIT data structure for the input data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 15:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 15:43:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 15:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

This\npropagator completely resolves the corresponding time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (defines the wave function ${\\psi}(x,t)$) and allows for considering\nthe quantum mechanical effects of a particle reflection from the potential\ndownward step/well and a particle tunneling through the potential barrier as a\nfunction of time. These results are related to fundamental issues such as\nmeasuring time in quantum mechanics (tunneling time, time of arrival, dwell\ntime). For imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature\n$(t\\rightarrow-i{\\hbar}/k_{B}T)$, the obtained propagator is equivalent to the\ndensity matrix for a particle that is in a heat bath and is subject to a\nrectangular potential. If one shifts to imaginary time $(t\\rightarrow-it)$, the\nmatrix element of the calculated propagator in the spatial basis provides a\nsolution to the diffusion-like equation with a rectangular potential.

Using first principles theory, we study the\nthermoelectric properties of a family of nine molecules, which consist of\ndithiol-terminated oligo(phenylene-ethynylenes) (OPEs) containing various\ncentral units. Uniquely, one molecule of this family possesses a conjugated\nacene-based central backbone attached via triple bonds to terminal sulfur atoms\nbound to gold electrodes and incorporates a fully conjugated hydroquinone\ncentral unit. We demonstrate that both S and the electronic contribution ZelT\nto the figure of merit ZT can be dramatically enhanced by oxidizing the\nhydroquinone to yield a second molecule, which possesses a cross-conjugated\nanthraquinone central unit.

We find another such interaction that\nsuggests a novel distinction in brain function between drinking and\nnon-drinking adolescents: a tighter coupling of ROI associated with emotion,\nreward, and interoceptive processes such as thirst, among drinkers. Finally, we\noutline many improvements and extensions of the methodology to reduce\ncomputational expense, complement other analytical tools like graph-theoretic\nanalysis, and allow for voxel level NFM to eliminate the necessity of ROI\nselection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 20:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}
