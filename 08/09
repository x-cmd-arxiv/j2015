We assume that a massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) accretes\nmatter coming from a companion star, making it to spin at the critical rate. We\nassume uniform rotation due to magnetic field coupling. The carbon ignition\nmass for non-rotating WDs is M_{ig}^{NR} \\approx 1.38 M_{\\odot}; while for the\ncase of uniformly rotating WDs it is a few percent larger (M_{ig}^{R} \\approx\n1.43 M_{\\odot}). When accretion rate decreases, the WD begins to lose angular\nmomentum, shrinks, and spins up; however, it does not overflow its critical\nrotation rate, avoiding mass shedding. Thus, angular momentum losses can lead\nthe CO WD interior to compression and carbon ignition, which would induce an\nSN~Ia. The delay, largely due to the angular momentum losses timescale, may be\nlarge enough to allow the companion star to evolve to a He WD, becoming\nundetectable at the moment of explosion. This scenario supports the occurrence\nof delayed SNe~Ia if the final CO WD mass is 1.38 M_{\\odot} < M < 1.43\nM_{\\odot}. We also find that if the delay is longer than ~3 Gyr, the WD would\nbecome too cold to explode, rather undergoing collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 16:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Algorithms tailored to such models yield\nestimated clusters with a clear statistical interpretation. We take this view\nhere and introduce the class of G-block covariance models as a background model\nfor variable clustering. In such models, two variables in a cluster are deemed\nsimilar if they have similar associations will all other variables. This can\narise, for instance, when groups of variables are noise corrupted versions of\nthe same latent factor. We quantify the difficulty of clustering data generated\nfrom a G-block covariance model in terms of cluster proximity, measured with\nrespect to two related, but different, cluster separation metrics. We derive\nminimax cluster separation thresholds, which are the metric values below which\nno algorithm can recover the model-defined clusters exactly, and show that they\nare different for the two metrics. We therefore develop two algorithms, COD and\nPECOK, tailored to G-block covariance models, and study their\nminimax-optimality with respect to each metric. Of independent interest is the\nfact that the analysis of the PECOK algorithm, which is based on a corrected\nconvex relaxation of the popular K-means algorithm, provides the first\nstatistical analysis of such algorithms for variable clustering. Additionally,\nwe contrast our methods with another popular clustering method, spectral\nclustering, specialized to variable clustering, and show that ensuring exact\ncluster recovery via this method requires clusters to have a higher separation,\nrelative to the minimax threshold. Extensive simulation studies, as well as our\ndata analyses, confirm the applicability of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 18:25:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 18:30:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 03:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 03:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 13 Dec 2018 03:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-14"}

We point out the severe repercussions: differentiable Dirac\nobservables and a reduced phase space do not exist in non-integrable\nconstrained systems and are thus unlikely to occur in a generic general\nrelativistic context. Instead, gauge invariant quantities generally become\ndiscontinuous, thus not admitting Poisson-algebraic structures and posing\nserious challenges to a quantization. Non-integrability also renders the\nparadigm of relational dynamics cumbersome, thereby straining common\ninterpretations of the dynamics. We illustrate these conceptual and technical\nchallenges with simple toy models. In particular, we exhibit reparametrization\ninvariant models which fail to be integrable and, as a consequence, can either\nnot be quantized with standard methods or lead to sick quantum theories without\na semiclassical limit. These troubles are qualitatively distinct from\nsemiclassical subtleties in unconstrained quantum chaos and can be directly\ntraced back to the scarcity of Dirac observables. As a possible resolution, we\npropose to change the method of quantization by refining the configuration\nspace topology until the generalized observables become continuous in the new\ntopology and can acquire a quantum representation. This leads to the polymer\nquantization method underlying loop quantum cosmology and gravity. Remarkably,\nthe polymer quantum theory circumvents the problems of the quantization with\nsmooth topology, indicating that non-integrability and chaos, while a\nchallenge, may not be a fundamental obstruction for quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 19:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

The low electron density,\nhigh dynamical age, and low surface brightness of the object confirm that it is\nobserved fairly late in its evolution. It shows clear evidence for dredge-up of\nCN-processed material characteristic of its class. In addition, the low\npeculiar velocity of 7 km s$^{-1}$ shows it to be a member of the young disk\ncomponent of our Galaxy.

Modern data sets often contain a large number\nof genes, which can complicate the reconstruction problem due to the fact that\ndifferent genes may undergo different evolutionary histories. This is the case\nin particular in the presence of horizontal genetic transfer (HGT), where a\ngene is inherited from a distant species rather than an immediate ancestor.\nSuch an event produces a gene tree which is distinct from, but related to, the\nspecies phylogeny.\n  In previous work, a natural stochastic models of HGT was introduced and\nstudied. It was shown, both in simulation and theoretical studies, that a\nspecies phylogeny can be reconstructed from gene trees despite surprisingly\nhigh rates of HGT under this model. Rigorous lower and upper bounds on this\nachievable rate were also obtained, but a large gap remained. Here we close\nthis gap, up to a constant. Specifically we show that a species phylogeny can\nbe reconstructed correctly from gene trees even when, on each gene, each edge\nof the species tree has a constant probability of being the location of an HGT\nevent. Our new reconstruction algorithm, which relies only on unrooted gene\ntree topologies, builds the tree recursively from the leaves and runs in\npolynomial time.\n  We also provide a matching bound in the negative direction (up to a constant)\nand extend our results to some cases where gene trees are not perfectly known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 22:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 06:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

For a conducting\nsubstrate with surface plasmon frequency $\\omega_s=\\omega_p/\\sqrt{2}$, the\nsurface plasmon frequency of the hybrid structure always lies below $\\omega_s$.\nThe intensity of this mode depends on the distance of the graphene layers from\nthe surface of the conductor, the energy band gap between the valence and\nconduction bands of MLG and, most importantly, on the number of two-dimensional\n(2D) layers.

Stochastic models of sequence\nevolution are closely related to spin systems that have been extensively\nstudied in statistical physics and that connection has led to important\ninsights on the theoretical properties of phylogenetic reconstruction\nalgorithms as well as the development of new inference methods. Here, we study\nmaximum likelihood, a classical statistical technique which is perhaps the most\nwidely used in phylogenetic practice because of its superior empirical\naccuracy.\n  At the theoretical level, except for its consistency, that is, the guarantee\nof eventual correct reconstruction as the size of the input data grows, much\nremains to be understood about the statistical properties of maximum likelihood\nin this context.

A\nforce-based stochastic relaxation method is employed to obtain force-balanced\nnetwork under cell contraction.

The force chains consist of fiber segments that either\npossess a high degree of alignment before cell contraction or are aligned due\nto the reorientation induced by cell contraction. Large fluctuations of the\nforces along different force chains are observed. Importantly, the decay of the\nforces along the force chains is significantly slower than the decay of\nradially averaged forces in the system.

First,\nby considering the characteristics in the spatial variation of neutron flux\nfrom the spallation target, we propose a multi-point measurement technique,\ni.e. the spallation neutron flux should be measured at multiple vertical\nlocations. To explain why the flux should be measured at multiple locations, we\nhave studied neutron production from a tungsten target bombarded by a 250\nMeV-proton beam with Geant4-based Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation\nresults indicate that the neutron flux at the central location is up to three\norders of magnitude higher than the flux at lower locations. Secondly, we have\ndeveloped an effective technique in order to measure the spallation neutron\nflux with a fission chamber (FC), by establishing the relation between the\nfission rate measured by FC and the spallation neutron flux. Since this\nrelation is linear for a FC, a constant calibration factor is used to derive\nthe neutron flux from the measured fission rate.

In each step of the decoding procedure,\nthe candidate paths with metrics less than a threshold are dropped directly to\navoid the unnecessary computations for the path searching on the descendant\nbranches of them. Given a candidate path, an upper bound of the path metric of\nits descendants is proposed to determined whether the pruning of this candidate\npath would affect frame error rate (FER) performance.

Multiple Gaussian fits are applied to examine the HVFs and\ntheir evolutions, using constraints on expansion velocities for the same\nspecies (i.e., SiII 5972 and SiII 6355). We find that strong HVFs tend to\nappear in SNe Ia with smaller decline rates (e.g., dm15(B)<1.4 mag), clarifying\nthat the finding by Childress et al.

The Si-HVFs seem to be more common in fast-expanding SNe Ia,\nwhich is different from the earlier result that the Ca-HVFs are associated with\nSNe Ia having slower SiII 6355 velocities at maximum light (i.e., Vsi). This\ndifference can be due to that the HVFs in fast-expanding SNe Ia usually\ndisappear more rapidly and are easily blended with the photospheric components\nwhen approaching the maximum light. Moreover, SNe Ia with both stronger HVFs at\nearly phases and larger Vsi are found to have noticeably redder B-V colors and\noccur preferentially in the inner regions of their host galaxies, while those\nwith stronger HVFs but smaller Vsi show opposite tendencies, suggesting that\nthese two subclasses have different explosion environments and their HVFs may\nhave different origins. We further examine the relationships between the\nabsorption features of SiII 6355 and CaII IR lines, and find that their\nphotospheric components are well correlated in velocity and strength but the\ncorresponding HVFs show larger scatter. These results cannot be explained with\nionization and/or thermal processes alone, and different mechanisms are\nrequired for the creation of HVF-forming region in SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2015 15:43:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

A new spectrometer recently proposed\nfor ultra-high-resolution IXS (UHRIX) has achieved 0.6~meV and 0.25~nm$^{-1}$\nspectral and momentum transfer resolutions, respectively. However, further\nimprovements down to 0.1~meV and 0.02~nm$^{-1}$ are required to close the gap\nin energy-momentum space between high and low frequency probes. We show that\nthis goal can be achieved by further optimizing the X-ray optics and by\nincreasing the spectral flux of the incident X-ray pulses. UHRIX performs best\nat energies from 5 to 10 keV, where a combination of self-seeding and undulator\ntapering at the SASE-2 beamline of the European XFEL promises up to a\nhundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with nominal SASE\npulses at saturation, or three orders of magnitude more than possible with\nstorage-ring based radiation sources. Wave-optics propagation shows that about\n$7\\times 10^{12}$~ph/s in a $90$-$\\mu$eV bandwidth can be achieved on the\nsample. This will provide unique new possibilities for dynamics studies by IXS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 22:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

Coefficients have been\ncalculated and are used to realize the matched filter digitally as a finite\nimpulse response filter. Numerical simulations confirm that this correctly\nimplements a matched filter that can be used for detection of the chaotic\nsignal.

There are two questions regarding\nbipedalism: i) why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal? and ii) why\ndid hominins become increasingly bipedal over time and replace their less\nbipedal ancestors? To answer these questions, the prominent theories in the\nfield, such as the savanna-based theory, the postural feeding hypotheses, and\nthe provisioning model, are collectively examined. Because biological evolution\nis an example of trial and error and not a simple causation, there may be\nmultiple answers to the evolution of bipedalism. The postural feeding\nhypothesis (reaching for food/balancing) provides an explanation for the\npartial bipedalism of the earliest hominins. The savannah-based theory\ndescribes how the largely bipedal hominins that started to settle on the ground\nbecame increasingly bipedal. The provisioning model (food-gathering/monogamy)\nexplains questions arising after the postural feeding hypothesis and before the\nsavannah theory in an evolutionary timeline. Indeed, there are no straight\nlines between the theories, and multiple forces could have pushed the evolution\nof bipedalism at different points. Finally, this manuscript states that the\narboreal hominins that possessed ambiguous traits of bipedalism were eliminated\nthrough choice and selection. Using the biological analogy of the okapi and\ngiraffe, I explain how one of the branches (Homo) became increasingly bipedal\nwhile the other (Pan) adapted to locomotion for forest life by narrowing the\nanatomical/biological focus in evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2015 08:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 16:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}
