Considering\nthe majority of short-lived flows, transient effects that have diverse causes,\nsuch as TCP slow start, sleep scheduling in wireless networks, or signalling in\ncellular networks, are, however, predominant. This paper contributes a general\nmodel of regenerative service processes to characterize the transient behavior\nof systems. The model leads to a notion of non-stationary service curves that\ncan be conveniently integrated into the framework of the stochastic network\ncalculus. We derive respective models of sleep scheduling and show the\nsignificant impact of transient phases on backlogs and delays. We also consider\nmeasurement methods that estimate the service of an unknown system from\nobservations of selected probe traffic. We find that the prevailing rate\nscanning method does not recover the service during transient phases well. This\nlimitation is fundamental as it is explained by the non-convexity of\nnon-stationary service curves. A second key difficulty is proven to be due to\nthe super-additivity of network service processes. We devise a novel two-phase\nprobing technique that first determines a minimal pattern of probe traffic.\nThis probe is used to obtain an accurate estimate of the unknown transient\nservice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 16:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

At the mean heliocentric distance of the Uranian system, native CO2 ice\nshould be removed on timescales shorter than the age of the Solar System.\nConsequently, the detected CO2 ice might be actively produced. Analogous to\nirradiation of icy moons in the Jupiter and Saturn systems, we hypothesize that\ncharged particles caught in Uranus' magnetic field bombard the surfaces of the\nUranian satellites, driving a radiolytic CO2 production cycle. To test this\nhypothesis, we investigated the distribution of CO2 ice by analyzing\nnear-infrared (NIR) spectra of these moons, gathered using the SpeX\nspectrograph at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) (2000 - 2013).\nAdditionally, we made spectrophotometric measurements using images gathered by\nthe Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003 -\n2005). We find that the detected CO2 ice is primarily on the trailing\nhemispheres of the satellites closest to Uranus, consistent with other\nobservations of these moons. Our band parameter analysis indicates that the\ndetected CO2 ice is pure and segregated from other constituents. Our\nspectrophotometric analysis indicates that IRAC is not sensitive to the CO2 ice\ndetected by SpeX, potentially because CO2 is retained beneath a thin surface\nlayer dominated by H2O ice that is opaque to photons over IRAC wavelengths.\nThus, our combined SpeX and IRAC analyses suggest that the near-surfaces (i.e.,\ntop few 100 microns) of the Uranian satellites are compositionally stratified.\nWe briefly compare the spectral characteristics of the CO2 ice detected on the\nUranian moons to icy satellites elsewhere, and we also consider the most likely\ndrivers of the observed distribution of CO2 ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 17:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However,\nwe also demonstrate that there is a region of the parameter space which\ndevelops a stable vacuum (up to the Planck scale), satisfies the relic\nabundance, and is in agreement with direct DM searches. Such an interesting\nregion of the parameter space corresponds to DM masses 350 GeV \\alt m_w \\alt 1\nTeV.

To address this problem, most existing algorithms\nmake assumptions to render the latent variables independent of each other,\neither by designing specific priors, or by approximating the true posterior\nusing a factorized distribution. We believe the correlations among latent\nvariables are crucial for faithful data representation.

Called \\emph{spectral source integration} (SSI), this method should see\nwidespread future use in problems that entail (i) point-particle description of\nthe small compact object, (ii) frequency domain decomposition, and (iii) use of\nthe background eccentric geodesic motion. Frequency domain approaches are\nwidely used in both perturbation theory flux-balance calculations and in local\ngravitational self-force calculations. Recent self-force calculations in Lorenz\ngauge, using the frequency domain and method of extended homogeneous solutions,\nhave been able to accurately reach eccentricities as high as $e \\simeq 0.7$. We\nshow here SSI successfully applied to Lorenz gauge. In a double precision\nLorenz gauge code, SSI enhances the accuracy of results and makes a factor of\nthree improvement in the overall speed. The primary initial application of\nSSI--for us its \\emph{raison d'\\^{e}tre}--is in an arbitrary precision\n\\emph{Mathematica} code that computes perturbations of eccentric orbits in the\nRegge-Wheeler gauge to extraordinarily high accuracy (e.g., 200 decimal\nplaces). These high accuracy eccentric orbit calculations would not be possible\nwithout the exponential convergence of SSI. We believe the method will extend\nto work for inspirals on Kerr, and will be the subject of a later publication.\nSSI borrows concepts from discrete-time signal processing and is used to\ncalculate the mode normalization coefficients in perturbation theory via sums\nover modest numbers of points around an orbit. A variant of the idea is used to\nobtain spectral accuracy in solution of the geodesic orbital motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 20:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

Such matrices are\ncalled stochastic density matrices in order to reflect an analogy with the\nquantum mechanical density matrices. The SDM approximation of a PDF satisfies\nthe normalization condition and is nonnegative everywhere in contrast to the\ntruncated Gram-Charlier and Edgeworth expansions. For bases with an algebraic\nstructure, such as the Hermite polynomial and Fourier bases, the SDM\napproximation can be chosen so as to satisfy given moment specifications and\ncan be optimized using a quadratic proximity criterion.

This leads\nto an ordinary differential equation for the SDM dynamics of the approximating\nPDF. As an example, we consider the Smoluchowski SDE on a multidimensional\ntorus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 21:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 05:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

LW escape fractions are thus a key parameter in cosmological\nsimulations of early reionization and star formation but have not yet been\nparametrized for realistic halos by halo or stellar mass. To do so, we perform\nradiation hydrodynamical simulations of LW UV escape from 9--120 M$_{\\odot}$\nPop III stars in $10^5$ to $10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ halos with ZEUS-MP. We find that\nphotons in the LW lines (i.e. those responsible for destroying H$_{2}$ in\nnearby systems) have escape fractions ranging from 0% to 85%.

Current model-based implementations of this approach\nlack an appropriate model for the tree describing the diversification and\nfossilization process and can produce estimates that lead to erroneous\nconclusions. We address this shortcoming by providing a total-evidence method\nimplemented in a Bayesian framework. This approach uses a mechanistic tree\nprior to describe the underlying diversification process that generated the\ntree of extant and fossil taxa. Previous attempts to apply the total-evidence\napproach have used tree priors that do not account for the possibility that\nfossil samples may be direct ancestors of other samples. The fossilized\nbirth-death (FBD) process explicitly models the diversification, fossilization,\nand sampling processes and naturally allows for sampled ancestors. This model\nwas recently applied to estimate divergence times based on molecular data and\nfossil occurrence dates. We incorporate the FBD model and a model of\nmorphological trait evolution into a Bayesian total-evidence approach to dating\nspecies phylogenies. We apply this method to extant and fossil penguins and\nshow that the modern penguins radiated much more recently than has been\npreviously estimated, with the basal divergence in the crown clade occurring at\n~12.7 Ma and most splits leading to extant species occurring in the last 2\nmillion years.

For various layouts of\nweb pages and typically small sizes of handheld portable devices, the\nimportance in the original image content gets obfuscated after resizing it with\nthe approach of uniform scaling. Thus, there occurs a need for resizing the\nimages in a content aware manner which can automatically discard irrelevant\ninformation from the image and present the salient features with more\nmagnitude.

At a fixed chemical potential, spiral phases exist only up to\nvalues of $J$ which are less than roughly half the electronic bandwidth. At a\nfixed electron density and near half filling, the system phase separates into a\nhalf-filled antiferromagnetic phase and a spiral phase.

Jet\nsubstructure is essentially determined by QCD radiations and non-perturbative\neffects. Predictions of jet substructure are usually different among Monte\nCarlo event generators, and are governed by the parton shower algorithm\nimplemented. For leading logarithmic parton shower, even though one of the core\nvariables is the evolution variable, its choice is not unique. We examine\nevolution variable dependence of the jet substructure by developing a parton\nshower generator that interpolates between different evolution variables using\na parameter $\\alpha$. Jet shape variables and associated jet rates for quark\nand gluon jets are used to demonstrate the $\\alpha$-dependence of the jet\nsubstructure. We find angular ordered shower predicts wider jets, while\nrelative transverse momentum ($p_{\\bot}$) ordered shower predicts narrower\njets. This is qualitatively in agreement with the missing phase space of\n$p_{\\bot}$ ordered showers. Such difference can be reduced by tuning other\nparameters of the showering algorithm, especially in the low energy region,\nwhile the difference tends to increase for high energy jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 01:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

The subject of one of these heated discussions is the\nso-called \"retrodiction paradox\", namely a deceptive inconsistency of quantum\nmechanics which is often associated with the \"measurement paradox\" and the\n\"collapse of the wave function\"; it comes from the apparent time-asymmetry\nbetween state preparation and measurement. Actually, in the literature one\nfinds several versions of the retrodiction paradox; however, a particularly\ninsightful one was presented by Sir Roger Penrose in his seminal book \\emph{The\nRoad to Reality}. Here, we address the question to what degree Penrose's\nretrodiction paradox occurs in the classical and quantum domain. We achieve a\ntwofold result.

Currently there is a lack of\nscalable statistical procedures for two-network comparisons aimed at detecting\nlocalised topological differences.

Un- derstanding nuclear fission, apart from a\ntheoretical point of view, is of practical importance for energy production and\nthe transmutation of nuclear waste. In nuclear astrophysics, fission sets the\nupper limit to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements via the r-process. In this\nwork we initiated a systematic study of intermediate energy proton-induced\nfission using the Constrained Molecu- lar Dynamics (CoMD) code. The CoMD code\nimplements an effective interaction with a nuclear matter compressibility of\nK=200 (soft EOS) with several forms of the density dependence of the\nnucleon-nucleon symmetry potential. Moreover, a constraint is imposed in the\nphase-space occu- pation for each nucleon restoring the Pauli principle at each\ntime step of the collision. A proper choice of the surface parameter of the\neffective interaction has been made to describe fission. In this work, we\npresent results of fission calculations for proton-induced reactions on : a)\n232 Th at 27 and 63 MeV, b) 235 U at 10, 30, 60 and 100 MeV, and c) 238 U at\n100 and 660 MeV. The calculated observables include fission-fragment mass\ndistributions, total fission energies, neutron multiplicities and fission\ntimes. These observables are compared to available experimental data. We show\nthat the microscopic CoMD code is able to describe the complicated many-body\ndynamics of the fission process at intermediate and high energy and give a\nreasonable estimate of the fission time scale. Sensitivity of the results to\nthe density dependence of the nucleon symmetry potential (and, thus, the\nnuclear symmetry energy) is found. Further improvements of the code are\nnecessary to achieve a satisfactory description of low energy fission in which\nshell effects play a dominant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 06:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

This impact could have been so\nenergetic that it could have mixed and homogenized the Earth's mantle. However,\nthis view appears to be inconsistent with geochemical studies that suggest that\nthe Earth's mantle was not mixed by the impact. Another plausible outcome is\nthat this energetic impact melted the whole mantle, but the extent of mantle\nmelting is not well understood even though it must have had a significant\neffect on the subsequent evolution of the Earth's interior and atmosphere. To\nunderstand the initial state of the Earth's mantle, we perform giant impact\nsimulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) for three different\nmodels: (a) standard: a Mars-sized impactor hits the proto-Earth, (b)\nfast-spinning Earth: a small impactor hits a rapidly rotating proto-Earth, and\n(c) sub-Earths: two half Earth-sized planets collide. We use two types of\nequations of state (MgSiO3 liquid and forsterite) to describe the Earth's\nmantle. We find that the mantle remains unmixed in (a), but it may be mixed in\n(b) and (c). The extent of mixing is most extensive in (c). Therefore, (a) is\nmost consistent and (c) may be least consistent with the preservation of the\nmantle heterogeneity, while (b) may fall between. We determine that the Earth's\nmantle becomes mostly molten by the impact in all of the models. The choice of\nthe equations of state does not affect these outcomes. Additionally, our\nresults indicate that entropy gains of the mantle materials by a giant impact\ncannot be predicted well by the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. Moreover, we show\nthat the mantle can remain unmixed on a Moon-forming timescale if it does not\nbecome mixed by the impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 06:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Several approaches have been considered\nin the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the\nnumber of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and\ndestination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of\nthis law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another\npopular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which\nargues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only\nthe role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between\nthem. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two\napproaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them\nagainst empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different\ncountries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities\nlaws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the\nprobability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called\ntrip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the\ncommuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We\nshow that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities\nlaws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network\nand to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting\ncommuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different\napproaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since\ntheir only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 09:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 06:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 08:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

Near secondary eclipse, when the\nplanet passes behind the parent star, the star sequentially obscures light from\nthe approaching and receding parts of the rotating planetary surface. The\ntemporal block of light emerging from the approaching (blue-shifted) or\nreceding (red-shifted) parts of the planet causes a temporal distortion in the\nplanet's spectral line profiles resulting in an anomaly in the planet's radial\nvelocity curve.

We conclude that mean\nglobal temperature changes related to TSI are not significant from 1975\nonwards.\n  Before 1975, when anthropogenic gases were less important, many of the\ntemperature changes can be attributed to TSI variations. Over much longer\nperiods of time, from Kyear to Myear, the TSI changes are more efficient still,\nthe sensitivity alpha increasing ro about 0.5. Since 1975 the changes in mean\nglobal temperature are not due to TSI changes, but rather to the increasing\natmospheric CO2 content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 11:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Standard turbulence models, like RaNS (Reynolds averaged\nNavier-Stokes) and LES (Large Eddy Simulation), are applied to flows in\nengineering, but they miss small scale effects, which are frequently of\nimportance, see e.g. the whole area of reactive flows, flows with apparent\nPrandtl or Schmidt number effects, or even wall bounded flows. A recent\nalternative to these standard approaches is the one-dimensional turbulence\n(ODT) model, which is limited to 1D sub-domains. In two papers we will provide\na generalized filter strategy, called XLES (extended LES), including a formal\ntheory (part I) and one special approach in the XLES family of models, called\nODTLES (in part II (see Glawe et al. (2015))). ODTLES uses an ODT sub-grid\nmodel to describe all turbulent scales not represented by XLES, which leaves\nthe larger scales to be simulated in 3D. This allows a turbulence modeling\napproach with a 3D resolution mainly independent of the turbulent intensity.\nThus ODTLES is able to compute highly turbulent flows in domains of moderate\ncomplexity affordably and including the full range of turbulent and diffusive\nscales.

Both models filter the governing flow equations. Thus a scale separation\napproach is introduced for modeling purposes with the large scales simulated\nusing a numerical scheme while smaller scales are assumed to be less important\nand might be modeled more or less easily. Unfortunately small scales are\nfrequently of big importance, e.g. in reactive flows, wall bounded flows, or\nflows with significant Prandtl or Schmidt number effects. Recent alternatives\nto these standard models are the class of models based on the one-dimensional\nturbulence (ODT) idea, like ODTLES. The ability of ODT to capture highly\nturbulent flows (recently up to $Re_\\tau = 6\\times 10^5$) allows ODTLES to\nrealize 3D resolutions basically independent of the turbulent intensity. In two\npapers we provide a formal theory and application of an innovative modeling\nstrategy for highly turbulent flows in domains of moderate complexity: In part\nI (see Glawe et al. (2015)) a new general filtering approach, called XLES\n(extended LES), is introduced. Contrary to LES, XLES is based on 2D filtering\nof the governing equations, whereby additional small scale terms are\ninterpreted numerically. In this work a new ansatz for the ODTLES model is\nintroduced as one special approach in the XLES family of models by\nincorporating the ODT model into XLES. The ODT model introduces microstructures\nnot captured by the XLES filtered equations. To illustrate the ODTLES model\ncapabilities, turbulent channel and duct flows up to friction Reynolds number\n$Re_\\tau = 10000$ are studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 12:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

For short\ntimes, the walker concentration decays as a stretched exponential of the depth\nz, but a crossover to long time normal diffusion is observed in most samples.\nThe anomalous concentration profile remains at long times in very porous solids\nif the walker steps are restricted to nearest neighbors and is accompanied with\nsubdiffusion features.

The study of RW of tracer particles left at the internal\npart of the solid rules out an interpretation by diffusion equations with\nposition-dependent coefficients.

According to its widespread interpretation, a violation of the\nLegget-Garg inequality disproofs macroscopic realism and non-invasiveness.\nNevertheless, recent results point out that macroscopic realism is a model\ndependent notion and that one should always be able to attribute to\ninvasiveness a violation of a Legget-Garg inequality. This opens some natural\nquestions: how to provide such an attribution in a systematic way? How can\napparent macroscopic realism violation be recast into a dimensional independent\ninvasiveness model? The present work answers these questions by introducing an\noperational model where the effects of invasiveness are controllable through a\nparameter associated with what is called the {\\it measurability} of the\nphysical system. Such a parameter leads to different generalized measurements\nthat can be associated with the dimensionality of a system, to measurement\nerrors or to back action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 14:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 13:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 15:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-07"}

We establish energy partitions relative to the total\nbolometric radiated flare energy for different observed components of stellar\nflares, and show that there is rough agreement for these values with solar\nflares. We apply an equipartition between the bolometric radiated flare energy\nand kinetic energy in an accompanying mass ejection, seen in solar eruptive\nevents and expected from reconnection. This allows an integrated flare rate in\na particular waveband to be used to estimate the amount of associated transient\nmass loss. This approach is supported by a good correspondence between\nobservational flare signatures on high flaring rate stars and the Sun, which\nsuggests a common physical origin. If the frequent and extreme flares that\nyoung solar-like stars and low-mass stars experience are accompanied by\ntransient mass loss in the form of coronal mass ejections, then the cumulative\neffect of this mass loss could be large. We find that for young solar-like\nstars and active M dwarfs, the total mass lost due to transient magnetic\neruptions could have significant impacts on disk evolution, and thus planet\nformation, and also exoplanet habitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 14:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

However, the semantic structure inherent in observations is\noftentimes lost in the process. Human perception excels at understanding\nsemantics but cannot always be expressed in terms of labels. Thus,\n\\emph{oracles} or \\emph{human-in-the-loop systems}, for example crowdsourcing,\nare often employed to generate similarity constraints using an implicit\nsimilarity function encoded in human perception. In this work we propose to\ncombine \\emph{generative unsupervised feature learning} with a\n\\emph{probabilistic treatment of oracle information like triplets} in order to\ntransfer implicit privileged oracle knowledge into explicit nonlinear Bayesian\nlatent factor models of the observations. We use a fast variational algorithm\nto learn the joint model and demonstrate applicability to a well-known image\ndataset. We show how implicit triplet information can provide rich information\nto learn representations that outperform previous metric learning approaches as\nwell as generative models without this side-information in a variety of\npredictive tasks. In addition, we illustrate that the proposed approach\ncompartmentalizes the latent spaces semantically which allows interpretation of\nthe latent variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 15:54:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 05:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 04:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 23:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

While adaptive processes are ubiquitous in mechanistic theories of\nemergent social complexity, complementary theories understand incentives,\neducation, and other inducements to rationality as able to suppress such\noutcomes.\n  We show in a series of laboratory experiments that, rather than suppressing\ncomplex social dynamics, sophisticated reasoning processes can support them.\nOur experiments elicit flocking behavior in groups and show that it is driven\nby the human ability to recursively anticipate the reasoning of others. We\nidentify this sophisticated flocking in three different games---the Beauty\nPageant, Mod Game, and Runway Game---across which game theory predicts no\nformal similarity. The persistence of sophisticated flocking across unrelated\ngame types not only speaks to the phenomenon's robustness, it also suggests\nthat people are treating three supposedly different decision settings as\nconceptually similar, implicating a second sophisticated cognitive ability:\nhuman concept formation. We also find in participants' underlying reasoning\nthat the number of recursions they perform is limited not by any individual's\ncognitive abilities, but by a social norm that emerges during flocking.\n  By implicating both recursive reasoning and concept formation in complex\ndynamics, we support interdisciplinary perspectives that emergent complexity is\ntypical of even the most intelligent populations and carefully designed social\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 22:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 05:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 15:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}
