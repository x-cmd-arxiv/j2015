The MPD equation of motion\nis decomposed in the orthonormal tetrad whose time vector is given by the\nfour-velocity $V^\\mu$ chosen to fix the spin condition (the \"reference\nobserver\") and the first spatial vector by the corresponding spin; such\nprojections do not contain the Weyl scalars $\\Psi_0$ and $\\Psi_4$ obtained in\nthe associated Newman-Penrose (NP) null tetrad.

We provide fits to these results as a function of baryon\ndensity and of the number of neutrino flavors, N_nu.

These\nmeasurements allow for a tight test of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data\nalone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our\nBBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light\nelements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of the\nprimordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations\nare now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions, and are\nconsistent with the Standard Model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H\nnow provides a tight measurement of N_nu when combined with the CMB baryon\ndensity, and provides a 2sigma upper limit N_nu < 3.2. The new precision of the\nCMB and of D/H observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest\nsource of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore\nrely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and he4, li7\npredictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 16:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

In this picture, we show that an\nexplosion energy of ~2x10^{52} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundred\nsolar radii would be required to power the early emission. The competing engine\nmodels involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-back\naccretion onto a central black hole. The prompt energy required may favour the\nblack hole scenario.

The latest proof\nof the SQL is analyzed to revleal an unsupported assumption on quantum\nmeasurements. Quantum measurement theory is introduced to give a general\ncriterion for physically realizable measurements in quantum mechanics. A theory\nof approximate position measurements is developed to obtain a rigorous\ncondition for the SQL and also to show that a precise position measurement can\nleave the object in an arbitrary family of states independent of the input\nstate. This concludes that Yuen's proposal of breaking the SQL by a contractive\nstate measurement, a measurement of the position leaving the free mass in a\nstate with the position uncertainty decreasing in time, is physically\nrealizable in principle. To enforce this conclusion, a model for error-free\nposition measurement that leaves the object in a contractive state is\nconstructed with a solvable Hamiltonian for measuring interaction. Finally,\nthis model is shown to break the SQL with arbitrary accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 17:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

A simultaneous description of the realistic\nevolution of the gaseous and solid components in a disk may provide a clue for\nsolving the problem of the mass concentration of the terrestrial planets in the\nsolar system. We simulate the formation of terrestrial planets from planetary\nembryos in a disk that evolves via magnetorotational instability and a disk\nwind. The aim is to examine the effects of a disk wind on the orbital evolution\nand final configuration of planetary systems. We perform N-body simulations of\nsixty 0.1 Earth-mass embryos in an evolving disk. The evolution of the gas\nsurface density of the disk is tracked by solving a one-dimensional diffusion\nequation with a sink term that accounts for the disk wind. We find that even in\nthe case of a weak disk wind, the radial slope of the gas surface density of\nthe inner disk becomes shallower, which slows or halts the type I migration of\nembryos. If the effect of the disk wind is strong, the disk profile is\nsignificantly altered (e.g., positive surface density gradient, inside-out\nevacuation), leading to outward migration of embryos inside ~ 1 AU. Disk winds\nplay an essential role in terrestrial planet formation inside a few AU by\nchanging the disk profile. In addition, embryos can undergo convergent\nmigration to ~ 1 AU in certainly probable conditions. In such a case, the\ncharacteristic features of the solar system's terrestrial planets (e.g., mass\nconcentration around 1 AU, late giant impact) may be reproduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 17:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

We find that the value of the critical wave vector is\nstrongly spin polarization-dependent, in a way that has no analog in ordinary\ntwo-dimensional electron gases. The origin of this effect is in the coupling\nbetween the plasmon and the inter-band electron-hole pairs of the minority spin\ncarriers.

While previous works on\ncoordination commonly assume an asymptotically vanishing error, we assume\nexact, zero error coordination. Furthermore, unlike previous works that employ\nthe empirical or strong notions of coordination, we define and use a notion of\nset coordination. This notion of coordination bears similarities with the\nempirical notion of coordination. We observe that set coordination, in its\nspecial case of two nodes with a one-way communication link is equivalent with\nthe \"Hide and Seek\" source coding problem of McEliece and Posner. The Hide and\nSeek problem has known intimate connections with graph entropy, rate distortion\ntheory, Renyi mutual information and even error exponents.

Existing methods for\nconstructing housing indices are computed at a coarse spatial granularity, such\nas metropolitan regions, which can mask or distort price dynamics apparent in\nlocal markets, such as neighborhoods and census tracts. A challenge in moving\nto estimates at, for example, the census tract level is the sparsity of\nspatiotemporally localized house sales observations. Our work aims at\naddressing this challenge by leveraging observations from multiple census\ntracts discovered to have correlated valuation dynamics. Our proposed Bayesian\nnonparametric approach builds on the framework of latent factor models to\nenable a flexible, data-driven method for inferring the clustering of\ncorrelated census tracts. We explore methods for scalability and\nparallelizability of computations, yielding a housing valuation index at the\nlevel of census tract rather than zip code, and on a monthly basis rather than\nquarterly. Our analysis is provided on a large Seattle metropolitan housing\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 20:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-07"}

Small cells\nare proved to give high EE, but the EE improvement saturates quickly with the\nBS density. Interestingly, the maximal EE is achieved by also equipping the BSs\nwith multiple antennas and operate in a \"massive MIMO\" fashion, where the array\ngain from coherent detection mitigates interference and the multiplexing of\nmany users reduces the energy cost per user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 20:49:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 18:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

Computationally efficient and powerful tools are in\ngreat need for the identification of new gene-gene interactions in\nhigh-dimensional association studies. Result: We develop C++ software for\ngenome-wide gene-gene interaction analyses (GWGGI). GWGGI utilizes tree-based\nalgorithms to search a large number of genetic markers for a disease-associated\njoint association with the consideration of high-order interactions, and then\nuses non-parametric statistics to test the joint association. The package\nincludes two functions, likelihood ratio Mann-whitney (LRMW) and Tree\nAssembling Mann-whitney (TAMW).We optimize the data storage and computational\nefficiency of the software, making it feasible to run the genome-wide analysis\non a personal computer. The use of GWGGI was demonstrated by using two real\ndata-sets with nearly 500 k genetic markers. Conclusion: Through the empirical\nstudy, we demonstrated that the genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis\nusing GWGGI could be accomplished within a reasonable time on a personal\ncomputer (i.e., ~3.5 hours for LRMW and ~10 hours for TAMW).

The ribbon is connected with semi-infinite quantum wires as the leads.\nThe S-W reconstruction occurs on the edges and the interfaces between the\nelectrodes and ribbon. When the reconstruction occurs on the edges, the\nconductance is suppressed considerably if the gate voltage $V_g$ takes\nintermediate values around $|V_{g}|\\sim t_0$($t_0$ being the hopping amplitude\nof grahene) in both positive and negative energy regions.

The effect of edge reconstruction\nbecome less important with increasing ribbon width as expected. The S-W\nreconstruction occurs also possibly at the interfaces.

In this work, we exploit the simple\nobservation that actions are accompanied by contextual cues to build a strong\naction recognition system. We adapt RCNN to use more than one region for\nclassification while still maintaining the ability to localize the action. We\ncall our system R*CNN. The action-specific models and the feature maps are\ntrained jointly, allowing for action specific representations to emerge.

Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic\nvariants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g.,\ngenome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint\nassociation analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we\nproposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees\nAssembling Mann whitney (TAMW).

Meanwhile, leftover debris from the formation of Charon was\nnot initially distant enough from Pluto-Charon to explain the orbits of the\ncurrent small satellites. The outstanding problems of the system are the\nmovement of debris outward and the small satellites location near mean motion\nresonances with Charon.\n  This work explores the dynamical behavior of collisionally interacting debris\norbiting the Pluto-Charon system.

Here, we expand upon this initial work to systematically\ninvestigate the effect of substitutional admixing on the energy levels of band\nedges. Density functional theory was used to survey potential admixing\ncandidates that modify either the conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band\nmaximum (VBM). We considered two sets of compositions based on\nLu$_3$B$_5$O$_{12}$ where B = Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb; and RE$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$,\nwhere RE = Lu, Gd, Dy, and Er.

Specifically, Ga and In decrease\nthe band gap by lowering the CBM, while As and Sb decrease the band gap by\nraising the VBM. These results demonstrate a powerful approach to quickly\nscreen the impact of dopants on the electronic structure of scintillator\ncompounds, identifying those dopants which alter the band edges in very\nspecific ways to eliminate both electron and hole traps responsible for\nperformance limitations.

We present numerical calculations of the\ntime-variable emission of a blazar based on a proposal by Marscher et al.\n(2010) to explain such events. In this model, a plasmoid (\"blob\") propagates\nrelativistically along the spine of a blazar jet and passes through a\nsynchrotron-emitting ring of electrons representing a shocked portion of the\njet sheath.

Such\nchains are deep in the insulating state, where superconducting phase coherence\nacross the chain is absent, and a voltage threshold for conduction is observed\nat the lowest temperatures. We find that Cooper-pair tunneling in such chains\nis completely suppressed. Instead, charge transport is dominated by tunneling\nof single electrons, which is very sensitive to the presence of BCS\nquasiparticles on the superconducting islands of the chain. Consequently we\nobserve a strong parity effect, where the threshold voltage vanishes sharply at\na characteristic parity temperature $T^*$, which is significantly lower than\nthe the critical temperature, $T_c$. A measurable and thermally-activated\nzero-bias conductance appears above $T^*$, with an activation energy equal to\nthe superconducting gap, confirming the role of thermally-excited\nquasiparticles. Conduction below $T^*$ and above the voltage threshold occurs\nvia injection of single electrons/holes into the Cooper-pair insulator, forming\na non-equilibrium steady state with a significantly enhanced effective\ntemperature. Our results explicitly show that single-electron transport\ndominates deep in the insulating state of Josephson-junction arrays.

First, the basic dynamics is modified in order to represent\neconomies where immediate wealth exchanges are carried out, instead of\nreshufflings or uni-directional movements of wealth. Such dynamics produces\nwealth distributions that describe more faithfully real data at small values of\nwealth. Secondly, a general probabilistic trading criterion is introduced, so\nthat two economic units can decide independently whether to trade or not\ndepending on their profit. It is found that the type of the equilibrium wealth\ndistribution is the same for a large class of trading criteria formulated in a\nsymmetrical way with respect to the two interacting units. This establishes\nunexpected links between and provides a microscopic foundations of various\nkinetic exchange models in which the existence of a saving propensity is\npostulated. We also study the generalized heterogeneous version of the model in\nwhich units use different trading criteria and show that suitable sets of\ndiversified parameter values with a moderate level of heterogeneity can\nreproduce realistic wealth distributions with a Pareto power law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 07:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-07"}

The APs in part of an\narterial wall are inhomogeneous on size and on distribution. In order to\nunderstand this in-homogeneity, the pathology of APs is analyzed by Misrepair\nmechanism, a mechanism proposed in our Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. I.\nIn general, development of an AP is a result of repair of injured endothelium.\nBecause of infusion and deposition of lipids beneath endothelial cells, the\nrepair has to be achieved by altered remodeling of local endothelium. Such a\nrepair is a Misrepair. During repair, smooth muscular cells (SMCs) are\nclustered and collagen fibers are produced to the lesion of endothelium for\nreconstructing an anchoring structure for endothelial cells and for forming a\nbarrier to isolate the lipids. II. Altered remodeling (Misrepair) makes the\nlocal part of endothelium have increased damage-sensitivity and reduced\nrepair-efficiency. Thus, this part of endothelium will have increased risk for\ninjuries, lipid-infusion, and Misrepairs. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs\nand focalized deposition of lipids result in development of a plaque. III. By a\nviscous circle between lipid-infusion and endothelium-Misrepair, growing of an\nAP is self-accelerating. Namely, once an AP develops, it grows in an increasing\nrate with time and it does not stop growing. Within part of an arterial wall,\nolder APs grow faster than younger ones. The oldest and the biggest AP is the\nmost threatening one in narrowing local vessel lumen. Therefore, the\nself-accelerated growing of an AP is a fatal factor in atherosclerosis.

A data set of temporal event sequences can\nbe represented as a data set of three-dimensional points, each point is defined\nby three variables: a sequence identifier, a time value and an event value.\nInstantiating data grid models to the 3D-points turns the problem into\n3D-coclustering.\n  The sequences are partitioned into clusters, the time variable is discretized\ninto intervals and the events are partitioned into clusters. The cross-product\nof the univariate partitions forms a multivariate partition of the\nrepresentation space, i.e., a grid of cells and it also represents a\nnonparametric estimator of the joint distribution of the sequences, time and\nevents dimensions. Thus, the sequences are grouped together because they have\nsimilar joint distribution of time and events, i.e., similar distribution of\nevents along the time dimension. The best data grid is computed using a\nparameter-free Bayesian model selection approach. We also suggest several\ncriteria for exploiting the resulting grid through agglomerative hierarchies,\nfor interpreting the clusters of sequences and characterizing their components\nthrough insightful visualizations.

We explore here to what extent CO (or its isotopologues) can be used as\na tracer of gas mass. We use a detailed gas-grain chemical model and study the\nevolution of the disk composition, starting from a dense pre-stellar core\ncomposition. We explore a range of disk temperature profiles, cosmic rays\nionization rates, and disk ages for a disk model representative of T Tauri\nstars. At the high densities that prevail in disks, we find that, due to fast\nreactions on grain surfaces, CO can be converted to less volatile forms\n(principally s-CO$_2$, and to a lesser extent s-CH$_4$) instead of being\nevaporated over a wide range of temperature. The canonical gas-phase abundance\nof 10$^{-4}$ is only reached above about 30-35 K. The dominant Carbon bearing\nentity depends on the temperature structure and age of the disk. The chemical\nevolution of CO is also sensitive to the cosmic rays ionization rate. Larger\ngas phase CO abundances are found in younger disks. Initial conditions, such as\nparent cloud age and density, have a limited impact. This study reveals that CO\ngas-phase abundance is heavily dependent on grain surface processes, which\nremain very incompletely understood so far. The strong dependence on dust\ntemperature profile makes CO a poor tracer of the gas-phase content of disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 10:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

In particular, the highly dynamic nature of\ngeneration and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy\nresources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved\nthrough demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential\noverload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of\nthis mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is\nnevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid\nand its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an\ninteractive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in\norder to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze\ndata being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain\ninsights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems.\nThe outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential\nbuildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of\nhardware measurement units and a management software. The Mj\\\"olnir framework,\nwhich we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback\nconcepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying\ndisaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily\nproduction and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an\nadvisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 10:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-07"}

Indeed, the classical \"dirty image\" is an\nupper bound, but a much tighter upper bound can be formed from the data using\narray processing techniques. This formulates image formation as a least squares\noptimization problem with inequality constraints. We propose to solve this\nconstrained least squares problem using active set techniques, and the steps\nneeded to implement it are described.

The three-body wave\nfunctions are in both cases obtained by means of the adiabatic expansion\nmethod. The information concerning all the possible incoming and outgoing\nchannels, which appears naturally when the continuum is not discretized, seems\nto be lost when the discretization is implemented. In this work we show that\nboth methods are fully equivalent, and the full information contained in the\nthree-body wave function is actually preserved in the discrete spectrum.\nTherefore, in those cases when the asymptotic behaviour is not known\nanalytically, i.e., when the Coulomb interaction is involved, the\ndiscretization technique can be safely used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 12:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

While conventional\nbeamforming schemes aim at the minimization of the transmit power subject to\nsuppressing interference to guarantee quality of service (QoS) constraints,\nhere we use the knowledge of both data and channel state information (CSI) at\nthe transmitter to exploit, rather than suppress, constructive interference.\nMore specifically, we design a new precoding scheme for the MISO downlink that\nminimizes the transmit power for generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated\nsignals. The proposed precoder reduces the transmit power compared to\nconventional schemes, by adapting the QoS constraints to accommodate\nconstructive interference as a source of useful signal power. By exploiting the\npower of constructively interfering symbols, the proposed scheme achieves the\nrequired QoS at lower transmit power. We extend this concept to the signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) balancing problem, where higher SINR\nvalues compared to the conventional SINR balancing optimization are achieved\nfor given transmit power budgets. In addition, we derive equivalent virtual\nmulticast formulations for both optimizations, both of which provide insights\nof the optimal solution and facilitate the design of a more efficient solver.\nFinally, we propose a robust beamforming technique to deal with imperfect CSI,\nthat also reduces the transmit power over conventional techniques, while\nguaranteeing the required QoS. Our simulation and analysis show significant\npower savings for small scale MISO downlink channels with the proposed\ndata-aided optimization compared to conventional beamforming optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 13:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-07"}

Tissue fibrosis is associated with aging of most of\nour organs, and it is the main pathology in arteriosclerosis, chronic\nbronchitis/emphysema, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The causes and\ncharacteristics of fibrosis are analyzed with Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism\nproposed in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. Tissue fibrosis is known to be\na result of repairs of tissue by collagen fibers. A repair with collagen fibers\nis a manner of \"Misrepair\". The collagen fibers are used for replacing dead\ncells or disrupted extracellular matrixes (ECMs) including elastic fibers,\nmyofibers, and basement membrane. The progressive tissue fibrosis with age\nmanifests the essential role of Misrepair in aging, because it reveals three\nfacts: A. a process of Misrepair exists; B. Misrepairs are unavoidable; and C.\nMisrepairs accumulate. As a result of accumulation of Misrepairs of tissue with\ncollagen fibers, tissue fibrosis is focalized and self-accelerating, appearing\nas growing of spots of hyaline degeneration. Fibrosis results in stiffness or\natrophy of an organ and progressive failure of the organ. In arteriosclerosis,\nthe deposition of collagen fibers in arterial wall is for replacing disrupted\nelastic fibers or myofibers, however results in hardness of the wall. Wrinkle\nformation is part of skin fibrosis, and it may be a result of accumulation of\ncollagen fibers of different lengths. Senile hair-loss and hair-whitening are\nprobably consequence of dermal fibrosis.

Here we introduce and study biased random walks on\nmultiplex networks, graphs where the nodes are related through different types\nof links organised in distinct and interacting layers, and we provide\nanalytical solutions for their long-time properties, including the stationary\noccupation probability distribution and the entropy rate. We focus on\ndegree-biased random walks and distinguish between two classes of walks, namely\nthose whose transition probability depends on a number of parameters which is\nextensive in the number of layers, and those whose motion depends on\nintrinsically multiplex properties of the neighbouring nodes. We analyse the\neffect of the structure of the multiplex network on the steady-state behaviour\nof the walkers, and we find that heterogeneous degree distributions as well as\nthe presence of inter-layer degree correlations and edge overlap determine the\nextent to which a multiplex can be efficiently explored by a biased walk.\nFinally we show that, in real-world multiplex transportation networks, the\ntrade-off between efficient navigation and resilience to link failure has\nresulted into systems whose diffusion properties are qualitatively different\nfrom those of appropriately randomised multiplex graphs. This fact suggests\nthat multiplexity is an important ingredient to include in the modelling of\nreal-world systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 14:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 15:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The focus is put\nhere on stability with respect to perturbations of the same period as the wave,\nfor KdV-like systems of one-dimensional Hamiltonian PDEs. Stability criteria\nare derived and investigated first in a general abstract framework, and then\napplied to three basic examples that are very closely related, and ubiquitous\nin mathematical physics, namely, a quasilinear version of the generalized\nKorteweg--de Vries equation (qKdV), and the Euler--Korteweg system in both\nEulerian coordinates (EKE) and in mass Lagrangian coordinates (EKL).

Both are expressed in terms of a\nsingle function, the abbreviated action integral along the orbits of waves in\nthe phase plane, which is the counterpart of the solitary waves moment of\ninstability introduced by Boussinesq. Regarding solitary waves, the celebrated\nGrillakis--Shatah--Strauss stability criteria amount to looking for the sign of\nthe second derivative of the moment of instability with respect to the wave\nspeed. For periodic waves, the most striking results obtained here can be\nsummarized as: an odd value for the difference between N -- the size of the PDE\nsystem -- and the negative signature of the Hessian of the action implies\nspectral instability, whereas a negative signature of the same Hessian being\nequal to N implies orbital stability. Since these stability criteria are merely\nencoded by the negative signature of matrices, they can at least be checked\nnumerically.

In close analogy to a\nclassical Markov process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a\nnoisy environment is often modelled by a dynamical semigroup with a generator\nin Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics leading to an\nirreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many\napplications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of\ngenuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence and correlations.

The low spin-orbit coupling typical for carbon-based materials and\nthe resulting long spin lifetimes give rise to a large influence of the\nelectron spin on charge transport which can be exploited in spintronic devices\nor to improve solar cell efficiencies. Magnetic resonance techniques are\nparticularly helpful to elucidate the microscopic structure of paramagnetic\nstates in semiconductors as well as the transport processes they are involved\nin. However, in organic devices the nature of the dominant spin-dependent\nprocesses is still subject to considerable debate. Using multi-frequency pulsed\nelectrically detected magnetic resonance (pEDMR), we show that the\nspin-dependent response of P3HT/PCBM solar cells at low temperatures is\ngoverned by bipolar polaron pair recombination involving the positive and\nnegative polarons in P3HT and PCBM, respectively, thus excluding a unipolar\nbipolaron formation as the main contribution to the spin-dependent charge\ntransfer in this temperature regime. Moreover the polaron-polaron coupling\nstrength and the recombination times of polaron pairs with parallel and\nantiparallel spins are determined. Our results demonstrate that the pEDMR pulse\nsequences recently developed for inorganic semiconductor devices can very\nsuccessfully be transferred to the study of spin and charge transport in\norganic semiconductors, in particular when the different polarons can be\ndistinguished spectrally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 15:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}
