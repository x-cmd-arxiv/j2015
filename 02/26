This field, which has been a longstanding concern\nof sociologists and psychologists, has been extended into an area of\nexperimental social psychology, and even has attracted the attention of\nphysicists and mathematicians. In this article, we present a novel model of\nopinion formation in which agents may either have a strict preference for a\nchoice, or be undecided. The opinion shift emerges during interpersonal\ncommunications, as a consequence of a cumulative process of conviction for one\nof the two extremes opinions through repeated interactions. There are two main\ningredients which play key roles in determining the steady state: the initial\nfraction of undecided agents and the conviction's sensitivity in each\ninteraction. As a function of these two parameters, the model presents a wide\nrange of possible solutions, as for instance, consensus of each opinion,\nbi-polarisation or convergence of undecided individuals. We found that a\nminimum fraction of undecided agents is crucial not only for reaching consensus\nof a given opinion, but also to determine a dominant opinion in a polarised\nsituation. In order to gain a deeper comprehension of the dynamics, we also\npresent the theoretical master equations of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 16:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

In a majority of the cases, it has seemed\nnecessary to use exotic stellar populations or alternative physical solutions\nto explain the excess. Few studies have carefully scrutinized the role of\nscattered light in this context. I explore the influence of scattered light on\nground-based observations of haloes and thick discs around edge-on galaxies,\nhaloes around face-on disc galaxies, host galaxies around blue compact galaxies\n(BCGs), and haloes around elliptical galaxies. Surface-brightness structures of\nall considered types of galaxies are modelled and analysed to compare\nscattered-light haloes and thick discs with measurements. I simulate the\ninfluence of scattered light and accurate sky subtraction on simplified\nS\\'ersic-type and face-on disc galaxy models. All galaxy models are convolved\nwith both lower-limit and brighter point spread functions (PSFs); for a few\ngalaxies it was possible to use dedicated PSFs. The results show bright\nscattered-light haloes and high amounts of red excess at large radii and faint\nsurface brightnesses for nearly all types of galaxies; exceptions are the\nlargest elliptical-type galaxies where the influence of scattered light is\nsmaller. Studies have underestimated the role of scattered light to explain\ntheir surface-brightness profiles. My analysis shows surface-brightness\nprofiles that include scattered light that are very similar to and overlap\nmeasurements at all radii. The derivation of physical properties of haloes,\nthick discs, and BCG hosts from diffuse data is misleading since accurate and\nradially extended PSFs are non-existent.

The law of mass action does not\nautomatically conserve current, as is clear from mathematics of a simple case,\nchosen to illustrate the issues. The law of mass action does not force a series\nof chemical reactions to have the same current flow everywhere. Interruption of\nfar-away current does not stop current everywhere in a series of chemical\nreactions, and so does not obey Maxwell equations. An additional constraint and\nequation is needed to enforce the global continuity of current flow. The\nadditional constraint is introduced in this paper in the special case that the\nchemical reaction describes spatial movement through narrow channels. In that\ncase, a fully consistent treatment is possible using a variety of models of\ncharge movement. The general case must be dealt with by variational methods\nthat enforce consistency of all the physical laws involved.

These 'IR/UV' relations are rooted in basic physical\nprinciples, such as causality and unitarity. In this paper, we seek similar\nconnections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics\nresponsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationary\ntheory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativistic\ninteractions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusing\non forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination of\nlow-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energy\nbehavior of the theory. While for relativistic amplitudes unitarity is\nsufficient to prove positivity of the sum rule, this is not guaranteed in the\nnon-relativistic case. We discuss the conditions under which positivity still\napplies, and show that they are satisfied by all known UV completions of\nsingle-field inflation. In that case, we obtain a consistency condition for\nprimordial non-Gaussianity, which constrains the size and the sign of the\nequilateral four-point function in terms of the amplitude of the three-point\nfunction. The resulting bound rules out about half of the parameter space that\nis still allowed by current observations. Finding a violation of our\nconsistency condition would point towards less conventional theories of\ninflation, or violations of basic physical principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 18:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 14:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

Energy spectra of the flows in the wavenumber\nspace indicate that a wavenumber similar to that introduced by Rhines for\nturbulent flows on the beta-plane can be introduced here. The wavenumber is\nbased on the translational speed of a vortex rather than on the\nroot-mean-square velocity of a turbulent flow. The comparison between the\nexperiments and numerical simulations demonstrates that evolving vortices also\nemit inertial waves. While these essentially three-dimensional waves can be\nobserved in the altimetric data they are not accounted for in the shallow water\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 20:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 14:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-06"}

This effect vanishes at high redshift $z\\sim2$ and for\nhigh masses $M_{200\\textrm m}\\gtrsim10^{14}M\\odot$. We perform cosmological\nanalyses of three idealized approximations to the cluster surveys by the South\nPole Telescope (SPT), \\textit{Planck}, and eROSITA. We pursue two main\nquestions: (1) What is the impact of baryons? -- For the SPT-like and the\n\\textit{Planck}-like samples, the impact of baryons on cosmological results is\nnegligible. In the eROSITA-like case, however, neglecting the baryonic impact\nleads to an underestimate of $\\Omega_\\textrm m$ by about $0.01$, which is\ncomparable to the expected uncertainty from eROSITA. (2) How does our DMonly\nHMF compare with previous work? -- For the \\textit{Planck}-like sample, results\nobtained using our DMonly HMF are shifted by\n$\\Delta(\\sigma_8)\\simeq\\Delta(\\sigma_8(\\Omega_\\textrm m/0.27)^{0.3})\\simeq0.02$\nwith respect to results obtained using the Tinker et al. (2008) fit. This\nsuggests that using our HMF would shift results from \\textit{Planck} clusters\ntoward better agreement with CMB anisotropy measurements. Finally, we discuss\nbiases that can be introduced through inadequate HMF parametrizations that\nintroduce false cosmological sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 21:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 13:21:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 09:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Generically the action of confusion on the HI\nmass function was found to be a suppression of the number count of sources\nbelow the `knee', and an enhancement above it. This results in a bias, whereby\nthe `knee' mass is increased and the faint end slope is steepened. For ALFALFA\nand HIPASS we find that the maximum impact this bias can have on the Schechter\nfit parameters is similar in magnitude to the published random errors. On the\nother hand, the impact of confusion on the HI mass functions of upcoming medium\ndepth interferometric surveys, will be below the level of the random errors. In\naddition, we find that previous estimates of the number of detections for\nupcoming surveys with SKA-precursor telescopes may have been too optimistic, as\nthe framework implemented here results in number counts between 60% and 75% of\nthose previously predicted, while accurately reproducing the counts of existing\nsurveys.

The time-varying abundance of small grains in an\nevolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet photons, while\ndust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and\nresulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in\nturn, selectively carry small dust grains leaving the larger particles---which\ndecouple from the gas---behind in the disk. We study these effects by\ninvestigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by\nEUV, FUV and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a 1-D multi-fluid\napproach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface\ndensity distributions. The 1-D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models\nconstructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and\ndetermine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust\ncoagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk\nlifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is\nthus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find\nthat photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass\nratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result\nin a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen.\nWe discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet\nformation, including the formation of gas-poor giants.

Its problems include (1)\nnot capturing large-scale bulk flows [leading to an O(1) error in the 1-loop\nSPT prediction for the baryon acoustic peak in the correlation function], (2)\nassuming that the Universe behaves as a pressureless, inviscid fluid, and (3)\ntreating fluctuations on scales that are non-perturbative as if they were.\nRecent studies have highlighted the successes of perturbation theory in\nLagrangian space or theories that solve equations for the effective dynamics of\nsmoothed fields. Both approaches mitigate some or all of the aforementioned\nissues with SPT. We discuss these physical developments by specializing to the\nsimplified 1D case of gravitationally interacting sheets, which allows us to\nsubstantially reduces the analytic overhead and still (as we show) maintain\nmany of the same behaviors as in 3D. In 1D, linear-order Lagrangian\nperturbation theory (\"the Zeldovich approximation\") is exact up to shell\ncrossing, and we prove that n^{th}-order Eulerian perturbation theory converges\nto the Zeldovich approximation as n goes to infinity. In no 1D cosmology that\nwe consider (including a CDM-like case and power-law models) do these theories\ndescribe accurately the matter power spectrum on any mildly nonlinear scale. We\nfind that theories based on effective equations are much more successful at\ndescribing the dynamics. Finally, we discuss many topics that have recently\nappeared in the perturbation theory literature such as beat coupling, the shift\nand smearing of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature, and the advantages of\nFourier versus configuration space. Our simplified 1D case serves as an\nintuitive review of these perturbation theory results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 22:33:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 03:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The d-wave superconductivity in CeTMIn5\n(TM=Co, Rh, Ir) has attracted significant interest due to its qualitative\nsimilarity to the cuprate high-Tc superconductors. Here, we show evidence for a\nfield induced phase-transition to a state akin to a density-wave (DW) in the\nheavy fermion CeRhIn5, existing in proximity to its unconventional\nsuperconductivity.

The unusually large hysteresis enables\nus to directly investigate the Fermi surface of a supercooled electronic system\nand to clearly associate a Fermi surface reconstruction with the transition.\nKey to our observation is the fabrication of single crystal microstructures,\nwhich are found to be highly sensitive to \"subtle\" phase transitions involving\nonly small portions of the Fermi surface.

Our DFT calculation correctly reproduces the linear\ndispersion, or Dirac cone, feature at the Fermi energy for the isolated\ngraphene monolayer and the band gap for the MoS2 monolayer. For the combined\ngraphene/MoS2 bi-layer, we observe interesting electronic structure and density\nof states (DOS) characteristics near the Fermi energy, showing both the gap\nlike features of the MoS2 layer and in-gap states with linear dispersion\ncontributed mostly by the graphene layer.

We also find that intercalating Li ions in between the layers of\nthe graphene/MoS2 heterostructure enhances the binding energy through orbital\nhybridizations between cations (Li adatoms) and anions (graphene and MoS2\nmonolayers).

Applying our approach, we are able to solve optimal commitments\nfor first-price and all-pay auctions in closed-form for fairly general\ndistribution settings.

The main objective in differentially private query processing is\nto maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy\nguarantees.

The\nground state of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate has been proven to be 100%\ncondensed in the limit of infinite particle number and constant interaction\nparameter [Lieb and Seiringer, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 88}, 170409 (2002)]. The\nmeaning of this result is that properties of the condensate, noticeably its\nenergy and density, converge to those obtained by minimizing the\nGross-Pitaevskii energy functional. This naturally raises the question whether\ncorrelations are of any importance in this limit. Here, we demonstrate both\nanalytically and numerically that even in the infinite particle limit many-body\ncorrelations can lead to a substantial modification of the \\textit{variance} of\nany operator compared to that expected from the Gross-Pitaevskii result. The\nstrong deviation of the variance stems from its explicit dependence on terms of\nthe reduced two-body density matrix which otherwise do not contribute to the\nenergy and density in this limit. This makes the variance a sensitive probe of\nmany-body correlations even when the energy and density of the system have\nalready converged to the Gross-Pitaevskii result. We use the center-of-mass\nposition operator to exemplify this persistence of correlations. Implications\nof this many-body effect are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 12:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Finally, concerning the\ndielectric properties of the microwave resonators made of LMT and NMT compounds\nwe have measured their temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency\n({\\tau}f) and the quality factor (Q). It is interesting to notice that\n({\\tau}f) in the case of the NMT compound (-16 ppm 1/K) is essentially smaller\nthan in the case of the LMT compound (-72 ppm 1/K), therefore proving a better\nstability against temperature variations in the NMT based resonators.

In this first\npaper on the preparation of our input catalogue, we compiled a large amount of\npublic data and collected low-resolution optical spectroscopy with CAFOS at the\n2.2 m Calar Alto telescope for 753 stars.

The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling\nin the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis\ncalculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations\nof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and\nnot even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the\ninner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star\nmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low\nmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,\nwhereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow\ncontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,\nsimulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity\npreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known\ndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 15:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-27"}

We argue that there are two basic phenomena,\nwhich are related to chiral anomaly in Weyl metals: Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE)\nand Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). While AHE is in principle present in any\nferromagnetic metal, we demonstrate that a magnetic Weyl metal is distinguished\nfrom an ordinary ferromagnetic metal by the absence of the extrinsic and the\nFermi surface part of the intrinsic contributions to the AHE, as long as the\nFermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl nodes. The AHE in a Weyl metal\nis thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by\nthe location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone. In other words, a\nferromagnetic Weyl metal may be thought of as the only example of a\nferromagnetic metal with a purely intrinsic AHE. We further develop a fully\nmicroscopic theory of diffusive magnetotransport in Weyl metals. We derive\ncoupled diffusion equations for the total and axial (i.e. node-antisymmetric)\ncharge densities and show that chiral anomaly manifests as a\nmagnetic-field-induced coupling between them.

When dealing with large collections, a more compact\nrepresentation based on global features is often preferred, which can be\nobtained from local features by means of, e.g., the Bag-of-Visual-Word (BoVW)\nmodel. Several applications, including for example visual sensor networks and\nmobile augmented reality, require visual features to be transmitted over a\nbandwidth-limited network, thus calling for coding techniques that aim at\nreducing the required bit budget, while attaining a target level of efficiency.\nIn this paper we investigate a coding scheme tailored to both local and global\nbinary features, which aims at exploiting both spatial and temporal redundancy\nby means of intra- and inter-frame coding. In this respect, the proposed coding\nscheme can be conveniently adopted to support the Analyze-Then-Compress (ATC)\nparadigm. That is, visual features are extracted from the acquired content,\nencoded at remote nodes, and finally transmitted to a central controller that\nperforms visual analysis. This is in contrast with the traditional approach, in\nwhich visual content is acquired at a node, compressed and then sent to a\ncentral unit for further processing, according to the Compress-Then-Analyze\n(CTA) paradigm. In this paper we experimentally compare ATC and CTA by means of\nrate-efficiency curves in the context of two different visual analysis tasks:\nhomography estimation and content-based retrieval. Our results show that the\nnovel ATC paradigm based on the proposed coding primitives can be competitive\nwith CTA, especially in bandwidth limited scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}
