It was\ncommonly assumed that moisture or oxygen in the environment causes the poor\nstability of hybrid halide perovskites, however, here we show from the\nfirst-principles calculations that the room-temperature tetragonal phase of\nCH3NH3PbI3 is thermodynamically unstable with respect to the phase separation\ninto CH3NH3I + PbI2, i.e., the disproportionation is exothermic, independent of\nthe humidity or oxygen in the atmosphere.

When I is replaced by Br or Cl, Pb by\nSn, or the organic cation CH3NH3 by inorganic Cs, the perovskites become more\nstable and do not phase-separate spontaneously.

In all considered cases,\nenergy release is triggered by the ideal kink instability, which is itself the\nresult of applying footpoint rotation to an initially potential field. The main\ngoal of this work is to establish the influence of the field topology and\nvarious thermodynamic effects on the energy release process. Specifically, we\ninvestigate convergence of the magnetic field at the loop footpoints,\natmospheric stratification, as well as thermal conduction. In all cases, the\napplication of vortical driving at the footpoints of an initally potential\nfield leads to an internal kink instability. With the exception of the curved\nloop with high footpoint convergence, the global geometry of the loop change\nlittle during the simulation. Footpoint convergence, curvature and atmospheric\nstructure clearly influences the rapidity with which a loop achieves\ninstability as well as the size of the subsequent energy release. Footpoint\nconvergence has a stabilising influence and thus the loop requires more energy\nfor instability, which means that the subsequent relaxation has a larger\nheating effect. Large-scale curvature has the opposite result: less energy is\nneeded for instability and so the amount of energy released from the field is\nreduced. Introducing a stratified atmosphere gives rise to decaying wave\nphenomena during the driving phase, and also results in a loop that is less\nstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 17:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Beside its metrological interest, it is also an\nestimator of the large trends of the power spectral density (PSD) of frequency\ndeviation. For instance, the Allan variance is able to discriminate different\ntypes of noise characterized by different power laws in the PSD. But, it was\nalso used in other fields: accelerometry, geophysics, geodesy, astrophysics and\neven finances! However, it seems that up to now, it has been exclusively\napplied for time series analysis. We propose here to use the Allan variance\nonto spatial data.\n  Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is used in geophysics to\nimage ground displacements in space (over the SAR image spatial coverage) and\nin time thank to the regular SAR image acquisitions by dedicated satellites.\nThe main limitation of the technique is the atmospheric disturbances that\naffect the radar signal while traveling from the sensor to the ground and back.\nIn this paper, we propose to use the Allan variance for analyzing spatial data\nfrom InSAR measurements. The Allan variance was computed in XY mode as well as\nin radial mode for detecting different types of behavior for different\nspace-scales, in the same way as the different types of noise versus the\nintegration time in the classical time and frequency application.

Space AVAR allowed to well characterize noise features,\nclassically found in InSAR such as phase decorrelation producing white noise or\natmospheric delays, behaving like a random walk signal.

We propose easy-to-implement solutions for Gaussian channels that\napproximate the optimal results for these maximization problems. Three topics\nare addressed. First, we consider the case where the channel output is\nquantized, and we find the quantization thresholds that maximize the mutual\ninformation. The approximation derived from the asymptotic solution has a\nnegligible loss on the entire range of SNR when 2-PAM modulation is used, and\nits quantization thresholds linearly depend on the standard deviation of noise.\nWe also derive a simple estimator of the relative capacity loss due to\nquantization, based on the high-rate limit. Then we consider the integer\nconstraint on the decoding metric, and maximize the mismatched channel\ncapacity. We study the asymptotic solution of the optimal metric assignment and\nshow that the same approximation we derived in the matched decoding case still\nholds for the mismatched decoder. Finally, we consider the demodulation problem\nfor 8PSK bit-interleaved coded modulation(BICM). We derive the approximated\noptimal demodulation metrics that maximize the general cut-off rate or the\nmismatched capacity using max-log approximation . The error rate performances\nof the two metrics' assignments are compared, based on\nReed-Solomon-Viterbi(RSV) code, and the mismatched capacity metric turns out to\nbe better.

One notion of learning a GMM is\nproper learning: here, the goal is to find a mixture of $k$ Gaussians\n$\\mathcal{M}$ that is close to the density $f$ of the unknown distribution from\nwhich we draw samples. The distance between $\\mathcal{M}$ and $f$ is typically\nmeasured in the total variation or $L_1$-norm.\n  We give an algorithm for learning a mixture of $k$ univariate Gaussians that\nis nearly optimal for any fixed $k$. The sample complexity of our algorithm is\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon^2})$ and the running time is $(k \\cdot\n\\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^{O(k^4)} + \\tilde{O}(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon^2})$. It is\nwell-known that this sample complexity is optimal (up to logarithmic factors),\nand it was already achieved by prior work. However, the best known time\ncomplexity for proper learning a $k$-GMM was\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{3k-1}})$. In particular, the dependence between\n$\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ and $k$ was exponential. We significantly improve this\ndependence by replacing the $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ term with a $\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ while only increasing the exponent moderately. Hence, for\nany fixed $k$, the $\\tilde{O} (\\frac{k}{\\epsilon^2})$ term dominates our\nrunning time, and thus our algorithm runs in time which is nearly-linear in the\nnumber of samples drawn. Achieving a running time of $\\textrm{poly}(k,\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ for proper learning of $k$-GMMs has recently been stated\nas an open problem by multiple researchers, and we make progress on this\nquestion.\n  Moreover, our approach offers an agnostic learning guarantee: our algorithm\nreturns a good GMM even if the distribution we are sampling from is not a\nmixture of Gaussians. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first\nagnostic proper learning algorithm for GMMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 19:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Multi-resolution elastic net allows the\nsimultaneous identification of scalar covariates and of intervals on the domain\nof one or more functional covariates that are most influential for the\nresponse. The results identify a contiguous group of speed intervals between\n5.3 to 5.7 m$\\cdot$s$^{-1}$ as influential for the improvement of running\nperformance and extend established relationships between physiological status\nand runner performance. Another outcome of multi-resolution elastic net is a\npredictive equation for performance based on the minimization of the mean\nsquared prediction error on a test data set across resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 20:14:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 13:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

In this study, we demonstrate that the maximal energy\ndensity that can be achieved in collision of $N$ slowly moving kinks and\nantikinks in the integrable sine-Gordon field, remarkably, is proportional to\n$N^2$, while the total energy of the system is proportional to $N$. This\nmaximal energy density can be achieved only if the difference between the\nnumber of colliding kinks and antikinks is minimal, i.e., is equal to 0 for\neven $N$ and 1 for odd $N$ and if the pattern involves an alternating array of\nkinks and anti-kinks. Interestingly, for odd (even) $N$ the maximal energy\ndensity appears in the form of potential (kinetic) energy, while kinetic\n(potential) energy is equal to zero. The results of the present study rely on\nthe analysis of the exact multi-soliton solutions for $N=1,2,$ and 3 and on the\nnumerical simulation results for $N=4,5,6,$ and 7.

The predicate can be, for example, a temporal logic constraint or\na time constraint, or any predicate that can be evaluated over a completed\ntrace. The framework takes into account both the sequence of events observed in\nthe current trace, as well as data attributes associated to these events. The\nprediction problem is approached in two phases. First, prefixes of previous\ntraces are clustered according to control flow information. Secondly, a\nclassifier is built for each cluster using event data to discriminate between\nfulfillments and violations. At runtime, a prediction is made on a running case\nby mapping it to a cluster and applying the corresponding classifier.

Assuming that the recoupling is mediated by mutual\nfriction between the superfluid neutrons and the charged components of the\ncore, we use the observed magnitudes and timescales of the shortest timescale\ncomponents of the recoveries from two recent glitches in the Vela pulsar to\ninfer the fraction of the core that is coupled to the crust during the glitch,\nand hence spun up by the glitch event. Within the framework of a two-fluid\nhydrodynamic model of glitches, we analyze whether crustal neutrons alone are\nsufficient to drive the glitch activity observed in the Vela pulsar. We use two\nsets of neutron star equations of state (EOSs), both of which span crust and\ncore consistently and cover a range of the slope of the symmetry energy at\nsaturation density $30 < L <120$ MeV.

Of particular significance are: a) the\ncored dark matter profile of disk galaxies, b) correlations of the shape of\nrotation curves with baryonic properties, and c) Tully-Fisher relations. Dark\nmatter halos around disk galaxies may have nontrivial dynamics if dark matter\nis strongly self interacting and dissipative. Multicomponent hidden sector dark\nmatter featuring a massless `dark photon' (from an unbroken dark $U(1)$ gauge\ninteraction) which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon provides a\nconcrete example of such dark matter. The kinetic mixing interaction\nfacilitates halo heating by enabling ordinary supernovae to be a source of\nthese `dark photons'. Dark matter halos can expand and contract in response to\nthe heating and cooling processes, but for a sufficiently isolated halo could\nhave evolved to a steady state or `equilibrium' configuration where heating and\ncooling rates locally balance. This dynamics allows the dark matter density\nprofile to be related to the distribution of ordinary supernovae in the disk of\na given galaxy. In a previous paper a simple and predictive formula was derived\nencoding this relation. Here we improve on previous work by modelling the\nsupernovae distribution via the measured UV and $H\\alpha$ fluxes, and compare\nthe resulting dark matter halo profiles with the rotation curve data for each\ndwarf galaxy in the LITTLE THINGS sample.

The latter describes particular fluctuation\nprocesses involving self-pairing of a single electron on self-intersecting\ntrajectories of a size up to phase-breaking length $l_{\\phi }$ which becomes\npossible due to an electron spin-flip scattering event at a nucleus. As a\nresult, different scenarios with either growth or decrease of the NMR\nrelaxation rate are possible upon approaching the normal metal - type-II\nsuperconductor transition. The character of fluctuations changes along the line\n$H_{c2}$ from the thermal long-wavelength type in weak magnetic fields to the\nclusters of rotating FCP in fields comparable to $H_{c2}$. We find that below\nthe well-defined temperature $T^*_0\\approx 0.6T_{c0}$, the MT process becomes\nineffective even in absence of intrinsic pair-breaking. The small scale of FCP\nrotations ($\\xi_{xy}$) in so high fields impedes formation of long (<$l_{\\phi\n}$) self-intersecting trajectories, causing the corresponding relaxation\nmechanism to lose its efficiency. This reduces the effect of superconducting\nfluctuations in the domain of high fields and low temperatures to just the\nsuppression of quasi-particle DOS, analogously to the Abrikosov vortex phase\nbelow the $H_{c2}$ line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 07:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

When the absorption lines belong to\nunscreened regions of space such as dwarf galaxies, a time variation would be\npresent for chameleons. For both K-mouflage and Vainshtein mechanisms, the\ncosmological time variation of the scalar field is not suppressed in both\nunscreened and screened environments, therefore enhancing the variation of\nconstants and their detection prospect. We also consider the time variation of\nthe redshift of distant objects using their spectrocopic velocities. We find\nthat models of the K-mouflage and Vainshtein types have very different\nspectroscopic velocities as a function of redshift and that their differences\nwith the $\\Lambda$-CDM template should be within reach of the future ELT- HIRES\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 09:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

In particular, the recent\ndiscovery of three-dimensional Dirac semimetals in Na$_{3}$Bi and\nCd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ demonstrates that a Dirac point with four-fold degeneracy can\nbe stable as long as certain crystalline symmetries are supplemented in\naddition to the time-reversal and inversion symmetries.

It is found that although the simultaneous\npresence of the time-reversal and inversion symmetries forces the net chiral\ncharge to vanish, a Dirac point can carry another quantized topological charge\nwhen an additional rotation symmetry is considered. Two different classes of\nDirac semimetals are identified depending on the nature of the rotation\nsymmetries. First, the conventional symmorphic rotational symmetry which\ncommutes with the inversion gives rise to the class I Dirac semimetals having a\npair of Dirac points on the rotation axes. Since the topological charges of\neach pair of Dirac points have the opposite sign, a pair-creation or a\npair-annihilation is required to change the number of Dirac points in the\nmomentum space. On the other hand, the class II Dirac semimetals possess a\nsingle isolated Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum, which is\nprotected by a screw rotation. The non-symmorphic nature of screw rotations\nallows the anti-commutation relation between the rotation and inversion\nsymmetries, which enables to circumvent the doubling of the number of Dirac\npoints and create a single Dirac point at the Brillouin zone boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 11:11:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 06:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

However, much less\nis known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality\nare not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.\n  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution\npatterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific\npatterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a\n\"one fits it all\" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these\nintuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables\nand metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as\nfor interpolating graph evolutions.\n  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,\nthis paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node\nimportance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality\ndistance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given\ncentrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances\nreflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in\ncase of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.\n  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and\nseven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the\nusefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared\nto a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the\nconsidered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the\ndynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 12:56:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 14:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

In doing so we reconstruct the density of cold dark matter out to $z =\n1.75$ and derive constraints on the metric components when the universe was\n10.5 Gyr old within a comoving volume of approximately 1 Gpc$^{3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 13:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 13:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 09:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-07"}

In this\nstudy, we model the system using both Benney and weighted-residual models that\naccount for the fluid injection through the wall.

In terms of\nnucleosynthesis, it behaves as an alpha element because it is enhanced in\nmetal-poor stars. The aim of this work is to derive the iron-peak element Zn\nabundances in 56 bulge giants from high resolution spectra. These results are\ncompared with data from other bulge samples, as well as from disk and halo\nstars, and damped Lyman-alpha systems, in order to better understand the\nchemical evolution in these environments. High-resolution spectra were obtained\nusing FLAMES+UVES on the Very Large Telescope. We find [Zn/Fe]=+0.24+-0.02 in\nthe range -1.3 < [Fe/H] < -0.5 and [Zn/Fe]=+0.06+-0.02 in the range -0.5 <\n[Fe/H] < -0.1, whereas for [Fe/H] > -0.1, it shows a spread of -0.60 < [Zn/Fe]\n< +0.15, with most of these stars having low [Zn/Fe]<0.0. These low zinc\nabundances at the high metallicity end of the bulge define a decreasing trend\nin [Zn/Fe] with increasing metallicities. A comparison with Zn abundances in\nDLA systems is presented, where a dust-depletion correction was applied for\nboth Zn and Fe. Finally, we present a chemical evolution model of Zn enrichment\nin massive spheroids, representing a typical classical bulge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 14:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}
