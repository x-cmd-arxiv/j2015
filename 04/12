Borgs, Chayes, Kahn and\nLov\\'asz showed that a sequence of bounded degree graphs is left convergent if\nand only if it is right convergent for certain target graphs $H$ with all\nweights (including loops) close to $1$. We give a short alternative proof of\nthis statement. In particular, for each bounded degree graph $G$ we associate\nfunctions $f_{G,k}$ for every positive integer $k$, and we show that left\nconvergence of a sequence of graphs is equivalent to the convergence of the\npartial derivatives of each of these functions at the origin, while right\nconvergence is equivalent to pointwise convergence. Using the bound on the\nmaximum degree of the graphs, we can uniformly bound the partial derivatives at\nthe origin, and show that the Taylor series converges uniformly on a domain\nindependent of the graph, which implies the equivalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 16:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2015 23:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

In addition\nto providing the motivation and relevant background on the physical behavior of\nthese systems, we discuss our recent efforts to develop a particular type of\nQEMS that is based upon the Cooper-pair box (CPB) and superconducting coplanar\nwaveguide (CPW) cavities, a system which has the potential to serve as a\ntestbed for studying the quantum properties of motion in engineered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 19:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

Decimal floating point gives a compact and\nexact representation, but requires conversion with a slow division operation\nbefore it can be used. Here, I show that interesting subsets of 64-bit\nfloating-point values can be compactly and exactly represented by the 32 bits\nconsisting of the sign, exponent, and high-order part of the mantissa, with the\nlower-order 32 bits of the mantissa filled in by table lookup, indexed by bits\nfrom the part of the mantissa retained, and possibly from the exponent. For\nexample, decimal data with 4 or fewer digits to the left of the decimal point\nand 2 or fewer digits to the right of the decimal point can be represented in\nthis way using the lower-order 5 bits of the retained part of the mantissa as\nthe index. Data consisting of 6 decimal digits with the decimal point in any of\nthe 7 positions before or after one of the digits can also be represented this\nway, and decoded using 19 bits from the mantissa and exponent as the index.\nEncoding with such a scheme is a simple copy of half the 64-bit value, followed\nif necessary by verification that the value can be represented, by checking\nthat it decodes correctly. Decoding requires only extraction of index bits and\na table lookup. Lookup in a small table will usually reference cache; even with\nlarger tables, decoding is still faster than conversion from decimal floating\npoint with a division operation.

A subnetwork that computes the Bayesian\nposterior density of the critical state variable - distance between predator\nand prey - emerges as a core component of the decision-making mechanism. This\nis a neural analog of a Bayesian particle filter with cerebellar-like\narchitecture. The model explains fundamental properties of neurons and nervous\nsystems in modern animals and makes testable predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 02:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

We derive the necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe reversibility of LOCC conversions between two bipartite pure entangled\nstates in the asymptotic setting. In addition, we show that conversion can be\nachieved perfectly with only local unitary operation under such condition\nexcept for special cases. Interestingly, our result implies that an error-free\nreversible conversion is asymptotically possible even between states whose\ncopies can never be locally unitarily equivalent with any finite numbers of\ncopies, although such a conversion is impossible in the finite setting. In\nfact, we show such an example. Moreover, we establish how to overcome the\nirreversibility of LOCC conversion in two ways. As for the first method, we\nevaluate how many copies of the initial state is to be lost to overcome the\nirreversibility of LOCC conversion. The second method is to add a supplementary\nstate appropriately, which also works for LU conversion unlike the first\nmethod. Especially, for the qubit system, any non-maximally pure entangled\nstate can be a universal resource for the asymptotic reversibility when copies\nof the state is sufficiently many. More interestingly, our analysis implies\nthat far-from-maximally entangled states can be better than nearly maximally\nentangled states as this type of resource.

We aim to\ncharacterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample of\nembedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of their\nenvelopes where CO is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profiles\ndictated by their current luminosities. Using observations from the\nSubmillimeter Array we measure the extents of the emission from the C18O\nisotopologue toward 16 deeply embedded protostars. We compare these\nmeasurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the current\nluminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfer\ncalculations. Eight out of sixteen sources show more extended C18O emission\nthan predicted by the models. The modeling shows that the likely culprit for\nthese signatures is sublimation due to increases in luminosities of the sources\nby about a factor five or more during the recent 10,000 years - the time it\ntakes for CO to freeze-out again on dust grains. For four of those sources the\nincrease would have had to have been a factor 10 or more. The compact emission\nseen toward the other half of the sample suggests that C18O only sublimates\nwhen the temperature exceeds 30 K - as one would expect if CO is mixed with H2O\nin the grain ice-mantles. The small-number statistics from this survey suggest\nthat protostars undergo significant bursts about once every 20,000 years. This\nalso illustrates the importance of taking the physical evolutionary histories\ninto account for descriptions of the chemical structures of embedded\nprotostars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 14:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Compared with the\nexpectation in a semi-analytical model applied to the Millennium Simulation,\nthe observed BCGs become under-massive/under-luminous with decreasing redshift.\nWe incorporate the uncertainties associated with cluster mass, redshift, and\nBCG stellar mass measurements into analysis of a redshift-dependent BCG-cluster\nmass relation, $m_{*}\\propto(\\frac{M_{200}}{1.5\\times\n10^{14}M_{\\odot}})^{0.24\\pm 0.08}(1+z)^{-0.19\\pm0.34}$, and compare the\nobserved relation to the model prediction. We estimate the average growth rate\nsince $z = 1.0$ for BCGs hosted by clusters of $M_{200, z}=10^{13.8}M_{\\odot}$,\nat $z=1.0$: $m_{*, BCG}$ appears to have grown by $0.13\\pm0.11$ dex, in tension\nat $\\sim 2.5 \\sigma$ significance level with the $0.40$ dex growth rate\nexpected from the semi-analytic model. We show that the buildup of extended\nintra-cluster light after $z=1.0$ may alleviate this tension in BCG growth\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 15:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 18:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

A normal subgroup $N_H$ of $H$ is said\nto be inheritably normal if there is a normal subgroup $N_G$ of $G$ such that\n$N_H=N_G\\cap H$. It is proved in the paper that a subgroup $N_{G_i}$ of a\nfactor $G_i$ of the $n$-periodic product $\\prod_{i\\in I}^nG_i$ with nontrivial\nfactors $G_i$ is an inheritably normal subgroup if and only if $N_{G_i}$\ncontains the subgroup $G_i^n$. It is also proved that for odd $n\\ge 665$ every\nnontrivial normal subgroup in a given $n$-periodic product $G=\\prod_{i\\in\nI}^nG_i$ contains the subgroup $G^n$. It follows that almost all $n$-periodic\nproducts $G=G_1\\overset{n}{\\ast}G_2$ are Hopfian, i.e., they are not isomorphic\nto any of their proper quotient groups. This allows one to construct nonsimple\nand not residually finite Hopfian groups of bounded exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 15:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

Hydrodynamic quantities like density, momentum and energy\nare discretised as volume averages. The magnetic field and electric field\ncomponents are discretised as area and line averages respectively, so as to\nemploy the constrained transport technique, which preserves the solenoidality\nof the magnetic field to machine precision. The present method makes use of a\ndimension-by-dimension approach employing a 1-D fourth-order accurate centrally\nweighted essentially non-oscillatory (1D-CWENO4) reconstruction polynomial. A\nfourth-order accurate, strong stability preserving (SSP) Runge-Kutta method is\nused to evolve the semi-discrete MHD equations in time. Higher-order accuracy\nof the scheme is confirmed in various linear and nonlinear multi-dimensional\ntests and the robustness of the method in avoiding unphysical numerical\nartifacts in the solution is demonstrated through several complex MHD problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2015 15:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 19:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-23"}
