For\neach (first-order) structured deformation $(g,G)$ of a continuous body, the\ntensor field $G$ is known to be a measure of deformations without\ndisarrangements, and $M:=\\nabla g-G$ is known to be a measure of deformations\ndue to disarrangements. The tensor fields $G$ and $M$ together deliver not only\nstandard notions of plastic deformation, but $M$ and its curl deliver the\nBurgers vector field associated with closed curves in the body and the\ndislocation density field used in describing geometrical changes in bodies with\ndefects. Recently, Owen and Paroni [13] evaluated explicitly some relaxed\nenergy densities arising in Choksi and Fonseca's energetics of structured\ndeformations [4] and thereby showed: (1) $(trM)^{+}$, the positive part of\n$trM$, is a volume density of disarrangements due to submacroscopic\nseparations, (2) $(trM)^{-}$, the negative part of $trM$, is a volume density\nof disarrangements due to submacroscopic switches and interpenetrations, and\n(3) $|trM|$, the absolute value of $trM$, is a volume density of all three of\nthese non-tangential disarrangements: separations, switches, and\ninterpenetrations. The main contribution of the present research is to show\nthat a different approach to the energetics of structured deformations, that\ndue to Ba\\'ia, Matias, and Santos [1], confirms the roles of $(trM)^{+}$,\n$(trM)^{-}$, and $|trM|$ established by Owen and Paroni. In doing so, we give\nan alternative, shorter proof of Owen and Paroni's results, and we establish\nadditional explicit formulas for other measures of disarrangements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 16:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 03:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

On the assumption that the distribution of materials\nin the body is homogeneous, failed regions first appearing in the body at\ndifferent spin rates are predicted by comparing the yield condition of an\nelastic stress in the body. It is found that as the spin rate increases, the\nlocations of the failed regions move from the equatorial surface to the central\nregion. To avoid such failure modes, the body should have higher cohesive\nstrength. The results by this model are consistent with those by a plastic\nfinite element model. Then, this model and a two-layered-cohesive model first\nproposed by Hirabayashi et al. are used to classify possible evolution and\ndisruption of a spherical body. There are three possible pathways to\ndisruption. First, because of a strong structure, failure of the central region\nis dominant and eventually leads to a breakup into multiple components. Second,\na weak surface and a weak interior make the body oblate. Third, a strong\ninternal core prevents the body from failing and only allows surface shedding.\nThis implies that observed failure modes may highly depend on the internal\nstructure of an asteroid, which could provide crucial information for giving\nconstraints on the physical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 16:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be\nmaintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network\narchitecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network,\nthe dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous\nset of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a\ncontinuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives\ndiffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the\nstored memory.

From our experience with equilibrium problems\none would have expected bulk operators. Boundary operators have correlators\nhaving critical exponents being half of those of bulk operators. If one studies\nthe space-time dependence of the two-point function, one has to consider one\nboundary and one bulk operators. The Raise and Peel model has conformal\ninvariance as can be shown in the spin 1/2 basis of the Hamiltonian which gives\nthe time evolution of the system. This is an XXZ quantum chain with twisted\nboundary condition and local interactions. This Hamiltonian is integrable and\nthe spectrum is known in the finite-size scaling limit. In the stochastic base\nin which the process is defined, the Hamiltonian is not local anymore. The\nmapping into an SOS model, helps to define new local operators.

In addition to\nphysical property changes, modification to the lattice structure, specifically\nlattice expansion, with increasing oxygen vacancy concentrations has been\nreported often and has become the convention for oxide materials. However, the\ncurrent understanding of the lattice behavior in oxygen-deficient films becomes\ndisputable when considering compounds containing different bonding environments\nor atomic layering. Moreover, tensile strain has recently been discovered to\nstabilize oxygen vacancies in epitaxial films, which further complicates the\ninterpretation of lattice behavior resulting from their appearance. Here, we\nreport on the selective strain control of oxygen vacancy formation and\nresulting lattice responses in the layered, Ruddlesden-Popper phases,\nLa1.85Sr0.15CuO4. We found that a drastically reduced Gibbs free energy for\noxygen vacancy formation near the typical growth temperature for\ntensile-strained epitaxial LSCO accounts for the large oxygen\nnon-stoichiometry. Additionally, oxygen vacancies form preferentially in the\nequatorial position of the CuO2 plane, leading to a lattice contraction, rather\nthan the expected expansion, observed with apical oxygen vacancies. Since\noxygen stoichiometry plays a key role in determining the physical properties of\nmany complex oxides, the strong strain coupling of oxygen nonstoichiometry and\nthe unusual structural response reported here can provide new perspectives and\nunderstanding to the structure and property relationships of many other\nfunctional oxide materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 18:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

These companions are not\nonly gravitationally bound, they tend to hierarchically isolate from other\ncluster stars through series of multibody encounters. In this paper, we study\nthe demographics of IMBH companions in compact star clusters through direct\n$N$-body simulation. We study clusters initially composed of $10^5$ or $2\\times\n10^5$ stars with IMBHs of 75 and 150 solar masses, and follow their evolution\nfor 6-10 Gyr. A tight innermost binary pair of IMBH and stellar object rapidly\nforms. The IMBH has a companion with orbital semi-major axis at least three\ntimes tighter than the second-most bound object over 90% of the time. These\ncompanionships have typical periods of order years and are subject to cycles of\nexchange and destruction. The most frequently observed, long-lived pairings\npersist for $\\sim 10^7$ yr. The demographics of IMBH companions in clusters are\ndiverse; they include both main sequence, giant stars, and stellar remnants.\nCompanion objects may reveal the presence of an IMBH in a cluster in one of\nseveral ways. Most-bound companion stars routinely suffer grazing tidal\ninteractions with the IMBH, offering a dynamical mechanism to produce repeated\nflaring episodes like those seen in the IMBH candidate HLX-1. Stellar winds of\ncompanion stars provide a minimum quiescent accretion rate for IMBHs, with\nimplications for radio searches for IMBH accretion in globular clusters.\nFinally, gravitational wave inspirals of compact objects are found to occur\nwith promising frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 20:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 02:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that\nexternal photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a\ndense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized\nwind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds\nboth with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula\nsurrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram\npressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on\nthe nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar. The line ratio\nstrongly favours photoionization over shock ionization, and so even if the\nobserved nebula is pressure confined there should still be an ionization front\nand a photoionization-confined shell closer to the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 20:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Here, using high resolution spectra from the APOGEE survey, we\npresent an analysis of the unusually asymmetric 1.5272 micron DIB feature along\nthe sightline to the Red Square Nebula and demonstrate the likely circumstellar\norigin of about half of the DIB absorption in this line of sight. This\ninterpretation is supported both by the velocities of the feature components\nand by the ratio of foreground to total reddening along the line of sight. The\nRed Square Nebula sightline offers the unique opportunity to study the behavior\nof DIB carriers in a constrained environment and thus to shed new light on the\ncarriers themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 20:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Exceptions to quantum thermalization have been predicted\nand observed, but typically require inherent symmetries or noninteracting\nparticles in the presence of static disorder. The prediction of many-body\nlocalization (MBL), in which disordered quantum systems can fail to thermalize\nin spite of strong interactions and high excitation energy, was therefore\nsurprising and has attracted considerable theoretical attention.

Here, to reveal the\norigins of this ill-conditioning, we start with a general treatment of the\npoint charge fitting problem as an inverse problem, and construct an\nanalytically soluble model with the point charges spherically arranged\naccording to Lebedev quadrature naturally suited for the inverse electrostatic\nproblem. This analytical model is contrasted to the atom-centered point-charge\nmodel that can be viewed as an irregular quadrature poorly suited for the\nproblem. This analysis shows that the numerical problems of the point charge\nfitting are due to the decay of the curvatures corresponding to the\neigenvectors of LS sum Hessian matrix. In part, this ill-conditioning is\nintrinsic to the problem and related to decreasing electrostatic contribution\nof the higher multipole moments, that are, in the case of Lebedev grid model,\ndirectly associated with the Hessian eigenvectors. For the atom-centered model,\nthis association breaks down beyond the first few eigenvectors related to the\nhigh-curvature monopole and dipole terms; this leads to even wider spread-out\nof the Hessian curvature values. Using these insights, it is possible to\nalleviate the ill-conditioning of the LS point-charge fitting without\nintroducing external restraints and/or constraints. Also, as the analytical\nLebedev grid PC model proposed here can reproduce multipole moments up to a\ngiven rank, it may provide a promising alternative to including explicit\nmultipole terms in a force field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 21:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 16:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 16:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

Extracting such information from microwave\nsurveys requires disentangling between foreground emissions and the\ncosmological signal, which boils down to solving a component separation\nproblem. Component separation techniques have been widely studied for the\nrecovery of CMB temperature anisotropies but quite rarely for the polarization\nmodes. In this case, most component separation techniques make use of\nsecond-order statistics to discriminate between the various components. More\nrecent methods, which rather emphasize on the sparsity of the components in the\nwavelet domain, have been shown to provide low-foreground, full-sky estimate of\nthe CMB temperature anisotropies. Building on sparsity, the present paper\nintroduces a new component separation technique dubbed PolGMCA (Polarized\nGeneralized Morphological Component Analysis), which refines previous work to\nspecifically tackle the estimation of the polarized CMB maps: i) it benefits\nfrom a recently introduced sparsity-based mechanism to cope with partially\ncorrelated components, ii) it builds upon estimator aggregation techniques to\nfurther yield a better noise contamination/non-Gaussian foreground residual\ntrade-off. The PolGMCA algorithm is evaluated on simulations of full-sky\npolarized microwave sky simulations using the Planck Sky Model (PSM), which\nshow that the proposed method achieve a precise recovery of the CMB map in\npolarization with low noise/foreground contamination residuals. It provides\nimprovements with respect to standard methods, especially on the galactic\ncenter where estimating the CMB is challenging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 08:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

For an $S$-Steiner tree, if the degree of each vertex in $S$\nis equal to one, then this tree is called a \\emph{pedant $S$-Steiner tree}. Two\npedant $S$-Steiner trees $T$ and $T'$ are said to be \\emph{internally disjoint}\nif $E(T)\\cap E(T')=\\varnothing$ and $V(T)\\cap V(T')=S$. For $S\\subseteq V(G)$\nand $|S|\\geq 2$, the \\emph{local pedant-tree connectivity} $\\tau_G(S)$ is the\nmaximum number of internally disjoint pedant $S$-Steiner trees in $G$.

Here we report\non the analysis of a deep Herschel-PACS observation of an extremely high J CO\ntransition (40-39) in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068.

For (un)directed hypergraphs, unique \\emph{prime factor decomposition\n(PFD)} results with respect to the Cartesian product are known.

In particular, the\nalgorithm has time complexity $O(|E||V|r^2)$ for hypergraphs $H=(V,E)$, where\nthe rank $r$ is the maximum number of vertices contained in an hyperedge of\n$H$. If $r$ is bounded, then this algorithm performs even in\n$O(|E|\\log^2(|V|))$ time.

In this paper, we explore the power of the new generation of open\ndatasets towards understanding the impact of the new disruption technologies\nthat emerge in the area of public transport. With our primary goal being a more\ntransparent economic landscape for urban commuters, we provide a direct price\ncomparison between Uber and the Yellow Cab company in New York. We discover\nthat Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher\nfares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in\noccurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone\napplication, OpenStreetCab, that offers a personalized consultation to mobile\nusers on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months\nafter its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a\nsingle city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the\npotential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a\nhighlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per\ntaxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive\nexperiments to show how Uber's surge pricing is the driving factor of higher\njourney prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application's\nusers. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber's surge pricing is\noccurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction\ntask where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area's tendency to surge.\nUsing exogenous to Uber datasets we show how it is possible to estimate\ncustomer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 16:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-31"}

A massive (~5E5Msun), large (~84x15 pc), and dense (~10E3\ncm^-3) giant molecular cloud (GMC), G23.0-0.4 with VLSR~77 km/s, is found to be\nadjacent to the two SNRs. The GMC displays a filamentary structure\napproximately along the Galactic plane. The filamentary structure of the dense\nmolecular gas, traced by C18O (J=1-0) emission, is also coincident well with\nthe distribution of the dust-continuum emission in the direction. Two dense\nmassive MC clumps, two 6.7 GHz methanol masers, and one HII/SNR complex,\nassociated with the 77 km/s GMC G23.0-0.4, are aligned along the filamentary\nstructure, indicating the star forming activity within the GMC.

It\nindicates that the turbulence seems to dominate the fragmentation process of\nthe dense gaseous filament on large scale. The established 4.4 kpc distance of\nthe GMC and the long dense filament traced by C18O emission, together with the\nrich massive star formation groups in the nearby region, suggest that G23.0-0.4\nis probably located at the near side of the Scutum-Centaurus arm in the first\nquadrant. Considering the large scale and the elongation structure along the\nGalactic plane, we speculate that the dense filamentary GMC has relation to the\nspiral density wave of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 23:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

The equivalence between \\emph{optimization} and\n\\emph{polyhedral separation} suggests that, for these problems, there must\nexist formulations admitting some elegant characterization for the polytopes\nassociated to them. Therefore, it is interesting to study known formulations\nfor vertex coloring with the goal of finding such characterizations. In this\nwork we study the asymmetric representatives formulation and we show that the\ncorresponding coloring polytope, for a given graph $G$, can be interpreted as\nthe stable set polytope of another graph obtained from $G$. This result allows\nus to derive complete characterizations for the corresponding coloring polytope\nfor some families of graphs, based on known complete characterizations for the\nstable set polytope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 14:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}
