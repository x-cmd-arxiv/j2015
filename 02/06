The\nother two relate to a closer examination of the issue of the representability\nof real functions by their Fourier coefficients. As was shown in the previous\npaper, in many cases one can recover the real function from its Fourier\ncoefficients even if the corresponding Fourier series diverges almost\neverywhere. In such cases we say that the real function is still representable\nby its Fourier coefficients. Here we establish a very weak condition on the\nFourier coefficients that ensures the representability of the function by those\ncoefficients. In addition to this, we show that any real function that is\nabsolutely integrable can be recovered almost everywhere from, and hence is\nrepresentable by, its Fourier coefficients, regardless of whether or not its\nFourier series converges.

The catastrophic cascades are\nthose observed by Buldyrev {\\it et al.} in interdependent networks, which we\nre-interpret as multiplex networks with agents that can only survive if they\nmutually support each other, and whose survival struggle we map onto an SOS\ntype growth model. This mapping not only reveals non-trivial structures in the\nphase space of the model, but also leads to a new and extremely efficient\nsimulation algorithm. We use this algorithm to study interdependent agents on\nduplex Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi (ER) networks and on lattices with dimensions 2, 3, 4,\nand 5. We obtain new and surprising results in all these cases, and we correct\nstatements in the literature for ER networks and for 2-d lattices.

For ER networks we\nverify that the cluster statistics is exactly described by mean field theory,\nbut find evidence that the cascade process is not. For $d=5$ we find a first\norder transition as for ER networks, but we find also that small clusters have\na nontrivial mass distribution that scales at the transition point.

The initial beam power is expected to be ~1.2 MW, however\nthe facility is designed to be upgradeable for 2.3 MW operation. We discuss\nhere the status of the design and the associated challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 16:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

Strategies for enhancing the signal over background and\ninterpretations of the experimental results are typically obtained within an\neffective field theory approach where all SUSY particles except the gravitino\nare heavy and are not produced resonantly. We extend this approach to a\nsimplified model that includes squarks and gluinos in the TeV range. In such a\ncase, the jet(s)-plus-missing-momentum signature can be generated through three\ndifferent concurring mechanisms: gravitino-pair production with an extra jet,\nassociated gravitino production with a squark or a gluino, or squark/gluino\npair production with their subsequent decay to a gravitino and a jet. By using\na matrix-element parton-shower merging procedure, we take into account all the\nrelevant production processes consistently, explore the SUSY parameter space\nwith the LHC Run-I data set, and give prospects for the Run II. We also\nconsider the reach of other signatures involving electroweak particles, e.g.,\nthe mono-photon, -Z, or -W plus missing momentum.

The sampling theorem shows that images\nbandlimited to the union of the Nyquist regions of the two rectangular lattices\ncan be recovered from their Manhattan samples, and an efficient procedure for\ndoing so is given.

This paper\npresents a combinatorial rigidity approach to measure (i) generic rigidity and\n(ii) generalized redundant rigidity properties of graph structures through\ngraph invariants for the localization problem in wireless sensor networks. We\ndefine the rigidity index as a graph invariant based on independent set of\nedges in the rigidity matroid. It has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates\nhow close we are to rigidity. Redundant rigidity is required for global\nrigidity, which is associated with unique realization of graphs. Moreover,\nredundant rigidity also provides rigidity robustness in networked systems\nagainst structural changes, such as link losses. Here, we give a broader\ndefinition of redundant edge that we call the \"generalized redundant edge.\"\nThis definition of redundancy is valid for both rigid and non-rigid graphs.\nNext, we define the redundancy index as a graph invariant based on generalized\nredundant edges in the rigidity matroid. It also has a value between 0 and 1,\nand it indicates the percentage of redundancy in a graph. These two indices\nallow us to explore the transition from non-rigidity to rigidity and the\ntransition from rigidity to redundant rigidity. Examples on graphs are provided\nto demonstrate this approach. From a sensor network point of view, these two\nindices enable us to evaluate the effects of sensing radii of sensors on the\nrigidity properties of networks, which in turn, allow us to examine the\nlocalizability of sensor networks. We evaluate the required changes in sensing\nradii for localizability by means of the rigidity index and the redundancy\nindex using random geometric graphs in simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 20:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

This paper aims to address the\nproblem from a new perspective and considers model-oriented dimensionality\nreduction in parameter spaces of binary multivariate distributions.\n  Specifically, we propose a general parameter reduction criterion, called\nConfident-Information-First (CIF) principle, to maximally preserve confident\nparameters and rule out less confident parameters. Formally, the confidence of\neach parameter can be assessed by its contribution to the expected Fisher\ninformation distance within the geometric manifold over the neighbourhood of\nthe underlying real distribution.\n  We then revisit Boltzmann machines (BM) from a model selection perspective\nand theoretically show that both the fully visible BM (VBM) and the BM with\nhidden units can be derived from the general binary multivariate distribution\nusing the CIF principle. This can help us uncover and formalize the essential\nparts of the target density that BM aims to capture and the non-essential parts\nthat BM should discard. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we develop a\nsample-specific CIF for model selection of BM that is adaptive to the observed\nsamples.

There is a crucial observational gap\nbetween ~0.2 and ~4 keV, outside the ranges of existing spectrometers. We\npresent observations from a new SXR spectrometer, the Amptek X123-SDD, which\nmeasured the spatially-integrated solar spectral irradiance from ~0.5 to ~5\nkeV, with ~0.15 keV FWHM resolution, during sounding rocket flights on 2012\nJune 23 and 2013 October 21.

At first figuring\nprominently in support of bottom-up indexing, it fell out of favor as shape\ngave way to appearance and recognition gave way to detection. With a strong\nprior in the form of a target object, the role of the weaker priors offered by\nperceptual grouping was greatly diminished. However, as the field returns to\nthe problem of recognition from a large database, the bottom-up recovery of the\nparts that make up the objects in a cluttered scene is critical for their\nrecognition. The medial axis community has long exploited the ubiquitous\nregularity of symmetry as a basis for the decomposition of a closed contour\ninto medial parts. However, today's recognition systems are faced with\ncluttered scenes, and the assumption that a closed contour exists, i.e. that\nfigure-ground segmentation has been solved, renders much of the medial axis\ncommunity's work inapplicable. In this article, we review a computational\nframework, previously reported in Lee et al. (2013), Levinshtein et al. (2009,\n2013), that bridges the representation power of the medial axis and the need to\nrecover and group an object's parts in a cluttered scene. Our framework is\nrooted in the idea that a maximally inscribed disc, the building block of a\nmedial axis, can be modeled as a compact superpixel in the image. We evaluate\nthe method on images of cluttered scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 23:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

As CME entails substantial local remodeling of the\nplasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending\nand hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high tension\nconditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this\nstudy, we build upon these pioneering experimental studies to provide\nfundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins,\nnamely, actin and BAR proteins in driving vesicle formation in high membrane\ntension environment. Our study reveals a new actin force induced `snap-through\ninstability' that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination\nto a highly invaginated tubular structure.

However, its derivations often lack rigor and\ntransparency leading to inconsistent results.\n  We apply the classic Chapman-Enskog method to the CR transport problem.

The term conversion, that makes the\ntelegraph and Chapman-Enskog approaches reasonably equivalent, is possible only\nafter this relaxation period. During this period, the telegraph solution is\nargued to be unphysical. Unlike the hyperdiffusion correction, it is not\nuniformly valid and introduces implausible singular components to the solution.\nThese dominate the solution during the relaxation period.

Starting from a near-equilibrium prestellar cloud, we\ncalculate the cloud evolution up to \\sim100 yr after the first protostar\nformation. The star formation process considerably differs between clouds with\nlower (Z \\le 10^-4 Z_\\odot) and higher (Z > 10^-4 Z_\\odot) metallicities.\nFragmentation frequently occurs and many protostars appear without forming a\nstable circumstellar disc in lower-metallicity clouds. In these clouds,\nalthough protostars mutually interact and some are ejected from the cloud\ncentre, many remain as a small stellar cluster. In contrast, higher-metallicity\nclouds produce a single protostar surrounded by a nearly stable\nrotation-supported disc. In these clouds, although fragmentation occasionally\noccurs in the disc, the fragments migrate inwards and finally fall onto the\ncentral protostar. The difference in cloud evolution is due to different\nthermal evolutions and mass accretion rates. The thermal evolution of the cloud\ndetermines the emergence and lifetime of the first core. The first core\ndevelops prior to the protostar formation in higher-metallicity clouds, whereas\nno (obvious) first core appears in lower-metallicity clouds. The first core\nevolves into a circumstellar disc with a spiral pattern, which effectively\ntransfers the angular momentum outwards and suppresses frequent fragmentation.\nIn lower-metallicity clouds, the higher mass accretion rate increases the disc\nsurface density within a very short time, rendering the disc unstable to\nself-gravity and inducing vigorous fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 05:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We investigated HH materials based on the\nTi0.3Zr0.35Hf0.35NiSn-system after 500 cycles (1700 h) from 373 to 873 K. Both\ncompounds exhibit a maximum Seebeck coefficient of S around 210 muV/K and an\nintrinsic phase separation into two HH phases. The dendritic microstructure is\ntemperature resistant and maintained the low thermal conductivity values (kappa\nless than 4 W/Km). Our results emphasize that phase-separated HH compounds are\nsuitable low cost materials and can lead to enhanced thermoelectric\nefficiencies beyond the set benchmark for industrial applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 08:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

We suggest alternative methods to\ncharacterise possible orbits, which compliment the MCMC technique. Firstly the\nallowed ranges of orbital elements are prior-independent, and we provide means\nto calculate these ranges without numerical analyses. Hence several interesting\nconstraints (including whether a companion even can be bound, its minimum\npossible semi-major axis and its minimum eccentricity) may be quickly computed\nusing our relations as soon as orbital motion is detected. We also suggest an\nalternative to posterior probability distributions as a means to present\npossible orbital elements, namely contour plots of elements as functions of\nline of sight coordinates. These plots are prior-independent, readily show\ndegeneracies between elements and allow readers to extract orbital solutions\nthemselves. This approach is particularly useful when there are other\nconstraints on the geometry, for example if a companion's orbit is assumed to\nbe aligned with a disc.

We discuss conditions\nnecessary for a rank-$2$ unitary $k$-torus to embed in simple $k$-groups of\ntype $A_2$, $G_2$ and $F_4$ in terms of the mod-$2$ Galois cohomological\ninvariants attached with these groups. We calculate the number of rank-$2$\n$k$-unitary tori generating these algebraic groups (in fact exhibit such tori\nexplicitly). The results in this paper and our earlier work (Invariants mod-2\nand subgroups of G_2 and F_4, J. Alg. 411 (2014) 312- 336) show that the\nmod-$2$ invariants of groups of type $G_2,F_4$ and $A_2$ are controlled by\ntheir $k$-subgroups of type $A_1$ and $A_2$ as well as the unitary $k$-tori\nembedded in them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 11:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 14:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

The folding temperature\nincreases with increasing attraction, as the folded $\\beta$-roll is stabilized\nby the surface.

For a self-conjugate WIMP,\nm_min = 50f GeV, where f is an electromagnetic energy efficiency factor. For a\nnon self-conjugate WIMP, the minimum mass is a factor of two larger. For a WIMP\nthat is a subdominant component of the dark matter density there is no bound on\nits mass and the upper bound to its annihilation cross section imposed by the\nCMB transforms into a lower bound to its annihilation cross section. These\nresults are outlined and quantified here using the latest CMB constraints for a\nstable, symmetric (equal number of particles and antiparticles), WIMP whose\nannihilation is s-wave dominated, and for particles that are, or are not, their\nown antiparticle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 13:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 18:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For example, heterogeneous cellular network (HetNet) and\nUltra dense network (UDN) have been proposed as promising techniques for 5G\nsystems. Dense deployment of base stations (BSs) allows a mobile user to be\nable to access multiple BSs. Meanwhile the unbalance between UL and DL in\nHetNets, such as different received SINR threshold and traffic load, etc.,\nbecomes increasingly obvious. All these factors naturally inspire us to\nconsider decoupling of uplink and downlink in radio access network. An\ninteresting question is that whether the decoupled uplink (UL) /downlink (DL)\naccess (DUDA) mode outperforms traditional coupled uplink (UL)/downlink (DL)\naccess (CUDA) mode or not, and how big is the performance difference in terms\nof system rate, spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE), etc. in\nHetNets. In this paper, we aim at thoroughly comparing the performance of the\ntwo modes based on stochastic geometry theory. In our analytical model, we take\ninto account dynamic transmit power control in UL communication. Specifically,\nwe employ fractional power control (FPC) to model a location-dependent channel\nstate. Numerical results reveals that DUDA mode significantly outperforms CUDA\nmode in system rate, SE and EE in HetNets. In addition, DUDA mode improves load\nbalance and potential fairness for both different type BSs and associated UEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 13:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

We\ndeveloped the MicroMA software program with the embedded optimized\nnear-real-time artificial intelligence algorithm to create the winning virtuous\nM and A strategies, using the financial performance characteristics of the\ninvolved firms, and to estimate the probability of the M and A transaction\ncompletion success. We believe that the fluctuating dependence of M and A\ntransactions number over the certain time period is quasi periodic. We think\nthat there are many factors, which can generate the quasi periodic oscillations\nof the M and A transactions number in the time domain, for example: the stock\nmarket bubble effects. We performed the research of the nonlinearities in the M\nand A transactions number quasi-periodic oscillations in Matlab, including the\nideal, linear, quadratic, and exponential dependences. We discovered that the\naverage of a sum of random numbers in the M and A transactions time series\nrepresents a time series with the quasi periodic systematic oscillations, which\ncan be finely approximated by the polynomial numbers. We think that, in the\ncourse of the M and A transaction implementation, the ability by the companies\nto absorb the newly acquired knowledge and to create the new innovative\nknowledge bases, is a key predeterminant of the M and A deal completion success\nas in Switzerland.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 14:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

A. M. Dirac in\n1938, many authors have tried to reformulate this model so-called radiation\nreaction. Recently, this effect has become important in ultra-intense\nlaser-electron (plasma) interactions. In our recent research, we found the\nstabilization method of radiation reaction by the QED vacuum fluctuation [PTEP\n2014, 043A01 (2014), PTEP 2015, 023A01 (2015)]. On the other hand, the\nmodification of the radiated field by highly intense incoming laser fields\nshould be taken into account when the laser intensity is higher than 1022W/cm2,\nwhich could be achieved by the next generation ultra-short pulse 10PW lasers,\nlike the ones under construction for the ELI-NP facility. In this paper, I\npropose the running charge-mass method for the description of the QED-based\nsynchrotron radiation by high-intensity external fields with the stabilization\nby the QED vacuum fluctuation as an extension to the model by Dirac.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 12:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 22:21:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 06:49:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 03:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

In the\ncurrent political landscape, a president cannot easily collaborate with the\nopposite party and pass legislature. Ideologies between parties have drifted\napart to the point that one party generally stonewalls any legislature proposed\nby the other party. Because of this political landscape, it is paramount for a\npresident to have a majority of his party in Congress. Political parties invest\na great deal of time and effort into making sure that first their Presidential\ncandidate wins and is popular, and then their congressional candidates win\nseats in Congress. In this study, the effect of the former on the latter was\ninvestigated - how the approval rating of the president influences the number\nof seats won or lost in Congress during the midterm elections. The data used\nwas collected from Gallup. An analysis of the data yielded the statistically\nsignificant linear model y = -107.423+1.594x, where x is the approval rating of\nthe president and y is the number of Congressional seats won or lost by the\nparty of the president. Further analysis yielded a 20 percent more\nstatistically useful model for approval ratings greater than 50 percent: y =\n-275.461+4.37551x. As of the eve of the 2014 Midterms, President Barrack Obama\nhad an approval rating of 44 percent. Using the originally derived linear\nmodel, it can be said with 95 percent confidence that the Democratic Party will\nlose between 27 and 48 seats in Congress, rounded to the nearest whole seat.\nThis prediction has since been proven correct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 20:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}
