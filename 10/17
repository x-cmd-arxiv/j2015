This gap led to look for functional spaces C_*(Om), contained in\nC(Om), as large as possible, for which f in C_*(Om) merely guarantees the\ncontinuity of D^2 u (but nothing more, say). H\\\"older continuity is too\nrestrictive to fulfill this minimal requirement since in this case D^2 u\ninherits the whole regularity enjoyed by f (we say that \"full regularity\"\noccurs). This two opposite situations led us to look for significant cases in\nwhich intermediate regularity (i.e., between \"mere continuity\" and \"full\nregularity\") occurs. This holds for data in Log spaces D^{0,a}(Om) (a= alpha)\nwhere 0< a < infty, simply obtained by replacing in the modulus of continuity\nof H\\\"older spaces the quantity 1/|x-y| by log(1/|x-y|).

Recently,\nKarimi and Banihashemi proposed a characterization of ETSs, which was based on\nviewing an ETS as a layered superset (LSS) of a short cycle in the code's\nTanner graph. A notable advantage of LSS characterization is that it\ncorresponds to a simple LSS-based search algorithm that starts from short\ncycles of the graph and finds the ETSs with LSS structure efficiently. Compared\nto the LSS-based characterization of Karimi and Banihashemi, which is based on\na single LSS expansion technique, the new characterization involves two\nadditional expansion techniques. The introduction of the new techniques\nmitigates two problems that LSS-based characterization/search suffers from: (1)\nexhaustiveness, (2) search efficiency. We prove that using the three expansion\ntechniques, any ETS structure can be obtained starting from a simple cycle, no\nmatter how large the size of the structure $a$ or the number of its unsatisfied\ncheck nodes $b$ are. We also demonstrate that for the proposed\ncharacterization/search to exhaustively cover all the ETS structures within the\n$(a,b)$ classes with $a \\leq a_{max}, b \\leq b_{max}$, for any value of\n$a_{max}$ and $b_{max}$, the length of the short cycles required to be\nenumerated is less than that of the LSS-based characterization/search. We also\nprove that the three expansion techniques, proposed here, are the only\nexpansions needed for characterization of ETS structures starting from simple\ncycles in the graph, if one requires each and every intermediate sub-structure\nto be an ETS as well. Extensive simulation results are provided to show that,\ncompared to LSS-based search, significant improvement in search speed and\nmemory requirements can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

We find, although the\nfermions are of mass dimension one, the four-point fermionic self-interaction\nviolates unitarity at high-energy. Therefore, it cannot be a fundamental\ninteraction of the theory. It follows that for the spin-half fermions, the\ndemand of renormalisability and unitarity forbids four-point interactions and\nonly allows for the Yukawa interaction. For fermions with spin j>1/2, they have\nno renormalisable or unitary interactions.

The linear stability analysis shows that short-wave\ninstabilities are created by the interplay between the shear in the upper and\nthe lower layers. If the stratification is non-uniform, in particular surface\nintensified, the linear growth rate is larger for short-wave instabilities than\nfor long-wave instabilities and the layers are essentially decoupled, with the\nsmall scales growing independently. The fully developed homogeneous turbulence\nis studied in a number of numerical experiments. Results show that in both the\ncase of equal layer depths and surface intensified stratification an inverse\ncascade in kinetic energy is observed. The modal kinetic energy spectra for the\ncase with surface intensified stratification show higher energy for higher\nbaroclinic numbers at small scales, due to the decoupling of the layers. As a\nresult, while the case with equal layer depths shows large barotropic\ninstabilities with large scale gradients of potential temperature, the surface\nintensified stratification is characterized by a transition from surface\ndynamics, characterized by a patchy distribution of vorticity, to interior\ndynamics, characterized by vorticity filamentation. The effect of the\nshort-wave instabilities can be seen in the probability distribution functions\nof the potential vorticity anomaly, which reduces to a Gaussian distribution\nwhen the growth rate of the short-wave instabilities is larger than the growth\nrate for the long-wave instabilities.

Since many stencil schemes have low\narithmetic intensity, most optimizations focus on increasing the temporal data\naccess locality, thus reducing the data traffic through the main memory\ninterface with the ultimate goal of decoupling from this bottleneck. There are,\nhowever, only few approaches that explicitly leverage the shared cache feature\nof modern multicore chips. If every thread works on its private, separate cache\nblock, the available cache space can become too small, and sufficient temporal\nlocality may not be achieved.\n  We propose a flexible multi-dimensional intra-tile parallelization method for\nstencil algorithms on multicore CPUs with a shared outer-level cache.

In many\natomic, molecular, and optical systems, such models also underlie the most\nsuccessful attempts to engineer strong, long-ranged interactions for the\npurpose of entanglement generation. Especially when the coupling between the\nspins and bosons is strong---such that it cannot be treated\nperturbatively---the properties of such models are extremely challenging to\ncalculate theoretically. Here, exact analytical expressions for nonequilibrium\nspin-spin correlation functions are derived for a specific model of spins\ncoupled to bosons. The spatial structure of the coupling between spins and\nbosons is completely arbitrary, and thus the solution can be applied to systems\nin any number of dimensions. The explicit and nonperturbative inclusion of the\nbosons enables the study of entanglement generation (in the form of spin\nsqueezing) even when the bosons are driven strongly and near-resonantly, and\nthus provides a quantitative view of the breakdown of adiabatic elimination\nthat inevitably occurs as one pushes towards the fastest entanglement\ngeneration possible. The solution also helps elucidate the effect of finite\ntemperature on spin squeezing. The model considered is relevant to a variety of\natomic, molecular, and optical systems, such as atoms in cavities or trapped\nions. As an explicit example, the results are used to quantify phonon effects\nin trapped ion quantum simulators, which are expected to become increasingly\nimportant as these experiments push towards larger numbers of ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 20:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Since this is a property of the\ndensity distribution of an exponential disk, it is independent of spectral type\nor stellar sample. Using the published estimates of the ultracool dwarf\nluminosity function, we show that their number counts typically peak around\nJ~24 mag with a total surface density of Sigma ~ 0.3 arcmin^-2, but with a\nstrong dependence on galactic coordinate and spectral type. Owing to the\nexponential shape of the disk, the ultracool dwarfs are very rare at faint\nmagnitudes (J>~27 mag), with typical densities of Sigma~0.005 arcmin^-2 (or\n~20% of the total contribution within the field). Therefore in the very narrow\nand deep fields, we predict there are only a few ultracool dwarfs, and hence\nthese stars are likely not a severe contaminant in searches for high-redshift\ngalaxies. Furthermore the ultracool dwarfs are expected to be considerably\nbrighter than the high-redshift galaxies, so samples near the faint-end of the\nhigh-redshift galaxy population will be the purest.

Placing\nencryption near the source ensures that data remains encrypted throughout the\nstorage stack, making it easier to use untrusted storage, such as public\nclouds.\n  Unfortunately, such a strategy also prevents downstream storage systems from\napplying content-based features, such as deduplication, to the data. In this\npaper, we present Lamassu, an encryption solution that uses block-oriented,\nhost-based, convergent encryption to secure data, while preserving\nstorage-based data deduplication. Unlike past convergent encryption systems,\nwhich typically store encryption metadata in a dedicated store, our system\ntransparently inserts its metadata into each file's data stream.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade. Our candidate for such physics is a simple model for stellar radiation\nfeedback. Radiative heating, powered by accretion onto forming stars, arrests\nthe fragmentation cascade and imposes a characteristic mass scale that is\nnearly independent of the time-evolution or initial conditions in the\nstar-forming cloud, and that agrees well with the peak of the observed IMF. In\ncontrast, models that introduce a stiff equation of state for denser clouds but\nthat do not explicitly include the effects of feedback do not yield an\ninvariant IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 22:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 21:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Some exotic matter might still be\nneeded at the junction between our solutions and flat spacetime, but we\ndemonstrate that the averaged null energy condition (as evaluated along radial\nnull geodesics) is satisfied for a particular set of wormhole geometries.\nTherefore, if fourth-order conformal Weyl gravity is a correct extension of\ngeneral relativity, traversable wormholes might become a realistic solution for\ninterstellar travel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 00:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 00:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 18:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

This is done by first deriving the conserved mass of a \"spherically\"\nsymmetric domain wall, which is taken as the classical Hamiltonian of the black\nhole. Upon deriving the conserved mass, we also point out that, for a\n\"spherically\" symmetric shell, there is an easy and straight-forward way of\ndetermining the conserved mass, which is related to the proper time derivative\nof the interior and exterior times. This method for determining the conserved\nmass is generic to any situation (i.e. any equation of state), since it only\ndepends on the energy per unit area, $\\sigma$, of the shell.\n  Classically, we show that the time taken for gravitational collapse follows\nthat of the typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse, that\nis, an asymptotic observer will see that the collapse takes an infinite amount\nof time to occur, while an infalling observer will see the collapse to both the\nhorizon and the classical singularity occur in a finite amount of time. Quantum\nmechanically, we take primary interest in the behavior of the collapse near the\nhorizon and near the classical singularity from the point of view of both\nasymptotic and infalling observers.

The most interesting quantum\nmechanical effect comes in when investigating near the classical singularity.\nHere, we find, that the quantum effects in this region are able to remove the\nclassical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is non-singular,\nand is also displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy density of\nthe domain wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 00:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

For applications such as predicting users' political preference,\nit is particularly important to be able to analyze the dynamics of competing\nopinions. While observing the evolution of polar opinions of a social network's\nusers over time, can we tell when the network \"behaved\" abnormally?\nFurthermore, can we predict how the opinions of the users will change in the\nfuture? Do opinions evolve according to existing network opinion dynamics\nmodels? To answer such questions, it is not sufficient to study individual user\nbehavior, since opinions can spread far beyond users' egonets. We need a method\nto analyze opinion dynamics of all network users simultaneously and capture the\neffect of individuals' behavior on the global evolution pattern of the social\nnetwork.\n  In this work, we introduce Social Network Distance (SND) - a distance measure\nthat quantifies the \"cost\" of evolution of one snapshot of a social network\ninto another snapshot under various models of polar opinion propagation. SND\nhas a rich semantics of a transportation problem, yet, is computable in time\nlinear in the number of users, which makes SND applicable to the analysis of\nlarge-scale online social networks.

Observations using Spitzer between 2005\nand 2009 show significant changes in the 10 micron silicate stretch feature.\nThere is a deepening of the 10 micron silicate stretch as well as the\ndevelopment of a feature between about 13 and 20 microns consistent with a\nblend of the MgO and FeO stretching features and the O-Si-O bending mode of\nincreasingly ordered silicate dust. Near-infrared observations show the\npresence of AlO and water vapor in the outflow in 2003, 2004 and 2005: the AlO\nhas significantly decreased in spectra obtained in 2014 while the water vapor\nremains largely unchanged. An attempt is made to correlate these observations\nand understand the significance of these changes using DUSTY modeling. The\nobservations appear consistent with the kinetically-controlled, condensation of\nhighly under-oxidized SiO/AlO/Fe/Mg dust grains in the outflow followed by the\ncontinuous evolution of the initial condensate due to thermal annealing and\noxidation of the dust via reaction with ambient O, OH and H2O in the expanding,\ncooling shell. Periodic monitoring of this dust shell over the mid-infrared\nspectral range could yield useful information on the evolution of\nunder-oxidized silicate condensates exposed to hot water vapor in more\nconventional circumstellar environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 05:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

It is also\nimplemented in mainstream dense linear algebra libraries. However, we note that\ntheoretical study of the parallelism of this algorithm is currently lacking. In\nthis paper, we present new theoretical results about the tiled Cholesky\nfactorization in the context of a parallel homogeneous model without\ncommunication costs. We use standard flop-based weights for the tasks. For a\n$t$-by-$t$ matrix, we know that the critical path of the tiled Cholesky\nalgorithm is $9t-10$ and that the weight of all tasks is $t^3$. In this\ncontext, we prove that no schedule with less than $0.185 t^2$ processing units\ncan finish in a time less than the critical path. In perspective, a naive bound\ngives $0.11 t^2.$ We then give a schedule which needs less than $0.25\nt^2+0.16t+3$ processing units to complete in the time of the critical path. In\nperspective, a naive schedule gives $0.50 t^2.$ In addition, given a fixed\nnumber of processing units, $p$, we give a lower bound on the execution time as\nfollows: $$\\max( \\frac{t^{3}}{p}, \\frac{t^{3}}{p} - 3\\frac{t^2}{p} + 6\\sqrt{2p}\n- 7 , 9t-10).$$ The interest of the latter formula lies in the middle term. Our\nresults stem from the observation that the tiled Cholesky factorization is much\nbetter behaved when we schedule it with an ALAP (As Late As Possible) heuristic\nthan an ASAP (As Soon As Possible) heuristic. We also provide scheduling\nheuristics which match closely the lower bound on execution time. We believe\nthat our theoretical results will help practical scheduling studies. Indeed,\nour results enable to better characterize the quality of a practical schedule\nwith respect to an optimal schedule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 09:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

Three different methods have been used\nhere: i) a numerical solution of the Cauchy momentum equation with the Carreau\nor power-law constitutive equations for pressure-driven flow in a fiber bed\nconsisting of a periodic array of cylindrical fibers, ii) an analytical\nsolution for a unit cell model representing the flow characteristics of a\nperiodic fibrous medium, and iii) a scaling analysis of characteristic bulk\nparameters such as the effective shear rate, the effective viscosity,\ngeometrical parameters of the system, and the fluid rheology. Our scaling\nanalysis yields simple expressions for evaluating the transverse mobility\nfunctions for each model, which can be used for a wide range of medium porosity\nand fluid rheological parameters. While the dimensionless mobility is, in\ngeneral, a function of the Carreau number and the medium porosity, our results\nshow that for porosities less than $\\varepsilon\\simeq0.65$, the dimensionless\nmobility becomes independent of the Carreau number and the mobility function\nexhibits power-law characteristics as a result of high shear rates at the pore\nscale. We derive a suitable criterion for determining the flow regime and the\ntransition from a constant viscosity Newtonian response to a power-law regime\nin terms of a new Carreau number rescaled with a dimensionless function which\nincorporates the medium porosity and the arrangement of fibers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 14:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

This\npaper presented an idea of using the power gating structure for reducing the\nsub threshold leakage in the reversible system. This concept presented in the\npaper is entirely new and presented in the literature of reversible logics. By\nusing the reversible logics for the digital systems, the energy can be saved up\nto the gate level implementation. But at the physical level designing of the\nreversible logics by the modern CMOS technology the heat or energy is\ndissipated due the sub-threshold leakage at the time of inactivity or standby\nmode. The Reversible Programming logic array (RPLA) is one of the important\nparts of the low power industrial applications and in this paper the physical\ndesign of the RPLA is presented by using the sleep transistor and the results\nis shown with the help of TINA- PRO software. The results for the proposed\ndesign is also compare with the CMOS design and shown that of 40.8% of energy\nsaving. The Transient response is also produces in the paper for the switching\nactivity and showing that the proposed design is much better that the modern\nCMOS design of the RPLA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 04:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-10"}
