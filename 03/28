Given such \\emph{context} information, each\nsmall cell base station (SCBS) aims to maximize the overall performance\nprovided to its frequent users, while ensuring that occasional users are also\nwell serviced. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game in which the\nSCBSs are the players. The strategy of each SCBS is to choose a proper power\nallocation so as to optimize a utility function that captures the tradeoff\nbetween the users' quality-of-service gains and the costs in terms of resource\nexpenditures. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence and\nuniqueness of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the game, and we show that\nthis condition is independent of the number of users in the network.

Applications of phylogeography are broad,\nand in the context of pathogens include the reconstruction of transmission\nhistories and the origin and emergence of outbreaks. Phylogeographic inference\nbased on bottom-up population genetics models is computationally expensive, and\nas a result faster alternatives based on the evolution of discrete traits have\nbecome popular. In this paper, we show that inference of migration rates and\nroot locations based on discrete trait models is extremely unreliable and\nsensitive to biased sampling. To address this problem, we introduce BASTA\n(BAyesian STructured coalescent Approximation), a new approach implemented in\nBEAST2 that combines the accuracy of methods based on the structured coalescent\nwith the computational efficiency required to handle more than just few\npopulations. We illustrate the potentially severe implications of poor model\nchoice for phylogeographic analyses by investigating the zoonotic transmission\nof Ebola virus. Whereas the structured coalescent analysis correctly infers\nthat successive human Ebola outbreaks have been seeded by a large unsampled\nnon-human reservoir population, the discrete trait analysis implausibly\nconcludes that undetected human-to-human transmission has allowed the virus to\npersist over the past four decades.

Traditionally, the emission lines employed\nare in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is\nlimited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in\nhelium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical\nparameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, & Guseva\n(2014) have pioneered adding the He 10830 infrared emission line in helium\nabundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He 10830\nmakes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the\ndegeneracy with temperature. We revisit our analysis of the dataset published\nby Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007) and incorporate the newly available\nobservations of He 10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoretical\nPaschen-gamma ratio. The solutions are better constrained, in particular for\nelectron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the\nmodel fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for\nquality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut.\nFurthermore, the addition of He 10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium\nabundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from\n10-80%. Overall, we find a reduction in the uncertainty on Y_p by over 50%.\nFrom a regression to zero metallicity, we determine Y_p = 0.2449 +/- 0.0040,\nconsistent with the BBN result, Y_p = 0.2470 +/- 0.0002, based on the Planck\ndetermination of the baryon density.

It includes the information on the instrumental noise,\npermitting the analysis of the goodness of the models, and an estimation of the\nerror of the retrieved parameters. The fifth chapter presents the spectral\nanalysis of Tempel 1 and Hartley 2 whose data are coming from Deep Impact space\nmission and its extended investigation. The sixth chapter shows the photometric\nanalysis of Lutetia asteroid, which was encountered by Rosetta during its\ncruise phase. This work have paved the way to the analysis of the final target\nof Rosetta: comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The tools presented are currently\nused by the VIRTIS Team to produce works on the comet, that are recommended to\nthe reader. Since a complete analysis on the comet is outside the scope of this\nwork, just preliminary results are shown here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 18:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

The chiral anomaly, which plays a fundamental role in chiral gauge\ntheories, was predicted to be observable in crystals by Nielsen and Ninomiya in\n1983 [1]. Theoretical progress in identifying and investigating Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals has revived strong interest in this issue [2-6]. In the Dirac\nsemimetal, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by a magnetic field $\\bf B$\nsplits each Dirac node into two chiral Weyl nodes. If an electric field $\\bf E$\nis applied parallel to $\\bf B$, charge is predicted to flow between the Weyl\nnodes. We report the observation in the Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi of a novel,\nnegative and highly anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR). We show that the\nenhanced conductivity has the form of a narrowly defined plume that can be\nsteered by the applied field. The novel MR is acutely sensitive to deviations\nof $\\bf B$ from $\\bf E$, a feature incompatible with conventional transport.\nThe locking of the current plume to the field appears to be a defining\nsignature of the chiral anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 18:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

Earlier observations showed two pairs of cavities distributed roughly\ncollinearly, with each pair associated with an elliptical shock front. The new\nobservations confirm a third pair of outer cavities, collinear with the other\npairs, and reveal an associated outer outburst shock at ~30 kpc. This system is\ntherefore unique in exhibiting three cavity pairs, each associated with an\nunambiguous AGN outburst shock front. The implied mean kinetic power is roughly\nthe same for each outburst, demonstrating that the average AGN kinetic\nluminosity can remain stable over long timescales (~50 Myr). The two older\noutbursts have larger, roughly equal total energies as compared with the\nyoungest outburst, implying that the youngest outburst is ongoing. We find that\nthe radiative cooling rate and the mean shock heating rate of the gas are well\nbalanced at each shock front, suggesting that AGN outburst shock heating alone\nis sufficient to offset cooling and establish AGN/ICM feedback within at least\nthe central 30 kpc. This heating takes place roughly isotropically and most\nstrongly at small radii, as is required for feedback to operate. We suggest\nthat shock heating may play a significant role in AGN feedback at smaller radii\nin other systems, where weak shocks are more difficult to detect. We find\nnon-zero shock front widths that are too large to be explained by particle\ndiffusion. Instead, all measured widths are consistent with shock broadening\ndue to propagation through a turbulent ICM with a mean turbulent speed of ~70\nkm/s. Finally, we place lower limits on the temperature of any volume-filling\nthermal gas within the cavities that would balance the internal cavity pressure\nwith the external ICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 19:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The\ndominant annihilation channels are different from those usually considered in\nprevious work. We show that the GeV-energy gamma-ray excess in the galactic\ncenter region, as derived from Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Space Telescope data, can be\nattributed to such secluded dark matter WIMPs, given parameters of the model\nthat are consistent with the cosmological dark matter density. Secluded WIMP\nmodels are also consistent with suggested upper limits on the DM contribution\nto the cosmic-ray antiproton flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 20:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 14:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 14:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

However, the benefits of full-duplex are still\nnot well understood. In this paper, we characterize the full-duplex rate gains\nin both single-channel and multi-channel use cases. For the single-channel\ncase, we quantify the rate gain as a function of the remaining\nself-interference and SNR values. We also provide a sufficient condition under\nwhich the sum of uplink and downlink rates on a full-duplex channel is concave\nin the transmission power levels. Building on these results, we consider the\nmulti-channel case. For that case, we introduce a new realistic model of a\nsmall form-factor (e.g., smartphone) full-duplex receiver and demonstrate its\naccuracy via measurements. We study the problem of jointly allocating power\nlevels to different channels and selecting the frequency of maximum\nself-interference suppression, where the objective is maximizing the sum of the\nrates over uplink and downlink OFDM channels. We develop a polynomial time\nalgorithm which is nearly optimal in practice under very mild restrictions.

The purely gas phase disequilibrium in Earth's\natmosphere is mostly attributable to O2 and CH4.

In the present paper, we\nconstruct a computational model that includes PDCD5 interactions in the p53\nsignaling network and study the effects of PDCD5 on p53-mediated cell fate\ndecisions during the DNA damage response. Our results revealed that PDCD5\nfunctions as a co-activator of p53 that regulates p53-dependent cell fate\ndecisions via the mediation of p53 dynamics. The effects of PDCD5 are\ndose-dependent such that p53 can display either sustained or pulsed dynamics at\ndifferent PDCD5 levels. Moreover, PDCD5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two\nmechanisms during the two phases of sustained and pulsed p53 dynamics. This\nstudy provides insights regarding how PDCD5 functions as a regulator of the p53\npathway and might be helpful for increasing our understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms by which PDCD5 can be used to treat cancers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 07:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

These methods exhibit good empirical performance on a wide variety of\ntasks and enjoy super-linear convergence to the optimal solution. For\nlarge-scale learning problems, stochastic Quasi-Newton methods have been\nrecently proposed. However, these typically only achieve sub-linear convergence\nrates and have not been shown to consistently perform well in practice since\nnoisy Hessian approximations can exacerbate the effect of high-variance\nstochastic gradient estimates. In this work we propose Vite, a novel stochastic\nQuasi-Newton algorithm that uses an existing first-order technique to reduce\nthis variance. Without exploiting the specific form of the approximate Hessian,\nwe show that Vite reaches the optimum at a geometric rate with a constant\nstep-size when dealing with smooth strongly convex functions.

The time variable used for this statement is the cosmic scale\nfactor, i.e., the \"$a$-time\", and not the cosmic time. For this, a\nLagrangian-coordinates formulation of the Euler-Poisson equations is employed,\noriginally used by Cauchy for 3-D incompressible flow. Temporal analyticity for\n$\\Lambda$CDM is found to be a consequence of novel explicit all-order recursion\nrelations for the $a$-time Taylor coefficients of the Lagrangian displacement\nfield, from which we derive the convergence of the $a$-time Taylor series. A\nlower bound for the $a$-time where analyticity is guaranteed and shell-crossing\nis ruled out is obtained, whose value depends only on $\\Lambda$ and on the\ninitial spatial smoothness of the density field. The largest time interval is\nachieved when $\\Lambda$ vanishes, i.e., for an Einstein-de Sitter universe.\nAnalyticity holds also if, instead of the $a$-time, one uses the linear\nstructure growth $D$-time, but no simple recursion relations are then obtained.\nThe analyticity result also holds when a curvature term is included in the\nFriedmann equation for the background, but inclusion of a radiation term\narising from the primordial era spoils analyticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 12:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 19:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

It is total in the sense that it involves\nterms for all three dimensions. Constant idempotents that are \"proper\nfunctions\" of K+1's components are not proper functions of K+1. They rather\nsatisfy \"inhomogeneous proper-value equations\", i.e. of the form (K + 1)U =\n{\\mu}U + {\\pi}, where {\\pi} is a scalar. We consider an equation of that type\nwith K+1 replaced with operators T that comprise K + 1 as a factor, but also\ncontaining factors for both space and spacetime translations. We study the\naction of those T's on linear combinations of constant idempotents, so that\nonly the algebraic (spin) part of K +1 has to be considered. {\\pi} is now, in\ngeneral, a non-scalar member of a Kaehler algebra. We develop the system of\nequations to be satisfied by the combinations of those idempotents for which\n{\\pi} becomes a scalar. We solve for its solutions with {\\mu} = 0, which\nactually also makes {\\pi} = 0: The solutions with {\\mu} = {\\pi} = 0 all have\nthree constituent parts, 36 of them being different in the ensemble of all such\nsolutions. That set of different constituents is structured in such a way that\nwe might as well be speaking of an algebraic representation of quarks.

A problem facing such panels is\nhow to take into account different standards amongst panel members and varying\nlevels of confidence in their scores. Here, a mathematically-based algorithm is\ndeveloped to calibrate the scores of such assessors, addressing both of these\nissues. The algorithm is based on the connectivity of the graph of assessors\nand objects evaluated, incorporating declared confidences as weights on its\nedges. If the graph is sufficiently well connected, relative standards can be\ninferred by comparing how assessors rate objects they assess in common,\nweighted by the levels of confidence of each assessment. By removing these\nbiases, \"true\" values are inferred for all the objects. Reliability estimates\nfor the resulting values are obtained. The algorithm is tested in two case\nstudies, one by computer simulation and another based on realistic evaluation\ndata. The process is compared to the simple averaging procedure in widespread\nuse, and to Fisher's additive incomplete block analysis. It is anticipated that\nthe algorithm will prove useful in a wide variety of situations such as\nevaluation of the quality of research submitted to national assessment\nexercises; appraisal of grant proposals submitted to funding panels; ranking of\njob applicants; and judgement of performances on degree courses wherein\ncandidates can choose from lists of options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 11:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}
