Dependent terms are predominantly\nidentified using lexical frequency statistics, assuming that (a) if terms\nco-occur often enough in some corpus, they are semantically dependent; (b) the\nmore often they co-occur, the more semantically dependent they are. This\nassumption is not always correct: the frequency of co-occurring terms can be\nseparate from the strength of their semantic dependence. E.g. \"red tape\" might\nbe overall less frequent than \"tape measure\" in some corpus, but this does not\nmean that \"red\"+\"tape\" are less dependent than \"tape\"+\"measure\". This is\nespecially the case for non-compositional phrases, i.e. phrases whose meaning\ncannot be composed from the individual meanings of their terms (such as the\nphrase \"red tape\" meaning bureaucracy). Motivated by this lack of distinction\nbetween the frequency and strength of term dependence in IR, we present a\nprincipled approach for handling term dependence in queries, using both lexical\nfrequency and semantic evidence. We focus on non-compositional phrases,\nextending a recent unsupervised model for their detection [21] to IR. Our\napproach, integrated into ranking using Markov Random Fields [31], yields\neffectiveness gains over competitive TREC baselines, showing that there is\nstill room for improvement in the very well-studied area of term dependence in\nIR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 16:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

Using the recently made rigorous IST for\nvector fields associated with the so-called Pavlov equation\n$v_{xt}+v_{yy}+v_xv_{xy}-v_yv_{xx}=0$, in this paper we establish the\nfollowing. 1. The non-local term $\\partial_x^{-1}$ arising from its\nevolutionary form $v_{t}=\nv_{x}v_{y}-\\partial^{-1}_{x}\\,\\partial_{y}\\,[v_{y}+v^2_{x}]$ corresponds to the\nasymmetric integral $-\\int_x^{\\infty}dx'$. 2.

Since no smooth and well-localized initial\ndata can satisfy such constraint at $t=0$, the initial ($t=0+$) dynamics of the\nPavlov equation can not be smooth, although, as it was already established,\nsmall norm solutions remain regular for all positive times. We expect that the\ntechniques developed in this paper to prove the above results, should be\nsuccessfully used in the study of the non-locality of other basic examples of\nintegrable dispersionless PDEs in multidimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 16:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

In this model, the rate of accretion of pebbles onto\nplanetesimals quickly outpaces the rate of direct planetesimal formation in the\ninner disk. This allows for the formation of a high mass inner disk without the\nneed for enhanced planetesimal formation or a massive protoplanetary disk. Our\nproposed mechanism for planetesimal disk growth does not require any special\nconditions to operate. Consequently, we expect that high mass planetesimal\ndisks form naturally in nearly all systems. The extent of this growth is\ncontrolled by the total mass in pebbles that drifts through the inner disk.\nAnything that reduces the rate or duration of pebble delivery will\ncorrespondingly reduce the final mass of the planetesimal disk. Therefore, we\nexpect that low mass stars (with less massive protoplanetary disks), low\nmetallicity stars and stars with giant planets should all grow less massive\nplanetesimal disks. The evolution of planetesimal disks into planetary systems\nremains a mystery. However, we argue that late stage planet formation models\nshould begin with a massive disk. This reinforces the idea that massive and\ncompact planetary systems could form in situ but does not exclude the\npossibility that significant migration occurs post-planet formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 16:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Despite many benefits that the cloud presents, such as high\navailability and scalability, most of the on-premise application architectures\nare not ready to fully exploit the benefits of this environment, and adapting\nthem to this environment is a non-trivial task. Microservices have appeared\nrecently as novel architectural styles that are native to the cloud. These\ncloud-native architectures can facilitate migrating on-premise architectures to\nfully benefit from the cloud environments because non-functional attributes,\nlike scalability, are inherent in this style. The existing approaches on cloud\nmigration does not mostly consider cloud-native architectures as their\nfirst-class citizens. As a result, the final product may not meet its primary\ndrivers for migration. In this paper, we intend to report our experience and\nlessons learned in an ongoing project on migrating a monolithic on-premise\nsoftware architecture to microservices.

To remove the need for\npre-generated frame labels, we adopt the connectionist temporal classification\n(CTC) objective function to infer the alignments between speech and label\nsequences. A distinctive feature of Eesen is a generalized decoding approach\nbased on weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs), which enables the efficient\nincorporation of lexicons and language models into CTC decoding. Experiments\nshow that compared with the standard hybrid DNN systems, Eesen achieves\ncomparable word error rates (WERs), while at the same time speeding up decoding\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 17:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 21:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 20:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

The resurge of interest in density matrix functional\nmethods has brought several new methods including the family of Piris Natural\nOrbital Functionals (PNOF). In this work we compare PNOF5 and PNOF6, which\ninclude nondynamic electron correlation effects to some extent, with other\nstandard ab initio methods in the H$_4$ $D_{4h}/D_{2h}$ potential energy\nsurface. Thus far, the wrongful behavior of single-reference methods at the\n$D_{2h}-D_{4h}$ transition of H$_4$ has been attributed to wrong account of\nnondynamic correlation effects, whereas in geminal-based approaches it has been\nassigned to a wrong coupling of spins and the localized nature of the orbitals.\nWe will show that actually $\\textit{interpair}$ nondynamic correlation is the\nkey to a cusp-free qualitatively correct description of H$_4$ PES.

In those games, players are vertices of an\nundirected, simple graph, and the strategy space of each player is the set of\ncolors from $1$ to $k$. A tight bound on the price of anarchy of\n$\\frac{k}{k-1}$ is known (Hoefer 2007, Kun et al. 2013), for the case that each\nplayer's payoff is the number of her neighbors with different color than\nherself. The study of more complex payoff functions was left as an open\nproblem.\n  We compute payoff for a player by determining the distance of her color to\nthe color of each of her neighbors, applying a non-negative, real-valued,\nconcave function $f$ to each of those distances, and then summing up the\nresulting values. This includes the payoff functions suggested by Kun et al.\n(2013) for future work as special cases.\n  Denote $f^*$ the maximum value that $f$ attains on the possible distances\n$0,\\dots,k-1$.

In\nthis paper, we carry out this crucial one-on-one comparison between the R_h=ct\nUniverse (an FRW cosmology with zero active mass) and wCDM/LCDM, using the\nlatest high-z measurements of H(z). Whereas the Type Ia SNe yield the\nintegrated luminosity distance, while the AP diagnostic tests the geometry of\nthe Universe, the Hubble parameter directly samples the expansion rate itself.\nWe find that the model-independent cosmic chronometer data prefer R_h}=ct over\nwCDM/LCDM with a BIC likelihood of ~95% versus only ~5%, in strong support of\nthe earlier SNeIa and AP results. This contrasts with a recent analysis of H(z)\ndata based solely on BAO measurements which, however, strongly depend on the\nassumed cosmology. We discuss why the latter approach is inappropriate for\nmodel comparisons, and emphasize again the need for truly model-independent\nobservations to be used in cosmological tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 19:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

The importance of recycling\nincreases steeply with galaxy stellar mass for $M_{\\ast} < 10^{10.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, and decreases mildly at higher mass.

Recycling is\nmore important for satellites than centrals and its contribution decreases with\ngalactocentric radius. The relative contribution of AGB stars increases with\ntime and towards galaxy centers. This is a consequence of the more gradual\nrelease of AGB ejecta compared to that of massive stars, and the preferential\nremoval of the latter by star formation-driven outflows and by lock up in\nstellar remnants. Recycling-fuelled star formation exhibits a tight, positive\ncorrelation with galaxy metallicity, with a secondary dependence on the\nrelative abundance of alpha elements (which are predominantly synthesized in\nmassive stars), that is insensitive to the subgrid models for feedback.

Despite their widespread usage in climate science\nand oil reservoir simulation, very little is known about the long-time behavior\nof these methods and why they are effective when applied with modest ensemble\nsizes in large dimensional turbulent dynamical systems. By following the basic\nprinciples of energy dissipation and controllability of filters, this paper\nestablishes a simple, systematic and rigorous framework for the nonlinear\nanalysis of EnKF and ESRF with arbitrary ensemble size, focusing on the\ndynamical properties of boundedness and geometric ergodicity. The time uniform\nboundedness guarantees that the filter estimate will not diverge to machine\ninfinity in finite time, which is a potential threat for EnKF and ESQF known as\nthe catastrophic filter divergence. Geometric ergodicity ensures in addition\nthat the filter has a unique invariant measure and that initialization errors\nwill dissipate exponentially in time. We establish these results by introducing\na natural notion of observable energy dissipation. The time uniform bound is\nachieved through a simple Lyapunov function argument, this result applies to\nsystems with complete observations and strong kinetic energy dissipation, but\nalso to concrete examples with incomplete observations. With the Lyapunov\nfunction argument established, the geometric ergodicity is obtained by\nverifying the controllability of the filter processes; in particular, such\nanalysis for ESQF relies on a careful multivariate perturbation analysis of the\ncovariance eigen-structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 20:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

It is important to protect the privacy of data in an outsourced\nk-NN system.\n  Prior works have all assumed the data owners (who submit data to the\noutsourced k-NN system) are a single trusted party.

The vulnerability is a result of the mathematical\nproperties of k-NN and its output. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving\nalternative system supporting kernel density estimation using a Gaussian\nkernel, a classification algorithm from the same family as k-NN.

However, we show that systems which are\ngenerally dispersive can have resonant sets of wave modes with identical group\nvelocities, leading to a local breakdown of dispersivity. This shows up as a\ngeometric singularity of the resonant manifold and possibly as an infinite\nphase measure in the collision integral. Such singularities occur widely for\nclassical wave systems, including acoustical waves, Rossby waves, helical waves\nin rotating fluids, light waves in nonlinear optics and also in quantum\ntransport, e.g. kinetics of electron-hole excitations (matter waves) in\ngraphene. These singularities are the exact analogue of the critical points\nfound by Van Hove in 1953 for phonon dispersion relations in crystals. The\nimportance of these singularities in wave kinetics depends on the dimension of\nphase space $D=(N-2)d$ ($d$ physical space dimension, $N$ the number of waves\nin resonance) and the degree of degeneracy $\\delta$ of the critical points.\nFollowing Van Hove, we show that non-degenerate singularities lead to finite\nphase measures for $D>2$ but produce divergences when $D\\leq 2$ and possible\nbreakdown of wave kinetics if the collision integral itself becomes too large\n(or even infinite). Similar divergences and possible breakdown can occur for\ndegenerate singularities, when $D-\\delta\\leq 2,$ as we find for several\nphysical examples, including electron-hole kinetics in graphene. When the\nstandard kinetic equation breaks down, then one must develop a new singular\nwave kinetics.

The central agent is stabilized by a bistable potential, the only\nstabilizing force in the system. The local agents derive their stability only\nfrom the central agent. In the mean field limit of a large number of local\nagents we show that the systemic risk decreases when the strength of the\ninteraction of the local agents with the central agent increases. This means\nthat the probability of transition from one of the two stable quasi-equilibria\nto the other one decreases. We also show that the systemic risk increases when\nthe strength of the interaction of the central agent with the mean field of the\nlocal agents increases.

A number\nof site-specific structural characteristics have been proposed, most of which\nare broadly related to either the density of contacts or the solvent\naccessibility of individual residues. Most importantly, there has been\ndisagreement in the literature over the relative importance of solvent\naccessibility and local packing density for explaining site-specific sequence\nvariability in proteins. We show here that this discussion has been confounded\nby the definition of local packing density. The most commonly used measures of\nlocal packing, such as the contact number and the weighted contact number,\nrepresent by definition the combined effects of local packing density and\nlonger-range effects. As an alternative, we here propose a truly local measure\nof packing density around a single residue, based on the Voronoi cell volume.\nWe show that the Voronoi cell volume, when calculated relative to the geometric\ncenter of amino-acid side chains, behaves nearly identically to the relative\nsolvent accessibility, and both can explain, on average, approximately 34\\% of\nthe site-specific variation in evolutionary rate in a data set of 209 enzymes.\nAn additional 10\\% of variation can be explained by non-local effects that are\ncaptured in the weighted contact number. Consequently, evolutionary variation\nat a site is determined by the combined action of the immediate amino-acid\nneighbors of that site and of effects mediated by more distant amino acids. We\nconclude that instead of contrasting solvent accessibility and local packing\ndensity, future research should emphasize the relative importance of immediate\ncontacts and longer-range effects on evolutionary variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 22:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2017 03:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

This is because most\nmeasurements have have relied on selecting nearly complete samples, where\nvariations in the composition of the galaxy population with seeing, depth, or\nother survey characteristics are small.\n  We introduce a new measurement method that aims to minimize this wastage,\nallowing precision measurement for any class of stars or galaxies detectable in\nan imaging survey.

Using the synthetic galaxies as randoms in the standard\nLandy-Szalay correlation function estimator suppresses the effects of variable\nsurvey selection by at least two orders of magnitude.

The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) aims to solve\nthis issue, providing a common framework which allows for a coherent modeling\nof sources using all the available data, independent of their origin. At the\nsame time, thanks to its architecture based on plug-ins, 3ML uses the existing\nofficial software of each instrument for the corresponding data in a way which\nis transparent to the user. 3ML is based on the likelihood formalism, in which\na model summarizing our knowledge about a particular region of the sky is\nconvolved with the instrument response and compared to the corresponding data.\nThe user can choose between a frequentist analysis, and a Bayesian analysis. In\nthe former, parameters of the model are optimized in order to obtain the best\nmatch to the data (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood).

We suggest that these types may\nbe imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only the\nresult of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmental\neffects. We present precise star formation histories of a sample of Local Group\ndwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldest\nmain-sequence turnoffs. We argue that these galaxies can be assigned to two\nbasic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and short\nstar formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of their\nstars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (or\nalmost). These two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto the\npresent-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). Slow and fast\ndwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the Milky Way\nand/or M31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lower\ndensity environments than fast dwarfs. We propose that the distinction between\na fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density of\nthe environment where they form.

We extend their work by including the polarization induced by\ndisk inclination with respect to the line of sight. Using a physically\nmotivated, semi-analytic model, we show that the polarization fraction of the\nscattered light increases with the inclination angle $i$, reaching $1/3$ for\nedge-on disks. The inclination-induced polarization can easily dominate that\nintrinsic to the disk in the face-on view. It provides a natural explanation\nfor the two main features of the polarization pattern observed in the tilted\ndisk of HL Tau ($i \\sim 45^\\circ$): the polarized intensity concentrating in a\nregion elongated more or less along the major axis, and polarization in this\nregion roughly parallel to the minor axis. This broad agreement provides\nsupport to dust scattering as a viable mechanism for producing, at least in\npart, polarized millimeter radiation.

By contrast,\nin this paper, we study the problem of reconstructing a known graph signal\nusing as input a graph signal that is non-zero only for a small subset of nodes\n(seeding nodes). The sparse signal is then percolated (interpolated) across the\ngraph using a graph filter. Graph filters are a generalization of classical\ntime-invariant systems and represent linear transformations that can be\nimplemented distributedly across the nodes of the graph.

We\nderive an alternative first-order method based on geodesic convexity: our\nmethod admits a transparent convergence analysis ($< 1$ page), attains linear\nrate, and displays reliable convergence even for rank deficient problems.\nThough superior to gradient-descent, ultimately our method is also outperformed\nby a well-known scaled Newton method. Nevertheless, the primary value of our\nwork is its conceptual value: it shows that for deriving gradient based methods\nfor the matrix square root, \\emph{the manifold geometric view of positive\ndefinite matrices can be much more advantageous than the Euclidean view}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 03:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 20:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

Partially linked to its\nnumerous applications in mechanism design, substantial interest arose also in\nthe study of nonlinear versions of MSP, with a focus on the submodular matroid\nsecretary problem (SMSP). So far, O(1)-competitive algorithms have been\nobtained for SMSP over some basic matroid classes. This created some hope that,\nanalogously to the matroid secretary conjecture, one may even obtain\nO(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over any matroid. However, up to now, most\nquestions related to SMSP remained open, including whether SMSP may be\nsubstantially more difficult than MSP; and more generally, to what extend MSP\nand SMSP are related.\n  Our goal is to address these points by presenting general black-box\nreductions from SMSP to MSP. In particular, we show that any O(1)-competitive\nalgorithm for MSP, even restricted to a particular matroid class, can be\ntransformed in a black-box way to an O(1)-competitive algorithm for SMSP over\nthe same matroid class. This implies that the matroid secretary conjecture is\nequivalent to the same conjecture for SMSP. Hence, in this sense SMSP is not\nharder than MSP. Also, to find O(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over a\nparticular matroid class, it suffices to consider MSP over the same matroid\nclass. Using our reductions we obtain many first and improved O(1)-competitive\nalgorithms for SMSP over various matroid classes by leveraging known algorithms\nfor MSP. Moreover, our reductions imply an O(loglog(rank))-competitive\nalgorithm for SMSP, thus, matching the currently best asymptotic algorithm for\nMSP, and substantially improving on the previously best\nO(log(rank))-competitive algorithm for SMSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 05:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

We calculate the top polarization and\nthe effects of these anomalous couplings on it at two centre-of-mass (cm)\nenergies, 8 TeV and 14 TeV. As a measure of top polarization, we look at\ndecay-lepton angular distributions in the laboratory frame, without requiring\nreconstruction of the rest frame of the top, and study the effect of the\nanomalous couplings on these distributions. We construct certain asymmetries to\nstudy the sensitivity of these distributions to top-quark couplings. We\ndetermine individual limits on the dominant couplings, viz., the real part of\nthe CMDM $\\mathrm{Re}\\rho_2$, the imaginary part of the CEDM\n$\\mathrm{Im}\\rho_3$, and the real part of the tensor $Wtb$ coupling\n$\\mathrm{Ref_{2R}}$, which may be obtained by utilizing these asymmetries at\nthe LHC. We also obtain simultaneous limits on pairs of these couplings taking\ntwo couplings to be non-zero at a time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 05:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 01:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

Most previous works focused on modeling\nthe unstructured text, and recently, some other methods have been proposed to\nmodel the unstructured text with specific tags. To build a general model for\nSSDs remains an important problem in terms of both model fitness and\nefficiency.

TWTM is a framework that leverages both the\ntags and words information, not only to learn the document-topic and topic-word\ndistributions, but also to infer the tag-topic distributions for text mining\ntasks.

In bipartite lattices, e.g., the square lattice, the ground state\ncan be two types of phases: ferromagnetic-like (FM) and antiferromagnetic-like\n(AFM) phases. In systems like SC compounds, the former phase consists of all\nsmall or large molecules, and the latter phase has the configuration of\nalternating small and large molecules. In fact, both cases are observed in SC\nsystems. In this paper, we have studied the effect of the short-range\ninteraction in the elastic system on the properties of those order-disorder\nphase transitions. We have obtained a phase diagram in the coordinates of the\ntemperature and the strength of the short-range interaction, including the\nmetastable structures. We show that effects of the short-range interaction are\nessentially different for FM and AFM phase transitions. In the FM transition,\nthe long-range interaction of elasticity is relevant, and the system exhibits a\nphase transition in the mean-filed universality class. In this case, the\nlong-range interaction strongly enhances the FM order, and it works\ncooperatively with the short-range interaction. In contrast, in the AFM\ntransition, the elastic interaction slightly enhances the AFM order, but\nessentially it does not contribute to the ordering, and the system shows a\ntransition in the Ising universality class. We have found that in the border\nregion between FM and AFM phases, the AFM phase has an advantage at finite\ntemperatures.

We\nanalyze observations of three tiny events, detected by the Nan\\c cay Radio\nHeliograph (NRH), two of which produced IP type IIIs. We took advantage of the\nNRH positioning information and of the high cadence of AIA/SDO data to identify\nthe associated EUV emissions. We measured positions and time profiles of the\nmetric and EUV sources. We found that the EUV events that produced IP type IIIs\nwere located near a coronal hole boundary, while the one that did not was\nlocated in a closed magnetic field region. In all three cases tiny flaring\nloops were involved, without any associated mass eruption. In the best observed\ncase the radio emission at the highest frequency (435 MHz) was displaced by\n~55\" with respect to the small flaring loop. The metric type III emission shows\na complex structure in space and in time, indicative of multiple electron\nbeams, despite the low intensity of the events. From the combined analysis of\ndynamic spectra and NRH images we derived the electron beam velocity as well as\nthe height, ambient plasma temperature and density at the level of formation of\nthe 160 MHz emission. From the analysis of the differential emission measure\nderived from the AIA images we found that the first evidence of energy release\nwas at the footpoints and this was followed by the development of flaring loops\nand subsequent cooling. We conclude that even small energy release events can\naccelerate enough electrons to give rise to powerful IP type III bursts. The\nproximity of the electron acceleration site to open magnetic field lines\nfacilitates the escape of the electrons into the interplanetary space. The\noffset between the site of energy release and the metric type III location\nwarrants further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 09:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Several competing scenarios have been\nproposed to explain such occurrences, including various jet plasma\ninstabilities leading to the formation of shocks, magnetic reconnection sites,\nand turbulence. In this letter we present the results of our detailed\ninvestigation of a prominent, five-hour-long optical microflare detected during\nrecent WEBT campaign in 2014, March 2-6 targeting the blazar 0716+714. After\nseparating the flaring component from the underlying base emission continuum of\nthe blazar, we find that the microflare is highly polarized, with the\npolarization degree $\\sim (40-60)\\%$$\\pm (2-10)\\%$, and the electric vector\nposition angle $\\sim (10 - 20)$deg$\\pm (1-8)$deg slightly misaligned with\nrespect to the position angle of the radio jet. The microflare evolution in the\n$(Q,\\,U)$ Stokes parameter space exhibits a looping behavior with a\ncounter-clockwise rotation, meaning polarization degree decreasing with the\nflux (but higher in the flux decaying phase), and approximately stable\npolarization angle. The overall very high polarization degree of the flare, its\nsymmetric flux rise and decay profiles, and also its structured evolution in\nthe $Q-U$ plane, all imply that the observed flux variation corresponds to a\nsingle emission region characterized by a highly ordered magnetic field. As\ndiscussed in the paper, a small-scale but strong shock propagating within the\noutflow, and compressing a disordered magnetic field component, provides a\nnatural, though not unique, interpretation of our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 09:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 11:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The model comprises an associative and unsupervised learning\nstrategy for the neural circuit of the ant. The neural circuit adapts to the\nenvironment by means of classical conditioning. The initially unknown\nenvironment includes different types of stimuli representing food and obstacles\nwhich, when they come in direct contact with the ant, elicit a reflex response\nin the motor neural system of the ant: moving towards or away from the source\nof the stimulus.

Traditional\nant systems include mainly a positive reinforcement pheromone. This approach\nuses a second pheromone that acts as a marker for forbidden paths (negative\nfeedback). This blockade is not permanent and is controlled by the evaporation\nrate of the pheromones. The combined action of both pheromones acts as a\ncollective stigmergic memory of the swarm, which reduces the search space of\nthe problem.

Examples of such systems may be found in\nnumerous areas of physics including mesoscopic physics that provides the main\nfocus of this review. We provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of OQSs\nin terms of the projection-operator formalism, according to which the system\nunder study is considered to be comprised of a localized region ($Q$), embedded\ninto a well-defined environment ($P$) of scattering wavefunctions (with\n$Q+P=1$). The $Q$ subspace must be treated using the concepts of non-Hermitian\nphysics, and of particular interest here is: the capacity of the environment to\nmediate a coupling between the different states of $Q$; the role played by the\npresence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectra of OQSs; the influence of\nEPs on the rigidity of the wavefunction phases, and; the ability of EPs to\ninitiate a dynamical phase transition (DPT). DPTs occur when the quantum\ndynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically\nconnected states, as a function of some external control parameter. In addition\nto discussing experiments on mesoscopic quantum point contacts, we also review\nmanifestations of DPTs in mesoscopic devices and other systems. Other possible\nmanifestations of this phenomenon are presented. From these discussions a\ngeneric picture of OQSs emerges in which the environmentally-mediated coupling\nbetween different quantum states plays a critical role in governing the system\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 12:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 17:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

S-EDPF takes explicit account of the stochastic nature of paths and\nuses this to minimise in-order delivery delay. S-EDPF also takes account of\nFEC, jointly scheduling transmission of information and coded packets and in\nthis way allows lossy links to reduce delay and improve resiliency, rather than\ndegrading performance as usually occurs with existing multipath systems.

In the process we\ndefine a new family of designs whose existence is implied by the existence of\n$q$-Steiner systems, but could exist even if the related $q$-Steiner systems do\nnot exist.\n  The method is based on a possible system obtained by puncturing all the\nsubspaces of the $q$-Steiner system several times. We define the punctured\nsystem as a new type of design and enumerate the number of subspaces of various\ntypes that it might have. It will be evident that its existence does not imply\nthe existence of the related $q$-Steiner system. On the other hand, this type\nof design demonstrates how close can we get to the related $q$-Steiner system.\n  Necessary conditions for the existence of such designs are presented. These\nnecessary conditions will be also necessary conditions for the existence of the\nrelated $q$-Steiner system. Trivial and nontrivial direct constructions and a\nnontrivial recursive construction for such designs, are given. Some of the\ndesigns have a symmetric structure, which is uniform in the dimensions of the\nexisting subspaces in the system. Most constructions are based on this uniform\nstructure of the design or its punctured designs.

Complex, multi-factorial models are commonly used to study\nmorphogenesis. It is difficult to understand the relation between the\nuncertainty in the input and the output of such `black-box' models, giving rise\nto the need for sensitivity analysis tools. In this paper, we introduce a\nworkflow for a global sensitivity analysis approach to study the impact of\nsingle parameters and the interactions between them on the output of\nmorphogenesis models. To demonstrate the workflow, we used a published,\nwell-studied model of vascular morphogenesis. The parameters of the model\nrepresent cell properties and behaviors that drive the mechanisms of angiogenic\nsprouting. The global sensitivity analysis correctly identified the dominant\nparameters in the model, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the\nanalysis provides information on the relative impact of single parameters and\nof interactions between them. The uncertainty in the output of the model was\nlargely caused by single parameters. The parameter interactions, although of\nlow impact, provided new insights in the mechanisms of \\emph{in silico}\nsprouting. Finally, the analysis indicated that the model could be reduced by\none parameter. We propose global sensitivity analysis as an alternative\napproach to study and validate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. Comparison of\nthe ranking of the impact of the model parameters to knowledge derived from\nexperimental data and validation of manipulation experiments can help to\nfalsify models and to find the operand mechanisms in morphogenesis. The\nworkflow is applicable to all `black-box' models, including high-throughput\n\\emph{in vitro} models in which an output measure is affected by a set of\nexperimental perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 13:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 12:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

Crossmodal enhancement is commonly expressed as a proportion of\nthe strongest unisensory response. However, being responsive to multiple\nsensory modalities does not guarantee that a neuron has actually engaged in\nintegrating its multiple sensory inputs, rather than simply responding to the\nmost salient stimulus. Here, we propose an alternative index measuring by how\nmuch the crossmodal response surpasses the level obtainable by optimally\ncombining the unisensory responses. Optimality is defined by probability\nsummation combining the unisensory responses under maximal negative stochastic\ndependence. The new index is analogous to measuring crossmodal enhancement by\nthe amount of violation of the \"race model inequality\", which is widely used in\nreaction time studies of multisensory integration. Neurons previously labeled\nas \"multisensory\" may lose that property since the new index tends to be\nsmaller than the traditional one. This is exemplified with a data set collected\nfrom single SC neurons. The new easy-to-compute index does not require any\nspecific distributional assumption.

Sequential Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) has been shown to be a promising approach to target tracking in\ncomplex environments, especially when dealing with clutter. However, a large\nnumber of measurements usually results in large processing requirements. This\npaper goes beyond the current state-of-the-art and presents a novel Sequential\nMCMC approach that can overcome this challenge through adaptively subsampling\nthe set of measurements. Instead of using the whole large volume of available\ndata, the proposed algorithm performs a trade off between the number of\nmeasurements to be used and the desired accuracy of the estimates to be\nobtained in the presence of clutter.

In this work, we complement the information collected in the\ncm band for our previously presented sample of radio loud BAL QSOs with new\nobservations at m and mm bands. Our aim is to verify the presence of old,\nextended radio components in the MHz range, and probe the emission of dust\n(linked to star formation) in the mm domain. We observed 5 sources from our\nsample, already presenting hints of low-frequency emission, with the GMRT at\n235 and 610 MHz. Other 17 sources (more than half the sample) were observed\nwith bolometer cameras at IRAM-30m and APEX. All sources observed with the GMRT\npresent extended emission at a scale of tens of kpc. In some cases these\nmeasurements allow us to identify a second component in the SED, at frequencies\nbelow 1.4 GHz, beyond the one already studied in the GHz domain. In the\nmm-band, only one source shows emission clearly ascribable to dust. Upper\nlimits were obtained for the remaining targets. These findings confirm that BAL\nQSOs can also be present in old radio sources, or even in restarting ones,\nwhere favourable conditions for the outflow launching/acceleration are present.\nA suggestion that these outflows could be precursors of the jet comes from the\nfact that ~70% of our sample can be considered in a GigaHertz Peaked Spectrum\n(GPS) or Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS)+GPS phase. This would confirm the idea\nproposed by other authors that these outflows could be recollimated to form the\njet. Comparing with previous works in the literature, dust emission seems to be\nweaker than the what expected in 'normal' QSOs, suggesting that a feedback\nmechanism could inhibit star formation in radio-loud BAL QSOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 15:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Motivated by the prosperity of\nmultilayer approach in social, transport or trade systems, we propose the\nintroduction of multilayer networks for language. The multilayer network of\nlanguage is a unified framework for modeling linguistic subsystems and their\nstructural properties enabling the exploration of their mutual interactions.\nVarious aspects of natural language systems can be represented as complex\nnetworks, whose vertices depict linguistic units, while links model their\nrelations. The multilayer network of language is defined by three aspects: the\nnetwork construction principle, the linguistic subsystem and the language of\ninterest. More precisely, we construct a word-level (syntax, co-occurrence and\nits shuffled counterpart) and a subword level (syllables and graphemes) network\nlayers, from five variations of original text (in the modeled language). The\nobtained results suggest that there are substantial differences between the\nnetworks structures of different language subsystems, which are hidden during\nthe exploration of an isolated layer. The word-level layers share structural\nproperties regardless of the language (e.g. Croatian or English), while the\nsyllabic subword level expresses more language dependent structural properties.\nThe preserved weighted overlap quantifies the similarity of word-level layers\nin weighted and directed networks. Moreover, the analysis of motifs reveals a\nclose topological structure of the syntactic and syllabic layers for both\nlanguages. The findings corroborate that the multilayer network framework is a\npowerful, consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic\nsubsystems simultaneously and hence to provide a more unified view on language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 15:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

In particular, from the marginals of these\ncomponents, we obtain an analytical formula for the position and momentum\nprobability distributions in presence of decoherence, that show a diffusive\nbehavior for large values of the decoherence parameter. These features limit\nthe dynamics of the present model. We also observe the decay of the\nnon-diagonal terms with time, and use this fact to quantify the amount of\ndecoherence, from the norm of those terms in phase space. From here, we can\ndefine a decoherence time scale, which differs from previous results that make\nuse of the same model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 15:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

Molecular experiments are providing rapid and systematic\napproaches to search for biomarkers, but because single-molecule biomarkers\nhave shown a disappointing lack of robustness for clinical diagnosis,\nresearchers have begun searching for distinctive sets of molecules, called\n\"biosignatures\". However, the most popular statistics are not appropriate for\ntheir identification, and the number of possible biosignatures to be tested is\nfrequently intractable. In the present work, we developed a \"multivariate\nfilter\" using genetic algorithms (GA) as a feature (gene) selector to optimize\na measure of intra-group cohesion and inter-group dispersion. This method was\nimplemented using Python and R (pyBioSig, available at\nhttps://github.com/fredgca/pybiosig under LGPL) and can be manipulated via\ngraphical interface or Python scripts. Using it, we were able to identify\nputative biosignatures composed by just a few genes and capable of recovering\nmultiple groups simultaneously in a hierarchical clustering, even ones that\nwere not recovered using the whole transcriptome, within a feasible length of\ntime using a personal computer. Our results allowed us to conclude that using\nGA to optimize our new intra-group cohesion and inter-group dispersion measure\nis a clear, effective, and computationally feasible strategy for the\nidentification of putative \"omical\" biosignatures that could support\ndiscrimination among multiple groups simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 14:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-03"}

How many\nqueries does a querying adversary need to submit in order to distinguish the\ntruncated permutation from a random function?\n  In 1998, Hall et al. showed an algorithm for determining (with high\nprobability) whether or not $f$ is a permutation, using $O(2^{\\frac{m+n}{2}})$\nqueries.

With quantitative scientists\nfrom computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from\nbiology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network\nscience serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major\ngoals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological\ngraph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from\nthe same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure.\nHowever, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically\nimplies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this\ngap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a\ngeneral introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work\ndevoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major\nchallenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node\nsubgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may\nparticipate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle,\na novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic\nbuilding blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs -\nsubgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at\nrandom - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs.\nFinally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical\nprocesses acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs\nimpose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a\nlarger network structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 13:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}
