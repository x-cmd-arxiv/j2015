In this paper, the strain-dependent thermal conductivity of monolayer\nsilicene under uniform bi-axial tension is computed by solving the phonon\nBoltzmann transport equation with force constants extracted from\nfirst-principles calculations. Unlike the commonly believed understanding that\nthermal conductivity only slightly decreases with increased tensile strain for\nbulk materials, it is found that the thermal conductivity of silicene first\nincreases dramatically with strain and then slightly decreases when the applied\nstrain increases further. At a tensile strain of 4%, the highest thermal\nconductivity is found to be about 7.5 times that of unstrained one. Such an\nunusual strain dependence is mainly attributed to the dramatic enhancement in\nthe acoustic phonon lifetime.

In this paper, we study relative t-designs in H(n,2),\nputting emphasis on Fisher type inequalities and the existence of tight\nrelative t-designs. We mostly consider relative t-designs on two shells. We\nprove that if the weight function is constant on each shell of a relative\nt-design on two shells then the subset in each shell must be a combinatorial\n(t-1)-design. This is a generalization of the result of Kageyama who proved\nthis under the stronger assumption that the weight function is constant on the\nwhole block set. Using this, we define tight relative t-designs for odd t, and\na strong restriction on the possible parameters of tight relative t-designs in\nH(n,2). We obtained a new family of such tight relative t-designs, which were\nunnoticed before. We will give a list of feasible parameters of such relative\n3-designs with n up to 100, and then we discuss the existence and/or the\nnon-existence of such tight relative 3-designs.

However, distance metric learning requires the\nlearned metric to be a PSD matrix, which is computational expensive and not\nnecessary for retrieval ranking problem. On the other hand, the bilinear model\nis shown to be more flexible for large-scale image retrieval task, hence, we\nadopt it to learn a matrix for estimating pairwise similarities under the\nregression framework.

A well known general region for this\nproblem is due to Venkataramani, Kramer and Goyal (VKG) [1]. Their encoding\nscheme is an extension of the El-Gamal-Cover (EC) and Zhang- Berger (ZB) coding\nschemes to the L channel case and includes a combinatorial number of refinement\ncodebooks, one for each subset of the descriptions. As in ZB, the scheme also\nallows for a single common codeword to be shared by all descriptions. This\npaper proposes a novel encoding technique involving Combinatorial Message\nSharing (CMS), where every subset of the descriptions may share a distinct\ncommon message. This introduces a combinatorial number of shared codebooks\nalong with the refinement codebooks of [1]. We derive an achievable\nrate-distortion region for the proposed technique, and show that it subsumes\nthe VKG region for general sources and distortion measures. We further show\nthat CMS provides a strict improvement of the achievable region for any source\nand distortion measures for which some 2-description subset is such that ZB\nachieves points outside the EC region. We then show a more surprising result:\nCMS outperforms VKG for a general class of sources and distortion measures,\nincluding scenarios where the ZB and EC regions coincide for all 2-description\nsubsets. In particular, we show that CMS strictly improves on VKG, for the\nL-channel quadratic Gaussian MD problem, for all L greater than or equal to 3,\ndespite the fact that the EC region is complete for the corresponding\n2-descriptions problem. Using the encoding principles derived, we show that the\nCMS scheme achieves the complete rate-distortion region for several asymmetric\ncross-sections of the L-channel quadratic Gaussian MD problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 06:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

Among the uncertainties in RANS\nsimulations, the model-form uncertainty is an important or even a dominant\nsource. Therefore, quantifying and reducing the model-form uncertainties in\nRANS simulations are of critical importance to make risk-informed decisions.\nResearchers in statistics communities have made efforts on this issue by\nconsidering numerical models as black boxes. However, this physics-neutral\napproach is not a most efficient use of data, and is not practical for most\nengineering problems.

For the $K-$user\ninterference channel using different changing patterns between different users,\nwe propose several methods to align some parts of interferences and to increase\nwhat is achieved by time sharing method. For more practical case when all the\nchannel links connected to the same destination have the same changing pattern,\nwe find an upper-bound and analyze it for the large interference channel\nnetwork. This result shows that when the size of the network increases, the\nupper-bound value goes to $\\frac{\\sqrt{K}}{2}$. For the fast fading channel\nwhen all the channels have the same changing pattern, we show that when the\ndirect links have different characteristic functions (channel permutation or\nmemory), in the absence of half part of CSI (cross links) at both transmitters\nand receivers, one can achieve $K/2$ degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Also by the\nconverse proof we show that this is the minimum channel information to achieve\nmaximum DoF of $\\frac{K}{2}$.

In other words, for the 3-user fully connected interference\nchannel we find out while $\\frac{3}{2}$ lies in achievable DoF, we don't need\nto know half part of the CSI.

The post-processing method is needed because of spurious\ndivergence growth at element interfaces due to the discontinuous nature of the\ndiscretization used. This spurious divergence eventually leads to a numerical\ninstability. Previous work has shown that a discontinuous element-local\nprojection onto the space of divergence-free basis functions is capable of\nstabilizing the projection method, but the discontinuity inherent in this\ntechnique may lead to instability in under-resolved simulations. By enforcing\ninter-element discontinuity and requiring a divergence-free result in the weak\nsense only, a new post-processing technique is developed that simultaneously\nimproves smoothness and reduces divergence in the pressure-projected velocity\nfield at the same time.

The key idea behind game-theoretic approach\nto network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where\nthe value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties.\nNext, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen\ngame-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as\nthe payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of\ngame-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according\nto their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role\nplayed by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is\nthat the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally\nchallenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a\nwide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in\npolynomial time. Our focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and\nits various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues.\nFurthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in\nconnectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it. Finally, we analyse\ncomputational properties of generalized version of cooperative games in which\norder of player matters. We propose a new representation for such games, called\ngeneralized marginal contribution networks, that allows for polynomial\ncomputation in the size of the representation of two dedicated extensions of\nthe Shapley value to this class of games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 09:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

The idea is to transform\na nondeterministic-polynomial-hard ground state simulation with infinite\ndegrees of freedom into a single optimization problem of a local function with\nfinite number of physical and ancillary degrees of freedom. This work\ncontributes mainly in the following aspects: 1) AOP provides a simple and\nefficient scheme to simulate the ground state by solving a local optimization\nproblem. Its solution contains two kinds of boundary states, one of which play\nthe role of the entanglement bath that mimic the interactions between a\nsupercell and the infinite environment, and the other give the ground state in\na tensor network (TN) form. 2) In the sense of TN, a novel decomposition named\nas tensor ring decomposition (TRD) is proposed to implement AOP. Instead of\nfollowing the contraction-truncation scheme used by many existing TN-based\nalgorithms, TRD solves the contraction of a uniform TN in an opposite clue by\nencoding the contraction in a set of self-consistent equations that\nautomatically reconstruct the whole TN, making the simulation simple and\nunified; 3) AOP inherits and develops the ideas of different well-established\nmethods, including the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), infinite\ntime-evolving block decimation (iTEBD), network contractor dynamics, density\nmatrix embedding theory, and etc., providing a unified perspective that is\npreviously missing in this fields; 4) AOP as well as TRD gives novel\nimplications to existing TN-based algorithms: a modified iTEBD is suggested and\nthe 2D AOP is argued to be an intrinsic 2D extension of DMRG that is based on\ninfinite projected entangled pair state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 11:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 16:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 20:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 07:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 08:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}
