Tewari et al.,\narXiv:1503.05057v1], where the suppression of phase coherence of a\nsingle-electron wave packet created at the edge of a quantum Hall (QH) system\nat filling factor 2 has been investigated with the help of an electronic\nMach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer. The authors of the experiment have observed\nan unexpected behavior of phase coherence, that saturates at high energies\ninstead of vanishing, presumably suggesting the relaxation of a wave packet to\nthe ground state before it arrives to the MZ interferometer. Here, we\ntheoretically investigate this situation using the model of edge states [I. P.\nLevkivskyi, E. V. Sukhorukov, Phys. Rev. B 78, 045322 (2008)], which accounts\nfor the strong Coulomb interaction between the two electron channels at the\nedge of a QH system. We conclude that the observed phenomenon cannot be\nexplained within this model for the reason that under an assumption of\nlinearity of the electron spectrum at low energies the system remains\nintegrable in terms of the collective charge excitations, and therefore full\nrelaxation to the ground state is not possible, despite strong interactions. As\na result, the degree of the phase coherence decreases with energy of the\ninitial state in a power-law manner. Since this does not happen in the\nexperiment, a new physical phenomenon may take place at the edge of a QH state,\nwhich deserves further investigations. We support our findings by calculating\nthe energy distribution and the Wigner function of the outgoing non-equilibrium\nstate of the single-electron wave packet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 16:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 19:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

For the efficient operation of HCNs it is\nessential that the high power macrocell shuts off its transmissions for an\nappropriate amount of time in order for the low power small cells to transmit.\nThis is a mechanism that allows time-domain resource partitioning (TDRP) and is\ncritical to be optimized for maximizing the throughput of the complete HCN. In\nthis paper, we investigate video communication in HCNs when TDRP is employed.\nAfter defining a detailed system model for video streaming in such a HCN, we\nconsider the problem of maximizing the experienced video quality at all the\nusers, by jointly optimizing the TDRP for the HCN, the rate allocated to each\nspecific user, and the selected video quality transmitted to a user.

Typical processing steps\nperformed at the server include keypoint detection, descriptor calculation, and\nfeature matching. Video compression has been shown to have an adverse effect on\nfeature-matching performance. The negative impact of compression can be reduced\nby using the keypoints extracted from the uncompressed video to calculate\ndescriptors from the compressed video. Based on this observation, we propose to\nprovide these keypoints to the server as side information and to extract only\nthe descriptors from the compressed video. First, we introduce four different\nframe types for keypoint encoding to address different types of changes in\nvideo content. These frame types represent a new scene, the same scene, a\nslowly changing scene, or a rapidly moving scene and are determined by\ncomparing features between successive video frames. Then, we propose Intra,\nSkip and Inter modes of encoding the keypoints for different frame types. For\nexample, keypoints for new scenes are encoded using the Intra mode, and\nkeypoints for unchanged scenes are skipped. As a result, the bitrate of the\nside information related to keypoint encoding is significantly reduced.\nFinally, we present pairwise matching and image retrieval experiments conducted\nto evaluate the performance of the proposed approach using the Stanford mobile\naugmented reality dataset and 720p format videos. The results show that the\nproposed approach offers significantly improved feature matching and image\nretrieval performance at a given bitrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 17:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

Greedy BST is known to be equivalent\nto a maximally greedy (but inherently offline) algorithm introduced\nindependently by Lucas in 1988 and Munro in 2000, conjectured to be dynamically\noptimal.\n  With the application of forbidden-submatrix theory, we prove a quasilinear\nupper bound on the performance of Greedy BST on deque sequences.

Currently neither splay trees, nor other\ngeneral-purpose BST algorithms are known to fulfill this requirement. As a\nspecial case, we show that Greedy BST can serve output-restricted deque\nsequences in linear time. A similar result is known for splay trees (Tarjan,\n1985; Elmasry, 2004).\n  As a further application of the insert-delete model, we give a simple proof\nthat, given a set U of permutations of [n], the access cost of any BST\nalgorithm is Omega(log |U| + n) on \"most\" of the permutations from U. In\nparticular, this implies that the access cost for a random permutation of [n]\nis Omega(n log n) with high probability.\n  Besides the splay tree noted before, Greedy BST has recently emerged as a\nplausible candidate for dynamic optimality.

This transition probability gives an optimal approximation to the\nfundamental quantum Zeno effect (which corresponds to continuous measurements)\nby a fixed number of discrete measurements. The difficulty for the analysis is\nthat the transition probability as a function of time instants has a huge\nnumber of local maxima. We resolve this problem both analytically by asymptotic\nanalysis and numerically by the development of efficient algorithms mainly\nbased on the dynamic programming. The proposed numerical methods can be\napplied, besides this problem, to a wide class of measurement-based optimal\ncontrol problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 19:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

This phenomenon has been\nextensively studied in the linear response regime, i.e., when the average drift\nvelocity of the electrons is a small fraction of the Fermi velocity. Here we\ninvestigate the phenomenon in the nonlinear regime, meaning that the average\ndrift velocity is comparable to, or exceeds the Fermi velocity. This regime is\nrealized when the electric field is very large, or when electron-impurity\nscattering is very weak. The quantum kinetic equation for the density matrix of\nnoninteracting electrons is exactly and analytically solvable, reducing to a\nproblem of spin dynamics for \"unpaired\" electrons near the Fermi surface. The\ncrucial parameter is $\\gamma=eEL_s/E_F$, where $E$ is the electric field, $e$\nis the absolute value of the electron charge, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy, and\n$L_s = \\hbar/(2m\\alpha)$ is the spin-precession length in the Rashba spin-orbit\nfield with coupling strength $\\alpha$.

To improve the stability of stochastic gradient,\nrecent years have witnessed the proposal of several semi-stochastic gradient\ndescent algorithms, which distinguish themselves from standard SGD by\nincorporating global information into gradient computation. In this paper we\ncontribute a novel stratified semi-stochastic gradient descent (S3GD) algorithm\nto this nascent research area, accelerating the optimization of a large family\nof composite convex functions. Though theoretically converging faster, prior\nsemi-stochastic algorithms are found to suffer from high iteration complexity,\nwhich makes them even slower than SGD in practice on many datasets.

We first explore the\ncharacteristics of perturbations in polarimetric microlensing during\ncaustic-crossing of a binary lensing as follows: (a) The cooler spots over the\nGalactic bulge sources have the smaller contributions in the total flux,\nalthough they have stronger magnetic fields. (b) The maximum deviation in the\npolarimetry curve due to the spot happens when the spot is located near the\nsource edge and the source spot is first entering the caustic whereas the\nmaximum photometric deviation occurs for the spots located at the source\ncenter. (c) There is a (partial) degeneracy for indicating spot's size, its\ntemperature contrast and its magnetic induction from the deviations in light or\npolarimetric curves.

Communities having markedly different opinions are for\nexample the Neocreationist and Intelligent Design Proponents (IDP), on one\nhand, and the Darwinian Evolution Defenders (DED), on the other hand. The case\nof knowledge diffusion within such communities is studied here on a network\nbased on an adjacency matrix built from time ordered selected quotations of\nagents, whence for inter- and intra-communities. The network is intrinsically\ndirected and not necessarily reciprocal. Thus, the adjacency matrices have\ncomplex eigenvalues, the eigenvectors present complex components. A\nquantification of the slow-down or speed-up effects of information diffusion in\nsuch temporal networks, with non-Markovian contact sequences, can be made by\ncomparing the real time dependent (directed) network to its counterpart, the\ntime aggregated (undirected) network, - which has real eigenvalues. In order to\ndo so, small world networks which both contain an $odd$ number of nodes are\nstudied and compared to similar networks with an $even$ number of nodes.\n  It is found that (i) the diffusion of knowledge is more difficult on the\nlargest networks, (ii) the network size influences the slowing-down or\nspeeding-up diffusion process. Interestingly, it is observed that (iii) the\ndiffusion of knowledge is slower in IDP and faster in DED communities. It is\nsuggested that the finding can be \"rationalized\", if some \"scientific quality\"\nand \"publication habit\" is attributed to the agents, as common sense would\nguess. This finding offers some opening discussion toward tying scientific\nknowledge to belief.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 09:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

While states in canonical loop quantum gravity,\nin the traditional continuum setting, are based on graphs with vertices of\narbitrary valence, group field theories have been defined so far in a\nsimplicial setting such that states have support only on graphs of fixed\nvalency. This has led to the question whether group field theory can indeed\ncover the whole state space of loop quantum gravity. In this contribution based\non [1] I present two new classes of group field theories which satisfy this\nobjective: i) a straightforward, but rather formal generalization to multiple\nfields, one for each valency and ii) a simplicial group field theory which\neffectively covers the larger state space through a dual weighting, a technique\ncommon in matrix and tensor models. To this end I will further discuss in some\ndetail the combinatorial structure of the complexes generated by the group\nfield theory partition function. The new group field theories do not only\nstrengthen the links between the mentioned quantum gravity approaches but,\nbroadening the theory space of group field theories, they might also prove\nuseful in the investigation of renormalizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 11:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

We tracked\nindividual flies that eclosed in a small (45mm) arena containing a piece of\nfruit, connected to a larger (130mm) arena by a wide (5mm) doorway. Using this\nsetup we show that the widely open doorway initially functions as a barrier:\nthe likelihood of entering the large arena increases gradually, requiring\nrepeated approaches to the doorway, and even after entering the flies\nimmediately return. Gradually the flies acquire the option to avoid returning,\nspending more relative time and performing relatively longer excursions in the\nlarge arena.

The query time of the Thorup-Zwick's oracle is $O(k)$, and it was\nsubsequently improved to $O(1)$ by Chechik. A major drawback of the oracle of\nThorup and Zwick is that its space is $\\Omega(n \\cdot \\log n)$. Mendel and Naor\ndevised an oracle with space $O(n^{1+1/k})$ and stretch $O(k)$, but their\noracle can only report distance estimates and not actual paths.

In 3D we find no anomaly\nof entropy appears. But the squashed cone method can not be used directly to\nget the correct result. For higher dimensions the anomaly of entropy would\nappear, still, we can not use the squashed cone method directly. That is\nbecasuse the Chern-Simons action is not gauge invariant. To get a reasonable\nresult we suggest two methods. One is by adding a boundary term to recover the\ngauge invariance. This boundary term can be derived from the variation of the\nChern-Simons action. The other one is by using the Chern-Simons relation\n$d\\bm{\\Omega_{4n-1}}=tr(\\bm{R}^{2n})$. We notice that the entropy of\n$tr(\\bm{R}^{2n})$ is a total derivative locally, i.e. $S=d s_{CS}$.

Under the right conditions the\nwave-fragments conserve their shape and velocity vectors for extended time\nperiods. We interpret the wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. When\ntwo or more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new\nwave-fragment. States of the logic variables, represented by the\nwave-fragments, are changed in the result of the collision between the\nwave-fragments. Thus, a logical gate is implemented. Several theoretical\ndesigns and experimental laboratory implementations of Boolean logic gates have\nbeen proposed in the past but little has been done cascading the gates into\nbinary arithmetical circuits. We propose a unique design of a binary one-bit\nfull adder based on a fusion gate. A fusion gate is a two-input three-output\nlogical device which calculates conjunction of the input variables and\nconjunction of one input variable with negation of another input variable. The\ngate is made of three channels: two channels cross each other at an angle,\nthird channel starts at the junction. The channels contain BZ medium. When two\nexcitation wave-fragments, travelling towards each other along input channels,\ncollide at the junction they merge into a single wave-front travelling along\nthe third channel. If there is just one wave-front in the input channel, the\nfront continues its propagation undisturbed. We make a one-bit full adder by\ncascading two fusion gates.

In conformal field theories defined via sigma\nmodels into Calabi-Yau manifolds, relevant operators can be estimated, in the\npoint-particle approximation, by the low-lying spectrum of the scalar Laplacian\non the manifold. In the strict large volume limit, the standard asymptotic\nexpansion of Weyl and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel diverges with the higher-order\ncurvature invariants. We propose that it would be sufficient to find an a\npriori uniform bound on the trace of the heat kernel for large but finite\nvolume. As a first step in this direction, we then study the heat trace\nasymptotics, as well as the actual spectrum of the scalar Laplacian, in the\nvicinity of a conifold singularity. The eigenfunctions can be written in terms\nof confluent Heun functions, the analysis of which gives evidence that regions\nof large curvature will not prevent the existence of a bound of this type.

The proposed approach is implemented as a publicly available Java\napplication, with a set of APIs for the programmatic execution of experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 15:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 09:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 05:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}

To take account the effects of\nnon-commutativity, two well known non-commutative parameters, $\\theta$ and\n$\\beta,$ are introduced. It should be emphasized, the effects of $\\beta$ which\nis related to momentum sector has more key role in comparison to $\\theta$ which\nis related to space sector.

The price time series\nof a portfolio of stocks are organized in braids that effectively simulate\nquantum gates in the hypothesis of Ising anyons quantum computational model.\nFollowing the prescriptions of Ising anyons model, 1-qubit quantum gates are\nconstructed for portfolio composed of four stocks. Adding two additional stocks\nat the initial portfolio result in 2-qubits quantum gates and circuits.\nHadamard gate, Pauli gates or controlled-Z gate are some of the elementary\nquantum gates that are identified in the stock market structure. Addition of\nother pairs of stocks, that eventually represent a market index, like Dow Jones\nindustrial Average, it results in a sequence of n-qubits quantum gates that\nform a quantum code.

Named complex-length finite element method (CFEM), the\ntechnique is linked to Pade approximants that provide exponential convergence\nof the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps and thus the solution at specified points in\nthe domain.
