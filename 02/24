The Sun's internal rotation is\nfar from barotropic, however, which allows at least the theoretical possibility\nthat the Sun's thermal balance is one of radiative equilibrium in the region of\nthe tachocline near the outer boundary of the radiative zone. We show here that\n(i) the constraint of radiative equilibrium leads to a straightforward ordinary\ndifferential equation for the Sun's rotation profile, and (ii) solutions of\nthis equation can be found that, to within current levels of accuracy, closely\nresemble the rotation profile deduced from helioseismology. More generally, we\ncalculate how large a baroclinic deviation from uniform rotation is required to\nmaintain radiative equilibrium without meridional circulation throughout the\nbulk of the radiative zone. Very little deviation is required, well below\ndetectability. The feasibility of radiative equilibrium for the tachocline\nsuggests that the issue of a spreading boundary layer may be less severe than\npreviously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 16:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This is similar to that found in the south polar regions in 2002,\nin spite of what appears to be strikingly different convective activity in the\ntwo regions. Keck and HST imaging observations close to equinox imply that the\ndepletions were simultaneously present in 2007, suggesting they are persistent\nfeatures. The depletions appear to be mainly restricted to the upper\ntroposphere, with depth increasing poleward from about 30 deg N, reaching ~4\nbars at 45 deg N and perhaps much deeper at 70 deg N. The latitudinal\nvariations in degree and depth of the depletions are important constraints on\nmodels of meridional circulation. Our observations are qualitatively consistent\nwith previously suggested circulation cells in which rising methane-rich gas at\nlow latitudes is dried out by condensation and sedimentation of methane ice\nparticles as the gas ascends to altitudes above the methane condensation level,\nthen is transported to high latitudes, where it descends and brings down\nmethane depleted gas. Since this cell would seem to inhibit formation of\ncondensation clouds in regions where clouds are actually inferred from spectral\nmodelling, it suggests that sparse localized convective events may be important\nin cloud formation. The small-scale latitudinal variations we found in the\neffective methane mixing ratio between 55 deg N and 82 deg N have significant\ninverse correlations with zonal mean latitudinal variations in cloud\nreflectivity in near-IR Keck images taken before and after the HST\nobservations. If the CH4/H2 absorption ratio variations are interpreted as\nlocal variations in para fraction instead of methane mixing ratio, we find that\ndownwelling correlates with reduced cloud reflectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 16:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

A\nhitherto largely overlooked disagreement between Bohr and Heisenberg about the\nmovability of the \"cut\" between measuring apparatus and observed quantum system\nsupports the view that, for Bohr, such a cut did not originate in dynamical\n(ontological) considerations, but rather in functional (epistemological)\nconsiderations. As such, both the motivation and the target of Bohr's doctrine\nof classical concepts are of a fundamentally different nature than what is\nunderstood as the dynamical problem of the quantum-to-classical transition. Our\nanalysis suggests that, contrary to claims often found in the literature,\nBohr's doctrine is not, and cannot be, at odds with proposed solutions to the\ndynamical problem of the quantum-classical transition that were pursued by\nseveral of Bohr's followers and culminated in the development of decoherence\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 18:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

The torsion pairs in mod H correspond nicely to\nthe perpendicular pairs of exceptional subcategories and there is a wealth of\nbijections, the Ingalls-Thomas bijections, between sets of modules and\nsubcategories.\n  If H is representation-finite, one may look at the corresponding numbers of\nmodules or subcategories.

A second,\nindependent, argument based on the quantum's nonlocal entanglement with its\nmeasuring apparatus shows that the outcomes must be definite eigenvalues\nbecause of relativity's ban on instant signaling. Experiments with entangled\nphoton pairs show the MS to be a non-paradoxical superposition of correlations\nbetween states rather than a \"Schrodinger's cat\" superposition of states.\nNature's measurement strategy is to shift the superposition--the\ncoherence--from the detected quantum to the correlations between the quantum\nand its detector, allowing both subsystems to collapse locally to mixtures of\ndefinite eigenvalues.

Although oxygen is an important tracer of Galactic chemical\nevolution, measurements of its abundance in the atmospheres of the oldest\nGalactic stars are still scarce and rather imprecise. At the lowest end of the\nmetallicity scale, oxygen can only be measured in giant stars and in most of\ncases such measurements rely on a single forbidden [O I] 630 nm line that is\nvery weak and frequently blended with telluric lines. Although molecular OH\nlines located in the ultraviolet and infrared could also be used for the\ndiagnostics, oxygen abundances obtained from the OH lines and the [O I] 630 nm\nline are usually discrepant to a level of ~0.3-0.4 dex. Aims. We study the\ninfluence of convection on the formation of the infrared (IR) OH lines and the\nforbidden [O I] 630 nm line in the atmospheres of extremely metal-poor (EMP)\nred giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\nratio spectra of four EMP red giant stars obtained with the VLT CRIRES\nspectrograph. For each EMP star, 4-14 IR OH vibrational-rotational lines\nlocated in the spectral range of 1514-1548 and 1595-1632 nm were used to\ndetermine oxygen abundances by employing standard 1D LTE abundance analysis\nmethodology. We then corrected the 1D LTE abundances obtained from each\nindividual OH line for the 3D hydrodynamical effects. Results. We find that the\ninfluence of convection on the formation of [O I] 630 nm line in the\natmospheres of EMP giants studied here is minor, which leads to very small\n3D-1D abundance corrections (< -0.01 dex). On the contrary, IR OH lines are\nstrongly affected by convection and thus the abundance corrections for these\nlines are significant, 3D-1D ~ -0.2 ... -0.3 dex. These abundance corrections\ndo indeed bring the 1D LTE oxygen abundances of EMP red giants obtained using\nIR OH lines into better agreement with those determined from the [O I] 630 nm\nline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 20:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on\nwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so\nquickly enough.

It is particularly important for planets with intermediate masses\nsusceptible to Type III-like migration. For some observed transition disks or\ndisks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses based\non the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient.

These\ntrends are consistent with theoretical models in which softer ionizing continua\nreduce overionization, and allow radiative acceleration of faster BAL outflows.\n(iii) As $\\alpha_{\\rm UV}$ becomes bluer, the distribution of $v_{\\rm md}$\nextends to larger values. This trend may imply faster outflows at higher\nlatitudes above the accretion disc plane. (iv) For non-BALQs, the C IV emission\nline decreases with decreasing He II EW, and becomes more asymmetric and\nblueshifted. This suggests an increasing relative contribution of emission from\nthe BAL outflow to the C IV emission line as the ionizing spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) gets softer, which is consistent with the increasing\nfraction of BALQs as the ionizing SED gets softer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The brown dwarf\n2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5)\ndetected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the\nArecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar\nto those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse\nperiodicity; previous VLA observations detected quiescent emission a factor of\n~100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we\npresent 14 hours of Very Large Array observations of this object that reveal a\nseries of pulses at ~6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the\npulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared\nto the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of ~1.77 hr and identify it\nwith the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in\na late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10\nGHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2M 1047+21 reaches\nat least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly-rotating\nradio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those\nof other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields\nand radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this\nkind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and\nmagnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both\ntheories and observational data are currently scarce.\n  A video of a short talk discussing this work is at\nhttp://youtu.be/OqCtFxcBB2s, and an experimental Web-native version of the\npaper may be viewed at http://purl.org/net/pkgwpub/goreham.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

Physical effects of HTAs become most\ntransparent upon analytic continuation in $n_f$ to non-integer number of\nflavors, reducing in the integer $n_f$ limit to a $\\mathbb Z_2$ valued phase\ndifference between dominant saddles. In ${\\cal N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory we\ndemonstrate the microscopic mechanism for the vanishing of the gluon\ncondensate. The same effect leads to an anomalously small condensate in a\nQCD-like $SU(N)$ gauge theory with fermions in the two-index representation.\nThe basic phenomenon is that, contrary to folklore, the gluon condensate can\nreceive both positive and negative contributions in a semi-classical expansion.\nIn quantum mechanics, a HTA leads to a difference in semi-classical expansion\nof integer and half-integer spin particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 21:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

However, a general theory\nof trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g., species\nthat differ in size) and gradients (e.g., temperature), has yet to be\nformulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory\nprovides the basis for such a theory it does not explicitly account for\ndifferences traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal\ntemperature for growth.

Based on such\nconsiderations, it is demonstrated in the paper that the hypothesis of the\nisomorphism existing between state vectors and elements of the reality is\nexpected to be unsuitable for a generic quantum system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 02:39:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 13:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

In\nrecent visualization experiments nonuniform laminar flows of the normal fluid,\nnamely, Hagen-Poiseuille flow and tail-flattened flow, have been observed.\nTail-flattened flow is a novel laminar flow in which the outer part of the\nHagen-Poiseuille flow becomes flat.

This work\naddresses a square channel to obtain important physics not revealed in the\npreceding numerical works.

The\nvortex tangle shows a characteristic space-time oscillation. Under\ntail-flattened flow, the nature of the quantum turbulence depends strongly on\nthat flatness. Vortex line density increases significantly as the profile\nbecomes flatter, being saturated above a certain flatness. The inhomogeneity is\nsignificantly reduced in comparison to the case of Hagen-Poiseuille flow.\nInvestigating the behavior of quantized vortices reveals that tail-flattened\nflow is an intermedi- ate state between Hagen-Poiseuille flow and uniform flow.\nIn both profiles we obtain a characteristic inhomogeneity in the physical\nquantities, which suggests that a boundary layer of superfluid appears near a\nsolid boundary.

This latter\nscheme has applications in diversified settings such as in reducing bandwidth\nof certificate chains and in secure routing protocols. Lu, Ostrovsky, Sahai,\nShacham, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2006) presented the first sequential aggregate\nsignature scheme in the standard model.

This technique\ncannot directly provide an aggregate signature scheme since, as we observed,\nadditional elements should be published in a public key to support aggregation.\nThus, our constructions are careful augmentation techniques for the dual system\ntechnique to allow it to support sequential aggregate signature schemes.

We demonstrate our method in a certain\nfamily of Hamiltonian systems of isomonodromy type including the sixth Painleve\nequation and Garnier systems; particularly, we present their solutions written\nin terms of iterated hypergeometric integrals. An algorithm for constructing\nthe Schlesinger transformations is also discussed through vector continued\nfractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 06:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 01:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

Most likely, these oscillations are caused by\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations of flaring loops which modulate the\nemission. Interpretation of the observations requires comparing them with\nsimulations. We simulate the gyrosynchrotron radio emission from a\nsemi-circular (toroidal-shaped) magnetic loop containing sausage-mode MHD\noscillations. The aim is to detect the observable signatures specific to the\nconsidered MHD mode and to study their dependence on the various source\nparameters. The MHD waves are simulated using a linear three-dimensional model\nof a magnetized plasma cylinder; both standing and propagating waves are\nconsidered. The curved loop is formed by replicating the MHD solutions along\nthe plasma cylinder and bending the cylinder; this model allows us to study the\neffect of varying the viewing angle along the loop. The radio emission is\nsimulated using a three-dimensional model and its spatial and temporal\nvariations are analyzed. We consider several loop orientations and different\nparameters of the magnetic field, plasma, and energetic electrons in the loop.\nIn the model with low plasma density, the intensity oscillations at all\nfrequencies are synchronous (with the exception of a narrow spectral region\nbelow the spectral peak). In the model with high plasma density, the emission\nat low frequencies (where the Razin effect is important) oscillates in\nanti-phase with the emissions at higher frequencies. The oscillations at high\nand low frequencies are more pronounced in different parts of the loop\n(depending on the loop orientation). The layers where the line-of-sight\ncomponent of the magnetic field changes sign can produce additional\npeculiarities in the oscillation patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 08:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Overlap fermions provide a\nlattice realisation of chiral symmetry and consequently offer a unique\nopportunity to explore the interplay of centre vortices, instantons and\ndynamical mass generation. Simulations are performed on gauge fields featuring\nthe removal of centre vortices, identified through gauge transformations\nmaximising the center of the gauge group. In contrast to previous results using\nthe staggered-fermion action, the overlap-fermion results illustrate a loss of\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking coincident with vortex removal.

Fifteen soft gamma-ray\npulsar show hard power-law spectra in the hard X-ray band and reach maximum\nluminosities typically in the MeV range. For only 7 of the 18 soft gamma-ray\npulsars pulsed emission has also been detected by the LAT, but 12 have a pulsar\nwind nebula (PWN) detected at TeV energies. For six pulsars with PWNe, we\npresent also the spectra of the total emissions at hard X-rays, and for IGR\nJ18490-0000, associated with HESS J1849-000 and PSR J1849-0001, we used our\nChandra data to resolve and characterize the contributions from the\npoint-source and PWN. Finally, we also discuss a sample of 15 pulsars which are\ncandidates for future detection of pulsed soft gamma-rays, given their\ncharacteristics at other wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 11:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In most of these applications, the number of parameters is\nlarge or perhaps even infinite. Thus, the development of numerical methods for\nthese parametric problems is faced with the possible curse of dimensionality.\nThis article is directed at (i) identifying and understanding which properties\nof parametric equations allow one to avoid this curse and (ii) developing and\nanalyzing effective numerical methodd which fully exploit these properties and,\nin turn, are immune to the growth in dimensionality. The first part of this\narticle studies the smoothness and approximability of the solution map, that\nis, the map $a\\mapsto u(a)$ where $a$ is the parameter value and $u(a)$ is the\ncorresponding solution to the PDE. It is shown that for many relevant\nparametric PDEs, the parametric smoothness of this map is typically holomorphic\nand also highly anisotropic in that the relevant parameters are of widely\nvarying importance in describing the solution. These two properties are then\nexploited to establish convergence rates of $n$-term approximations to the\nsolution map for which each term is separable in the parametric and physical\nvariables. These results reveal that, at least on a theoretical level, the\nsolution map can be well approximated by discretizations of moderate\ncomplexity, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality is broken. This\ntheoretical analysis is carried out through concepts of approximation theory\nsuch as best $n$-term approximation, sparsity, and $n$-widths. These notions\ndetermine a priori the best possible performance of numerical methods and thus\nserve as a benchmark for concrete algorithms. The second part of this article\nturns to the development of numerical algorithms based on the theoretically\nestablished sparse separable approximations. The numerical methods studied fall\ninto two general categories. The first uses polynomial expansions in terms of\nthe parameters to approximate the solution map. The second one searches for\nsuitable low dimensional spaces for simultaneously approximating all members of\nthe parametric family. The numerical implementation of these approaches is\ncarried out through adaptive and greedy algorithms. An a priori analysis of the\nperformance of these algorithms establishes how well they meet the theoretical\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 13:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 14:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

In single\nlayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) the lack of inversion\nsymmetry, combined with a large spin-orbit interaction, leads to a conduction\n(valence) band with different spin-polarized minima (maxima) having equal\nenergies. This offers the opportunity to manipulate information at the level of\nthe charge (electrons or holes), spin (up or down) and crystal momentum\n(valley).

The observed large dispersion measure values of\nFRBs suggests an extragalactic origin and an accurate determination of their\npositions and distances will provide an unique opportunity to study the\nmagneto-ionic properties of the IGM. So far, FRBs have all been found using\nlarge dishes equipped with multi-pixel arrays. While large single dishes are\nwell-suited for the discovery of transient sources they are poor at providing\naccurate localisations. A 2D snapshot image of the sky, made with a correlation\ninterferometer array, can provide an accurate localisation of many compact\nradio sources simultaneously. However, the required time resolution to detect\nFRBs and a desire to detect them in real time, makes this currently\nimpractical. In a beamforming approach, where many narrow tied-array beams are\nproduced, the advantages of single dishes and interferometers can be combined.\nWe present a proof-of-concept analysis of a new non-imaging method that\nutilises the additional spectral and comparative spatial information obtained\nfrom multiple overlapping TABs to estimate a transient source location with up\nto arcsecond accuracy in almost real time. We show that this method can work\nfor a variety of interferometric configurations, including for LOFAR and\nMeerKAT, and that the estimated angular position may be sufficient to identify\na host galaxy without reference to other simultaneous or follow-up\nobservations. With this method, many transient sources can be localised to\nsmall fractions of a HPBW of a TAB, in the case of MeerKAT, sufficient to\nlocalise a source to arcsecond accuracy. In cases where the position is less\naccurately determined we can still significantly reduce the area that need be\nsearched for associated emission at other wavelengths and potential host\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 14:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 10:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The anomalous behavior observed for the G-mode phonon is in very good\nagreement with theoretical predictions and provides a measurement of the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant for zone-center ($\\Gamma$ point) optical\nphonons. In addition, the decrease of the integrated intensity of the 2D-mode\nfeature with increasing doping, makes it possible to determine the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant for near zone-edge (K and K' points) optical\nphonons.

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs\nhave forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a\nuniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 15:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

Thermodynamic quantities are\ncalculated from their relations with partition function which consists of\ntriple infinite summations over momentum states in each direction. To get\nanalytical expressions, summations are converted to integrals for macro systems\nby continuum approximation which fails at nanoscales. To avoid both from the\nnumerical calculation of summations and the failure of their integral\napproximations at nanoscale, a method which gives an analytical expression for\nsingle particle partition function (SPPF) is proposed.

Therefore, to represent SPPF by lower-dimensional analytical\nexpressions becomes possible rather than numerical calculation of summations.\nConsidering rectangular domains with different aspect ratios, comparison of the\nresults of derived expressions with those of summation forms of SPPF is done.\nIt's shown that analytical expressions for SPPF give very precise results with\nmaximum relative errors of around 1%, 2% and 3% at just the transition point\nfor single, double and triple transitions respectively.
