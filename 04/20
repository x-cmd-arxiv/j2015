The SBF (stars born per unit mass, time, and\nmetallicity) is the combination of the initial mass function (IMF), the\nstar-formation history (SFH), and the metallicity distribution function (MDF).\nThe framework of our analysis is that of Poisson Point Processes (PPPs), a\nclass of statistical models suitable when dealing with points (stars) in a\nmultidimensional space (the measurement space of multiple photometric bands).\nThe theory of PPPs easily accommodates the modeling of measurement errors as\nwell as that of incompleteness. Compared to most of the tools used to study\nresolved stellar populations, our method avoids binning stars in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram and uses the entirety of the information (i.e., the\nwhole likelihood function) for each data point; the proper combination of the\nindividual likelihoods allows the computation of the posterior probability for\nthe global population parameters. This includes unknowns such as the IMF slope\nand combination of SFH and MDF, which are rarely solved for simultaneously in\nthe literature, however entangled and correlated they might be. Our method also\nallows proper inclusion of nuisance parameters, such as distance and extinction\ndistributions. The aim of this paper, is to assess the validity of this new\napproach under a range of assumptions, using only simulated data. Forthcoming\nwork will show applications to real data. Although it has a broad scope of\npossible applications, we have developed this method to study multi-band HST\nobservations of the Milky Way Bulge. Therefore we will focus on simulations\nwith characteristics similar to those of the Galactic Bulge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 18:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

In this paper, we aim\nto discover visual attributes in a weakly supervised setting that is commonly\nencountered with contemporary image search engines. Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) have enjoyed remarkable success in vision applications\nrecently. However, in a weakly supervised scenario, widely used CNN training\nprocedures do not learn a robust model for predicting multiple attribute labels\nsimultaneously. The primary reason is that the attributes highly co-occur\nwithin the training data. To ameliorate this limitation, we propose\nDeep-Carving, a novel training procedure with CNNs, that helps the net\nefficiently carve itself for the task of multiple attribute prediction. During\ntraining, the responses of the feature maps are exploited in an ingenious way\nto provide the net with multiple pseudo-labels (for training images) for\nsubsequent iterations. The process is repeated periodically after a fixed\nnumber of iterations, and enables the net carve itself iteratively for\nefficiently disentangling features. Additionally, we contribute a\nnoun-adjective pairing inspired Natural Scenes Attributes Dataset to the\nresearch community, CAMIT - NSAD, containing a number of co-occurring\nattributes within a noun category. We describe, in detail, salient aspects of\nthis dataset. Our experiments on CAMIT-NSAD and the SUN Attributes Dataset,\nwith weak supervision, clearly demonstrate that the Deep-Carved CNNs\nconsistently achieve considerable improvement in the precision of attribute\nprediction over popular baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 18:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

This approach overlooks, however, that\nHerbig Ae/Be stars are in some sense much better targets to study planet\nformation processes empirically, with their disks generally being larger,\nbrighter and simply easier to observe across a large wavelength range. In\naddition, massive gas giant planets have been found on wide orbits around early\ntype stars, triggering the question if these objects did indeed form there and,\nif so, by what process. In the following I briefly review what we currently\nknow about the occurrence rate of planets around intermediate mass stars,\nbefore discussing recent results from Herbig Ae/Be stars in the context of\nplanet formation. The main emphasis is put on spatially resolved polarized\nlight images of potentially planet forming disks and how these images - in\ncombination with other data - can be used to empirically constrain (parts of)\nthe planet formation process. Of particular interest are two objects, HD100546\nand HD169142, where, in addition to intriguing morphological structures in the\ndisks, direct observational evidence for (very) young planets has been\nreported. I conclude with an outlook, what further progress we can expect in\nthe very near future with the next generation of high-contrast imagers at 8-m\nclass telescopes and their synergies with ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 20:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

While chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods provide a\npromising low-cost route for CMOS compatible, large-scale growth of materials,\nit often falls short of the high-quality demands in nanoelectronics and\noptoelectronics. We present large-scale CVD synthesis of single- and few-\nlayered MoS2 using direct vapor-phase sulfurization of MoO2, which enables us\nto obtain extremely high-quality single-crystal monolayer MoS2 samples with\nfield-effect mobility exceeding 30 cm2/Vs in monolayers. These samples can be\nreadily synthesized on a variety of substrates, and demonstrate a high-degree\nof optoelectronic uniformity in Raman and photoluminescence mapping over entire\ncrystals with areas exceeding hundreds of square micrometers. Owing to their\nhigh crystalline quality, Raman spectroscopy on these samples reveal a range of\nmulti-phonon processes through peaks with equal or better clarity compared to\npast reports on mechanically exfoliated samples. This enables us to investigate\nthe layer thickness- and substrate-dependence of the extremely weak phonon\nprocesses at 285 cm-1 and 487 cm-1 in 2D MoS2. The ultra-high,\noptoelectronic-grade crystalline quality of these samples could be further\nestablished through photocurrent spectroscopy, which clearly reveal excitonic\nstates at room temperature, a feat that has been previously demonstrated only\non device fabricated with mechanically exfoliated that were artificially\nsuspended across trenches.

Here, we report a hitherto unknown size dependence of\nthis metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effect in the nanoscale. When the\nmolecules are deposited in nanoporous anodic alumina films with exposed\naluminum at the bottom of the pores, they form organic nanowires standing on\naluminum nanoparticles whose plasmon waves have much larger amplitudes. This\nincreases the MEF strongly, resulting in several orders of magnitude increase\nin the fluorescence intensity of the organic fluorophores. The increase in\nintensity shows an inverse super-linear dependence on nanowire diameter because\nthe nanowires also act as plasmonic 'waveguides' that concentrate the plasmons\nand increase the coupling of the plasmons with the radiative modes of the\nmolecules. Furthermore, if the nanoporous template housing the nanowires has\nbuilt-in electric fields due to space charges, a strong molecule-specific red-\nor blue-shift is induced in the fluorescence peak owing to a renormalization of\nthe dipole moment of the molecule.

This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites)\nalgorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how\ninteresting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either\npositively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may\nwish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their\ncost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing,\nyet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single,\nhigh-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of\nthe search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than\nstate-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new\nalgorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular\nneural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP-\nElites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of\ninterest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse\nsolutions, and (3) improves finding a single, best solution, it will advance\nscience and engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 01:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

Every 5.5 years eta Car's light curve and spectrum change remarkably\nacross all observed wavelength bands. We compare the recent spectroscopic event\nin mid-2014 to the events in 2003 and 2009 and investigate long-term trends.\nMethods. Eta Car was observed with HST STIS, VLT UVES, and CTIO 1.5m CHIRON for\na period of more than two years in 2012-2015. Archival observations with these\ninstruments cover three orbital cycles. Results. Important spectroscopic\ndiagnostics show significant changes in 2014 compared to previous events. While\nthe timing of the first HeII 4686 flash was remarkably similar to previous\nevents, the HeII equivalent widths were slightly larger and the line flux\nincreased compared to 2003. The second HeII peak occurred at about the same\nphase as in 2009, but was stronger. The HeI line flux grew in 2009-2014\ncompared to 1998-2003. On the other hand, Halpha and FeII lines show the\nsmallest emission strengths ever observed. Conclusions. The basic character of\nthe spectroscopic events has changed in the past 2-3 cycles; ionizing UV\nradiation dramatically weakened during each pre-2014 event but not in 2014. The\nstrengthening of HeI emission and the weakening of the lower-excitation wind\nfeatures in our direct line of sight implies a substantial change in the\nphysical parameters of the emitting regions. The polar spectrum at FOS4 shows\nless changes in the broad wind emission lines, which may be explained by the\nlatitude-dependent wind structure of eta Car. The quick and strong recovery of\nthe HeII emission in 2014 supports a scenario, in which the wind-wind shock may\nnot have completely collapsed as was proposed for previous events. All this may\nbe the consequence of just one elementary change, namely a strong decrease in\nthe primary's mass-loss rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 05:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

However, it is unclear how the unique valley degree of freedom\ncombined with the strong excitonic effect influences the optical excitation.\nHere we discover a new set of optical selection rules in monolayer WS2,imposed\nby valley and exciton angular momentum. We experimentally demonstrated such a\nprinciple for second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon luminescence\n(TPL). Moreover, the two-photon induced valley populations yield net circular\npolarized photoluminescence after a sub-ps interexciton relaxation (2p->1s) and\nlast for 8 ps. The discovery of this new optical selection rule in valleytronic\n2D system not only largely extend information degrees but sets a foundation in\ncontrol of optical transitions that is crucial to valley optoeletronic device\napplications such as 2D valley-polarized light emitting diodes (LED), optical\nswitches and coherent control for quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 06:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

It is proved\nthat the system of root functions of a linear boundary value problem\nconstitutes a Riesz basis in $L^2[0,1] \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2$ provided that the\nboundary conditions are strictly regular.\n  By analogy with the case of ordinary differential equations, boundary\nconditions are called strictly regular if the eigenvalues of the corresponding\nunperturbed $(Q=0)$ operator are asymptotically simple and separated.

However under certain\nrestrictions on coefficients of the boundary linear forms we present certain\nalgebraic criteria of the strict regularity in the latter case. In particular,\nit is shown that regular separated boundary conditions are always strictly\nregular while periodic (antiperiodic) boundary conditions are strictly regular\nif and only if $b_1 + b_2 \\not = 0.$\n  The proof of the main result is based on existence of triangular\ntransformation operators for system (1).

Among them, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2)\nshows long-term stability as well as superior sensitivity enabling high\nthroughput performance. The traditional method of fabricating nanopores with\nnanometer precision is based on the use of focused electron beams in\ntransmission electron microscope (TEM). This nanopore fabrication process is\ntime-consuming, expensive, not scalable and hard to control below 1 nm. Here,\nwe exploited the electrochemical activity of MoS2 and developed a convenient\nand scalable method to controllably make nanopores in single-layer MoS2 with\nsub-nanometer precision using electrochemical reaction (ECR). The\nelectrochemical reaction on the surface of single-layer MoS2 is initiated at\nthe location of defects or single atom vacancy, followed by the successive\nremovals of individual atoms or unit cells from single-layer MoS2 lattice and\nfinally formation of a nanopore. Step-like features in the ionic current\nthrough the growing nanopore provide direct feedback on the nanopore size\ninferred from a widely used conductance vs. pore size model. Furthermore, DNA\ntranslocations can be detected in-situ when as-fabricated MoS2 nanopores are\nused. The atomic resolution and accessibility of this approach paves the way\nfor mass production of nanopores in 2D membranes for potential solid-state\nnanopore sequencing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 08:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

We consider\nthe possibility that neutrinos possess secret scalar or pseudoscalar\ninteractions mediated by the Nambu-Goldstone boson of a still unknown\nspontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry, as in, e.g. , Majoron models. In\nsuch scenarios, neutrinos still decouple at $T\\simeq 1$ MeV, but become tightly\ncoupled again ('recouple') at later stages of the cosmological evolution. We\nuse available observations of CMB anisotropies, including Planck 2013 and the\njoint BICEP2/Planck 2015 data, to derive constraints on the quantity\n$\\gamma_{\\nu \\nu}^4$, parameterizing the neutrino collision rate due to\n(pseudo)scalar interactions. We consider both a minimal extension of the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model, and scenarios with extra relativistic species or\nnon-vanishing tensors.

However, previous\nstudies have shown that the temperatures of the dust & gas may remain decoupled\neven at higher densities. We study in detail the temperatures of dust & gas in\nthe photon-dominated region S 140, especially around the deeply embedded\ninfrared sources IRS 1-3 and at the ionization front. We derive the dust\ntemperature and column density by combining Herschel PACS continuum\nobservations with SOFIA observations at 37 $\\mu$m and SCUBA at 450 $\\mu$m. We\nmodel these observations using greybody fits and the DUSTY radiative transfer\ncode. For the gas part we use RADEX to model the CO 1-0, CO 2-1, 13CO 1-0 and\nC18O 1-0 emission lines mapped with the IRAM-30m over a 4' field. Around IRS\n1-3, we use HIFI observations of single-points and cuts in CO 9-8, 13CO 10-9\nand C18O 9-8 to constrain the amount of warm gas, using the best fitting dust\nmodel derived with DUSTY as input to the non-local radiative transfer model\nRATRAN. We find that the gas temperature around the infrared sources varies\nbetween 35 and 55K and that the gas is systematically warmer than the dust by\n~5-15K despite the high gas density. In addition we observe an increase of the\ngas temperature from 30-35K in the surrounding up to 40-45K towards the\nionization front, most likely due to the UV radiation from the external star.\nFurthermore, detailed models of the temperature structure close to IRS 1 show\nthat the gas is warmer and/or denser than what we model. Finally, modelling of\nthe dust emission from the sub-mm peak SMM 1 constrains its luminosity to a few\n~10^2 Lo. We conclude that the gas heating in the S 140 region is very\nefficient even at high densities, most likely due to the deep UV penetration\nfrom the embedded sources in a clumpy medium and/or oblique shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 10:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

Compared to other sparse\nBLAS routines, an efficient parallel SpGEMM implementation has to handle extra\nirregularity from three aspects: (1) the number of nonzero entries in the\nresulting sparse matrix is unknown in advance, (2) very expensive parallel\ninsert operations at random positions in the resulting sparse matrix dominate\nthe execution time, and (3) load balancing must account for sparse data in both\ninput matrices.\n  In this work we propose a framework for SpGEMM on GPUs and emerging CPU-GPU\nheterogeneous processors. This framework particularly focuses on the above\nthree problems. Memory pre-allocation for the resulting matrix is organized by\na hybrid method that saves a large amount of global memory space and\nefficiently utilizes the very limited on-chip scratchpad memory.

Stochastic resonance (SR) has been identified to have the\npotential to tackle this problem, namely to enable non-linear systems to detect\nsmall, otherwise sub-threshold signals by means of added non-zero noise. This\nhas been demonstrated within a wide range of systems in physical, technological\nand biological contexts. Based on its ubiquitous importance, numerous\ntheoretical and technical approaches aim at an optimization of signal\ntransduction based on SR. Several quantities like mutual information,\nsignal-to-noise-ratio, or the cross-correlation between input stimulus and\nresulting detector response have been used to determine optimal noise\nintensities for SR. The fundamental shortcoming with all these measures is that\nknowledge of the signal to be detected is required to compute them. This\ndilemma prevents the use of adaptive SR procedures in any application where the\nsignal to be detected is unknown. We here show that the autocorrelation\nfunction (AC) of the detector response fundamentally overcomes this drawback.\nFor a simplified model system, the equivalence of the output AC with the\nmeasures mentioned above is proven analytically. In addition, we test our\napproach numerically for a variety of systems comprising different input\nsignals and different types of detectors. The results indicate a strong\nsimilarity between mutual information and output AC in terms of the optimal\nnoise intensity for SR. Hence, using the output AC to adaptively vary the\namount of added noise in order to maximize information transmission via SR\nmight be a fundamental processing principle in nature, in particular within\nneural systems which could be implemented in future technical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 12:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

Several approaches\nhave been proposed to integrate radius and margin for joint learning of feature\ntransformation and SVM classifier.

An alternating minimization\nmethod is adopted to solve the F-SVM model, where the feature transformation is\nupdatedvia gradient descent and the classifier is updated by employing the\nexisting SVM solver. By incorporating with kernel principal component analysis,\nF-SVM is further extended for joint learning of nonlinear transformation and\nclassifier.

The magnetic phase diagram of MnSi in applied\nmagnetic field appears to depend on the experimental setups, which is related\nto a difference in demagnetization factors arising due to the disc shape of the\nsample. The magnetic phase transition in MnSi in zero magnetic field is\nsignified by a quasi discontinuity in the c11 elastic constant, which varies\nsignificantly with magnetic field. It is notable that the region where the c11\ndiscontinuity almost vanishes closely corresponds to the extent of skyrmion\nphase along the magnetic to paramagnetic transition. This implies that the c11\nelastic constant is almost continuous through the transition from the skyrmion\nto paramagnetic phases. A recovery of the discontinuity of c11 and enhanced\nsound absorption occur at the crossing of the phase transition line and the\nline of minima in c11. The powerful fluctuations at the minima of c11 make the\nmentioned crossing point similar to a critical end point, where a second order\nphase transition meets a first order one. The skyrmion domain in the case of a\nperpendicular setup with a smaller demagnetization factor has a reduced\ntemperature range, which suggests that the magnetic field inhomogeneity plays\nan important role in the skyrmion occurrence and, hence, opens a way of\nskyrmion manipulation. The small anisotropy of the shear moduli in the (001)\nplane found in the parallel setup is most probably also caused by the magnetic\nfield inhomogeneity, which distorts the hexagonal symmetry of the skyrmion\ncrystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 13:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

Such ultrafast transition is induced by strong changes\nin the atomic potential energy surface, which trigger atomic relocation.\nHowever, heating of a material due to the electron-phonon coupling can also\nlead to a phase transition, called 'thermal melting'. This thermal melting can\noccur even if the excited-electron density is much too low to induce\nnon-thermal effects. To study phase transitions, and in particular, the\ninterplay of the thermal and nonthermal effects in silicon under a femtosecond\nx-ray irradiation, we propose their unified treatment by going beyond the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation within our hybrid model based on tight binding\nmolecular dynamics. With our extended model we identify damage thresholds for\nvarious phase transitions in irradiated silicon. We show that electron-phonon\ncoupling triggers the phase transition of solid silicon into a low-density\nliquid phase if the energy deposited into the sample is above $\\sim0.65$ eV per\natom. For the deposited doses of over $\\sim0.9$ eV per atom, solid silicon\nundergoes a phase transition into high-density liquid phase triggered by an\ninterplay between electron-phonon heating and nonthermal effects. These\nthresholds are much lower than those predicted with the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation ($\\sim2.1$ eV/atom), and indicate a significant contribution of\nelectron-phonon coupling to the relaxation of the laser-excited silicon. We\nexpect that these results will stimulate dedicated experimental studies,\nunveiling in detail various paths of structural relaxation within\nlaser-irradiated silicon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 13:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

One of the main difficulties is to\ncapture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of\nquantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic\nmachines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by\nconsidering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal\nmachine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the\nvalue of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a\nlifted weight. We do so by imposing simple operational axioms that any\nreasonable work quantifier must fulfil and by deriving from them stringent\nmathematical condition with a clear physical interpretation. Our approach\nallows us to derive much of the structure of the theory of thermodynamics\nwithout taking as a primitive the definition of work. We can derive, for any\nwork quantifier, a quantitative second law in the sense of bounding the work\nthat can be performed using some non-equilibrium resource by the work that is\nneeded to create it. We also discuss in detail the role of reversibility and\ncorrelations in connection with the second law. Furthermore, we recover the\nusual identification of work with energy in degrees of freedom with vanishing\nentropy as a particular case of our formalism. Our mathematical results can be\nformulated abstractly and are general enough to carry over to other resource\ntheories than quantum thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 13:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 14:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 08:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

An alternative approach is here\ndeveloped that relies on the comparison of subspace dimensions without a need\nto introduce thermo-majorisation used previously. Optimal single shot work for\nprocesses where a weight transfers from (a) a single energy level to another\nsingle energy level is then re-derived. In addition we discuss the final state\nof the system after work extraction and show that the system typically ends in\nits thermal state, while there are cases where the system is only close to it.\nThe work of formation in the single level transfer setting [1] is also\nre-derived. The approach presented now allows the extension of the single shot\nwork concept to work extraction (b) involving multiple final levels of the\nweight. A key conclusion here is that the single shot work for case (a) is\nappropriate only when a \\emph{resonance} of a particular energy is required.\nWhen wishing to identify \"work extraction\" with finding the weight in a\nspecific available energy or any higher energy a broadening of the single shot\nwork concept is required.
