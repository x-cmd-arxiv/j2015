Animated images provide evidence of highly\ndynamic ejecta moving near-radially in the anti-sunward direction. The bulk\nspeed of the clumps at their initial detection in the HI1-B images range from\n$200-400$ km s$^{-1}$ followed by an appreciable acceleration up to speeds of\n$450-600$ km s$^{-1}$, which are typical of slow to intermediate solar wind\nspeeds. The clump velocities do not exceed these limiting values and seem to\nreach a plateau. The images also show that the clumps do not expand as they\npropagate. Order of magnitude calculations show that ionized single atoms or\nmolecules accelerate too quickly compared to observations, while dust grains\nmicron sized or larger accelerate too slowly. We find that neutral Na, Li, K,\nor Ca atoms with $\\beta>50$ could possibly fit the observations. Just as\nlikely, we find that an interaction with the solar wind and the heliospheric\nmagnetic field (HMF) can cause the observed clump dynamical evolution,\naccelerating them quickly up to solar wind velocities.

In addition, the data\nsuggest that clump ejecta initially move along near-radial, bright structures,\nwhich then separate into HVECs and larger dust grains that steadily bend\nbackwards relative to the comet's orbital motion due to the effects of solar\nradiation and gravity. These structures gradually form new striae in the dust\ntail. The near-periodic spacing of the striae may be indicative of outgassing\nactivity modulation due to the comet nucleus' rotation. It is, however, unclear\nwhether all striae are formed as a result of this process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 16:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The\npursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the\ndiscovery of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is\npossible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single,\nunifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper'\nlearning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and\nstochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside\nof the model. We show that under surprisingly weak assumptions both conditions\nare, in a certain sense, equivalent. The central condition has a\nre-interpretation in terms of convexity of a set of pseudoprobabilities,\nlinking it to density estimation under misspecification. For bounded losses, we\nshow how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we\nprove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of\nthe Tsybakov margin condition, both of which have played a central role in\nobtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein\ncondition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more\nsuitable to deal with unbounded losses. In its stochastic mixability form, our\ncondition generalizes both a stochastic exp-concavity condition identified by\nJuditsky, Rigollet and Tsybakov and Vovk's notion of mixability. Our unifying\nconditions thus provide a substantial step towards a characterization of fast\nrates in statistical learning, similar to how classical mixability\ncharacterizes constant regret in the sequential prediction with expert advice\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 16:53:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 09:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Earlier, it was seen that the quantum interference between AFM\nspin density fluctuations and soft diffusive modes of the disordered metal is\nsuppressed, a consequence of the large-momentum scattering. The suppression of\nthis interference results in a non-singular temperature dependence of the\ncorresponding interaction correction to conductivity.

The coupling between the adatoms to a graphene\nsheet is described in the framework of tunneling Hamiltonian.

In this case the indirect exchange between the adatoms mediated by\nthe 2D carriers appears to be substantially enhanced compared to the results\nknown from Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) theory. Moreover, unlike the\nresults of RKKY calculations in the case of resonant exchange the magnetic\ncoupling between the adatoms sitting over different graphene sublattices do not\ncancel each other. Thus, for a random distribution of the magnetic adatoms over\ngraphene surface a non-zero magnetic interaction is expected.

We\ngenerate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate\nobservations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid surveys.

To overcome constraints imposed by restricted connectivity between\nqubits, a larger set of interactions can be approximated using minor embedding\ntechniques whereby several physical qubits are used to represent a single\nlogical qubit. However, minor embedding introduces new types of errors due to\nits approximate nature. We introduce and study quantum annealing correction\nschemes designed to improve the performance of quantum annealers in conjunction\nwith minor embedding, thus leading to a hybrid scheme defined over an encoded\ngraph. We argue that this scheme can be efficiently decoded using an energy\nminimization technique provided the density of errors does not exceed the\nper-site percolation threshold of the encoded graph. We test the hybrid scheme\nusing a D-Wave Two processor on problems for which the encoded graph is a\n2-level grid and the Ising model is known to be NP-hard. The problems we\nconsider are frustrated Ising model problem instances with \"planted\" (a priori\nknown) solutions. Applied in conjunction with optimized energy penalties and\ndecoding techniques, we find that this approach enables the quantum annealer to\nsolve minor embedded instances with significantly higher success probability\nthan it would without error correction. Our work demonstrates that quantum\nannealing correction can and should be used to improve the robustness of\nquantum annealing not only for natively embeddable problems, but also when\nminor embedding is used to extend the connectivity of physical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 19:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The observed elemental abundances\nand derived gas mass are in good agreement with asymptotic giant branch\nnucleosynthesis models for an initial mass of 1.90 Msun and a metallicity of\nZ=0.004. We infer that respectively about 80 %, 50 %, and 90 % of the Mg, S,\nand Fe atoms are in the solid phase. We also assessed the maximum possible\nmagnesium sulfide (MgS) and iron-rich sulfide (Fe50S) masses and tested whether\nthese species can produce the band flux of the observed 30 um feature.\nDepending on what fraction of the sulfur is in sulfide molecules such as CS, we\nconclude that MgS and Fe50S could be possible carriers of the 30 um feature in\nthis PN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 19:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'.

Our key observation is that many robots will stay in a relatively\nclosed environment (e.g. a house or an office). By constraining a robot to stay\nin a limited territory, we can ensure that the robot has seen most objects\nbefore and the speed of introducing a new object is slow. Furthermore, we can\nbuild a 3D map of the environment to reliably subtract the background to make\nrecognition easier. We propose extremely robust algorithms to obtain a 3D map\nand enable humans to collectively annotate objects. During testing time, our\nalgorithm can recognize all objects very reliably, and query humans from crowd\nsourcing platform if confidence is low or new objects are identified. This\npaper explains design decisions in building such a system, and constructs a\nbenchmark for extensive evaluation.

The main improvements are the use of\nmore and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more\ndetailed foreground and instrumental models, allowing further checks and\nenhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a\nlarger sky fraction. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further\nreduce uncertainties. For temperature, we perform an analysis of end-to-end\ninstrumental simulations fed into the data processing pipeline; this does not\nreveal biases from residual instrumental systematics. The $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to Planck data. The slope\nof primordial scalar fluctuations, $n_s$, is confirmed smaller than unity at\nmore than 5{\\sigma} from Planck alone. We further validate robustness against\nspecific extensions to the baseline cosmology. E.g., the effective number of\nneutrino species remains compatible with the canonical value of 3.046. This\nfirst detailed analysis of Planck polarization concentrates on E modes. At low\n$\\ell$ we use temperature at all frequencies and a subset of polarization. The\nfrequency range improves CMB-foreground separation. Within the baseline model\nthis requires a reionization optical depth $\\tau=0.078\\pm0.019$, significantly\nlower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring.

We developed a (simple) simulation test bed of electrical\nneurostimulation of myelinated nerve fibers with underlying sensory activity.\nThis paper reports our findings so far. Interactions between stimulation-evoked\nand underlying activities are mainly due to collisions of action potentials and\nlosses of excitability due to the refractory period following an action\npotential. In addition, intuitively, the reliability of sensory activity\ndecreases as the stimulation frequency increases.

To that end, we define ABA-detecting registers, which are similar to\nnormal read/write registers, except that they allow a process q to detect with\na read operation, whether some process wrote the register since q's last read.\nABA-detecting registers can be implemented trivially from a single unbounded\nregister, but we show that they have a high complexity if base objects are\nbounded: An obstruction-free implementation of an ABA-detecting single bit\nregister cannot be implemented from fewer than n-1 bounded registers. Moreover,\nbounded CAS objects (or more generally, conditional read-modify-write\nprimitives) offer little help to implement ABA-detecting single bit registers:\nWe prove a linear time-space tradeoff for such implementations. We show that\nthe same time-space tradeoff holds for implementations of single bit LL/SC\nprimitives from bounded writable CAS objects. This proves that the\nimplementations of LL/SC/VL by Anderson and Moir (1995) as well as Jayanti and\nPetrovic (2003) are optimal. We complement our lower bounds with tight upper\nbounds: We give an implementation of ABA-detecting registers from n+1 bounded\nregisters, which has step complexity O(1). We also show that (bounded) LL/SC/VL\ncan be implemented from a single bounded CAS object and with O(n) step\ncomplexity. Both upper bounds are asymptotically optimal with respect to their\ntime-space product. These results give formal evidence that the ABA problem is\ninherently difficult, that even writable CAS objects do not provide significant\nbenefits over registers for dealing with the ABA problem itself, and that there\nis no hope of finding a more efficient implementation of LL/SC/VL from bounded\nCAS objects and registers than the ones mentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 21:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-13"}

The\nXARM mission, equipped with the Resolve X-ray micro-calorimeter, will continue\nHitomi's legacy by measuring ICM motions through Doppler shifting and\nbroadening of emission lines in a larger number of galaxy clusters, and at\nlarger radii. In this work, we investigate how well we can measure bulk and\nturbulent gas motions in the ICM with XARM, by analyzing mock XARM simulations\nof galaxy clusters extracted from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. We\nassess how photon counts, spectral fitting methods, multiphase ICM structure,\ndeprojections, and region selection affect the measurements of gas motions. We\nfirst show that XARM is capable of recovering the underlying spherically\naveraged turbulent and bulk velocity profiles for dynamically relaxed clusters\nto within $\\sim 50\\%$ with a reasonable amount of photon counts in the X-ray\nemission lines. We also find that there are considerable azimuthal variations\nin the ICM velocities, where the velocities measured in a single azimuthal\ndirection can significantly deviate from the true value even in dynamically\nrelaxed systems. Such variation must be taken into account when interpreting\ndata and developing observing strategies. We will discuss the prospect of using\nthe upcoming XARM mission to measure non-thermal pressure and to correct for\nthe hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters. Our results are broadly\napplicable for future X-ray missions, such as Athena and Lynx.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 22:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2018 23:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jun 2018 12:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

The bulk modulus of generic Penrose tilings is\nzero asymptotically. According to our results, B grows as (epsilon^2 L^3) when\n(epsilon^2 L^3) << 10^2, then saturates, and finally decays as (epsilon^2\nL^3)^{-2/3} ~ 1/L^2 for epsilon^2 L^3 >> 10^2. Stenull and Lubensky seem to\nhave only analyzed one value of epsilon for which saturation is reached at the\nlargest size studied. This led them to a wrong conclusion. We support our\nresults by also considering generic Penrose approximants with fixed boundaries,\nwhose bulk modulus constitutes a strict upper bound for that of periodic\nsystems, finding that these have a vanishing B as well for large L. We conclude\nthat the main point in Stenull and Lubensky letter is unjustified. Penrose\ntilings are no better models of jammed packings than any of the previously\nstudied isostatic networks with geometric disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 23:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-13"}

The value of the central\nvelocity dispersion has a serious impact on the mass and possible presence of\nan intermediate-mass black hole at the center of NGC 6388. We use a photometric\ncatalog of NGC 6388 to create a simulated SINFONI and ARGUS dataset.

In addition, we produce an N-body realization of a 10^6 M_SUN stellar\ncluster with the same photometric properties as NGC 6388 to account for\nunresolved stars. We find that the individual radial velocities, i.e. the\nmeasurements from the simulated SINFONI data, are systematically biased towards\nlower velocity dispersions. The reason is that due to the wings in the point\nspread function the velocities get biased towards the mean cluster velocity.\nThis study shows that even with AO supported observations, individual radial\nvelocities in crowded fields are likely to be biased. The ARGUS observations do\nnot show this kind of bias but were found to have larger uncertainties than\npreviously obtained.

This\nnon-affine model is much more realistic than classical affine models like the\nHeston stochastic volatility model, even though both are as parsimonious (only\nfour stochastic parameters). Indeed, it provides more realistic volatility\ndistribution and volatility paths, which translate in practice into more robust\ncalibration and better hedging accuracy, explaining its popularity among\npractitioners. In order to price vanilla options with IGa volatility, we\npropose a closed-form volatility-of-volatility expansion. Specifically, the\nprice of a European put option with IGa volatility is approximated by a\nBlack-Scholes price plus a weighted combination of Black-Scholes greeks, where\nthe weights depend only on the four time-dependent parameters of the model.\nThis closed-form pricing method allows for very fast pricing and calibration to\nmarket data. The overall quality of the approximation is very good, as shown by\nseveral calibration tests on real-world market data where expansion prices are\ncompared favorably with Monte Carlo simulation results. This paper shows that\nthe IGa model is as simple, more realistic, easier to implement and faster to\ncalibrate than classical transform-based affine models.

Given a grammar, the\nrandom access problem is to compactly represent the grammar while supporting\nrandom access, that is, given a position in the original uncompressed string\nreport the character at that position. In this paper we study the random access\nproblem with the finger search property, that is, the time for a random access\nquery should depend on the distance between a specified index $f$, called the\n\\emph{finger}, and the query index $i$. We consider both a static variant,\nwhere we first place a finger and subsequently access indices near the finger\nefficiently, and a dynamic variant where also moving the finger such that the\ntime depends on the distance moved is supported.\n  Let $n$ be the size the grammar, and let $N$ be the size of the string.

Also considered are measures of the magnetic field in the\nphotosphere (sunspot number and sunspot area), the chromosphere and corona\n(10.7cm radio flux and 530.3nm green coronal index), and two measures of the\nSun's magnetic activity closer to Earth (the interplanetary magnetic field and\nthe galactic cosmic-ray intensity). Scaled versions of the activity proxies\ndiverge from the helioseismic data around 2000, indicating a change in\nrelationship between the proxies. The degree of divergence varies from proxy to\nproxy with sunspot area and 10.7cm flux showing only small deviations, while\nsunspot number, coronal index, and the two interplanetary proxies show much\nlarger departures. In Cycle 24 the deviations in the solar proxies and the\nhelioseismic data decrease, raising the possibility that the deviations\nobserved in Cycle 23 are just symptomatic of a 22-year Hale cycle. However, the\ndeviations in the helioseismic data and the interplanetary proxies increase in\nCycle 24. Interestingly the divergence in the solar proxies and the\nhelioseismic data are not reflected in the shorter-term variations (often\nreferred to as quasi-biennial oscillations) observed on top of the dominant\n11-year solar cycle.

We apply symmetry rules in the complete scrambling assumption to\ncalculate branching ratio tables for reactions between chemical species that\ninclude multiple protons and/or deuterons. Reaction sets for both gas-phase and\ngrain-surface chemistry are generated using an automated routine that forms all\npossible spin-state variants of any given reaction with up to six H/D atoms.\nSingle-point and modified Bonnor-Ebert models are used to study the density and\ntemperature dependence of ammonia and its isotopologs, and the associated\nspin-state ratios.\n  Results.

We aim at\ndeveloping an efficient software package for the analysis of medium- to\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of single stars and those in binary systems. The\nmajor requirements are that the code has a high performance, represents the\nstate-of-the-art analysis tool, and provides accurate determinations of\natmospheric parameters and chemical compositions for different types of stars.\nWe use the method of atmosphere models and spectrum synthesis, which is one of\nthe most commonly used approaches for the analysis of stellar spectra. Our Grid\nSearch in Stellar Parameters (GSSP) code makes use of the OpenMPI\nimplementation, which makes it possible to run in parallel mode. The method is\nfirst tested on the simulated data and is then applied to the spectra of real\nstellar objects. The majority of test runs on the simulated data were\nsuccessful in the sense that we could recover the initially assumed sets of\natmospheric parameters. We experimentally find the limits in signal-to-noise\nratios of the input spectra, below which the final set of parameters gets\nsignificantly affected by the noise. Application of the GSSP package to the\nspectra of three Kepler stars, KIC11285625, KIC6352430, and KIC4931738, was\nalso largely successful.

Building on the prior work of Tyagi for the\ntwo-terminal scenario, we derive a lower bound on the communication complexity,\n$R_{\\text{SK}}$, defined to be the minimum rate of public communication needed\nto generate a maximal-rate SK. It is well known that the minimum rate of\ncommunication for omniscience, denoted by $R_{\\text{CO}}$, is an upper bound on\n$R_{\\text{SK}}$.

This allows\nus to explicitly evaluate $R_{\\text{SK}}$ for such PIN models.

Since these games generally do not have\npure Nash equilibria, we consider approximate pure Nash equilibria, in which no\nplayer can improve her utility by more than some fixed factor $\\alpha$ through\nunilateral strategy changes. There is a threshold $\\alpha_\\delta$ (where\n$\\delta$ is a parameter that limits the demand of each player on a specific\nresource) such that $\\alpha$-approximate pure Nash equilibria always exist for\n$\\alpha \\geq \\alpha_\\delta$, but not for $\\alpha < \\alpha_\\delta$.

This is due to the fact that the samples available\nfor study all originate from relatively shallow depths. Comparison of the\nstable isotope compositions of planets and meteorites can help overcome this\nlimitation. Specifically, the non-chondritic Si isotope composition of the\nEarth's mantle was interpreted to reflect the presence of Si in the core, which\ncan also explain its low density relative to pure Fe-Ni alloy. However, we have\nfound that angrite meteorites display a heavy Si isotope composition similar to\nthe lunar and terrestrial mantles. Because core formation in the angrite\nparent-body (APB) occurred under oxidizing conditions at relatively low\npressure and temperature, significant incorporation of Si in the core is ruled\nout as an explanation for this heavy Si isotope signature. Instead, we show\nthat equilibrium isotopic fractionation between gaseous SiO and solid\nforsterite at 1370 K in the solar nebula could have produced the observed Si\nisotope variations. Nebular fractionation of forsterite should be accompanied\nby correlated variations between the Si isotopic composition and Mg/Si ratio\nfollowing a slope of 1, which is observed in meteorites. Consideration of this\nnebular process leads to a revised Si concentration in the Earth's core of 3.6\n(+6.0/-3.6) wt% and provides estimates of Mg/Si ratios of bulk planetary\nbodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 14:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The last five years have witnessed an explosion in\nmagnetar research which has led, among other things, to the discovery of\ntransient, or \"outbursting,\" and \"low-field\" magnetars. Substantial progress\nhas been made also on the theoretical side. Quite detailed models for\nexplaining the magnetars' persistent X-ray emission, the properties of the\nbursts, the flux evolution in transient sources have been developed and\nconfronted with observations. New insight on neutron star asteroseismology has\nbeen gained through improved models of magnetar oscillations. The long-debated\nissue of magnetic field decay in neutron stars has been addressed, and its\nimportance recognized in relation to the evolution of magnetars and to the\nlinks among magnetars and other families of isolated neutron stars. The aim of\nthis paper is to present a comprehensive overview in which the observational\nresults are discussed in the light of the most up-to-date theoretical models\nand their implications. This addresses not only the particular case of magnetar\nsources, but the more fundamental issue of how physics in strong magnetic\nfields can be constrained by the observations of these unique sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 14:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

For deriving the effective theory of modes\nin the vicinity of the quantum critical point we develop a new method by\nmapping a Bose-Einstein condensate of $N$-particles onto a sigma model with a\ncontinuous global (pseudo)symmetry that mixes bosons of different momenta. The\nBogolyubov modes of the condensate are mapped onto the Goldstone modes of the\nsigma model, which become gapless at the critical point. These gapless\nGoldstone modes are the quantum carriers of information and entropy. Analyzing\ntheir effective theory, we observe the information-processing properties\nstrikingly similar to the ones predicted by the black hole portrait. The energy\ncost per qubit of information-storage vanishes in the large-$N$ limit and the\ntotal information-storage capacity increases with $N$ either exponentially or\nas a power law. The longevity of information-storage also increases with $N$,\nwhereas the scrambling time in the over-critical regime is controlled by the\nLyapunov exponent and scales logarithmically with $N$. This connection reveals\nthat the origin of black hole information storage lies in the quantum\ncriticality of the graviton Bose-gas, and that much simpler systems that can be\nmanufactured in table-top experiments can exhibit very similar\ninformation-processing dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 15:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The best approximation ratio known for TAP is $1.5$. In the\nmore general Weighted TAP problem, $F$ should be of minimum weight. Weighted\nTAP admits several $2$-approximation algorithms w.r.t. to the standard cut\nLP-relaxation, but for all of them the performance ratio of $2$ is tight even\nfor TAP. The problem is equivalent to the problem of covering a laminar set\nfamily. Laminar set families play an important role in the design of\napproximation algorithms for connectivity network design problems. In fact,\nWeighted TAP is the simplest connectivity network design problem for which a\nratio better than $2$ is not known. Improving this \"natural\" ratio is a major\nopen problem, which may have implications on many other network design\nproblems. It seems that achieving this goal requires finding an LP-relaxation\nwith integrality gap better than $2$, which is a long time open problem even\nfor TAP. In this paper we introduce such an LP-relaxation and give an algorithm\nthat computes a feasible solution for TAP of size at most $1.75$ times the\noptimal LP value. This gives some hope to break the ratio $2$ for the weighted\ncase. Our algorithm computes some initial edge set by solving a partial system\nof constraints that form the integral edge-cover polytope, and then applies\nlocal search on $3$-leaf subtrees to exchange some of the edges and to add\nadditional edges. Thus we do not need to solve the LP, and the algorithm runs\nroughly in time required to find a minimum weight edge-cover in a general\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 08:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-19"}
