We propose an answer to this criticism by modifying the Nelson-Yasue\nformulation of non-relativistic stochastic mechanics for a spinless particle\nwith the following hypothesis: a spinless Nelson-Yasue particle of rest mass\n$m$ continuously undergoes a driven steady-state oscillation of\n`zitterbewegung' (\\emph{zbw}) frequency,\n$\\omega_{c}=\\left(1/\\hbar\\right)mc^{2}$, in its instantaneous mean forward (and\nbackward) translational rest frame. With this hypothesis we show that, in the\nlab frame, \\emph{S} arises from imposing the constraint of conservative\ndiffusions on the time-symmetrized steady-state phase of the \\emph{zbw}\nparticle, satisfies the required quantization condition, and evolves in time by\nthe Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations (when generalized to describe a\nstatistical ensemble of \\emph{zbw} particles). From the mathematical\nequivalence of Schr\\\"odinger's equation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung\nequations plus the quantization condition, Schr\\\"odinger wave functions for a\nspinless particle (in and excluding external fields) are thereby recovered. We\nalso apply this `zitterbewegung stochastic mechanics' (ZSM) to the case of a\ncentral potential and show that it predicts angular momentum quantization. This\npaper sets the foundation for Part II, which will (primarily) work out the\nmany-particle version of ZSM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 18:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 14:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 00:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 19:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 16:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 16:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

One of\nthe main goals of NIKA2 is to measure the pressure distribution in galaxy\nclusters at high resolution using the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect. Such\nobservations have already proved to be an excellent probe of cluster pressure\ndistributions even at high redshifts. However, an important fraction of\nclusters host submm and/or radio point sources, which can significantly affect\nthe reconstructed signal. Here we report on <20\" resolution observations at 150\nand 260GHz of the cluster MACSJ1424, which hosts both radio and submm point\nsources. We examine the morphology of the tSZ signal and compare it to other\ndatasets. The NIKA data are combined with Herschel satellite data to study the\nSED of the submm point source contaminants. We then perform a joint\nreconstruction of the intracluster medium (ICM) electronic pressure and density\nby combining NIKA, Planck, XMM-Newton, and Chandra data, focusing on the impact\nof the radio and submm sources on the reconstructed pressure profile. We find\nthat large-scale pressure distribution is unaffected by the point sources\nbecause of the resolved nature of the NIKA observations. The reconstructed\npressure in the inner region is slightly higher when the contribution of point\nsources are removed. We show that it is not possible to set strong constraints\non the central pressure distribution without accurately removing these\ncontaminants. The comparison with X-ray only data shows good agreement for the\npressure, temperature, and entropy profiles, which all indicate that MACSJ1424\nis a dynamically relaxed cool core system. The present observations illustrate\nthe possibility of measuring these quantities with a relatively small\nintegration time, even at high redshift and without X-ray spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 16:21:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 08:55:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 09:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

They pose a great challenge for planet formation\ntheories, which fall into two broad classes: (1) formation further out followed\nby inward migration; (2) formation in situ, in the very inner regions of the\nprotoplanetary disk. We review the pros and cons of these classes, before\nfocusing on a new theory of sequential in situ formation from the inside-out\nvia creation of successive gravitationally unstable rings fed from a continuous\nstream of small (~cm-m size) \"pebbles,\" drifting inward via gas drag. Pebbles\nfirst collect at the pressure trap associated with the transition from a\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI)-inactive (\"dead zone\") region to an inner,\nMRI-active zone. A pebble ring builds up that begins to dominate the local mass\nsurface density of the disk and spawns a planet. The planet continues to grow,\nmost likely by pebble accretion, until it becomes massive enough to isolate\nitself from the accretion flow via gap opening. This reduces the local gas\ndensity near the planet, leading to enhanced ionization and a retreat of the\ndead zone inner boundary. The process repeats with a new pebble ring gathering\nat the new pressure maximum associated with this boundary. We discuss the\ntheory's predictions for planetary masses, relative mass scalings with orbital\nradius, and minimum orbital separations, and their comparison with observed\nsystems. Finally, we discuss open questions, including potential causes of\ndiversity of planetary system architectures, i.e., STIPs versus Solar System\nanalogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 18:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-23"}

It is important to accelerate ConvNet training, which is\ncomputationally costly.

To attain such\nperformance on real shared-memory machines, our algorithm computes convolutions\nconverging on the same node of the network with temporal locality to reduce\ncache misses, and sums the convergent convolution outputs via an almost\nwait-free concurrent method to reduce time spent in critical sections. We\nimplement the algorithm with a publicly available software package called ZNN.\nBenchmarking with multi-core CPUs shows that ZNN can attain speedup roughly\nequal to the number of physical cores. We also show that ZNN can attain over\n90x speedup on a many-core CPU (Xeon Phi Knights Corner). These speedups are\nachieved for network architectures with widths that are in common use. The task\nparallelism of the ZNN algorithm is suited to CPUs, while the SIMD parallelism\nof previous algorithms is compatible with GPUs. Through examples, we show that\nZNN can be either faster or slower than certain GPU implementations depending\non specifics of the network architecture, kernel sizes, and density and size of\nthe output patch. ZNN may be less costly to develop and maintain, due to the\nrelative ease of general-purpose CPU programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 18:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

The cross-plane thermal\nconductivity is calculated from the layer thermal conductivities in series with\none another and with thermal boundary resistances (TBRs) associated with each\ninterface; the TBRs dominate cross-plane transport. The TBR of each interface\nis calculated from the transmission coefficient obtained by interpolating\nbetween the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) and the diffuse mismatch model (DMM),\nwhere the weight of the AMM transmission coefficient is the same\nwavelength-dependent specularity parameter related to the effective interface\nrms roughness that is commonly used to describe diffuse interface scattering.\nThe model is applied to multiple III-arsenide superlattices, and the results\nare in very good agreement with experimental findings. The method is both\nsimple and accurate, easy to implement, and applicable to complicated SL\nsystems, such as the active regions of quantum cascade lasers. It is also valid\nfor other SL material systems with high-quality interfaces and predominantly\nincoherent phonon transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 19:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

In the\nquantum setting one must take into account the quantum side information held by\nan adversary which might be used to break the security of the extractor. In the\ncase of seeded extractors the presence of quantum side information has been\nextensively studied. For multi-source extractors one can easily see that high\nconditional min-entropy is not sufficient to guarantee security against\narbitrary side information, even in the classical case. Hence, the interesting\nquestion is under which models of (both quantum and classical) side information\nmulti-source extractors remain secure. In this work we suggest a natural model\nof side information, which we call the Markov model, and prove that any\nmulti-source extractor remains secure in the presence of quantum side\ninformation of this type (albeit with weaker parameters). This improves on\nprevious results in which more restricted models were considered and the\nsecurity of only some types of extractors was shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 20:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 12:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Without reference to any\nspecific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is\nthat it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members\ndue to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a\nnovel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests\nthis one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra,\nrather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally\ndone.

Six months of radio observations of\nthe 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,\nnon-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ of\nfreely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical\nspectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away\n(3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low\nfrequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high\nradio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)\nX-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the\nconclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal. Unlike most other\nnovae with strong shock-powered radio emission, V5589 Sgr is not embedded in\nthe wind of a red-giant companion. Based on the similar inclinations and\noptical line profiles of V5589 Sgr and V959 Mon, we propose that shocks in\nV5589 Sgr formed from collisions between a slow flow with an equatorial density\nenhancement and a subsequent faster flow.

Specifically,\nthe hard X-ray polarimetry is more rewarding because the sources are expected\nto be intrinsically highly polarized at higher energies. With the successful\nimplementation of Hard X-ray optics in NuSTAR, it is now feasible to conceive\nCompton polarimeters as focal plane detectors. Such a configuration is likely\nto provide sensitive polarization measurements in hard X-rays with a broad\nenergy band. We are developing a focal plane hard X-ray Compton polarimeter\nconsisting of a plastic scintillator as active scatterer surrounded by a\ncylindrical array of CsI(Tl) scintillators. The scatterer is 5 mm diameter and\n100 mm long plastic scintillator (BC404) viewed by normal PMT. The photons\nscattered by the plastic scatterer are collected by a cylindrical array of 16\nCsI(Tl) scintillators (5 mm x 5 mm x 150 mm) which are read by Si\nPhotomultiplier (SiPM). Use of the new generation SiPMs ensures the compactness\nof the instrument which is essential for the design of focal plane detectors.\nThe expected sensitivity of such polarimetric configuration and complete\ncharacterization of the plastic scatterer, specially at lower energies have\nbeen discussed in Chattopadhyay et al.

When studying interconnected\nnetworks it is useful to consider a multiplex model, where the component\nnetworks operate together with inter-layer links among them. In order to have a\nwell-connected multilayer structure, it is necessary to optimally design these\ninter-layer links considering realistic constraints. In this work, we solve the\nproblem of finding an optimal weight distribution for one-to-one inter-layer\nlinks under budget constraint.

On the other hand, when the two layers are arbitrary, increasing the\nbudget reveals the existence of two different regimes. Up to a certain\nthreshold budget, the second eigenvalue of the supra-Laplacian is simple, the\noptimal weight distribution is uniform, and the Fiedler vector is constant on\neach layer. Increasing the budget past the threshold, the optimal weight\ndistribution can be non-uniform. The interesting consequence of this result is\nthat there is no need to solve the optimization problem when the available\nbudget is less than the threshold, which can be easily found analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2015 22:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

The shallow disk gaps cannot terminate growth of\ngiant planets. For planets less massive than 10 Jupiter masses, their growth\nrates are mainly controlled by the gas supply through the global disk\naccretion, rather than their gaps. The insufficient gas supply compared with\nthe rapid gas capture causes a depletion of the gas surface density even at the\noutside of the gap, which can create an inner hole in the protoplanetary disk.\nOur model can also predict the depleted gas surface density in the inner hole\nfor a given planet mass. Secondly, our findings are applied to the formation of\nour solar system. For the formation of Jupiter, a very low-mass gas disk with a\nfew or several Jupiter masses is required at the beginning of its gas capture\nbecause of the non-stopping capture. Such a low-mass gas disk with sufficient\nsolid material can be formed through viscous evolution from an initially\n$\\sim$10AU-sized compact disk with the solar composition. By the viscous\nevolution with a moderate viscosity of $\\alpha \\sim 10^{-3}$, most of disk gas\naccretes onto the sun and a widely spread low-mass gas disk remains when the\nsolid core of Jupiter starts gas capture at $t \\sim 10^7$ yrs. The depletion of\nthe disk gas is suitable for explaining the high metallicity in giant planets\nof our solar system. A very low-mass gas disk also provides a plausible path\nwhere type I and II planetary migrations are both suppressed significantly. In\nparticular, we also show that the type II migration of Jupiter-size planets\nbecomes inefficient because of the additional gas depletion due to the rapid\ngas capture by themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 07:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

In\nparticular, we address its subtle issues as well. Unlike the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard model (MSSM), the Next to MSSM (NMSSM) can be scale\ninvariant and has no mass parameter in its Lagrangian before SUSY and gauge\nsymmetry breakings. Therefore, the NMSSM is a perfect framework for\nsuper-natural SUSY. To give the SUSY breaking soft mass to the singlet, we\nconsider the moduli and dilaton dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory on\n$S^1/Z_2$. In these scenarios, SUSY is broken by one and only one $F$-term of\nmoduli or dilaton, and the SUSY breaking soft terms can be determined via the\nK\\\"ahler potential and superpotential from Calabi-Yau compactification of\nM-theory on $S^1/Z_2$. Thus, as predicted by super-natural SUSY, the SUSY\nelectroweak fine-tuning measure is of unity order. In the moduli dominant SUSY\nbreaking scenario, the right-handed sleptons are relatively light around 1 TeV,\nstau can be even as light as 580 GeV and degenerate with the lightest\nneutralino, chargino masses are larger than 1 TeV, the light stop masses are\naround 2 TeV or larger, the first two-generation squark masses are about 3 TeV\nor larger, and gluinos are heavier than squarks.

Vortex pinning, guided vortex motion, and the ratchet\neffect are three main fluxonic ``tools'' which allow for the dynamical (pinned\nor moving), the directional (angle-dependent), and the orientational (current\npolarity-sensitive) control over the fluxons, respectively. Thanks to the\nperiodicity of the vortex lattice, several groups of effects emerge when the\nvortices move in a periodic pinning landscape: Spatial commensurability of the\nlocation of vortices with the underlying pinning nanolandscape leads to a\nreduction of the dc resistance and the microwave loss at the so-called matching\nfields. Temporal synchronization of the displacement of vortices with the\nnumber of pinning sites visited during one half ac cycle manifests itself as\nShapiro steps in the current-voltage curves. Delocalization of vortices\noscillating under the action of a high-frequency ac drive can be tuned by a\nsuperimposed dc bias. In this short review a choice of experimental results on\nthe vortex dynamics in the presence of periodic pinning in Nb thin films is\npresented. The consideration is limited to one particular type of artificial\npinning structures --- directly written nanolandscapes of the washboard type,\nwhich are fabricated by focused ion beam milling and focused electron beam\ninduced deposition. The reported results are relevant for the development of\nfluxonic devices and the reduction of microwave losses in superconducting\nplanar transmission lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 09:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

We use the Kepler data accumulated on the pulsating DB white dwarf KIC\n08626021 to explore in detail the stability of its oscillation modes, searching\nin particular for evidences of nonlinear behaviors. Methods. We analyse nearly\ntwo years of uninterrupted short cadence data, concentrating in particular on\nidentified triplets due to stellar rotation that show intriguing behaviors\nduring the course of the observations. Results. We find clear signatures of\nnonlinear effects attributed to resonant mode coupling mechanisms. We find that\na triplet at 4310 {\\mu}Hz and this doublet at 3681 {\\mu}Hz (most likely the two\nvisible components of an incomplete triplet) have clear periodic frequency and\namplitude modulations typical of the so-called intermediate regime of the\nresonance, with time scales consistent with theoretical expectations. Another\ntriplet at 5073 {\\mu}Hz is likely in a narrow transitory regime in which the\namplitudes are modulated while the frequencies are locked.

These should resonate as a warning to projects\naiming at measuring the evolutionary cooling rate of KIC 08626021, and of white\ndwarf stars in general.

Finally, we calculate the absorption and transmittance spectra of\nTiS3 in the random-phase-approximation (RPA) and find that the calculations are\nin good agreement with the observed experimental optical transmittance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 11:11:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 18:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

For example ultrasound vector field tomography needs a\npriori knowledge of the sound speed. According to Fermat's principle ultrasound\nsignals travel along geodesic curves of a Riemannian metric which is associated\nwith the refractive index. The inverse problem thus consists of determining the\nindex of refraction from integrals along geodesics curves associated with the\nintegrand leading to a nonlinear problem.

In this paper, we present NXgraph, an efficient graph processing\nsystem on a single machine. With the abstraction of vertex intervals and edge\nsub-shards, we propose the Destination-Sorted Sub-Shard (DSSS) structure to\nstore a graph. By dividing vertices and edges into intervals and sub-shards,\nNXgraph ensures graph data access locality and enables fine-grained scheduling.\nBy sorting edges within each sub-shard according to their destination vertices,\nNXgraph reduces write conflicts among different threads and achieves a high\ndegree of parallelism. Then, three updating strategies, i.e., Single-Phase\nUpdate (SPU), Double-Phase Update (DPU), and Mixed-Phase Update (MPU), are\nproposed in this paper. NXgraph can adaptively choose the fastest strategy for\ndifferent graph problems according to the graph size and the available memory\nresources to fully utilize the memory space and reduce the amount of data\ntransfer. All these three strategies exploit streamlined disk access pattern.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world graphs and five synthetic graphs show\nthat NXgraph can outperform GraphChi, TurboGraph, VENUS, and GridGraph in\nvarious situations. Moreover, NXgraph, running on a single commodity PC, can\nfinish an iteration of PageRank on the Twitter graph with 1.5 billion edges in\n2.05 seconds; while PowerGraph, a distributed graph processing system, needs\n3.6s to finish the same task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 12:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-10"}

However, various\ndiscrepancies with other solar indices recently motivated a full re-calibration\nof this series. Based on various diagnostics and corrections established in the\nframework of several Sunspot Number Workshops and described in Clette et al.\n2014, we assembled all corrections in order to produce a new standard version\nof this reference time series. In this paper, we explain the three main\ncorrections and the criteria used to choose a final optimal version of each\ncorrection factor or function, given the available information and published\nanalyses. We then discuss the good agreement obtained with the Group sunspot\nNumber derived from a recent reconstruction. Among the implications emerging\nfrom this re-calibrated series, we also discuss the absence of a rising secular\ntrend in the newly-determined solar cycle amplitudes, also in relation with\ncontradictory indications derived from cosmogenic radionuclides. As conclusion,\nwe introduce the new version management scheme now implemented at the World\nData Center - SILSO, which reflects a major conceptual transition: beyond the\nre-scaled numbers, this first revision of the Sunspot Number also transforms\nthe former locked data archive into a living observational series open to\nfuture improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 13:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-06"}

The Gamma vs. \\dot M\ncorrelation revealed in M101~ULX-1 is similar to that in a number of Galactic\nBHs and exhibits clearly the correlation along with the strong \\Gamma\nsaturation at ~2.8.

Being low mass bosons,\nthese light-matter quasiparticles can condense at comparably high temperatures\nup to 300K, while preserving fundamental properties such as coherence in space\nand time domain even when they are out of equilibrium with the environment.\nAlthough the presence of an in-plane polariton confinement potential is not\nstrictly necessary in order to observe condensation of polaritons, engineering\nthe polariton confinement is a key to controlling, shaping and directing the\nflow of polaritons. Prototype polariton-based optoelectronic devices rely on\nultrafast photon-like velocities and strong nonlinearities, as well as on\ntailored confinement. Nanotechnology provides several pathways to achieving\nsuch a confinement, and the specific features and advantages of the different\ntechniques are discussed in this paper. As hybrid exciton-photon\nquasiparticles, polaritons can be trapped via their excitonic as well as their\nphotonic component, which leads to a wide choice of highly complementary\ntechniques.
