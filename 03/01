At the\nsame time, three-dimensional spherical simulations of convectively driven\ndynamos reproduce a similar diversity, which is commonly obtained either with\nBoussinesq models or with more realistic models based on the anelastic\napproximation, which take into account the variation of the density with depth\nthroughout the convection zone.

In this paper, we aim at\nclarifying this point by investigating in more detail the influence of the\ndensity stratification on dipolar dynamos. To that end, we rely on a systematic\nparameter study that allows us to clearly follow the evolution of the stability\ndomain of the dipolar branch as the density stratification is increased. The\nimpact of the density stratification both on the dynamo onset and the dipole\ncollapse is discussed and compared to previous Boussinesq results. Furthermore,\nour study indicates that the loss of the dipolar branch does not ensue from a\nspecific modification of the dynamo mechanisms related to the background\nstratification, but could instead result from a bias as our observations\nnaturally favour a certain domain in the parameter space characterized by\nmoderate values of the Ekman number, owing to current computational\nlimitations.

We propose a simple method to simultaneously\nextract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographic\ninversion technique derived from classical Doppler mapping. Based on the\nmaximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set of\norbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resulting\nDoppler map.

One\nnoticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,\nin which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radial\nvelocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustly\nrecovered. The present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbital\nparameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when more\nclassical radial velocity detection methods generally fail.

The key motivations for this desired switch from wired\ntopology discovery to wireless one are the flexibility and capability for\nexpansion and upgrading of a wireless backbone.

However, as\npower systems are forced to operate closer to their technical limits, where\nflexible generation becomes scarce, the conventional market paradigm may not be\nable to respond effectively on the wide range of uncertainty. The operational\nflexibility of the power system depends both on the technical parameters of its\ncomponents, i.e., generators and transmission infrastructure, as well as on the\noperational practices that make optimal use of the available assets. This work\nfocuses on alternative market designs that enable sharing of cross-border\nbalancing resources between adjacent power systems through High Voltage Direct\nCurrent (HVDC) interconnections which provide increased controllability. In\nthis context, we formulate a stochastic market-clearing algorithm that attains\nfull spatio-temporal integration of reserve capacity, day-ahead and balancing\nmarkets. Against this benchmark we compare two deterministic market designs\nwith varying degrees of coordination between the reserve capacity and energy\nservices, both followed by a real-time mechanism. Our study reveals the\ninefficiency of deterministic approaches as the shares of wind power increase.\nNevertheless, enforcing a tighter coordination between the reserves and energy\ntrading floors may improve considerably the expected system cost compared to a\nsequential market design. Aiming to provide some insights for improvement of\nthe sequential market-clearing, we analyse the effect of explicit transmission\nallocation between energy and reserves for different HVDC capacities and\nidentify the market dynamics that dictate the optimal ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 23:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

Secondly, the calculated anomalous Hall conductivities (AHCs) are\nmoderate, being within 200 S/cm, and agree well with the available experiments\non highly L2$_1$ ordered Co$_2$FeSi specimen although they differ significantly\nfrom the reported experiments on other compounds where the B2 antisite\ndisorders were present. Surprisingly, the AHC in Co$_2$FeSi decreases and then\nchanges sign when Si is replaced by Ge and finally by Sn. Third, the calculated\ntotal magnetic moments agree well with the corresponding experimental ones in\nall the studied compounds except Co$_2$FeSi where a difference of 0.3\n$\\mu_B$/f.u. exists. We also perform the GGA plus on-site Coulomb interaction\n$U$ calculations in the GGA+$U$ scheme.

Based on the magnification invariant theory, which\nstates that the sum of signed magnifications of the total images of a given\nsource is a constant, we calculate the cusp summations for the five lens\nmodels.

We used interferometric IRAM CO(1-0) and CO(2-1), and\nSMA CO(3-2) emission line maps to derive sigmahtwo and HST-Halpha images to\nestimate sigmasfr. Each galaxy is characterized by a distinct molecular SF\nrelation at spatial scales between 20 to 200 pc. The K-S relations can be\nsub-linear, but also super-linear, with slopes ranging from 0.5 to 1.3.\nDepletion times range from 1 and 2Gyr, compatible with results for nearby\nnormal galaxies. These findings are valid independently of which transition,\nCO(1-0), CO(2-1), or CO(3-2), is used to derive sigmahtwo. Because of\nstar-formation feedback, life-time of clouds, turbulent cascade, or magnetic\nfields, the K-S relation might be expected to degrade on small spatial scales\n(<100 pc). However, we find no clear evidence for this, even on scales as small\nas 20 pc, and this might be because of the higher density of GMCs in galaxy\ncenters which have to resist higher shear forces. The proportionality between\nsigmahtwo and sigmasfr found between 10 and 100 Msun/pc2 is valid even at high\ndensities, 10^3 Msun/pc2. However, by adopting a common CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor (alpha_CO), the central regions of the galaxies have higher sigmasfr for\na given gas column than those expected from the models, with a behavior that\nlies between the mergers/high-redshift starburst systems and the more quiescent\nstar-forming galaxies, assuming that the first ones require a lower value of\nalpha_CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 14:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 18:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Especially, this concerns microwave\nspectroscopic characterization of biological liquids. Use of effective testing\nmethods to obtain information about physical properties of different liquids on\nthe molecular level is one of the most important problems in biophysics.\nHowever, the standard methods based on the microwave resonant techniques are\nnot sufficiently suitable for biological liquids because the resonance peak in\na resonator with high-loss liquids is so broad that the material parameters\ncannot be measured correctly. Although molecular vibrations of biomolecules may\nhave microwave frequencies, it is not thought that such resonant coupling is\nsignificant due to their low energy compared with thermal energy and the\nstrongly dampening aqueous environment. This paper presents an innovative\nmicrowave sensing technique for different types of lossy materials, including\nbiological liquids. The technique is based on the combination of the microwave\nperturbation method and the Fano-resonance effects observed recently in\nmicrowave structures with embedded magnetic-dipolar quantum dots. When\nfrequency of the magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) resonance is not equal to the\ncavity resonance frequency, one gets Fano transmission intensity. With tuning,\nby a bias magnetic field, the MDM resonance frequency to the cavity resonance\nfrequency, one observes a Lorentz line shape. Use of an extremely narrow\nLorentzian peak allows exact probing the resonant frequency of a cavity loaded\nby a high-lossy-material sample. For different kinds of samples, one has\ndifferent frequencies of Lorentzian peaks. This gives a picture for precise\nspectroscopic characterization of high absorption matter in microwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 14:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The basis of STDP has strong experimental evidences and it depends on\nprecise input and output spike timings.
