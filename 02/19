Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian\noptimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI)\nheuristic. However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For\nexample, in the case of decoupled constraints---i.e., when one can\nindependently evaluate the objective or the constraints---EI can encounter a\npathology that prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a\ncurrent best solution, which may not exist if none of the data collected so far\nsatisfy the constraints. By contrast, information-based approaches do not\nsuffer from these failure modes. In this paper, we present a new\ninformation-based method called Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints\n(PESC).

We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied\nmodes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion\ntasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping,\nand more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated\nbody, requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our\ninterest in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a\nrelatively few base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of\navailable choices. Here we report on the development of one important example\nof such a behavioral programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal\nsagittal plane hopping gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF\nbase controllers.\n  For this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is\nfastened to a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform's\nlocomotion is powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in\nflight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape\nin flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance.\nThe motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four\nsimple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in\nisolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these\nabstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific\ncomponent of the locomotion task at hand.

Predictions about the future of habitable conditions on Earth include a\ndecline in species diversity and habitat extent, ocean loss and changes in the\nmagnitudes of geochemical cycles. However, testing these predictions on the\npresent-day Earth is difficult. The discovery of a planet that is a near\nanalogue to the far future Earth could provide a means to test these\npredictions. Such a planet would need to have an Earth-like biosphere history,\nrequiring it to have been in its system's habitable zone (HZ) for Gyr-long\nperiods during the system's past, and to be approaching the inner-edge of the\nHZ at present.

We show\nthat the evolution of all the (un)polarized gluon TMDPDFs is driven by a\nuniversal evolution kernel, which can be resummed up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Considering the proper definition\nof gluon TMDPDFs, we perform an explicit next-to-leading-order calculation of\nthe unpolarized ($f_1^g$), linearly polarized ($h_1^{\\perp g}$) and helicity\n($g_{1L}^g$) gluon TMDPDFs, and show that, as expected, they are free from\nrapidity divergences. As a byproduct, we obtain the Wilson coefficients of the\nrefactorization of these TMDPDFs at large transverse momentum. In particular,\nthe coefficient of $g_{1L}^g$, which has never been calculated before,\nconstitutes a new and necessary ingredient for a reliable phenomenological\nextraction of this quantity, for instance at RHIC or the future AFTER@LHC or\nElectron-Ion Collider. The coefficients of $f_1^g$ and $h_1^{\\perp g}$ have\nnever been calculated in the present formalism, although they could be obtained\nby carefully collecting and recasting previous results in the new TMD\nformalism. We apply these results to analyze the contribution of linearly\npolarized gluons at different scales, relevant, for instance, for the inclusive\nproduction of the Higgs boson and the $C$-even pseudoscalar bottomonium state\n$\\eta_{b}$. Applying our resummation scheme we finally provide predictions for\nthe Higgs boson $q_T$-distribution at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 19:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 11:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 17:43:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:58:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 23:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

We investigate in detail\nthe possibility of delensing the CMB with the cosmic infrared background (CIB),\nemission from dusty star-forming galaxies that is an excellent tracer of the\nCMB lensing signal, in order to improve constraints on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio $r$. We find that the maps of the CIB, such as current Planck satellite\nmaps at 545 GHz, can be used to remove more than half of the lensing B-mode\npower. Calculating optimal combinations of different large-scale-structure\ntracers for delensing, we find that co-adding CIB data and external\narcminute-resolution CMB lensing reconstruction can lead to significant\nadditional improvements in delensing performance. We investigate whether\nmeasurement uncertainty in the CIB spectra will degrade the delensing\nperformance if no model of the CIB spectra is assumed, and instead the CIB\nspectra are marginalized over, when constraining $r$. We find that such\nuncertainty does not significantly affect B-mode surveys smaller than a few\nthousand degrees. Even for larger surveys it causes only a moderate reduction\nin CIB delensing performance, especially if the surveys have high (arcminute)\nresolution, which allows self-calibration of the delensing procedure. Though\nfurther work on the impact of foreground residuals is required, our overall\nconclusions for delensing with current CIB data are optimistic: this delensing\nmethod can tighten constraints on $r$ by a factor up to $\\approx2.2$, and by a\nfactor up to $\\approx4$ when combined with external $\\approx 3 \\mu$K-arcmin\nlensing reconstruction, without requiring the modeling of CIB properties. CIB\ndelensing is thus a promising method for the upcoming generation of CMB\npolarization surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 19:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Particularly, we consider two problems: the first\nis to send correlated Gaussian sources on a Gaussian broadcast channel where\neach receiver is interested in reconstructing only one source component (or one\nspecific linear function of the sources) under the mean squared error\ndistortion measure; the second is to send correlated Gaussian sources on a\nGaussian multiple-access channel, where each transmitter observes a noisy\ncombination of the source, and the receiver wishes to reconstruct the\nindividual source components (or individual linear functions) under the mean\nsquared error distortion measure. It is shown that when the channel parameters\nmatch certain general conditions, the induced distortion tuples are on the\nboundary of the achievable distortion region, and thus optimal. Instead of\nfollowing the conventional approach of attempting to characterize the\nachievable distortion region, we ask the question whether and how a match can\nbe effectively determined.

The resulting dewetting transitions are often impeded by large\nkinetic barriers. According to macroscopic theory, such barriers arise from the\nfree energy required to nucleate a critical vapor tube that spans the region\nbetween two hydrophobic surfaces - tubes with smaller radii collapse, whereas\nlarger ones grow to dry the entire confined region. Using extensive molecular\nsimulations of water between two nanoscopic hydrophobic surfaces, in\nconjunction with advanced sampling techniques, here we show that for\ninter-surface separations that thermodynamically favor dewetting, the barrier\nto dewetting does not correspond to the formation of a (classical) critical\nvapor tube. Instead, it corresponds to an abrupt transition from an isolated\ncavity adjacent to one of the confining surfaces to a gap-spanning vapor tube\nthat is already larger than the critical vapor tube anticipated by macroscopic\ntheory. Correspondingly, the barrier to dewetting is also smaller than the\nclassical expectation. We show that the peculiar nature of water density\nfluctuations adjacent to extended hydrophobic surfaces - namely, the enhanced\nlikelihood of observing low-density fluctuations relative to Gaussian\nstatistics - facilitates this non-classical behavior. By stabilizing isolated\ncavities relative to vapor tubes, enhanced water density fluctuations thus\nstabilize novel pathways, which circumvent the classical barriers and offer\ndiminished resistance to dewetting. Our results thus suggest a key role for\nfluctuations in speeding up the kinetics of numerous phenomena ranging from\nCassie-Wenzel transitions on superhydrophobic surfaces, to\nhydrophobically-driven biomolecular folding and assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 22:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 21:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Methods in the\nformer category typically build on heuristic search using upper bounds on the\nvalue function. Unfortunately, no techniques exist to compute such upper bounds\nfor problems with non-factored value functions. To allow for meaningful\nbenchmarking through measurable quality guarantees on a very general class of\nproblems, this paper introduces a family of influence-optimistic upper bounds\nfor factored decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes\n(Dec-POMDPs) that do not have factored value functions. Intuitively, we derive\nbounds on very large multiagent planning problems by subdividing them in\nsub-problems, and at each of these sub-problems making optimistic assumptions\nwith respect to the influence that will be exerted by the rest of the system.\nWe numerically compare the different upper bounds and demonstrate how we can\nachieve a non-trivial guarantee that a heuristic solution for problems with\nhundreds of agents is close to optimal. Furthermore, we provide evidence that\nthe upper bounds may improve the effectiveness of heuristic influence search,\nand discuss further potential applications to multiagent planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 23:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 08:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

The problem\ngeneralizes the graph coloring problem and at the same time can be viewed as a\nspecial case of the $2$-CSP problem. In this paper, we prove several lower\nbound for HOM under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) assumption. The main\nresult is a lower bound $2^{\\Omega\\left( \\frac{n \\log h}{\\log \\log h}\\right)}$.\nThis rules out the existence of a single-exponential algorithm and shows that\nthe trivial upper bound $2^{{\\mathcal O}(n\\log{h})}$ is almost asymptotically\ntight.\n  We also investigate what properties of graphs $G$ and $H$ make it difficult\nto solve HOM$(G,H)$. An easy observation is that an ${\\mathcal O}(h^n)$ upper\nbound can be improved to ${\\mathcal O}(h^{\\operatorname{vc}(G)})$ where\n$\\operatorname{vc}(G)$ is the minimum size of a vertex cover of $G$. The second\nlower bound $h^{\\Omega(\\operatorname{vc}(G))}$ shows that the upper bound is\nasymptotically tight.

Since the chromatic number $\\chi(H)$ does not exceed\n$\\operatorname{tw}(H)$ and $\\Delta(H)+1$, it is natural to ask whether similar\nupper bounds with respect to $\\chi(H)$ can be obtained.

It\nis found that there are two types of zero modes (the $0-$level modes): a\n$q-$form zero mode and a $(q-1)-$form one, which cannot be localized on the\nbrane at the same time. For the $n-$level KK modes, there are two interacting\nKK modes, a massive $q-$form KK mode and a massless $(q-1)-$form one. By\nanalyzing gauge invariance of the effective action and choosing a gauge\ncondition, the $n-$level massive $q-$form KK mode decouples from the $n-$level\nmassless $(q-1)-$form one. It is also found that the Hodge duality in the bulk\nnaturally becomes two dualities on the brane. The first one is the Hodge\nduality between a $q-$form zero mode and a $(p-q-1)-$form one, or between a\n$(q-1)-$form zero mode and a $(p-q)-$form one. The second duality is between\ntwo group KK modes: one is an $n-$level massive $q-$form KK mode with mass\n$m_n$ and an $n-$level massless $(q-1)-$form mode; another is an $n-$level\n$(p-q)-$form one with the same mass $m_n$ and an $n-$level massless\n$(p-q-1)-$form mode.

It is possible to show that the deceleration parameter\nchanges sign at a given redshift according to observational data. Furthermore,\na $f(R)$ gravity cosmological model can be constructed in brane-antibrane\nsystem starting from the very early universe and accounting for the\ncosmological redshift at all phases of cosmic history, from inflation to late\ntime acceleration. Here we propose a $f(R)$ model where transition redshifts\ncorrespond to inflation-deceleration and deceleration-late time acceleration\ntransitions starting froma BIon system. At the point where the universe was\nborn, due to the transition of $k$ black fundamental strings to the BIon\nconfiguration, the redshift is approximately infinity and decreases with\nreducing temperature ($z\\sim T^{2}$). The BIon is a configuration in flat space\nof a universe-brane and a parallel anti-universe-brane connected by a wormhole.\nThis wormhole is a channel for flowing energy from extra dimensions into our\nuniverse, occurring at inflation and decreasing with redshift as $z\\sim\nT^{4+1/7}$. Dynamics consists with the fact that the wormhole misses its energy\nand vanishes as soon as inflation ends and deceleration begins. Approaching two\nuniverse branes together, a tachyon is originated, it grows up and causes the\nformation of a wormhole. We show that, in the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, the\ncosmological redshift depends on the tachyonic potential and has a significant\ndecrease at deceleration-late time acceleration transition point ($z\\sim\nT^{2/3}$). As soon as today acceleration approaches, the redshift tends to zero\nand the cosmological model reduces to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 08:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The trigger comprises three stages. A first\nstage employs programmable discriminators to digitize the signals arriving from\nthe camera channels (pixels). At the second stage, a grid of low-cost FPGAs is\nused to process the digitized signals for camera regions with 37 pixels. At the\nthird stage, trigger conditions found independently in any of the overlapping\n37-pixel regions are combined into a global camera trigger by few central\nFPGAs.

For instance, semelparous\nspecies whose adults reproduce once and die have shorter generation times than\niteroparous species that reproduce on several occasions. A shorter generation\ntime ensures a higher growth rate in stable environments where resources are in\nexcess, and is therefore a positively selected feature in this (rarely met)\nsituation. In a stable and limiting environment, all combination of traits (or\nstrategies) that produce the same number of viable offspring on average are\nstrictly neutral even when their generation times differ. We first study the\nevolution of life-history strategies with different generation times in this\ncontext, and show that those with the longest generation time represent the\nmost likely evolutionary outcomes. Indeed, strategies with longer generation\ntimes generate fewer mutants per time unit, which makes them less likely to be\nreplaced within a given time period. This `turnover bias' inevitably exists and\nfavors the evolution of strategies with long generation times. Its real impact,\nhowever, should depend on the strength and direction of other evolutionary\nforces; selection for short generation times, for instance, may oppose turnover\nbias. Likewise, the evolutionary outcome depends on the strength of such\nselection and population size, comparably to other biases acting on the\noccurrence of mutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 09:30:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 11:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 08:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-22"}

It has been conjectured that\nquantum analogs of classical mixing processes may offer a generic quadratic\nspeed-up in realizing such stationary distributions. Such a speed-up would also\nimply a speed-up of a broad family of heuristic algorithms.\n  However, a true quadratic speed up has thus far only been demonstrated for\nspecial classes of Markov chains. These results often presuppose a regular\nstructure of the underlying graph of the Markov chain, and also a regularity in\nthe transition probabilities.\n  In this work, we demonstrate a true quadratic speed-up for a class of Markov\nchains where the restriction is only on the form of the stationary\ndistribution, rather than directly on the Markov chain structure itself. In\nparticular, we show efficient mixing can be achieved when it is beforehand\nknown that the distribution is monotonically decreasing relative to a known\norder on the state space. Following this, we show that our approach extends to\na wider class of distributions, where only a fraction of the shape of the\ndistribution is known to be monotonic.

The main novelty of our approach is\nto envision sharing partial traveling information to the encountered vehicles\nfor better service. Our data forwarding algorithm utilizes this lightweight\ninformation under the delusive paths privacy preservation together with the\nsocial community structure in vehicular networks. We assume that data\ntransmission is carried by vehicles and road side units (RSUs), while cellular\nnetwork manages and coordinates relevant global information. The approximate\ndestination set is the set of RSUs that are often passed by the destination\nvehicle. RSU importance is raised by summing encounter ratios of RSUs in the\nsame connected component. We first define a concept of space-time\napproachability which is derived from shared partial traveling route and\nencounter information. It describes the capability of a vehicle to advance\nmessages toward destination. Then, we design a novel data forwarding algorithm,\ncalled approachability based algorithm, which combines the space-time\napproachability with the social community attribute in vehicular networks. We\nevaluate our approachability based algorithm on data sets from San Francisco\nCabspotting and Shanghai Taxi Movement.

As a result, hypersurfaces of constant khronon\ndefine a preferred foliation of the spacetime, and the khronon can be thought\nof as a physical absolute time. The MOND phenomenology arises as a result of\nthe presence, in the action, of terms depending on the acceleration of the\ncongruence orthogonal to the preferred foliation.

They are usually\nbelieved to be the result of fluid convection in combination with particle size\nsegregation. However, suspensions composed of uniformly sized particles also\ndevelop a granular front. Within a large rotating drum, a stationary\nrecirculating avalanche is generated. The flowing material is a mixture of a\nvisco-plastic fluid obtained from a kaolin-water dispersion, with spherical\nceramic particles denser than the fluid. The goal is to mimic the composition\nof many common granular-fluid materials, like fresh concrete or debris flow. In\nthese materials, granular and fluid phases have the natural tendency to\nsegregate due to particle settling. However, through the shearing caused by the\nrotation of the drum, a reorganization of the phases is induced, leading to the\nformation of a granular front. By tuning the material properties and the drum\nvelocity, it is possible to control this phenomenon. The setting is reproduced\nin a numerical environment, where the fluid is solved by a Lattice-Boltzmann\nMethod, and the particles are explicitly represented using the Discrete Element\nMethod. The simulations confirm the findings of the experiments, and provide\ninsight into the internal mechanisms. Comparing the time-scale of particle\nsettling with the one of particle recirculation, a non-dimensional number is\ndefined, and is found to be effective in predicting the formation of a granular\nfront.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 14:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

According to EMH, only 8 markets are\nclassified in uncorrelated processes at $2\\sigma$ confidence interval. 6 Stock\nmarkets belong to anti-correlated class and dominant part of markets has memory\nin corresponding daily index prices during January 1995 to February 2014.\nNew-Zealand with $H=0.457\\pm0.004$ and Jordan with $H=0.602\\pm 0.006$ are far\nfrom EMH. The nature of cross-correlation exponents based on AMF-DXA is almost\nmultifractal for all pair of Stock markets. The empirical relation, $H_{xy}\\le\n[H_{xx}+H_{yy}]/2$, is confirmed. Mentioned relation for $q>0$ is also\nsatisfied while for $q<0$ there is a deviation from this relation confirming\nbehavior of markets for small fluctuations is affected by contribution of major\npair. For larger fluctuations, the cross-correlation contains information from\nboth local and global conditions. Width of singularity spectrum for\nauto-correlation and cross-correlation are $\\Delta \\alpha_{xx}\\in\n[0.304,0.905]$ and $\\Delta \\alpha_{xy}\\in [0.246,1.178]$, respectively. The\nwide range of singularity spectrum for cross-correlation confirms that the\nbilateral relation between Stock markets is more complex. The value of\n$\\sigma_{DCCA}$ indicates that all pairs of stock market studied in this time\ninterval belong to cross-correlated processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 15:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 16:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}
