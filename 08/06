For example the transmission of numerical clock readings is implicit\nin the concept of a coordinate system. The transmission of numbers and other\nlogical distinctions is often achieved over a computer-mediated communications\nnetwork in the face of an unpredictable environment. By unpredictable we mean\nsomething stronger than the spread of probabilities over given possible\noutcomes, namely an opening to unforeseeable possibilities. Unpredictability,\nuntil now overlooked in theoretical physics, makes the transmission of numbers\ninteresting. Based on recent proofs within quantum theory that provide a\ntheoretical foundation to unpredictability, here we show how regularities in\nphysics rest on a background of channels over which numbers are transmitted.\n  As is known to engineers of digital communications, numerical transmissions\ndepend on coordination reminiscent of the cycle of throwing and catching by\nplayers tossing a ball back and forth. In digital communications, the players\nare computers, and the required coordination involves unpredictably adjusting\n\"live clocks\" that step these computers through phases of a cycle.

Via its logically synchronized channels, a network of\nlive clocks serves as a reference against which to locate events.

The goal of such approach is to\nconstruct an interpolant in space that corresponds to the \"best $M$-terms\"\nbased on sharp a priori estimate of polynomial coefficients. In the past, SG\nmethods have been successful in achieving this, with a traditional construction\nthat relies on the solution to a Knapsack problem: only the most profitable\nhierarchical surpluses are added to the SG. However, this approach requires\nadditional sharp estimates related to the size of the analytic region and the\nnorm of the interpolation operator, i.e., the Lebesgue constant. Instead, we\npresent an iterative SG procedure that adaptively refines an estimate of the\nregion and accounts for the effects of the Lebesgue constant.

At each iteration, an importance sampling proposal distribution is\nformed using an ensemble of particles. A stratified sample is taken from this\ndistribution and weighted under the posterior, a state-of-the-art ensemble\ntransport resampling method is then used to create an evenly weighted sample\nready for the next iteration. We demonstrate that this ensemble transport\nadaptive importance sampling (ETAIS) method outperforms MCMC methods with\nequivalent proposal distributions for low dimensional problems, and in fact\nshows better than linear improvements in convergence rates with respect to the\nnumber of ensemble members.

For all\nsystems a universal influence of both the electrical and thermal contact\nresistance is observed on the leg's efficiency, when the systems are analyzed\nin terms of the contribution of the contact resistance to the total resistance\nof the leg. The results are compared with the analytical model of Min and Rowe\n(1992). In order for the efficiency not to decrease more than 20%, the contact\nelectrical resistance should be less than 30% of the total leg resistance for\nzero thermal contact resistance, while the thermal contact resistance should be\nless than 20% for zero electrical contact resistance. The universal behavior\nalso allowed the maximum tolerable contact resistance for a segmented system to\nbe found, i.e. the resistance at which a leg of only the high temperature\nthermoelectric material has the same efficiency as the segmented leg with a\ncontact resistance at the interface.

Even with the\nrecent detection of extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube\nexperiment, no astrophysical neutrino source has yet been discovered. Transient\nsources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, or active galactic\nnuclei are promising candidates. Multi-messenger programs offer a unique\nopportunity to detect these transient sources. By combining the information\nprovided by the ANTARES neutrino telescope with information coming from other\nobservatories, the probability of detecting a source is enhanced, allowing the\npossibility of identifying a neutrino progenitor from a single detected event.\nA method based on optical and X-ray follow-ups of high-energy neutrino alerts\nhas been developed within the ANTARES collaboration. This program, denoted as\nTAToO, triggers a network of robotic optical telescopes (TAROT and ROTSE) and\nthe Swift-XRT with a delay of only a few seconds after a neutrino detection,\nand is therefore well-suited to search for fast transient sources.

These fields typically exist on \"sub-Larmor\nscales\" -- scales smaller than the electron Larmor radius. Electrons moving\nthrough such magnetic fields undergo small-angle stochastic deflections of\ntheir pitch-angles, thus establishing diffusive transport on long time-scales.\nWe show that this behavior, under certain conditions, is equivalent to Coulomb\ncollisions in collisional plasmas.

Variable selection\nfor kernel regression models is a challenge partly because, unlike the linear\nregression setting, there is no clear concept of an effect size for regression\ncoefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides an\neffect size analog of each explanatory variable for Bayesian kernel regression\nmodels when the kernel is shift-invariant --- for example, the Gaussian kernel.\nWe use function analytic properties of shift-invariant reproducing kernel\nHilbert spaces (RKHS) to define a linear vector space that: (i) captures\nnonlinear structure, and (ii) can be projected onto the original explanatory\nvariables. The projection onto the original explanatory variables serves as an\nanalog of effect sizes. The specific function analytic property we use is that\nshift-invariant kernel functions can be approximated via random Fourier bases.\nBased on the random Fourier expansion we propose a computationally efficient\nclass of Bayesian approximate kernel regression (BAKR) models for both\nnonlinear regression and binary classification for which one can compute an\nanalog of effect sizes. We illustrate the utility of BAKR by examining two\nimportant problems in statistical genetics: genomic selection (i.e. phenotypic\nprediction) and association mapping (i.e. inference of significant variants or\nloci).

SBIC simultaneously optimizes the weights of\nthe empirical similarity function and finds the locations of absent data\npoints. As such, SBIC uses an embedded mechanism for synthetic data generation\nwhich does not modify the training dataset, but alters the algorithm to suit\nimbalanced datasets. Therefore, SBIC uses the ideas of both major schools of\nthoughts in imbalanced classification: Like cost-sensitive approaches SBIC\noperates on an algorithm level to handle imbalanced structures; and similar to\nsynthetic data generation approaches, it utilizes the properties of unobserved\ndata points from the minority class.

Accurately measuring stellar masses is particularly important\nbecause they likely influence planet occurrence and the architectures of\nplanetary systems. Single main-sequence stars typically have masses estimated\nfrom evolutionary tracks, which generally provide accurate results due to their\nextensive empirical calibration. However, the validity of this method for\nsubgiants and giants has been called into question by recent studies, with\nsuggestions that the masses of these evolved stars could have been\noverestimated. We investigate these concerns using a sample of 59 benchmark\nevolved stars with model-independent masses (from binary systems or\nasteroseismology) obtained from the literature. We find very good agreement\nbetween these benchmark masses and the ones estimated using evolutionary\ntracks. The average fractional difference in the mass interval $\\sim$0.7 - 4.5\nM$_{\\odot}$, is consistent with zero (-1.30 $\\pm$ 2.42%), with no significant\ntrends in the residuals relative to the input parameters. A good agreement\nbetween model-dependent and -independent radii (-4.81 $\\pm$ 1.32%) and surface\ngravities (0.71 $\\pm$ 0.51%) is also found. The consistency between\nindependently determined ages for members of binary systems adds further\nsupport for the accuracy of the method employed to derive the stellar masses.\nTaken together, our results indicate that determination of masses of evolved\nstars using grids of evolutionary tracks is not significantly affected by\nsystematic errors, and is thus valid for estimating the masses of isolated\nstars beyond the main sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 01:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 22:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Our energy-resolved analysis shows the time delays are energy dependent.\nWe argue that the lag is unlikely to be a result of reflection from an\naccretion disc (`reverberation') based on the lack of reflection features in\nthe spectra, and the large size of the reflector inferred from the magnitude of\nthe lag.

We\nfocus on the case where each network has the same number of communities and the\ndependency links are restricted to be between pairs of communities of different\nnetworks. This is very realistic for infrastructure across cities. Each city\nhas its own infrastructures and different infrastructures are dependent within\nthe city.

In our example of cities\nthese nodes have long range links which are more likely to fail. For both\ntreelike and looplike interdependent modular networks we find distinct regimes\ndepending on the number of modules, $m$. (i) In the case where there are fewer\nmodules with strong intraconnections, the system first separates into modules\nin an abrupt first-order transition and then each module undergoes a second\npercolation transition.

It is roughly $1.5$\nkpc wide and has an integrated $V$-band luminosity of at least $M_V = -7.4$.\nThe stellar populations in the feature are indistinguishable from those in the\nouter LMC disk. We attempt to quantify the geometry of the outer disk using\nsimple planar models, and find that only a disk with mild intrinsic ellipticity\ncan simultaneously explain the observed stellar density on the sky and the\nazimuthal line-of-sight distance profile. We also see possible non-planar\nbehaviour in the outer disk that may reflect a warp and/or flare, as well as\ndeviations that resemble a ring-like structure between $\\sim9-12$ degrees from\nthe LMC centre. Based on all these observations, we conclude that our remote,\nstream-like feature is likely comprised of material that has been stripped from\nthe outskirts of the LMC disk, although we cannot rule out that it represents a\ntransient overdensity in the disk itself. We conduct a simple $N$-body\nsimulation to show that either type of structure could plausibly arise due to\nthe tidal force of the Milky Way; however we also recognize that a recent close\ninteraction between the LMC and the SMC may be the source of the stripping or\nperturbation. Finally, we observe evidence for extremely diffuse LMC\npopulations extending to radii of $\\sim 18.5$ kpc in the disk plane ($\\approx\n20$ degrees on the sky), corroborating previous spectroscopic detections at\ncomparable distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 10:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 02:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

However, the relevance of DM annihilations in halos for\ncosmological observables is still subject to debate, with previous works\nreaching different conclusions on this point. Also, all previous studies used a\nsingle type of parameterization for the astrophysical reionization, and\nincluded no astrophysical source for the heating of the intergalactic medium.\nIn this work, we revisit these problems. When standard approaches are adopted,\nwe find that the ionization fraction does exhibit a very particular (and\npotentially constraining) pattern, but the currently measurable optical depth\nto reionization is left almost unchanged: In agreement with the most of the\nprevious literature, for plausible halo models we find that the modification of\nthe signal with respect to the one coming from annihilations in the smooth\nbackground is tiny, below cosmic variance within currently allowed parameter\nspace. However, if different and probably more realistic treatments of the\nastrophysical sources of reionization and heating are adopted, a more\npronounced effect of the DM annihilation in halos is possible. We thus conclude\nthat within currently adopted baseline models the impact of the virialised DM\nstructures cannot be uncovered by CMB power spectra measurements, but a larger\nimpact is possible if peculiar models are invoked for the redshift evolution of\nthe DM annihilation signal or different assumptions are made for the\nastrophysical contributions.

Here we present\nplasma diagnostics on a tornado-like structure and its surroundings, seen above\nthe limb by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) aboard the\nHinode satellite. We aim to extend our view of the velocity patterns seen in\ntornado-like structures with EIS to a wider range of temperatures and to\nprovide insight into the physical characteristics of the plasma. Using Gaussian\nfitting to fit and de-blend the spectral lines seen by EIS, we calculated\nline-of-sight velocities and non-thermal line widths. Along with information\nfrom the CHIANTI database, we used line intensity ratios to calculate electron\ndensities at each pixel. Using a regularised inversion code we also calculated\nthe differential emission measure (DEM) at different locations in the\nprominence. The split Doppler-shift pattern is found to be visible down to a\ntemperature of around log(T) = 6.0. At temperatures lower than this, the\npattern is unclear in this data set. We obtain an electron density of log(n_e)\n= 8.5 when looking towards the centre of the tornado structure at a plasma\ntemperature of log(T) = 6.2, as compared to the surroundings of the tornado\nstructure where we find log(n_e) to be nearer 9.

These are of particular\ninterest as the neutralino annihilation models which fit these observations\nmight have observable consequences from radio to gamma-ray emission. Since dark\nmatter is expected to be a major matter constituent of cosmic structure, these\nmulti-frequency consequences should also be common to structures across the\nmass spectrum. Thus, in this work we make predictions for the multi-frequency\nspectra of three well-known sources dominated by dark matter, e.g. the Coma\ncluster, the galaxy M81, and the Draco dwarf galaxy using models favoured by\ndark matter interpretations of the aforementioned observations.

In a given experimental setting - here\ntaken as in the JUNO project for definiteness - the achievable hierarchy\nsensitivity and parameter accuracy depend not only on the accumulated\nstatistics but also on systematic uncertainties, which include (but are not\nlimited to) the mass-mixing priors and the normalizations of signals and\nbackgrounds. We examine, in addition, the effect of introducing smooth\ndeformations of the detector energy scale, E -> E'(E), and of the reactor flux\nshape, Phi(E) -> Phi'(E), within reasonable error bands inspired by\nstate-of-the-art estimates. It turns out that energy-scale and flux-shape\nsystematics can noticeably affect the performance of a JUNO-like experiment,\nboth on the hierarchy discrimination and on precision oscillation physics. It\nis shown that a significant reduction of the assumed energy-scale and\nflux-shape uncertainties (by, say, a factor of 2) would be highly beneficial to\nthe physics program of medium-baseline reactor projects. Our results also shed\nsome light on the role of the inverse-beta decay threshold, of geoneutrino\nbackgrounds, and of matter effects in the analysis of future reactor\noscillation data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 13:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 16:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

We found several compounds that are stable under pressure,\ni.e. HCl, H$_2$Cl, H$_3$Cl, H$_5$Cl and H$_4$Cl$_7$, which display a rich\nvariety of chemical bonding types. At ambient pressure, H$_2$, Cl$_2$ and HCl\nmolecular crystals are formed by weak intermolecular van der Waals interactions\nand adjacent HCl molecules connect with each other to form asymmetric zigzag\nchains, which become symmetric under high pressure. In hydrogen-rich chlorides,\nH$_2$ and HCl react to form the thermodynamically stable H$_3$Cl crystalline\ncompound in which molecular cyclic H$_3^+$ cations are stabilised by the Cl$^-$\nsublattice. Increasing the amount of hydrogen leads to stable solid-state\nH$_5$Cl, in which H$_2$ formally combines with H$_3^+$ to form H$_5^+$ cations.\nAdditionally, chlorine-based Kagom\\'e layers are formed with intercalated\nzigzag HCl chains in chlorine-rich hydrides.

Many feature selection algorithms use information\ncontained within a gene set as a biological priori, and select relevant\nfeatures by incorporating such information. Thus, an integration of gene set\nanalysis with feature selection is highly desired.

This brief paper derives the complete\nparaxial system for the case of acoustics in the presence of an inhomogeneous\nisotopic time independent media described by a sound speed profile c(x,y,z).\nThe derivation is performed for three distinct conformal representations of the\nacoustic metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 19:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

The Principle of\nMaximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the ambiguities associated with the\nconventional renormalization scale-setting procedure, giving predictions which\nare independent of the choice of renormalization scheme. The scales of the QCD\ncouplings and the effective number of quark flavors are set order by order in\nthe pQCD series. The PMC has a solid theoretical foundation, satisfying the\nstandard renormalization group invariance and all of the the self-consistency\nconditions derived from the renormalization group......In this brief report, we\nsummarize the results of our recent PMC applications for a number of collider\nprocesses, emphasizing their generality and applicability....... These results\ndemonstrate that the application of the PMC systematically eliminates a major\ntheoretical uncertainty for pQCD predictions, thus increasing the sensitivity\nof the colliders to possible new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 03:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 14:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

While\nthe response to perturbations has been quantified, recovery strategies for\nperturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through\nanecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science-based quantitative\nmethods framework for measuring, comparing and interpreting hazard responses\nand as well as recovery strategies. The framework, motivated by the recently\nproposed temporal resilience paradigm, is demonstrated with the Indian Railways\nNetwork. The methods are demonstrated through the resilience of the network to\nnatural or human-induced hazards and electric grid failure. Simulations\ninspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as\nwell as a cyber-physical attack scenario. Multiple metrics are used to generate\nvarious recovery strategies, which are simply sequences in which system\ncomponents should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of\nrecovery strategies suggests that faster and more resource-effective recovery\nis possible through network centrality measures. Case studies based on two\nhistorical events, specifically the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2012\nNorth Indian blackout, and a simulated cyber-physical attack scenario, provides\nmeans for interpreting the relative performance of various recovery strategies.\nQuantitative evaluation of recovery strategies suggests that faster and more\nresource-effective restoration is possible through network centrality measures,\neven though the specific strategy may be different for sub-networks or for the\npartial recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 22:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 14:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 03:29:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 21:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}
