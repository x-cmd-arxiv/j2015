The broken isotropy\nenables us to carefully test a large variety of theoretically predicted\ntwo-particle features by quantitatively comparing them to the results of\nBrownian dynamics simulations. Specifically, we determine and compare the\none-particle density, the total correlation functions, their contact values,\nand the force distributions acting on a particle. For this purpose, we follow\nthe compressibility route and theoretically calculate the direct correlation\nfunctions by taking functional derivatives. We usually observe an excellent\nagreement between theory and simulations, except for small deviations in cases\nwhere local crystal-like order sets in. Our results set the course for further\ninvestigations on the consistency of functionals as well as for structural\nanalysis on, e.g., the primitive model.

Hence, a bipartite maximally entangled state is a state\nwhich can be transformed deterministically into any other state via LOCC. In\nthe multipartite setting no such state exists. There, rather a whole set, the\nMaximally Entangled Set of states (MES), which we recently introduced, is\nrequired. This set has on the one hand the property that any state outside of\nthis set can be obtained via LOCC from one of the states within the set and on\nthe other hand, no state in the set can be obtained from any other state via\nLOCC. Recently, we studied LOCC transformations among pure multipartite states\nand derived the MES for 3- and generic 4-qubit states.

This paper explores the effect of the\nenvironment on H II regions in the MonR2 molecular cloud. We aim to investigate\nthe density structure of envelopes surrounding HII regions and to determine\ntheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. The Mon R2 molecular cloud is an\nideal target since it hosts an H II region association. Column density and\ntemperature images derived from Herschel data were used together to model the\nstructure of HII bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. The resulting\nobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the Mon R2\nionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. The\nfour hot bubbles associated with H II regions are surrounded by dense, cold,\nand neutral gas envelopes. The radial density profiles are reminiscent of those\nof low-mass protostellar envelopes. The inner parts of envelopes of all four\nHII regions could be free-falling because they display shallow density\nprofiles. As for their outer parts, the two compact HII regions show a density\nprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.\nIn contrast, the central UCHii region shows a steeper outer profile, that could\nbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. The size of the heated\nbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initial\nneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,\n0.1Myr,for the dense UCHII and compact HII regions and 0.35 Myr for the\nextended HII region. The envelope transition radii between the shallow and\nsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since the\nformation of the first proto stellar embryo, Tinf : 1Myr, for the\nultra-compact, 1.5 / 3Myr for the compact, and greater than 6Myr for the\nextended HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 17:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

This means that one uses worst-case\nanalysis of the recursive procedure that creates the sub-instances. We develop\na new analysis method that is more refined than the worst-case analysis. We\ntake the shape of instances in the computation tree into consideration and\namortise against certain \"bad\" instances that are created as the recursion\nproceeds. This enables us to show correlation decay and to obtain an FPTAS even\nwhen SSM fails.\n  We apply our technique to the problem of approximately counting independent\nsets in hypergraphs with degree upper-bound Delta and with a lower bound k on\nthe arity of hyperedges. Liu and Lin gave an FPTAS for k>=2 and Delta<=5 (lack\nof SSM was the obstacle preventing this algorithm from being generalised to\nDelta=6).

The best previously-known approximation scheme\nfor Delta=6 is the Markov-chain simulation based FPRAS of Bordewich, Dyer and\nKarpinski, which only works for k>=8.\n  Our technique also applies for larger values of k, giving an FPTAS for\nk>=Delta. This bound is not substantially stronger than existing randomised\nresults in the literature. Nevertheless, it gives the first deterministic\napproximation scheme in this regime.

We present the results from a noise analysis for 42\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed with the European Pulsar Timing Array. For\ncharacterising the low-frequency, stochastic and achromatic noise component, or\n\"timing noise\", we employ two methods, based on Bayesian and frequentist\nstatistics. For 25 MSPs, we achieve statistically significant measurements of\ntheir timing noise parameters and find that the two methods give consistent\nresults. For the remaining 17 MSPs, we place upper limits on the timing noise\namplitude at the 95% confidence level. We additionally place an upper limit on\nthe contribution to the pulsar noise budget from errors in the reference\nterrestrial time standards (below 1%), and we find evidence for a noise\ncomponent which is present only in the data of one of the four used telescopes.\nFinally, we estimate that the timing noise of individual pulsars reduces the\nsensitivity of this data set to an isotropic, stochastic GW background by a\nfactor of >9.1 and by a factor of >2.3 for continuous GWs from resolvable,\ninspiralling supermassive black-hole binaries with circular orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 18:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 17:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 00:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The aim here is\nto enable the decoder to first tackle easier portions of the sequences, and\nthen turn to cope with difficult parts. Specifically, in each iteration, an\nencoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is employed to, from the\ninput sequence, automatically create features to represent the internal states\nof and formulate a list of potential actions for the DQN. Take rephrasing a\nnatural sentence as an example. This list can contain ranked potential words.\nNext, the DQN learns to make decision on which action (e.g., word) will be\nselected from the list to modify the current decoded sequence. The newly\nmodified output sequence is subsequently used as the input to the DQN for the\nnext decoding iteration. In each iteration, we also bias the reinforcement\nlearning's attention to explore sequence portions which are previously\ndifficult to be decoded. For evaluation, the proposed strategy was trained to\ndecode ten thousands natural sentences. Our experiments indicate that, when\ncompared to a left-to-right greedy beam search LSTM decoder, the proposed\nmethod performed competitively well when decoding sentences from the training\nset, but significantly outperformed the baseline when decoding unseen\nsentences, in terms of BLEU score obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 19:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

In\nparticular, we present the predictions of our model for the C/Fe and O/Fe\nratios, in connection with the spectral anomalies found by the ATIC-2\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 19:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

We use a representation of the problem via the $CP^{N-1}$ sigma\nmodel in the limit $N \\rightarrow 1$ to determine the stability of this\ncritical point. First we prove that the DS critical exponents are robust, so\nlong as the polymer does not cross itself: they can arise in a generic lattice\nmodel, and do not require fine tuning. This resolves a longstanding theoretical\nquestion. However there is an apparent paradox: two different lattice models,\napparently both in the DS universality class, show different numbers of\nrelevant perturbations, apparently leading to contradictory conclusions about\nthe stability of the DS exponents. We explain this in terms of subtle\ndifferences between the two models, one of which is fine-tuned (and not\nstrictly in the DS universality class). Next, we allow the polymer to cross\nitself, as appropriate e.g. to the quasi-2D case. This introduces an additional\nindependent relevant perturbation, so we do not expect the DS exponents to\napply. The exponents in the case with crossings will be those of the generic\ntricritical $O(n)$ model at $n=0$, and different to the case without crossings.\nWe also discuss interesting features of the operator content of the $CP^{N-1}$\nmodel. Simple geometrical arguments show that two operators in this field\ntheory, with very different symmetry properties, have the same scaling\ndimension for any value of $N$ (equivalently, any value of the loop fugacity).\nAlso we argue that for any value of $N$ the $CP^{N-1}$ model has a marginal\nparity-odd operator which is related to the loops' winding angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 19:56:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 23:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

Our analysis shows that major migration traps\ngenerally occur where the disk surface density gradient changes sign from\npositive to negative, around 20--300$R_{\\rm g}$, where $R_{\\rm g}=2GM/c^{2}$ is\nthe Schwarzschild radius. At these traps, massive objects in the AGN disk can\naccumulate, collide, scatter, and accrete. Intermediate mass black hole\nformation is likely in these disk locations, which may lead to preferential gap\nand cavity creation at these radii. Our model thus has significant implications\nfor SMBH growth as well as gravitational wave source populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 21:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by\nthe evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer\nrapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational\nvelocity $v_e \\sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars\nin our sample is 65\\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the\nrelatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing\nrotational spin-down must be efficient.

The Planck l>=1000 constraints\nare also in tension with low-redshift data sets, including Planck's own\nmeasurement of the CMB lensing power spectrum (2.4 sigma), and the most precise\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale determination (2.5 sigma). The Hubble\nconstant predicted by Planck from l>=1000, H_0=64.1+/-1.7 km/s/Mpc, disagrees\nwith the most precise local distance ladder measurement of 73.0+/-2.4 km/s/Mpc\nat the 3.0 sigma level, while the Planck value from l<1000, 69.7+/-1.7\nkm/s/Mpc, is consistent within 1 sigma. A discrepancy between the Planck and\nSouth Pole Telescope (SPT) high-multipole CMB spectra disfavors interpreting\nthese tensions as evidence for new physics. We conclude that the parameters\nfrom the Planck high-multipole spectrum probably differ from the underlying\nvalues due to either an unlikely statistical fluctuation or unaccounted-for\nsystematics persisting in the Planck data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 01:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 19:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

It is a mystery\nhow neurons integrate the input from so many synapses and what kind of\nlarge-scale network behavior this enables. It has been previously proposed that\nnon-linear properties of dendrites enable neurons to recognize multiple\npatterns. In this paper we extend this idea by showing that a neuron with\nseveral thousand synapses arranged along active dendrites can learn to\naccurately and robustly recognize hundreds of unique patterns of cellular\nactivity, even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation.\nWe then propose a neuron model where some of the patterns recognized by a\nneuron lead to action potentials and define the classic receptive field of the\nneuron, whereas the majority of the patterns recognized by a neuron act as\npredictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without immediately generating\nan action potential. We then present a network model based on neurons with\nthese properties and show that the network learns a robust model of time-based\nsequences. Given the similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex\nand the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose\nthat this form of sequence memory is a universal property of neocortical\ntissue. We further propose that cellular layers in the neocortex implement\nvariations of the same sequence memory algorithm to achieve different aspects\nof inference and behavior. The neuron and network models we introduce are\nrobust over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse\ndistributed code of cellular activations. The sequence capacity of the network\nscales linearly with the number of synapses on each neuron. Thus neurons need\nthousands of synapses to learn the many temporal patterns in sensory stimuli\nand motor sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 06:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 21:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

Compare with previous works in other quantum systems for\na distributed quantum computing, under the all-resonance regime, the present\nproposal does not require classical pulses and ancillary qubits, which relaxes\nthe difficulty of its implementation largely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 06:47:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 16:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Sep 2018 05:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

The object\nboundaries are represented as chains of connected segments and the database\nimages are pre-processed to obtain such chains that have a high chance of\ncontaining the object. This is accomplished using two approaches in this work:\na) extracting long chains in contour segment networks and b) extracting\nboundaries of segmented object proposals.

This\nmatching mechanism is used to generate a hierarchical k-medoids based indexing\nstructure for the extracted chains of all database images in an offline process\nwhich is used to efficiently retrieve a small set of possible matched images\nfor query chains. Finally, a geometric verification step is employed to test\ngeometric consistency of multiple chain matches to improve results.

Segmentation is a fundamental\ncomponent of image processing, and plays a significant role in computer vision,\nobject recognition, and object tracking. Active Contour Models (ACMs)\nconstitute a powerful energy-based minimization framework for image\nsegmentation, which relies on the concept of contour evolution. Starting from\nan initial guess, the contour is evolved with the aim of approximating better\nand better the actual object boundary. Handling complex images in an efficient,\neffective, and robust way is a real challenge, especially in the presence of\nintensity inhomogeneity, overlap between the foreground/background intensity\ndistributions, objects characterized by many different intensities, and/or\nadditive noise. In this thesis, to deal with these challenges, we propose a\nnumber of image segmentation models relying on variational level set methods\nand specific kinds of neural networks, to handle complex images in both\nsupervised and unsupervised ways. Experimental results demonstrate the high\naccuracy of the segmentation results, obtained by the proposed models on\nvarious benchmark synthetic and real images compared with state-of-the-art\nactive contour models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 11:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

Then, CVaR optimization is analysed in the context of portfolio selection\nand how to apply CVaR optimization for hedging a portfolio consisting of\noptions. The original contributions in this part are an alternative proof of\nAcerbi's Integral Formula in the continuous case and an explicit programme\nformulation for portfolio hedging.\n  The second part first analyses the Scaled and Non-Scaled CVaR norm as new\nfamily of norms in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and compares this new norm family to the more\nwidely known $L_p$ norms.

However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,\n084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact\nt=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and\nthat it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory. It is shown that the t=0+ limit of the new rate expression\nvanishes in the exact quantum limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 15:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 02:37:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 15:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The time dependence behaviour of the scalar\ncondensation and Maxwell fields are fitted numerically. A usual value for\nMaxwell field on AdS horizon is $\\exp(-bt)$, and the exponential $\\log$ ratio\nis therefore $10^{-8} s^{-1}$. The coefficient $b$ of the time in the\nexponential term $\\exp(-bt)$ can be interpreted as a tool to measure the degree\nof dynamical instability, its reciprocal $\\frac{1}{b}$ is the time in which the\ndisturbance is multiplied in the ratio.
