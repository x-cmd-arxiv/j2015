How the bubbles connect to the Galactic plane is unclear. We\nfind that bubble-like emission is not only found in the halo, but it is\nstrongly present in the Galactic plane as well with a morphology close to the\nspatial distribution of the 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line from 26Al, a radioactive\nnucleus synthesized in SNRs. In addition, the spectral shape of this hard\ncomponent coincides with the predicted spectrum from cosmic rays trapped in\nsources. Hence, we propose that the bubble-like emission in the plane has a\nhadronic origin, which arises from SCRs. The bubbles in the halo have the same\nenergy spectrum, which suggests that they are outflows from the plane with the\ngamma-rays arising from hadronic interactions of protons trapped in a plasma of\nadvected gas. Towards the Galactic center (GC) we observe the 1-3 GeV excess,\nbut observe this excess in addition in all regions where there is strong 26Al\nproduction. This excludes the dark matter annihilation interpretation. Instead,\nwe propose that the excess is caused by a deficit of the CRs at low rigidities\nin the regions of dense molecular clouds, which are characterized by higher\nenergy losses and stronger stellar winds. The 26Al line is a tracer of such\nregions. If we introduce a break in the cosmic ray injection spectra in the\nregions of strong 26Al production to effectively take the deficit of low\nrigidity CRs into account, the excess in the Galactic plane and towards the GC\nboth disappear. We thus conclude that the excess in the Galactic center is\nlargely an artefact from the excess in the Galactic plane. The correlation\nbetween the two originates simply from the lines-of-sight towards the GC\ncrossing the Galactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 16:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

The algorithm\npropagates an ensemble of particles in the product space of model parameters\nand outputs. Each particle update consists of a random jump in parameter space\nfollowed by a simulation of a model output and a Metropolis\nacceptance/rejection step based on a comparison of the simulated output to the\ndata. The distance of a particle to the data is interpreted as an energy and\nthe algorithm is reducing the associated temperature of the ensemble such that\nentropy production is minimized. If this simulated annealing is not too fast\ncompared to the mixing speed in parameter space, the parameter marginal of the\nensemble approaches the Bayesian posterior distribution. Annealing is adaptive\nand depends on certain extensive thermodynamic quantities that can easily be\nmeasured throughout run-time. In the general case, we propose annealing with a\nconstant entropy production rate, which is optimal as long as annealing is not\ntoo fast. For the practically relevant special case of no prior knowledge, we\nderive an optimal fast annealing schedule with a non-constant entropy\nproduction rate.

All measurements are\nmade in a human-supervised manner so that attention is paid to each galaxy. We\nused isophotal analysis, unsharp masking, and fitting ellipses to measured\nstructures. We find that the sizes of the inner rings and lenses normalized to\nbarlength correlate with the galaxy mass: the normalized sizes increase toward\nthe less massive galaxies; it has been suggested that this is related to the\nlarger dark matter content in the bar region in these systems. Bars in the low\nmass galaxies are also less concentrated, likely to be connected to the mass\ncut-off in the appearance of the nuclear rings and lenses. We also show\nobservational evidence that barlenses indeed form part of the bar, and that a\nlarge fraction of the inner lenses in the non-barred galaxies could be former\nbarlenses in which the thin outer bar component has dissolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 16:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 14:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

This paper discusses our\nstudy of a sample of 17 moderately (r-I) and highly (r-II) r-process-element\nenhanced VMP and EMP stars. High-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra of the\nstars were obtained at roughly monthly intervals over 8 years with the FIES\nspectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. From these spectra, radial\nvelocities with an accuracy of ~100 m/s were determined by cross-correlation\nagainst an optimized template. 14 of the programme stars exhibit no significant\nRV variation over this period, while 3 are binaries with orbits of typical\neccentricity for their periods, resulting in a normal binary frequency of\n~18+-6% for the sample. Our results confirm our preliminary conclusion from\n2011, based on partial data, that the chemical peculiarity of the r-I and r-II\nstars is not caused by any putative binary companions. Instead, it was\nimprinted on the natal molecular clouds of these stars by an external, distant\nsource. Models of the ISM in early galaxies should account for such mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 17:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

In consequence our ability to include them\nin the wider context of the formation and evolution of PNe is directly\naffected. Why most structures have lower densities than the PN shells hosting\nthem? Is their intense emission in low-ionization lines the key to their main\nexcitation mechanism? Therefore, if considered altogether, can LISs line\nratios, chemical abundances and kinematics enlighten the interplay between the\ndifferent excitation and formation processes? Here we present a spectroscopic\nanalysis of five PNe that possess LISs confirming that all nebular components\nhave comparable electron temperatures, whereas the electron density is\nsystematically lower in LISs than in the surrounding nebula. Chemical\nabundances of LISs versus other PN components do not show significant\ndifferences as well.

Here we used a few cycle infrared \\lambda_{0}~1800nm source[3]\nand observed direct evidences for inner-shell excitations through the\nlaser-induced electron recollision process. It is the first step toward\ntime-resolved core-hole studies in the keV energy range with sub-femtosecond\ntime resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 18:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The present study\nsystematically examined the catalytic behavior of pure M1 phases prepared by\nselective dissolution of the M2 phase in MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O catalysts in\naqueous hydrogen peroxide. It confirmed that the MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O M1 phases\nare highly active and selective for propane and propylene ammoxidation, while\nthe MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O M2 phases were active and selective in propylene\nammoxidation only.

The findings of this study do not support\nthe existence of the synergy effect for any M1/M2 compositional variant.\nInstead, the observed behavior of MoV(Te,Sb)(Nb,Ta)O catalysts was consistent\nwith partial loss of some surface active species from the M1 phase surface\nduring the H2O2 treatment and generation of fresh ab planes of the M1 phase via\nmechanical grinding of the H2O2-treated M1 phase.

We\nshow that models satisfying these assumptions dominate over contributions to\nIGM heating from stellar populations, and cause the 21 cm brightness\ntemperature to rise at $z > 20$. An absence of such a signature in the\nforthcoming observational data would imply that SMBH formation occurred later\n(e.g. via so-called direct collapse scenarios), that it was not a common\noccurrence in early galaxies and protogalaxies, or that it produced far fewer\nX-rays than empirical trends at lower redshifts, either due to intrinsic\ndimness (radiative inefficiency) or Compton-thick obscuration close to the\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 20:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

In particular, X-rays are very\nefficient at heating the IGM before it became completely ionized, an effect\nthat can be measured through the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. High-mass\nX-ray binaries (HMXBs), known to be prolific X-ray sources in star-forming\ngalaxies at lower redshifts, are prime candidates for driving the thermal\nevolution of the IGM at redshifts $z > 20$. Despite their importance, the\nformation efficiency of HMXBs from the first stellar populations is not well\nunderstood---as such, their collective X-ray emission and the subsequent\nimprint on the 21 cm signature are usually evaluated using free parameters.\nUsing $N$-body simulations, we estimate the rate of HMXB formation via mutual\ngravitational interactions of nascent, small groups of the first stars (Pop III\nstars). We run two sets of calculations: one in which stars form in small\ngroups of five in nearly Keplerian initial orbits, and another in which two\nsuch groups collide (expected from mergers of host protogalaxies). We find that\nHMXBs form at a rate of one per $~10^{4}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ in newly born stars,\nand that they emit with a power of $\\sim 10^{41} ~{\\rm erg}~{\\rm s} ^{-1}$ in\nthe $2-10$ keV band per solar mass per year of star formation. This value is a\nfactor $\\sim 10^{2}$ larger than what is observed in star forming galaxies at\nlower redshifts; the X-ray production from early HMXBs would have been even\nmore copious, if they also formed $in$ $situ$ or via migration in protostellar\ndisks. Combining our results with earlier studies suggests that early HMXBs\nwere highly effective at heating the IGM and leaving a strong 21 cm signature.\nWe discuss broader implications of our results, such as the rate of long GRBs\nfrom PopIII stars and the direct collapse black hole formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 20:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Since, a tunnel magnetoresistance signal\ncarries the information of the spin texture, it is proposed that spin-polarized\ntunneling of electrons to a 3D TI surface can be used to uniquely identify the\nsurface potentials and quantitatively characterize them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 20:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 21:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

Among the\nmany classification methods, Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a\ntraditional model-based approach which makes use of the covariance information.\nHowever, in the high-dimensional, low-sample size setting, LDA cannot be\ndirectly deployed because the sample covariance is not invertible. While there\nare modern methods designed to deal with high-dimensional data, they may not\nfully use the covariance information as LDA does. Hence in some situations, it\nis still desirable to use a model-based method such as LDA for classification.\nThis article exploits the potential of LDA in more complicated data settings.\nIn many real applications, it is costly to manually place labels on\nobservations; hence it is often that only a small portion of labeled data is\navailable while a large number of observations are left without a label. It is\na great challenge to obtain good classification performance through the labeled\ndata alone, especially when the dimension is greater than the size of the\nlabeled data. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a semi-supervised\nsparse LDA classifier to take advantage of the seemingly useless unlabeled\ndata. They provide additional information which helps to boost the\nclassification performance in some situations. A direct estimation method is\nused to reconstruct LDA and achieve the sparsity; meanwhile we employ the\ndifference-convex algorithm to handle the non-convex loss function associated\nwith the unlabeled data. Theoretical properties of the proposed classifier are\nstudied. Our simulated examples help to understand when and how the information\nextracted from the unlabeled data can be useful. A real data example further\nillustrates the usefulness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 20:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

Since the support of sparse precision matrix\nrepresents the conditional independence graph among matrix entries, conducting\nsupport recovery yields valuable information. A commonly used approach is the\npenalized log-likelihood method. However, due to the complicated structure of\nprecision matrices in the form of Kronecker product, the log-likelihood is\nnon-convex, which presents challenges for both computation and theoretical\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach by formulating the\nsupport recovery problem into a multiple testing problem. A new test statistic\nis developed and based on that, we use the popular Benjamini and Hochberg's\nprocedure to control false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically. Our method\ninvolves only convex optimization, making it computationally attractive.\nTheoretically, our method allows very weak conditions, i.e., even when the\nsample size is finite and the dimensions go to infinity, the asymptotic\nnormality of the test statistics and FDR control can still be guaranteed. We\nfurther provide the power analysis result. The finite sample performance of the\nproposed method is illustrated by both simulated and real data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 21:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 02:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

Large samples of\ndijet, Z+jets, and photon+jet events at the LHC allowed the calibration of jets\nwith high precision, leading to very small systematic uncertainties. Both ATLAS\nand CMS achieved a jet energy calibration uncertainty of about 1% in the\ncentral detector region and for jets with transverse momentum pT>100 GeV.

In many critical applications\nsuch as large-scale search and pattern matching, finding the nearest neighbors\nto a query is a fundamental research problem. However, the straightforward\nsolution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive\ncomputational complexity and memory requirement. In response, Approximate\nNearest Neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular\ndue to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior\nrandomized hashing methods, e.g., Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH), explore\ndata-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations.\nAlthough having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain\nmetric spaces, performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in\nmany real-world applications. As a remedy, new approaches incorporating\ndata-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have\nemerged. Such learning to hash methods exploit information such as data\ndistributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions.\nImportantly, the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of\nneighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The\ngoal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of\ninsights, pros and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive\nsurvey of the learning to hash framework and representative techniques of\nvarious types, including unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised. In\naddition, we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep\nlearning models. Finally, we discuss the future direction and trends of\nresearch in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 23:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

The\nfrequency shifts in the degree range of 180-1200 are correlated with different\nproxies of solar activity e.g. 10.7 cm radio flux, the International Sunspot\nNumber and the strength of the local magnetic field. In general, a good\nagreement is found between the shifts and activity indices, and the correlation\ncoefficients are found to be comparable with intermediate degree mode\nfrequencies. Analyzing the frequency shifts separately for the two cycles, we\nfind that cycle 24 is weaker than cycle 23. Since the magnetic activity is\nknown to be different in the two hemisphere, for the first time, we compute the\nfrequency shifts over the two hemispheres separately and find that the shifts\nalso display hemispheric asymmetry; the amplitude of shifts in the northern\nhemisphere peaked during late 2011, more than two years earlier than the south.\nWe further correlate the hemispheric frequency shifts with the hemispheric\nsunspot number and mean magnetic activity index. Since the frequency shifts and\nthe hemispheric activity indices are found to be significantly correlated, we\nsuggest that the shifts be used as an indicator of hemispheric activity since\nnot many indices are measured over the two hemispheres separately. We also\ninvestigate the variation at different latitudinal bands and conclude that the\nshifts in active latitudes correlate well with the local magnetic activity\nindex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 23:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The aim of this research is to estimate the\nprevalence of this phenomenon and its characteristic signatures. We analysed 21\nactive regions (NOAA 11637--11657) observed in January 2013 in the 171 A\nchannel of SDO/AIA. For each active region we inspected six hours of\nobservations, constructing time-distance plots for the slits positioned across\npronounced bright loops.

Low-amplitude decayless\nkink oscillations are found to be present in the majority of the analysed\nactive regions. The oscillation periods lie in the range from 1.5 to\n10~minutes. In two active regions with insufficient observation conditions we\ndid not identify any oscillation patterns. The oscillation periods are found to\nincrease with the length of the oscillating loop.

We note that some of the $3$-bichromatic STSs,\nconstructed by Colbourn, Dinitz and Rosa, have cross-free sets of size close to\n$6k$ (but cannot have size exactly $6k$).\n  The constructed STS$(18k+3)$ shows that equality is possible for $n=18k+3$ in\nthe following result: in every $3$-coloring of the blocks of any Steiner triple\nsystem STS$(n)$ there is a monochromatic connected component of size at least\n$\\lceil{2n\\over 3}\\rceil+1$ (we conjecture that equality holds for every\nadmissible $n$).\n  The analogue problem can be asked for $r$-colorings as well, if $r-1 \\equiv\n1,3 \\mbox{ (mod 6)}$ and $r-1$ is a prime power, we show that the answer is the\nsame as in case of complete graphs: in every $r$-coloring of the blocks of any\nSTS$(n)$, there is a monochromatic connected component with at least ${n\\over\nr-1}$ points, and this is sharp for infinitely many $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 07:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

This\nis because visual data often forms a special structure lying on a lower\ndimensional space embedded in a higher dimensional space. However, since these\nmanifolds belong to non-Euclidean topological spaces, exploiting their\nstructures is computationally expensive, especially when one considers the\nclustering analysis of massive amounts of data. To this end, we propose an\nefficient framework to address the clustering problem on Riemannian manifolds.\nThis framework implements random projections for manifold points via kernel\nspace, which can preserve the geometric structure of the original space, but is\ncomputationally efficient. Here, we introduce three methods that follow our\nframework. We then validate our framework on several computer vision\napplications by comparing against popular clustering methods on Riemannian\nmanifolds. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework maintains the\nperformance of the clustering whilst massively reducing computational\ncomplexity by over two orders of magnitude in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 08:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

First, objective properties of quantum systems are not associated\nwith observables but are defined by preparations. Second, measurable results of\nclassical theories are not sharp. All such results can be obtained as\nhigh-entropy limits of quantum mechanics. Third, a careful study of exchange\nsymmetry requires a modification of the theory of measurement. Fourth, screens\nand detectors are closely associated with state reduction. A new, rather\nimproved understanding of quantum mechanics is achieved without any deep\nchanges of the theory itself.

The directions to search\nfor fixed points are generated by using the ideas of the steepest descent\ndirection and conventional nonlinear conjugate gradient directions for\nunconstrained optimization.

These equations provide an optimum\nrepresentation of the kinematic properties of systems of curved and connected\ndislocation lines with the information contained in a given set of density\nmeasures. The performance of the derived equations is benchmarked against other\nmodels proposed in the literature, using discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations as a reference.

From these the full dislocation orientation distribution\nwhich emerges as dislocations move through a channel-wall structure can be\nfaithfully reconstructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 13:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 11:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 13:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 17:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 11:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In contrast to conventional techniques and in\norder to reduce complexity, the relay nodes can either harvest energy from the\nsource signal (in case of uncharged battery) or attempt to decode and forward\nit (in case of charged battery). Several relay selection schemes that\ncorrespond to different state information requirements and implementation\ncomplexities are proposed. The charging/discharging behavior of the battery is\nmodeled as a two-state Markov chain and analytical expressions for the\nsteady-state distribution and the outage probability performance are derived\nfor each relay selection scheme. We prove that energy storage significantly\naffects the performance of the system and results in a zeroth diversity gain at\nhigh signal-to-noise ratios; the convergence floors depend on the steady-state\ndistribution of the battery and are derived in closed-form by using appropriate\napproximations.

Several approaches to reducing shape noise have recently\nbeen put forward, using information beyond photometry, such as radio\npolarization and optical spectroscopy. Here we investigate how well the\nintrinsic ellipticities of galaxies can be predicted using other, exclusively\nphotometric parameters. These parameters (such as galaxy colours) are already\navailable in the data and do not necessitate additional, often expensive\nobservations. We apply two regression techniques, generalized additive models\n(GAM) and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to the publicly released data\ncatalog of galaxy properties from CFHTLenS. In our simple analysis we find that\nthe individual galaxy ellipticities can indeed be predicted from other\nphotometric parameters to better precision than the scatter about the mean\nellipticity. This means that without additional observations beyond photometry\nthe ellipticity contribution to the shear can be measured to higher precision,\ncomparable to using a larger sample of galaxies. Our best-fit model, achieved\nusing PPR, yields a gain equivalent to having 114.3% more galaxies. Using only\nparameters unaffected by lensing (e.g.~surface brightness, colour), the gain is\nonly ~12%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 13:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

The presented model has several characteristic features: (i)\nthe line centroid energy is positively correlated with the luminosity; (ii) the\nline width is positively correlated with the luminosity as well; (iii) the\nposition and the width of the cyclotron absorption line are variable over the\npulse phase; (iv) the line has a more complicated shape than widely used\nLorentzian or Gaussian profiles; (v) the phase-resolved cyclotron line centroid\nenergy and the width are negatively and positively correlated with the pulse\nintensity, respectively. The predictions of the proposed theory are compared\nwith the variations of the cyclotron line parameters in the X-ray pulsar GX\n304-1 over a wide range of sub-critical luminosities as seen by the INTEGRAL\nobservatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 13:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 14:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

More than\nhalf of the cross sections at lowest $Q^2$ are fit using two single-parameter\nform-factor models, with the first based on a dipole parametrization, and the\nsecond on a linear fit to a conformal-mapping variable. These low-$Q^2$ fits\nextrapolate the slope of the form factor to $Q^2$=0 and determine $R_{\\rm E}$\nvalues of approximately 0.84 and 0.89~fm, respectively. Fits spanning all\n$Q^2$, in which the single constants are replaced with cubic splines at larger\n$Q^2$, lead to similar results for $R_{\\rm E}$. We conclude that the scattering\ndata is consistent with $R_{\\rm E}$ ranging from at least 0.84 to 0.89~fm, and\ntherefore cannot resolve the discrepancy between determinations of $R_{\\rm E}$\nmade using muonic and electronic hydrogen-atom spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 14:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

A type-based approach is used to provide a correct checking\nprocedure for self-stabilisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 15:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2015 21:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Graphene and its\nderivatives have also been considered as promising nanoscale fillers in gas\nbarrier application of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). In this review, recent\nresearch and development of the utilization of graphene and its derivatives in\nthe fabrication of nanocomposites with different polymer matrices for barrier\napplication are explored. Most synthesis methods of graphene-based PNCs are\ncovered, including solution and melt mixing, in situ polymerization and\nlayer-by-layer process. Graphene layers in polymer matrix are able to produce a\ntortuous path which works as a barrier structure for gases. A high tortuosity\nleads to higher barrier properties and lower permeability of PNCs. The\ninfluence of the intrinsic properties of these fillers (graphene and its\nderivatives) and their state of dispersion in polymer matrix on the gas barrier\nproperties of graphene/PNCs are discussed. Analytical modeling aspects of\nbarrier performance of graphene/PNCs are also reviewed in detail. We also\ndiscuss and address some of the work on mixed matrix membranes for gas\nseparation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 06:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

This finding is in\nmarked contrast with the well-known result of the classical theory, where such\nwaves do not exist in a homogeneous (isotropic or anisotropic) half-space. In\nthe context of the classical theory, this weakness is usually circumvented by\nmodeling the half-space as a layered structure or as having non-homogeneous\nproperties. On the other hand, employing a simplified version of gradient\nelasticity (including only one microstructural parameter and an additional\nsurface-energy term), Vardoulakis and Georgiadis (1997), and Georgiadis et al.\n(2000), showed that such surface waves may exist in a homogeneous half-space\nonly if a certain type of gradient anisotropy is included in the formulation.\nOn the contrary, in the present work, we prove that the complete Toupin-Mindlin\ntheory of isotropic gradient elasticity (with five microstructural parameters)\nis capable of predicting torsional and SH surface waves in a purely isotropic\nand homogeneous material. In fact, it is shown that torsional and SH surface\nwaves are dispersive and can propagate at any frequency (i.e. no cut-off\nfrequencies appear). The character of the dispersion (either normal or\nanomalous) depends strongly upon the microstructural characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 14:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

Our model incorporates the key effects of\nWolbachia infection including cytoplasmic incompatibility and male killing. We\nalso allow the possibility of reduced reproductive output, incomplete maternal\ntransmission, and different mortality rates for uninfected/infected male/female\nindividuals. We study the existence and local stability of equilibria,\nincluding the biologically relevant and interesting boundary equilibria.

We apply a recent method NAV (\"New\nAlgol Variable\") to eclipsing binary stars of different types. Although all\nperiodic functions may be represented as Fourier series with an infinite number\nof coefficients, this is impossible for a finite number of the observations.\nThus one may use a restricted Fourier series, i.e. a trigonometric polynomial\n(TP) of order s either for fitting the light curve, or to make a periodogram\nanalysis. However, the number of parameters needed drastically increases with\ndecreasing width of minimum. In the NAV algorithm, the special shape of minimum\nis used, so the number of parameters is limited to 10 (if the period and\ninitial epoch are fixed) or 12 (not fixed). We illustrate the NAV method by\napplication to a recently discovered Algol-type eclipsing variable 2MASS\nJ11080308-6145589 (in the field of previously known variable star RS Car) and\ncompare results to that obtained using the TP fits. For this system, the\nstatistically optimal number of parameters is 44, but the fit is still worse\nthan that of the NAV fit.
