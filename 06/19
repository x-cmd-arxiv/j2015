Then we construct energy-like and\nentropy-like Lyapunov-Meyer functions (LMF) for these equations. We show that\nenergy-like LMF contains no information about the equilibrium of the system and\nis a substantial generalization of the Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural\nselection. If there are exists nontrivial equilibrium point for generalized\nreplicator system then we construct entropy-like LMF for this system and prove\nthat it is a relative entropy function or the function of information\ndivergence. We prove that negative relative entropy is a convex function for a\nprobability space and receive new distance measure between two probability\ndistributions. Also we use Legendre-Donkin-Fenchel transformation for dual\ncoordinates. As result we establish the set of next important links: nonlinear\npairwise interaction - generalized Fisher (replicator) equations -\nLyapunov-Meyer functions - relative entropy - distance measure -\nLDF-transformation - duality. In particular it follows from these links that\nnonlinear pairwise interaction is the origin of all known entropy functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 16:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

While confirming similar behavior in optimally Co-doped\nSrFe2As2 samples, the influence on Tc of strain induced by grinding to ~50\nmicron sized particles, followed by pressing the powder into a pellet using 10\nkbar pressure, was found to increase the annealed transition width of 1.5 K by\napproximately a factor of ten. Also, the bulk discontinuity in the specific\nheat at Tc, deltaC, on the same pellet sample was completely suppressed by\ngrinding. This evidence for a strong sensitivity of superconductivity to strain\nwas used to optimize single crystal growth of Co-doped BaFe2As2.

In particular we predict analytically the shapes of\nthe phase diagrams in the vicinity of the critical points, the binodal and\nspinodal densities at coexistence, and the speeds and shapes of the\nphase-separated profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 16:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 15:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

In practice, CFRSs are also\nparticularly vulnerable to \"shilling\" attacks or \"profile injection\" attacks\ndue to their openness. The attackers can carefully inject chosen attack\nprofiles into CFRSs in order to bias the recommendation results to their\nbenefits. To reduce this risk, various detection techniques have been proposed\nto detect such attacks, which use diverse features extracted from user\nprofiles. However, relying on limited features to improve the detection\nperformance is difficult seemingly, since the existing features can not fully\ncharacterize the attack profiles and genuine profiles. In this paper, we\npropose a novel detection method to make recommender systems resistant to the\n\"shilling\" attacks or \"profile injection\" attacks.

The proof uses the\ntheory of Betti splittings of monomial ideals due to Francisco, H\\`a, and Van\nTuyl and the structure of weakly chordal graphs. Along the way, we compute the\nlinearity defect of edge ideals of cycles and weakly chordal graphs.

In this\nwork we study controllability in the structural system theoretic sense,\nstructural controllability. In other words, instead of focusing on a specific\nnumerical system realization, we provide guarantees for equivalence classes of\nlinear time-invariant systems on the basis of their structural sparsity\npatterns, i.e., location of zero/nonzero entries in the plant matrices. To this\nend, we first propose several necessary and/or sufficient conditions to ensure\nstructural controllability of the overall system, on the basis of the\nstructural patterns of the subsystems and their interconnections. The proposed\nverification criteria are shown to be efficiently implementable (i.e., with\npolynomial time complexity in the number of the state variables and inputs) in\ntwo important subclasses of interconnected dynamical systems: similar (i.e.,\nevery subsystem has the same structure), and serial (i.e., every subsystem\noutputs to at most one other subsystem). Secondly, we provide a distributed\nalgorithm to verify structural controllability for interconnected dynamical\nsystems. The proposed distributed algorithm is efficient and implementable at\nthe subsystem level; the algorithm is iterative, based on communication among\n(physically) interconnected subsystems, and requires only local model and\ninterconnection knowledge at each subsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 18:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The necessity for a dilaton field in the $1 +\n1$ effective Lagrangian for classical geometry, the appearance of fermions, and\neven the form of the universal potential in the canonical $1$ matrix model,\nfollow from general HST considerations. We note that 't Hooft's ansatz for the\nleading contribution to the black hole S-matrix, accounts for the entire\nS-matrix in these models in the limit that the string scale coincides with the\nPlanck scale, up to transformations between near horizon and asymptotic\ncoordinates. These $1 + 1$ dimensional models are describable as decoupling\nlimits of the near horizon geometry of higher dimensional extremal black holes\nor black branes, and this suggests that deformations of the simplest model are\nequally physical.

The latter rewrites:\n$C(\\int_{\\Omega}\\frac{u^{p}}{|x|^s}dx)^{\\frac{2}{p}}\\leq \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla\nu|^2dx-\\gamma \\int_{\\Omega}\\frac{u^2}{|x|^2}dx$ for all $u\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)$,\nwhere \\gamma <n^2/4, s\\in [0,2) and p:=2(n-s)/(n-2). We address questions\nregarding the explicit values of the optimal constant C, as well as the\nexistence of non-trivial extremals attached to these inequalities. Scale\ninvariance properties lead to situations where the best constants do not depend\non the domain and are not attainable. We consider two different approaches to\n\"break the homogeneity\" of the problem:\n  One approach was initiated by Brezis-Nirenberg and by Janelli. It is suitable\nfor the case where 0 is in the interior of \\Omega, and consists of considering\nlower order perturbations of the critical nonlinearity. The other approach was\ninitiated by Ghoussoub-Kang , C.S. Lin et al. and Ghoussoub-Robert. It consists\nof considering domains where the singularity is on the boundary.\n  Both of these approaches are rich in structure and in challenging problems.\nIf 0\\in \\Omega, a negative linear perturbation suffices for higher dimensions,\nwhile a positive \"Hardy-singular interior mass\" is required in lower\ndimensions. If the singularity is on the boundary, then the local geometry\naround 0 plays a crucial role in high dimensions, while a positive\n\"Hardy-singular boundary mass\" is needed for the lower dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 19:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment. The robust s-wave pairing also reveals that the current standard\neffective models with only onsite interactions are not sufficient and a minimum\nmicroscopic model must include strong nearest neighbor repulsive interactions\nresulted from the d-d direct bondings to serves as a s-wave symmetry\nstabilizer. Finally, the sign distribution of the superconducting order\nparameters in the reciprocal space is simply a consequence of the form factors\ngiven by the leading short-range pairings.

This project aims at\nverifying diffraction-limited imaging experimentally with groups of detached\nand independent optical telescopes. In a large optics laboratory, artificial\nstars were observed by an array of small telescopes. Using high-speed\nphoton-counting solid-state detectors, intensity fluctuations were\ncross-correlated over up to 180 baselines between pairs of telescopes,\nproducing coherence maps across the interferometric Fourier-transform plane.\nThese measurements were used to extract parameters about the simulated stars,\nand to reconstruct their two-dimensional images. As far as we are aware, these\nare the first diffraction-limited images obtained from an optical array only\nlinked by electronic software, with no optical connections between the\ntelescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 20:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

The task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space\ndistortion effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distribution\nof halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. One of the main modeling\nchallenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radial\ndistribution and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known as\nthe Finger-of-God effect. We present a model for the galaxy power spectrum of\nin which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies\nand relate different contributions to 1- and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our\nprimary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physically\nmeaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. For the 2-halo terms we\nuse the previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of\ndistribution function and perturbation theory approach. This term needs to be\nmultiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellites\ninside the halo. To this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which are\nnon-perturbative. We show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as\nalmost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo\ninducing a small k^2R^2 term, where R is related to the size of the halo. We\nadopt a similar model for FoG in redshift space, ensuring that FoG velocity\ndispersion is related to the halo mass. For FoG k^2 type expansions do not work\nand FoG resummation must be used instead. We test several damping functions to\nmodel the velocity dispersion FoG effect.

Specifically, analytic expressions for upper\nand lower bounds on the expected completion time are provided, and, in\nparticular, it is shown that both these bounds scale as $\\alpha \\log n$. For\nexample, on a full binary tree with $n$ end users, and packet loss probability\nof $0.1$, we bound the expected completion time for disseminating one packet\nfrom below by $1.41 \\log_2 n+o \\left( \\log n \\right)$ and from above by $1.78\n\\log_2 n+o \\left( \\log n \\right)$.\n  Clearly, the completion time is determined by the last end user who receives\nthe message, that is, a maximum over all arrival times. Hence, Extreme Value\nTheory (EVT) is an appropriate tool to explore this problem. However, since\narrival times are correlated, non-stationary, and furthermore, time slots are\ndiscrete, a thorough study of EVT for Non-Stationary Integer Valued (NSIV)\nsequences is required. To the best of our knowledge, such processes were not\nstudied before in the framework of EVT. Consequently, we derive the asymptotic\ndistribution of the maxima of NSIV sequences satisfying certain conditions, and\ngive EVT results which are applicable also beyond the scope of this work. These\nresult are then used to derive tight bounds on the completion time. Finally,\nthe results are validated by extensive simulations and numerical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 21:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Most techniques,\nsuch as nearest-neighbor prediction, quickly suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality and overfitting for more than a few predictors which has limited\ntheir application mostly to the univariate case. Therefore, selection\nstrategies are needed that harness the available information as efficiently as\npossible. Since often the right combination of predictors matters, ideally all\nsubsets of possible predictors should be tested for their predictive power, but\nthe exponentially growing number of combinations makes such an approach\ncomputationally prohibitive. Here a prediction scheme that overcomes this\nstrong limitation is introduced utilizing a causal pre-selection step which\ndrastically reduces the number of possible predictors to the most predictive\nset of causal drivers making a globally optimal search scheme tractable. The\ninformation-theoretic optimality is derived and practical selection criteria\nare discussed. As demonstrated for multivariate nonlinear stochastic delay\nprocesses, the optimal scheme can even be less computationally expensive than\ncommonly used sub-optimal schemes like forward selection. The method suggests a\ngeneral framework to apply the optimal model-free approach to select variables\nand subsequently fit a model to further improve a prediction or learn\nstatistical dependencies. The performance of this framework is illustrated on a\nclimatological index of El Ni\\~no Southern Oscillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 21:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The post-quench Cooper pairs occupy a linear combination\nof \"ground\" and \"excited\" Floquet states, with coefficients determined by the\ndistribution function. While the Floquet bandstructure exhibits a single\navoided crossing relative to the equilibrium case, the distribution function\nshows a population inversion of the Floquet bands at low energies. For a\nrealization in ultracold atoms, these two features compensate, producing a bulk\naverage rf signal that is well-captured by a quasi-equilibrium approximation.\nIn particular, the rf spectrum shows a robust gap. The single crossing occurs\nbecause the quench-induced Floquet phase belongs to a particular class of\nsoliton dynamics for the BCS equation. The population inversion is a\nconsequence of this, and ensures the conservation of the pseudospin winding\nnumber. As a comparison, we compute the rf signal when only the lower Floquet\nband is occupied; in this case, the gap disappears for strong quenches. The\ntunneling signal in a solid state realization is ignorant of the distribution\nfunction, and can show wildly different behaviors. We also examine rf,\ntunneling, and ARPES for weak quenches, such that the resulting topological\nsteady-state is characterized by a constant nonequilibrium order parameter.

We made use of the homogeneous set of\nobservations of the polars by XMM-Newton to search for the presence of QPOs in\nthe (0.5-10 keV) energy range and to set significant upper limits for the\nbrightest X-ray polars. We extracted high time-resolution X-ray light curves by\ntaking advantage of the 0.07 sec resolution of the EPIC-PN camera.

The turbulent transport of momentum and density\ncan be described in a very direct and compact form by a Prandtl mixing length\nmodel: the turbulent vertical fluxes of momentum and density are found to scale\nquadratically with the vertical mean gradients of velocity and density. The\nscaling coefficient, the square of the mixing length, is approximately constant\nover the mixing zone of the stratified shear layer. We show how, in different\nflow configurations, this length can be related to the shear length of the flow\n($\\epsilon$/$\\partial$ z u^3)^1/2. We also study the fluctuations of the\nmomentum and density turbulent fluxes, showing how they relate to mixing and to\nthe entrainment/detrainment balance. We suggest a quantitative measure of local\nentrainment and detrainment derived from observed conditional correlations of\ndensity flux and density or vertical velocity fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 08:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We consider two types of the SLs: the SLs with uniform and\nnonuniform gap. Using the perturbative approach we obtain an analytical\nexpression for the inverse localization length (ILL) derived for the case of\nrandomly fluctuating geometric and energetic parameters. In the first case,\nwhen the barrier (well) width fluctuates around its mean value, the\ncorresponding equation for the ILL reveals the presence of the Fabry-Perot\nresonances, at which the localization length diverges. These resonances are\nexact, i.e., are stored in any degree of disorder. It has been found that the\nlocalization properties manifest stronger for the particles with energies lying\nin the non-resonant bands where our approach is extremely sensitive to the\ndegree of disorder. For the case of weakly fluctuating both barrier and well\nwidths we analytically obtain ILL taking correlations into account. The main\neffect of the correlations, which lead to an increase (or decrease) in the\nlocalization length, was revealed near the double resonance arising at\ncoincidence of two Fabry-Perot resonances associated with barrier and well\nwidths. The random fluctuations of the potential strength also lead to the\ndelocalization resonances. However, they exist only in a weak-disorder\napproximation.

The ideal pattern,\nhowever, would have to serve two conflicting purposes: 1) be broadband to\nensure robust deconvolution and 2) has sufficient zero-crossings for a high\ndepth discrepancy. This paper presents a simple but effective scene-adaptive\ncoded aperture solution to bridge this gap. We observe that the geometric\nstructures in a natural scene often exhibit only a few edge directions, and the\nsuccessive frames are closely correlated. Therefore we adopt a spatial\npartitioning and temporal propagation scheme. In each frame, we address one\nprincipal direction by applying depth-discriminative codes along it and\nbroadband codes along its orthogonal direction. Since within a frame only the\nregions with edge direction corresponding to its aperture code behaves well, we\nutilize the close among-frame correlation to propagate the high quality single\nframe results temporally to obtain high performance over the whole image\nlattice. To physically implement this scheme, we use a Liquid Crystal on\nSilicon (LCoS) microdisplay that permits fast changing pattern codes. Firstly,\nwe capture the scene with a pinhole and analyze the scene content to determine\nprimary edge orientations. Secondly, we sequentially apply the proposed coding\nscheme with these orientations in the following frames. Experiments on both\nsynthetic and real scenes show that our technique is able to combine advantages\nof the state-of-the-art patterns for recovering better quality depth map and\nall-focus images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 10:09:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 02:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

PNPF\ncontains many more correlations than most models and simulations of channels,\nbecause it includes water and calculates dielectric properties consistently as\noutputs. This model accounts for the steric effect of ions and water molecules\nwith different sizes and interstitial voids, the correlation effect of crowded\nions with different valences, and the screening effect of polarized water\nmolecules in an inhomogeneous aqueous electrolyte. The steric energy is shown\nto be comparable to the electrical energy under physiological conditions,\ndemonstrating the crucial role of the excluded volume of particles and the\nvoids in the natural function of channel proteins. Water is shown to play a\ncritical role in both correlation and steric effects in the model. We extend\nthe classical Scharfetter-Gummel (SG) method for semiconductor devices to\ninclude the steric potential for ion channels, which is a fundamental physical\nproperty not present in semiconductors. Together with a simplified matched\ninterface and boundary (SMIB) method for treating molecular surfaces and\nsingular charges of channel proteins, the extended SG method is shown to\nexhibit important features in flow simulations such as optimal convergence,\nefficient nonlinear iterations, and physical conservation. Two different\nmethods --- called the SMIB and multiscale methods --- are proposed for two\ndifferent types of channels, namely, the gramicidin A channel and an L-type\ncalcium channel, depending on whether water is allowed to pass through the\nchannel. The PNPF currents are in accord with the experimental I-V (V for\napplied voltages) data of the gramicidin A channel and I-C (C for bath\nconcentrations) data of the calcium channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 10:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We\nexplore this in the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking with\nmessengers transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group,\nnamely, octet of color SU(3) and triplet of weak SU(2). A distinctive feature\nof this scenario is that the focus point is achieved by fixing a single\ncombination of parameters in the messenger sector, which is invariant under the\nrenormalization group evolution. Because of this invariance, the focus point\nbehavior is well under control once the relevant parameters are fixed by a more\nfundamental theory. The observed Higgs boson mass is explained with a\nrelatively mild fine-tuning $\\Delta=$ 60-150. Interestingly, even in the\npresence of incomplete messenger multiplets of the SU(5) GUT group, the gauge\ncouplings still unify perfectly, but at a scale which is one or two orders of\nmagnitude above the conventional GUT scale. Because of this larger unification\nscale, the colored Higgs multiplets become too heavy to trigger proton decay at\na rate larger than the experimentally allowed limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 11:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 11:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

We consider a sample of 224 quasars selected from the SDSS at z<1\nobserved in the infrared band by Herschel. We evaluate the star formation rate\nin relation to several outflow signatures traced by the [OIII]4959,5007 and\n[OII]3726,3729 emission lines in about half of the sample with high quality\nspectra. Most of the quasars show asymmetric and broad wings in [OIII], which\nwe interpret as outflow signatures. We separate the quasars in two groups,\n``weakly'' and ``strongly'' outflowing, using three different criteria. When we\ncompare the mean star formation rate in five redshift bins in the two groups,\nwe find that the SFRs are comparable or slightly larger in the strongly\noutflowing quasars. We estimate the stellar mass from SED fitting and the\nquasars are distributed along the star formation main sequence, although with a\nlarge scatter. The scatter from this relation is uncorrelated with respect to\nthe kinematic properties of the outflow. Moreover, for quasars dominated in the\ninfrared by starburst or by AGN emission, we do not find any correlation\nbetween the star formation rate and the velocity of the outflow, a trend\npreviously reported in the literature for pure starburst galaxies.

Due to adverse selection, acquiring a lifetime payout\nannuity is an irreversible transaction that creates an incentive to delay.\nUnder the institutional all-or-nothing arrangement where annuitization must\ntake place at one distinct point in time (i.e. retirement), we derive the\noptimal age at which to annuitize and develop a metric to capture the loss from\nannuitizing prematurely. In contrast, under an open-market structure where\nindividuals can annuitize any fraction of their wealth at anytime, we locate a\ngeneral optimal annuity purchasing policy. In this case, we find that an\nindividual will initially annuitize a lump sum and then buy annuities to keep\nwealth to one side of a separating ray in wealth-annuity space.

We impose an initial ambient magnetic field,\nperpendicular to the simulation box, and we add a spectrum of large-scale\nmagnetic and kinetic fluctuations, with energy equipartition and vanishing\ncorrelation. Once the turbulence is fully developed, we observe a MHD inertial\nrange, where the spectra of the perpendicular magnetic field and the\nperpendicular proton bulk velocity fluctuations exhibit power-law scaling with\nspectral indices of -5/3 and -3/2, respectively. This behavior is extended over\na full decade in wavevectors and is very stable in time. A transition is\nobserved around proton scales. At sub-ion scales, both spectra steepen, with\nthe former still following a power law with a spectral index of ~-3. A -2.8\nslope is observed in the density and parallel magnetic fluctuations,\nhighlighting the presence of compressive effects at kinetic scales. The\nspectrum of the perpendicular electric fluctuations follows that of the proton\nbulk velocity at MHD scales, and flattens at small scales. All these features,\nwhich we carefully tested against variations of many parameters, are in good\nagreement with solar wind observations. The turbulent cascade leads to on\noverall proton energization with similar heating rates in the parallel and\nperpendicular directions. While the parallel proton heating is found to be\nindependent on the resistivity, the number of particles per cell and the\nresolution employed, the perpendicular proton temperature strongly depends on\nthese parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 13:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

In order to define complexity for linear automata, we have to use\nthree operations, namely, triangular product of linear automata, wreath product\nof pure automata and wreath product of a linear automaton with a pure one which\nreturns a linear automaton. We define the complexity of a linear automaton as\nthe minimal number of operations in the decompositions of the automaton into\nindecomposable components (atoms). This theory relies on the following\nparallelism between wreath and triangular products: both of them are terminal\nobjects in the categories of cascade connections of automata.

A\nparticularly puzzling and up-to-now unexplained feature of the Kuiper belt is\nthe so-called `kernel', a concentration of orbits with semimajor axes a~44 AU,\neccentricities e~0.05, and inclinations i<5 deg. Here we show that the Kuiper\nbelt kernel can be explained if Neptune's otherwise smooth migration was\ninterrupted by a discontinuous change of Neptune's semimajor axis when Neptune\nreached ~28 AU. Before the discontinuity happened, planetesimals located at ~40\nAU were swept into Neptune's 2:1 resonance, and were carried with the migrating\nresonance outwards. The 2:1 resonance was at ~44 AU when Neptune reached ~28\nAU. If Neptune's semimajor axis changed by fraction of AU at this point,\nperhaps because Neptune was scattered off of another planet, the 2:1 population\nwould have been released at ~44 AU, and would remain there to this day. We show\nthat the orbital distribution of bodies produced in this model provides a good\nmatch to the orbital properties of the kernel. If Neptune migration was\nconveniently slow after the jump, the sweeping 2:1 resonance would deplete the\npopulation of bodies at ~45-47 AU, thus contributing to the paucity of the\nlow-inclination orbits in this region. Special provisions, probably related to\ninefficiencies in the accretional growth of sizable objects, are still needed\nto explain why only a few low-inclination bodies have been so far detected\nbeyond ~47 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based\nmicro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the\nemotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook\nhypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues\ntypical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to\nadopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social\nnetwork. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they\nrequire massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the\nindividuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional\ncontagion using Twitter. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null\nmodel that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of\nemotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are\nexposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a\nnegative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than\nbaseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50%\nmore positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship\nbetween the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and\nthat of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of\nindividuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly\nsusceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions\nthan the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive\nemotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much\ngreater than that of negative emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 14:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form. The $I$-$\\lambda$-$Q$ relations of a gravastar are dramatically\ndifferent from those of an ordinary compact star, but the black-hole limit is\ncontinuous, i.e. these quantities approach their Kerr counterparts when the\ncompactness is maximum. Therefore, such relations can be used to discern a\ngravastar from an ordinary compact star, but not to break the degeneracy with\nthe black-hole case. Based on these results, we conjecture that the full\nmultipolar structure and the tidal deformability of a spinning, ultracompact\ngravastar are identical to those of a Kerr black hole.

Thanks to the\nrange of lattice volumes and spacings considered, we can extrapolate the\nresults for the second and fourth cumulant of the topological charge\ndistribution to the continuum limit with confidence by keeping finite volume\neffects negligible with respect to the statistical errors. Our best results for\nthe topological susceptibility is t_0^2*chi=6.67(7)*10^-4, where t_0 is a\nstandard reference scale, while for the ratio of the forth cumulant over the\nsecond we obtain R=0.233(45).

We find that irrespective of its direction, the presence of a\nmagnetic field reduces the radiative heat conductance, and dramatic reductions\nup to 700% can be found with fields of about 6 T at room temperature. We show\nthat this striking behavior is due to the fact that the magnetic field\nradically changes the nature of the NFRHT. The field not only affects the\nelectromagnetic surface waves (both plasmons and phonon polaritons) that\nnormally dominate the near-field radiation in doped semiconductors, but it also\ninduces hyperbolic modes that progressively dominate the heat transfer as the\nfield increases. In particular, we show that when the field is perpendicular to\nthe plates, the semiconductors become ideal hyperbolic near-field emitters.\nMore importantly, by changing the magnetic field, the system can be\ncontinuously tuned from a situation where the surface waves dominate the heat\ntransfer to a situation where hyperbolic modes completely govern the near-field\nthermal radiation.

Two ambiguities associated with the original Irving-Kirkwood\nprocedure (which was limited to pair potential interactions) are addressed in\nits generalization. The first ambiguity is due to the non-uniqueness of the\ndecomposition of the force on an atom as a sum of central forces, which is a\nresult of the non-uniqueness of the potential energy representation in terms of\ndistances between the particles. This is in turn related to the shape space of\nthe system. The second ambiguity is due to the non-uniqueness of the energy\ndecomposition between particles. The latter can be completely avoided through\nan alternate derivation for the energy balance. It is found that the\nexpressions for the specific internal energy and the heat flux obtained through\nthe alternate derivation are quite different from the original Irving-Kirkwood\nprocedure and appear to be more physically reasonable. Next, in the second step\nof the unified framework, spatial averaging is applied to the pointwise field\nto obtain the corresponding macroscopic quantities.
