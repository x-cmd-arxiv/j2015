CNNs mainly consist of convolutional and\npooling layers, both of which are performed on local image areas without\nconsidering the dependencies among different image regions. However, such\ndependencies are very important for generating explicit image representation.\nIn contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well known for their ability\nof encoding contextual information among sequential data, and they only require\na limited number of network parameters.

Our main results are Theorem A and Theorem B. We show\nthat the parameter space of what we call $B12$ configurations is a three\ndimensional rational variety. As a consequence we derive the existence of a\nthree dimensional family of rational $B12$ configurations. On the other hand\nthe moduli space of $B15$ configurations is shown to be an elliptic curve with\nonly finitely many rational points, all corresponding to degenerate\nconfigurations. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, we conclude that there are no\nrational $B15$ configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2015 18:57:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 09:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

In materials with broken inversion\nsymmetry, such as an electrically gated bilayer graphene, the momentum-space\nBerry curvature $\\Omega$ carries opposite sign in the K and K' valleys. A sign\nreversal of $\\Omega$ along an internal boundary of the sheet gives rise to\ncounter-propagating one-dimensional conducting modes encoded with opposite\nvalley indices.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst paper to provide precise convergence rate guarantees for general convex\nfunctions under standard convex assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 00:40:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 01:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 03:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

Many potential con- founding factors (PCFs) exist in such a\nscenario, and if one seeks to estimate the causal effect of the treatment on a\nresponse, one needs to control for such factors. Identifying all relevant PCFs\nmay be difficult (or impossible) given a single observational study. Instead,\nwe argue that if one can observe a sequence of similar treatments over the\ncourse of a lengthy time period, one can identify patterns of behavior in the\nexperimental subjects that are correlated with the response of interest and\ncontrol for those patterns directly. Specifically, in our case-study we find\nand control for an early-adopter effect: the scenario in which the magnitude of\nthe response is highly correlated with how quickly one adopts a treatment after\nits release.\n  We provide a flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework that controls for such\nearly-adopter effects in the analysis of the effects of multiple sequential\ntreatments. The methods are presented and evaluated in the context of a\ndetailed case-study involving product updates (newer versions of the same\nproduct) from eBay, Inc.

ESAs dosing is currently based on clinical protocols that often do not\naccount for the high inter- and intra-individual variability in the patient's\nresponse. As a result, the hemoglobin level of some patients oscillates around\nthe target range, which is associated with multiple risks and side-effects.\nThis work proposes a methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) to\noptimize ESA therapy.\n  Methods: RL is a data-driven approach for solving sequential decision-making\nproblems that are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Computing\noptimal drug administration strategies for chronic diseases is a sequential\ndecision-making problem in which the goal is to find the best sequence of drug\ndoses. MDPs are particularly suitable for modeling these problems due to their\nability to capture the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment\nand the stochastic nature of the underlying process. The RL algorithm employed\nin the proposed methodology is fitted Q iteration, which stands out for its\nability to make an efficient use of data.\n  Results: The experiments reported here are based on a computational model\nthat describes the effect of ESAs on the hemoglobin level. The performance of\nthe proposed method is evaluated and compared with the well-known Q-learning\nalgorithm and with a standard protocol. Simulation results show that the\nperformance of Q-learning is substantially lower than FQI and the protocol.\n  Conclusion: Although prospective validation is required, promising results\ndemonstrate the potential of RL to become an alternative to current protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

This\nfinding is insensitive to the choice for modelling the activity depth\ndistribution in the ground using activity measurements of collected soil\nlayers, or by using exponential and hyperbolic secant fits to the measurement\ndata. Better predictions are obtained by modelling the horizontal distribution\nof radioactive cesium across an area if multiple soil samples are available, as\nopposed to assuming a spatially homogeneous contamination distribution.\nReductions seen in air dose rates above flat, undisturbed fields in Fukushima\nPrefecture are consistent with decrement by radioactive decay and downward\nmigration of cesium into soil.

Thus the minimum (and typical) grain size\n$s_\\text{min}$ is expected to be close to the radiation pressure blowout size\n$s_\\text{blow}$. Yet a recent analysis of a sample of Herschel-resolved debris\ndiscs showed the ratio $s_\\text{min}/s_\\text{blow}$ to systematically decrease\nwith the stellar luminosity from about ten for solar-type stars to nearly unity\nin the discs around the most luminous A-type stars. Here we explore this trend\nin more detail, checking how significant it is and seeking to find possible\nexplanations. We show that the trend is robust to variation of the composition\nand porosity of dust particles. For any assumed grain properties and stellar\nparameters, we suggest a recipe of how to estimate the \"true\" radius of a\nspatially unresolved debris disc, based solely on its spectral energy\ndistribution. The results of our collisional simulations are qualitatively\nconsistent with the trend, although additional effects may also be at work. In\nparticular, the lack of grains with small $s_\\text{min}/s_\\text{blow}$ for\nlower luminosity stars might be caused by the grain surface energy constraint\nthat should limit the size of the smallest collisional fragments. Also, a\nbetter agreement between the data and the collisional simulations is achieved\nwhen assuming debris discs of more luminous stars to have higher dynamical\nexcitation than those of less luminous primaries. This would imply that\nprotoplanetary discs of more massive young stars are more efficient in forming\nbig planetesimals or planets that act as stirrers in the debris discs at the\nsubsequent evolutionary stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 10:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

STM systems take optimistic approach. Multiple transactions\nare allowed to execute concurrently. On completion, each transaction is\nvalidated and if any inconsistency is observed it is aborted. Otherwise it is\nallowed to commit.\n  In databases a class of histories called as conflict-serializability (CSR)\nbased on the notion of conflicts have been identified, whose membership can be\nefficiently verified. As a result, CSR is the commonly used correctness\ncriterion in databases. Similarly, using the notion of conflicts, a correctness\ncriterion, conflict-opacity (co-opacity) which is a sub-class of can be\ndesigned whose membership can be verified in polynomial time. Using the\nverification mechanism, an efficient STM implementation can be designed that is\npermissive w.r.t co-opacity.\n  By storing multiple versions for each transaction object, multi-version STMs\nprovide more concurrency than single-version STMs. But the main drawback of\nco-opacity is that it does not admit histories that are uses multiple versions.\nThis has motivated us to develop a new conflict notions for multi-version STMs.\nIn this paper, we present a new conflict notion multi-version conflict.

However, the precise\nconnection between the turbulent fluctuations and the particle kinetics has not\nyet been established. Here we present clear evidence of plasma turbulence\nheating based on diagnosed wave features and proton velocity distributions from\nsolar wind measurements by the Wind spacecraft. For the first time, we can\nreport the simultaneous observation of counter-propagating magnetohydrodynamic\nwaves in the solar wind turbulence. Different from the traditional paradigm\nwith counter-propagating Alfv\\'en waves, anti-sunward Alfv\\'en waves (AWs) are\nencountered by sunward slow magnetosonic waves (SMWs) in this new type of solar\nwind compressible turbulence. The counter-propagating AWs and SWs correspond\nrespectively to the dominant and sub-dominant populations of the imbalanced\nEls\\\"asser variables. Nonlinear interactions between the AWs and SMWs are\ninferred from the non-orthogonality between the possible oscillation direction\nof one wave and the possible propagation direction of the other. The associated\nprotons are revealed to exhibit bi-directional asymmetric beams in their\nvelocity distributions: sunward beams appearing in short and narrow patterns\nand anti-sunward broad extended tails. It is suggested that multiple types of\nwave-particle interactions, i.e., cyclotron and Landau resonances with AWs and\nSMWs at kinetic scales, are taking place to jointly heat the protons\nperpendicularly and parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 13:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

We introduce the\nterminology of hidden force and hidden source of volume: the effective density\nor modulus is negative when the hidden force or source of volume is larger\nthan, and operates in antiphase to, respectively, the force or volume change\nthat would be obtained in their absence. We demonstrate this ansatz for some\nestablished acoustic metamaterials with elements based on membranes, Helmholtz\nresonators, springs and masses. The hidden force for membrane-based acoustic\nmetamaterials, for instance, is the force from the membrane tension. The hidden\nsource for a Helmholtz-resonator-based metamaterial is the extra air volume\ninjected from the resonator cavity. We also explain the analogous concepts for\npure mass-and-spring systems, in which case hidden forces can arise from masses\nand springs fixed inside other masses, whereas hidden sources - more aptly\ntermed hidden expanders of displacement in this case - can arise from light\nrigid trusses coupled to extra degrees of freedom for mechanical motion such as\nthe case of coupling to masses that move at right angles to the\nwave-propagation direction.

Decision-theoretic Bayesian design of experiments for such\nnonlinear models is conceptually very attractive, allowing the formal\nincorporation of prior knowledge to overcome the parameter dependence of\nfrequentist design and being less reliant on asymptotic approximations.\nHowever, the necessary approximation and maximization of the, typically\nanalytically intractable, expected utility results in a computationally\nchallenging problem.

Thus, the nodes transmit their measurements to the\ncorresponding cluster heads, which after some processing, communicate a summary\nof the received information to the fusion center, which takes the final\ndecision about the state of the nature. As the network has a fixed size,\ncommunication within smaller clusters will be less affected by the path loss\neffect, reducing energy consumption in the information exchange process between\nnodes and cluster heads.

In order to achieve economic feasibility of projects\nsuch as these, the cavities must achieve a very high intrinsic quality factor\n($Q_0$) to keep cryogenic losses within feasible limits. To reach these high\n$Q_0$'s in the case of LCLS-II, nitrogen-doping has been proposed as a cavity\npreparation technique. When dealing with $Q_0$'s greater than 1\\e{10}, the\neffects of ambient magnetic field on $Q_0$ become significant. Here we show\nthat the sensitivity to RF losses from trapped magnetic field in a cavity's\nwalls is strongly dependent on the cavity preparation.

Experimental verification in the literature has focused on cases under\nstandard gravity on earth, and to the authors' knowledge, this work is the\nfirst to explore its relevance to spreading puddles under high gravity. By\nusing centrifugation with a high-density liquid base underneath a coated\nsubstrate, it is possible to apply acceleration normal to a substrate to\ndecrease the capillary length and increase the rate of spreading. Due to the\nnature of centrifugation, this method works primarily on flexible substrates,\nwhich bend with a curvature that conforms to a contour of uniformly distributed\ncentrifugal acceleration. With high gravity of 600 g applied, the capillary\nlength reduces by a factor of 24.5, and the spreading shifts from \"transient\nspreading\" between the surface tension-driven and gravity-driven regimes to the\ngravity-driven regime. Experimental results show that high gravitational\nacceleration will enhance the rate of spreading such that a puddle, which would\nrequire 12 hours under standard gravity on earth to go from an 8-{\\mu}l droplet\nto a 40-{\\mu}m thick puddle, would require less than 1 minute under 600 g.\nOverall, this work suggests that previously derived expressions for\ngravity-driven spreading of puddles under earth's standard gravity extend to\npredicting the behavior of puddles spreading on smooth, wetting substrates\nexposed to more than 100 g's of acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 15:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

A first question thus arose as to the\nintegration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation, leading to a new\nmodel calculating natural and artificial lighting. The results of this new\ndaylighting module were then compared with results of other simulation codes\nand experimental cases both in artificial and natural environments. Excellent\nagreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a\ntropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output\nwith detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion\nIsland (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the\ninterest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.\nIntroduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow\nsimulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2],\nand TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be\nintegrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the\nlatter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After\nmore than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to\nadd a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some\ndetails on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial\nsoftware and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical\nEngineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion\nIsland, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation\nand moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone\napproach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing\nthermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code\nwere successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model,\nthe majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy\nAgency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated\ntechnologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\ndeveloped BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building\nsimulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of\ntest cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of\nbuilding energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach\nis very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input\nequivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by\nmost of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of\nprograms considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe.\nAssociated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of\nvalidation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 06:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

Hence charges should radiate, if they are in free fall\nin gravitational fields, and they should not radiate if they are supported at\nrest in gravitational fields. But according to Einstein's equivalence\nprinciple, charges in free fall should not radiate, while charges supported at\nrest in gravitational fields should radiate. In this article we point out\nindirect experimental evidence, indicating that the equivalence principle is\ncorrect, while the traditional interpretation of Larmor's formula must be\namended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 08:34:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 12:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 15:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

Our total energy calculations suggest feasible formation of\nmonolayer crystal structures composed entirely of pentagons. In addition,\nelectronic band dispersion calculations indicate that while p-graphene and\np-AgN$_{3}$ are semiconductors with indirect bandgaps, p-BN structures display\nmetallic behavior. We also investigate the mechanical properties (in-plane\nstiffness and the Poisson's ratio) of four different pentagonal structures\nunder uniaxial strain. p-graphene is found to have the highest stiffness value\nand the corresponding Poisson's ratio is found to be negative. Similarly,\np-B$_{2}$N$_{4}$ and p-B$_{4}$N$_{2}$ have negative Poisson's ratio values. On\nthe other hand, the p-AgN$_{3}$ has a large and positive Poisson's ratio. In\ndynamical stability tests based on calculated phonon spectra of these\npentagonal monolayers, we find that only p-graphene and p-B$_{2}$N$_{4}$ are\nstable, but p-AgN$_{3}$ and p-B$_{4}$N$_{2}$ are vulnerable against vibrational\nexcitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}
