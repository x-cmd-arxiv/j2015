However, due to the large mass and limited engine power of HDVs,\nslopes have a significant impact on the feasible and optimal speed profiles\nthat each vehicle can and should follow. Therefore maintaining a short\ninter-vehicular distance as required by platooning without coordination between\nvehicles can often result in inefficient or even unfeasible trajectories. In\nthis paper we propose a two-layer control architecture for HDV platooning aimed\nto safely and fuel-efficiently coordinate the vehicles in the platoon. Here,\nthe layers are responsible for the inclusion of preview information on road\ntopography and the real-time control of the vehicles, respectively. Within this\narchitecture, dynamic programming is used to compute the fuel-optimal speed\nprofile for the entire platoon and a distributed model predictive control\nframework is developed for the real-time control of the vehicles. The\neffectiveness of the proposed controller is analyzed by means of simulations of\nseveral realistic scenarios that suggest a possible fuel saving of up to 12%\nfor the follower vehicles compared to the use of standard platoon controllers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 16:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

When a ball is hit in the air, the\nbaserunner will usually wait, to gather additional information as to whether a\nball will fall for a hit before deciding to run aggressively. This additional\ninformation guarantees that there will not be a double play and an \"unnecessary\nout\". However, waiting could potentially cost the runner the opportunity to\nreach third base, or even scoring on the play if the ball falls for a hit. This\nin turn affects the probability of scoring at least one run henceforth in the\ninning. We create a new statistic, the baserunning risk threshold (BRT), which\nmeasures the minimum probability with which the baserunner should be sure that\na ball in play will fall in for a hit, before running without waiting to see if\nthe ball will be caught, with the goal of scoring at least one run in the\ninning. We measure a 0-out and a 1-out version of BRT, both in aggregate, and\nalso in high leverage situations, where scoring one run is particularly\nimportant. We show a drop in BRT for pitchers who pitch in more high leverage\ninnings, and a very low BRT on average for \"elite closers\". It follows that\nbaserunners should be frequently running without waiting, and getting thrown\nout in double plays regularly to maximize their chances of scoring at least one\nrun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 17:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

Non-contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing\n(NC-OFDM) is a promising technique to utilize such disjoint frequency bands in\nan efficient manner. In this paper we study the problem of fair spectrum\nallocation across multiple NCOFDM-enabled point-to-point cognitive radio links\nunder certain practical considerations that arise from such non-contiguous\naccess. When using NC-OFDMA, the channels allocated to a cognitive link are\nspread across several disjoint frequency bands leading to a large spectral span\nfor that link. Increased spectral span requires higher sampling rates, leading\nto increased power consumption in the ADC/DAC of the transmit/receive nodes. In\nthis context, this paper proposes a spectrum allocation that maximizes the\nminimum rate achieved by the cognitive radio links, under a constraint on the\nmaximum permissible spectral span. Under constant transmit powers and\northogonal spectrum allocation, such an optimization is a mixed-integer linear\nprogram and can be solved efficiently. There exists a clear trade-off between\nthe max-min rate achieved and the maximum permissible spectral span. The\nspectral allocation obtained from the proposed optimization framework is shown\nto be close to the tradeoff boundary, thus showing the effectiveness of the\nproposed technique.

KSC represents a least-squares support vector machine\nbased formulation of spectral clustering described by a weighted kernel PCA\nobjective. Just as in the classifier case, the binary clustering model is\nexpressed by a hyperplane in a high dimensional space induced by a kernel. In\naddition, the multi-way clustering can be obtained by combining a set of binary\ndecision functions via an Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) encoding scheme.\nBecause of its model-based nature, the KSC method encompasses three main steps:\ntraining, validation, testing. In the validation stage model selection is\nperformed to obtain tuning parameters, like the number of clusters present in\nthe data. This is a major advantage compared to classical spectral clustering\nwhere the determination of the clustering parameters is unclear and relies on\nheuristics. Once a KSC model is trained on a small subset of the entire data,\nit is able to generalize well to unseen test points. Beyond the basic\nformulation, sparse KSC algorithms based on the Incomplete Cholesky\nDecomposition (ICD) and $L_0$, $L_1, L_0 + L_1$, Group Lasso regularization are\nreviewed.

The objective of the present study is to directly compare\nthe analysis of strong gravitational lens systems using different lens model\nsoftware and similarly parameterized models to understand the differences and\nlimitations of the resulting models. The software lens model translation tool,\nHydraLens, was used to generate multiple models for four strong lens systems\nincluding COSMOS J095930+023427, SDSS J1320+1644, SDSSJ1430+4105 and\nJ1000+0021. All four lens systems were modeled with PixeLens, Lenstool, glafic,\nand Lensmodel. The input data and parameterization of each lens model was\nsimilar for the four model programs used to highlight differences in the output\nresults. The calculation of the Einstein radius and enclosed mass for each lens\nmodel was comparable. The results were more dissimilar if the masses of more\nthan one lens potential were free-parameters. The image tracing algorithms of\nthe software are different, resulting in different output image positions and\ndifferences in time delay and magnification calculations, as well as\nellipticity and position angle of the resulting lens model. In a comparison of\ndifferent software versions using identical model input files, results differed\nsignificantly when using two versions of the same software. These results\nfurther support the need for future lensing studies to include multiple lens\nmodels, use of open software, availability of lens model files use in studies,\nand computer challenges to develop new approaches. Future studies need a\nstandard nomenclature and specification of the software used to allow improved\ninterpretation, reproducibility and transparency of results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 00:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

In\nthis regime, the Coulomb effect on the orbital triplet and singlet\nelectron-pair state is calculated and found to lead to four split energy\nlevels, including two hybrid and two unhybrid states. Moreover, due to the\ninterplay of hybrid and unhybrid Coulomb interactions between two electrons,\nour calculations reveal that the ground pair-state will switch from one hybrid\norbit-triplet state (strong confinement) to the unhybrid orbit-singlet state\n(intermediate confinement) as the channel width gradually increases and then\nback to the original hybrid orbit-triplet state (weak confinement), due to\nlarger total spin of the orbit-singlet state, as the channel width becomes\nlarger than a threshold value.

The active sample appears to have no bias in terms of AGN\ntype, the only difference being the neutral absorbing column which is two\norders of magnitude greater for the Seyfert 2s. In the luminosity range spanned\nby the sample, log L_{14-195keV} [erg/s] = 42.4-43.7, the optically obscured\nand X-ray absorbed fractions are 50-65%. The similarity of these fractions to\nmore distant spectroscopic AGN samples, although over a limited luminosity\nrange, suggests that the torus does not strongly evolve with redshift. Our\nsample confirms that X-ray unabsorbed Seyfert 2s are rare, comprising not more\nthan a few percent of the Seyfert 2 population. At higher luminosities, the\noptically obscured fraction decreases (as expected for the increasing dust\nsublimation radius), but the X-ray absorbed fraction changes little.

We use the\nPizzochero snowplow model for pulsar glitches as well as starquake models to\ndetermine for the first time the expected properties of glitches in accreting\npulsars and their observability. Since some accreting pulsars show\naccretion-induced long-term spin-up, we also investigate the possibility that\nanti-glitches occur in these stars. We find that glitches caused by quakes in a\nslow accreting neutron star are very rare and their detection extremely\nunlikely. On the contrary, glitches and anti-glitches caused by a transfer of\nangular momentum between the superfluid neutron vortices and the non-superfluid\ncomponent may take place in accreting pulsars more often. We calculate the\nmaximum jump in angular velocity of an anti-glitch and we find that it is\nexpected to be about 1E-5 - 1E-4 rad/s. We also note that since accreting\npulsars usually have rotational angular velocities lower than those of isolated\nglitching pulsars, both glitches and anti-glitches are expected to have long\nrise and recovery timescales compared to isolated glitching pulsars, with\nglitches and anti-glitches appearing as a simple step in angular velocity.\nAmong accreting pulsars, we find that GX 1+4 is the best candidate for the\ndetection of glitches with currently operating X-ray instruments and future\nmissions such as the proposed Large Observatory for X-ray Timing (LOFT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 08:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 May 2015 15:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Thus, the application of such a model to AGNs\nfails to produce their observed X-ray emission. As a consequence, a fraction of\ndisk accretion energy is usually assumed to be transferred to the corona. To\navoid this assumption, we propose that gas in a vertically extended\ndistribution is supplied to a supermassive black hole by the gravitational\ncapture of interstellar medium or stellar wind material. In this picture, the\ngas partially condenses to an underlying cool disk as it flows toward the black\nhole, releasing accretion energy as X-ray emission and supplying mass for the\ndisk accretion. Detailed numerical calculations reveal that the X-ray\nluminosity can reach a few tens of percent of the bolometric luminosity. The\nvalue of $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ varies from 0.9 to 1.2 for the mass supply rate\nranging from 0.03 to 0.1 times the Eddington value.

Such a picture\nprovides a natural extension of the model for low luminosity AGN where\ncondensation is absent at low mass accretion rates and no optically thick disk\nexists in the inner region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 08:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

Bandit problems are classes of online learning\nproblems that capture exploration versus exploitation tradeoffs. In a\nmultiarmed bandit model, players can pick among many arms, and each play of an\narm generates an i.i.d. reward from an unknown distribution. The objective is\nto design a policy that maximizes the expected reward over a time horizon for a\nsingle player setting and the sum of expected rewards for the multiplayer\nsetting. In the multiplayer setting, arms may give different rewards to\ndifferent players. There is no separate channel for coordination among the\nplayers.

Quasi-periodic brightenings are frequently observed in the BPs\nand are generally linked with underneath magnetic flux changes.

With highest possible spectral\nand spatial resolution of IRIS, we attempted to identify the sources of these\noscillations.

The source shows a\nnumber of exceptional aperiodic timing phenomena that are observed against a\nbackdrop of timing properties that show consistent trends in all five observed\noutbursts and closely resemble those of other atoll sources. We performed a\ndetailed study of the enigmatic ~410 Hz QPO, which has only been observed in\nSAX J1808.4-3658. We find that it appears only when the upper kHz QPO frequency\nis less than the 401 Hz spin frequency. The difference between the ~410 Hz QPO\nfrequency and the spin frequency follows a similar frequency correlation as the\nlow frequency power spectral components, suggesting that the ~410 Hz QPO is a\nretrograde beat against the spin frequency of a rotational phenomenon in the 9\nHz range.

Observationally, the FGLR\nis a tight relationship with only small scatter. It is, therefore, ideal to be\nused as a constraint for stellar evolution models. The goal of this work is to\ninvestigate whether stellar evolution can reproduce the observed FGLR and to\ndevelop an improved foundation of the FGLR as an extragalactic distance\nindicator. We use different grids of stellar models for initial masses between\n9 and 40 Msun, for metallicities between Z = 0.002 and 0.014, with and without\nrotation, computed with various mass loss rates during the red supergiant\nphase. For each of these models we discuss the details of post-main sequence\nevolution and construct theoretical FGLRs by means of population synthesis\nmodels which we then compare with the observed FGLR. In general, the stellar\nevolution model FGLRs agree reasonably well with the observed one. There are,\nhowever, differences between the models, in particular with regard to the shape\nand width (scatter) in the flux-weighted gravity-luminosity plane. The best\nagreement is obtained with models which include the effects of rotation and\nassume that the large majority, if not all the observed BSG evolve towards the\nred supergiant phase and only a few are evolving back from this stage. The\neffects of metallicity on the shape and scatter of the FGLR are small. (...)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 12:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

A less probed mode is the compensated isocurvature\nperturbation (CIP), a fluctuation in the relative number densities of cold dark\nmatter and baryons. In the curvaton model, a subdominant field during inflation\nlater sets the primordial curvature fluctuation $\\zeta$. In some curvaton-decay\nscenarios, the baryon and cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations nearly\ncancel, leaving a large CIP correlated with $\\zeta$. This correlation can be\nused to probe these CIPs more sensitively than the uncorrelated CIPs considered\nin past work, essentially by measuring the squeezed bispectrum of the CMB for\ntriangles whose shortest side is limited by the sound horizon. Here, the\nsensitivity of existing and future CMB experiments to correlated CIPs is\nassessed, with an eye towards testing specific curvaton-decay scenarios. The\nplanned CMB Stage 4 experiment could detect the largest CIPs attainable in\ncurvaton scenarios with more than 3$\\sigma$ significance.

Independent of the\nspecific motivation for the origin of a correlated CIP perturbation,\ncross-correlation of CIP reconstructions with the primary CMB can improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of a CIP detection.

Specifically, our simulations with the\nprobe method recover the following central characteristics of charge transfer\nin molecular wires: (i) The electrical conductance of short wires falls off\nexponentially with molecular length, a manifestation of the tunneling\n(superexchange) mechanism. Hopping dynamics overtakes superexchange in long\nwires demonstrating an ohmic-like behavior. (ii) In off-resonance situations,\nweak dephasing effects facilitate charge transfer. Under large dephasing the\nelectrical conductance is suppressed.

The\nfirst one is a high performance scheme, which benefits from optimized source\nand channel rate adaptation. In the second scheme, the channel coding rate is\nfixed and optimized along with transmission power with respect to channel and\nsource variations; hence this scheme enjoys simplicity of implementation. The\ntwo last schemes have fixed transmission power with optimized adaptive or fixed\nchannel coding rate. For all the proposed schemes, closed form solutions for\nmean distortion, optimized rate and power are provided and in the high SNR\nregime, the mean distortion exponent and the asymptotic mean power gains are\nderived. The proposed schemes with buffering exploit the diversity due to\nsource and channel variations. Specifically, when the buffer size is limited,\nfixed channel rate adaptive power scheme outperforms an adaptive rate fixed\npower scheme. Furthermore, analytical and numerical results demonstrate that\nwith limited buffer size, the system performance in terms of reconstructed\nsignal SNR saturates as transmission power is increased, suggesting that\nappropriate buffer size selection is important to achieve a desired\nreconstruction quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 14:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

The objective of the present work is to describe affinity maturation of\nB lymphocytes (in which random events are perhaps the most characteristic), and\nto study a possible network model of immune memory. In our model stochastic\nprocesses govern all events. A major novelty of this approach is that it\npermits studying random variations in the immune process. Four basic components\nare simulated in the model: non-immune self cells, nonself cells (pathogens), B\nlymphocytes, and bone marrow cells that produce naive B lymphocytes. A point in\na generalized shape space plus the size of the corresponding population\nrepresents nonself and non-immune self cells. On the other hand, each\nindividual B cell is represented by a disc that models its recognition region\nin the shape space. Infection is simulated by an \"injection\" of nonself cells\ninto the system. Division of pathogens may instigate an attack of naive B\ncells, which in turn may induce clonal proliferation and hypermutation in the\nattacking B cells, and which eventually may slow down and stop the exponential\ngrowth of pathogens. Affinity maturation of newly produced B cells becomes\nexpressed as a result of selection when the number of pathogens decreases.\nUnder favorable conditions, the expanded primary B cell clones may stimulate\nthe expansion of secondary B cell clones carrying complementary receptors to\nthe stimulating B cells. Like in a hall of mirrors, the image of pathogens in\nthe primary B cell clones then will be reflected in secondary B cell clones.\nThis \"ping-pong\" game may survive for a long time even in the absence of the\npathogen, creating a local network memory. This memory ensures that repeated\ninfection by the same pathogen will be eliminated more efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 14:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

For $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}$, a $k$-SIIRV of order $n \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}_{+}$ is the probability distribution of the sum of $n$ independent\nrandom variables each supported on $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$. We denote by ${\\cal\nS}_{n,k}$ the set of all $k$-SIIRVs of order $n$.\n  In this paper, we tightly characterize the sample and computational\ncomplexity of learning $k$-SIIRVs. More precisely, we design a computationally\nefficient algorithm that uses $\\widetilde{O}(k/\\epsilon^2)$ samples, and learns\nan arbitrary $k$-SIIRV within error $\\epsilon,$ in total variation distance.\nMoreover, we show that the {\\em optimal} sample complexity of this learning\nproblem is $\\Theta((k/\\epsilon^2)\\sqrt{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}).$ Our algorithm\nproceeds by learning the Fourier transform of the target $k$-SIIRV in its\neffective support. Its correctness relies on the {\\em approximate sparsity} of\nthe Fourier transform of $k$-SIIRVs -- a structural property that we establish,\nroughly stating that the Fourier transform of $k$-SIIRVs has small magnitude\noutside a small set.\n  Along the way we prove several new structural results about $k$-SIIRVs. As\none of our main structural contributions, we give an efficient algorithm to\nconstruct a sparse {\\em proper} $\\epsilon$-cover for ${\\cal S}_{n,k},$ in total\nvariation distance. We also obtain a novel geometric characterization of the\nspace of $k$-SIIRVs. Our characterization allows us to prove a tight lower\nbound on the size of $\\epsilon$-covers for ${\\cal S}_{n,k}$, and is the key\ningredient in our tight sample complexity lower bound.\n  Our approach of exploiting the sparsity of the Fourier transform in\ndistribution learning is general, and has recently found additional\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 14:48:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 07:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

Specifically, we predict the solution of the parametrized PDE at\neach collocation point on the current level of the SC approximation by\nevaluating each sample with a previously assembled lower fidelity interpolant,\nand then use such predictions to provide deterministic (linear or nonlinear)\niterative solvers with improved initial approximations. As a concrete example,\nwe develop our approach in the context of SC approaches that employ sparse\ntensor products of globally defined Lagrange polynomials on nested\none-dimensional Clenshaw-Curtis abscissas. This work also provides a rigorous\ncomputational complexity analysis of the resulting fully discrete sparse grid\nSC approximation, with and without acceleration, which demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our proposed methodology in reducing the total number of\niterations of a conjugate gradient solution of the finite element systems at\neach collocation point. Numerical examples include both linear and nonlinear\nparametrized PDEs, which are used to illustrate the theoretical results and the\nimproved efficiency of this technique compared with several others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 15:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

These correlations were\nreally revealed in our previous experiments with some large-scale\nheliogeophysical processes as the source ones and the lab detectors as the\nprobe ones. Recently a new experiment has been performing on the base of Baikal\nDeep Water Neutrino Observatory. The thick water layer is an excellent shield\nagainst any local impacts on the detectors. The first annual series 2012/2013\nhas demonstrated that detector signals respond to the heliogeophysical\nprocesses and causal connection of the signals directed downwards: from the\nEarth surface to the Baikal floor. But this nonlocal connection proved to be in\nreverse time. In addition advanced nonlocal correlation of the detector signal\nwith the regional source-process: the random component of hydrological activity\nin the upper layer was revealed and the possibility of its forecast on nonlocal\ncorrelations was demonstrated. But the strongest macroscopic nonlocal\ncorrelations are observed at extremely low frequencies, that is at periods of\nseveral months. Therefore the above results should be verified in a longer\nexperiment. We verify them by data of the second annual series 2013/2014 of the\nBaikal experiment. All the results have been confirmed, although some\nquantitative parameters of correlations and time reversal causal links turned\nout different due to nonstationarity of the source-processes. A new result is\ndisplaying of the advanced response of nonlocal correlation detector to the\nearthquake. This opens up the prospect of the earthquake forecast on the new\nphysical principle, although further confirmation in the next events is\ncertainly needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 13:56:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 08:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

It will be demonstrated that this boundary is preserved\nunder the action of the $SIM(1)$ subgroup of the Lorentz group. Furthermore,\nthe presence of this boundary will break half of the supersymmetry of the\noriginal theory. As the original Chern-Simons theory had $\\mathcal{N} =1$\nsupersymmetry in absence of a boundary, it will only have $\\mathcal{N}=1/2$\nsupersymmetry in presence of this boundary. We will also observe that the\nChern-Simons theory can be made gauge invariant by introducing new degrees of\nfreedom on the boundary. The gauge transformation of these new degrees of\nfreedom will exactly cancel the boundary term obtained from the gauge\ntransformation of the Chern-Simons theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 08:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 15:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

Our experiments are based on the Lytro\n(first gen- eration) camera. Unfortunately, the optical systems of the Lytro\nand those of microscopes are not compatible, lead- ing to a loss of light-field\ninformation due to angular and spatial vignetting when directly recording\nmicroscopic pic- tures. We therefore consider an adaptation of the Lytro op-\ntical system. We demonstrate that using the Lytro directly as an oc- ular\nreplacement, leads to unacceptable spatial vignetting. However, we also found a\nsetting that allows the use of the Lytro camera in a virtual imaging mode which\nprevents the information loss to a large extent. We analyze the new vir- tual\nimaging mode and use it in two different setups for im- plementing light-field\nmicroscopy using a Lytro camera. As a practical result, we show that the camera\ncan be used for low magnification work, as e.g. common in quality control,\nsurface characterization, etc. We achieve a maximum spa- tial resolution of\nabout 6.25{\\mu}m, albeit at a limited SNR for the side views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 12:17:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 09:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}
