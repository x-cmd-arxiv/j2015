Since N-body simulations are\ncomputationally expensive, it is common to use faster methods that approximate\nthe dark matter field as a set of halos. In this approximation, we replace mass\nconcentrations in N-body simulations by a spherically symmetric\nNavarro-Frenk-White halo density profile. We also consider the full mass field\nas the sum of two distinct fields: dark matter halos ($M>9\\times\n10^{12}~M_{\\odot}$/h) and particles not included into halos. Mock halos\nreproduce well the matter power spectrum, but underestimate the lensing power\nspectrum on large and small scales. For sources at $z_{\\rm s}=1$ the lensing\npower spectrum is underestimated by up to 40% at $\\ell\\approx 10^4$ with\nrespect to the simulated halos. The large scale effect can be alleviated by\ncombining the mock catalogue with the dark matter distribution outside the\nhalos. In addition, to evaluate the contribution of substructures we have\nsmeared out the intra-halo substructures in a N-body simulation while keeping\nthe halo density profiles unchanged. For the matter power spectrum the effect\nof this smoothing is only of the order of 5%, but for lensing substructures are\nmuch more important: for $\\ell\\approx 10^4$ the internal structures contribute\n30% of the total spectrum. These findings have important implications in the\nway mock catalogues have to be created, suggesting that some approximate\nmethods currently used for galaxy surveys will be inadequate for future weak\nlensing surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 16:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

They dictate how physical systems of diverse nature, ranging from\nfundamental particles to crystalline materials, respond topologically to\nexternal perturbations, insensitive to local details. The anomaly paradigm was\ntriggered by the discovery of the chiral anomaly that contributes to the decay\nof pions into photons and influences the motion of superfluid vortices in\n$^3$He-A. In the solid state, it also fundamentally affects the properties of\ntopological Weyl and Dirac semimetals, recently realized experimentally in\nTaAs, Na$_3$Bi, Cd$_3$As$_2$, and ZrTe$_{5}$.

With angle resolution,\nthe chiral anomaly is identified by a characteristic note-shaped pattern of the\nemission spectra, originating from the imbalanced occupation of the bulk states\nand a previously unreported momentum dependent energy shift of the surface\nstate Fermi arcs. We further demonstrate that the chiral anomaly likewise\nleaves an imprint in angle averaged emission spectra, facilitating its\nexperimental detection.

The long-term memory updates a\nplay path with weight reinforcement, while the short-term memory can be\nimmediately added or removed. With this, 'long branches' can play a short path,\nbefore returning to a full search at the resulting leaf nodes. Re-using an\nearlier search path allows the tree to be forward-pruned, which is known to be\ndangerous, because it removes part of the search process. Additional checks are\ntherefore made and moves can even be re-added when the search result is\nunsatisfactory. Automatic feature analysis is now central to the algorithm,\nwhere key squares and related squares can be generated automatically and used\nto guide the search process. Using this analysis, if a search result is\ninferior, it can re-insert un-played moves that cover these key squares only.\nOn the tactical side, a type of move that the forward-pruning will fail on is\nrecognised and a pattern-based solution to that problem is suggested. This has\ncompleted the theory of an earlier paper and resulted in a more human-like\napproach to searching for a chess move.

In the\nlinear case no propagation modes are excited at this frequency, however, in\ncase of nonlinear medium when the amplitude of the injected signal is above\nsome threshold value, the solitons are formed and they are propagating inside\nthe coupled nonlinear PCWs. Near field distributions of the light pulse\npropagation inside the coupled nonlinear PCWs and the output powers of the\nregistered signals are studied in a detail. The amplification coefficient is\ncalculated at the various amplitudes of the launched signal. The results\nvividly demonstrate the effectiveness of the weakly coupled nonlinear PCWs as\nall-optical digital amplifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 19:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Mech. Dyn. Astron. vol. 116, 109, 2013) to the study of the rotation of\nstars hosting massive close-in planets. The stars have nearly the same tidal\nrelaxation factors as gaseous planets and the evolution of their rotation is\nsimilar to that of close-in hot Jupiters: they tidally evolve towards a\nstationary solution. However, stellar rotation may also be affected by stellar\nwind braking. Thus, while the rotation of a quiet host star evolves towards a\nstationary attractor with a frequency ($1+6e^2$) times the orbital mean-motion\nof the companion, the continuous loss of angular momentum in an active star\ndisplaces the stationary solution towards slower values: Active host stars with\nbig close-in companions tend to have rotational periods larger than the orbital\nperiods of their companions. The study of some hypothetical examples shows that\nbecause of tidal evolution, the rules of gyrochronology cannot be used to\nestimate the age of one system with a large close-in companion, no matter if\nthe star is quiet or active, if the current semi-major axis of the companion is\nsmaller than 0.03--0.04 AU.

We find that all\nlocations are effectively stable to 2D perturbations, mostly because the disks\nare thick.

For the non-rewired\nrandom graph version, due to a constant number of links out-going from each\nsite, we write a simple mean-field-like equation describing the behaviour of\nmagnetization; we argue that it is exact and support the claim with extensive\nMonte Carlo simulations. For the rewired version, this equation is obeyed only\nat low temperatures. At higher temperatures, rewiring leads to strong\nheterogeneities, which apparently invalidates mean-field arguments and induces\nlarge fluctuations and divergent susceptibility. Such behaviour is traced back\nto the formation of a relatively small core of agents which influence the\nentire system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 12:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 21:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

(2014). For a\n\\rho-estimator based on some model S (which means that the estimator belongs to\nS) and a true distribution of the observations that also belongs to S, the risk\n(with squared Hellinger loss) is bounded by a quantity which can be viewed as a\ndimension function of the model and is often related to the \"metric dimension\"\nof this model, as defined in Birg\\'e (2006). This is a minimax point of view\nand it is well-known that it is pessimistic. Typically, the bound is accurate\nfor most points in the model but may be very pessimistic when the true\ndistribution belongs to some specific part of it. This is the situation that we\nwant to investigate here. For some models, like the set of decreasing densities\non [0,1], there exist specific points in the model that we shall call\n\"extremal\" and for which the risk is substantially smaller than the typical\nrisk. Moreover, the risk at a non-extremal point of the model can be bounded by\nthe sum of the risk bound at a well-chosen extremal point plus the square of\nits distance to this point. This implies that if the true density is close\nenough to an extremal point, the risk at this point may be smaller than the\nminimax risk on the model and this actually remains true even if the true\ndensity does not belong to the model.

So, the\ncombination of the two very different but consistent results -- taken at face\nvalue -- leads to a hint at an ALP with mass $m = {\\cal O} (10^{-10} \\, {\\rm\neV})$ and two-photon coupling in the range $2.94 \\times 10^{- 12} \\, {\\rm\nGeV}^{- 1} < g_{a \\gamma \\gamma} < 0.66 \\times 10^{- 10} \\, {\\rm GeV}^{- 1}$.\nAs a bonus, the Universe would become considerably more transparent above\nenergies $E \\gtrsim 1 \\, {\\rm TeV}$ than dictated by conventional physics. Our\nprediction can be checked not only by the new generation of observatories like\nCTA, HAWC, GAMMA-400, LHAASO, TAIGA-HiSCORE and HERD, but also thanks to the\nplanned laboratory experiments ALPS II (upgraded), STAX, IAXO and with other\ntechniques now being developed by Avignone and collaborators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 15:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 16:49:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 18:26:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2020 16:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In order to provide such information security, the\nconfidentiality, data integrity, and data origin authentication must be\nverified based on cryptographic encryption algorithms. This paper presents a\nnew emerging trend of modern symmetric encryption algorithm by development of\nthe advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm. The new development focuses\non the integration between Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and an enhanced\nversion of AES. A new quantum symmetric encryption algorithm, which is\nabbreviated as Quantum-AES (QAES), is the output of such integration. QAES\ndepends on generation of dynamic quantum S-Boxes (DQS-Boxes) based quantum\ncipher key, instead of the ordinary used static S-Boxes. Furthermore, QAES\nexploits the specific selected secret key generated from the QKD cipher using\ntwo different modes (online and off-line).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 20:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Here,\ntwo-person one-goal assurance games are generalized to N-person, M-goal\nachievement games in which group members can have different motivations with\nrespect to the achievement of the different goals. The theoretical performance\nof groups faced with the challenge of multiple simultaneous goals is analyzed\nmathematically and computationally. For two-goal scenarios one finds that\n\"polarized\" as well as \"biased\" groups perform well in the presence of\ndefectors. A special case, called individual purpose games (N-person, N-goal\nachievements games where there is a one-to-one mapping between actors and goals\nfor which they have a high achievement motivation) is analyzed in more detail\nin form of the \"importance of being different theorem\". It is shown that in\nsome individual purpose games, groups of size N can successfully accomplish N\ngoals, such that each group member is highly motivated towards the achievement\nof one unique goal. The game-theoretic results suggest that multiple goals as\nwell as differences in motivations can, in some cases, correspond to highly\neffective groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 14:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}
