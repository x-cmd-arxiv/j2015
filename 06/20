In such environment, the exposure to particulate matter and other air\npollutants is enhanced, with a consequent worsening of both safety and health.\nThe main solution adopted by the international community is aimed at the\nreduction of the emissions. In this theoretical study, we test a new solution:\nthe removal of air pollutants close to their sources by a network of Air\nPollution Abatement (APA) devices. The APA technology depletes gaseous and\nparticulate air pollutants by a portable and low-consuming scrubbing system,\nthat mimics the processes of wet and dry deposition. We estimate the potential\npollutant abatement efficacy of a single absorber by Computational Fluid\nDynamics (CFD) method. The presence of the scrubber effectively creates an\nadditional sink at the bottom of the canyon, accelerating its cleaning process\nby up to 70%, when an almost perfect scrubber (90% efficiency) is simulated.\nThe efficacy of absorber is not proportional to its internal abatement\nefficiency, but it increases rapidly at low efficiencies, then tends to\nsaturate. In the particular configuration of the canyon we choose (aspect ratio\nof 3) the upwind corner is the most favourable for the absorber application.

As\ntemporally successive point cloud frames are similar, motion estimation is key\nto effective compression of these sequences. It however remains a challenging\nproblem as the point cloud frames have varying numbers of points without\nexplicit correspondence information. We represent the time-varying geometry of\nthese sequences with a set of graphs, and consider 3D positions and color\nattributes of the points clouds as signals on the vertices of the graphs. We\nthen cast motion estimation as a feature matching problem between successive\ngraphs. The motion is estimated on a sparse set of representative vertices\nusing new spectral graph wavelet descriptors. A dense motion field is\neventually interpolated by solving a graph-based regularization problem. The\nestimated motion is finally used for removing the temporal redundancy in the\npredictive coding of the 3D positions and the color characteristics of the\npoint cloud sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able\nto accurately estimate the motion between consecutive frames. Moreover, motion\nestimation is shown to bring significant improvement in terms of the overall\ncompression performance of the sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first paper that exploits both the spatial correlation inside each frame\n(through the graph) and the temporal correlation between the frames (through\nthe motion estimation) to compress the color and the geometry of 3D point cloud\nsequences in an efficient way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 17:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

We also introduce two simple\nmethods for entangling the intra-cavity SC qubits in a GHZ state.

Topologically protected edge\nstates are edge states which are stable against spatially localized (even\nstrong) deformations of the edge. First studied in the context of the quantum\nHall effect, protected edge states have attracted huge interest due to their\nrole in the field of topological insulators. Theoretical understanding of\ntopological protection has mainly come from discrete (tight-binding) models and\ndirect numerical simulation. In this paper we consider a rich family of\ncontinuum PDE models for which we rigorously study regimes where topologically\nprotected edge states exist. Our model is a class of Schroedinger operators on\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$ with a background 2D honeycomb potential perturbed by an\n\"edge-potential\". The edge potential is a domain-wall interpolation, transverse\nto a prescribed \"rational\" edge, between two distinct periodic structures.\nGeneral conditions are given for the bifurcation of a branch of topologically\nprotected edge states from Dirac points of the background honeycomb structure.\nThe bifurcation is seeded by the zero mode of a 1D effective Dirac operator. A\nkey condition is a spectral no-fold condition for the prescribed edge. We then\nuse this result to prove the existence of topologically protected edge states\nalong zigzag edges of certain honeycomb structures. Our results are consistent\nwith the physics literature and appear to be the first rigorous results on the\nexistence of topologically protected edge states for continuum 2D PDE systems\ndescribing waves in a non-trivial periodic medium.

Here we introduce the new adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code\nTENET, which employs a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme for\nhydrodynamics. The Euler equations in this method are solved in a weak\nformulation with a polynomial basis by means of explicit Runge-Kutta time\nintegration and Gauss-Legendre quadrature. This approach offers significant\nadvantages over commonly employed second order finite volume (FV) solvers. In\nparticular, the higher order capability renders it computationally more\nefficient, in the sense that the same precision can be obtained at\nsignificantly less computational cost. Also, the DG scheme inherently conserves\nangular momentum in regions where no limiting takes place, and it typically\nproduces much smaller numerical diffusion and advection errors than a FV\napproach. A further advantage lies in a more natural handling of AMR refinement\nboundaries, where a fall-back to first order can be avoided. Finally, DG\nrequires no wide stencils at high order, and offers an improved data locality\nand a focus on local computations, which is favourable for current and upcoming\nhighly parallel supercomputers.

The OCA approach has been applied in the\nconjunction with DMFT to a number of heavy-fermion, actinide, transition metal\ncompounds, and nanoscale systems. However, several recent studies in the\nframework of impurity models pointed out to serious deficiencies of OCA and\nraised questions regarding its reliability. Here we consider a single band\nHubbard model on the Bethe lattice at finite temperatures and compare the\nresults of OCA to those of a numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\nmethod. The temperature-local repulsion U phase diagram for the particle-hole\nsymmetric case obtained by OCA is in good agreement with that of QMC, with the\nmetal-insulator transition captured very well. We find, however, that the\ninsulator to metal transition is shifted to higher values of U and,\nsimultaneously, correlations in the metallic phase are significantly\noverestimated. This counter-intuitive behavior is due to simultaneous\nunderestimations of the Kondo scale in the metallic phase and the size of the\ninsulating gap. We trace the underestimation of the insulating gap to that of\nthe second moment of the high-frequency expansion of the impurity spectral\ndensity. Calculations for the system away from the particle-hole symmetric case\nare also presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 20:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 23:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

We give explicit error bounds in terms of\nthe parameters of the model; in several settings, our bounds improve on or\nmatch known nonprivate results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 21:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In terms of the latter variables, the NANM\nHamiltonian has the same form as the YM Hamiltonian, except that the Gauss laws\ndo not arise as first class constraints.

The method could eliminate\nthe PSF difference between fibers, extract spectra to the photo noise level, as\nwell as improve the resolution. But the method is limited by its huge\ncomputation requirement and thus cannot be implemented in actual data\nreduction. In this article, we develop a practical computation method to solve\nthe computation problem. The new computation method can deconvolve a 2D fiber\nspectral image of any size with actual PSFs, which may vary with positions. Our\nmethod does not require large amounts of memory and can extract a 4k multi 4k\nnoise-free CCD image with 250 fibers in 2 hr. To make our method more\npractical, we further consider the influence of noise, which is thought to be\nan intrinsic illposed problem in deconvolution algorithms. We modify our method\nwith a Tikhonov regularization item to depress the method induced noise.\nCompared with the results of traditional extraction methods, our method has the\nleast residual and influence by cross talk and noise, even for extreme\nsituation. Our method can convergent in 2 to 4 iterations, and the computation\ntimes are about 3.5 hr for the extreme fiber distance and about 2 hr for\nnonextreme cases.

Motivated by these\nfindings, we then explore the possibility of generating strong infrared effects\nin Einstein gravity, with no $R^2$ terms, as a consequence of the\nhigher-derivative term generated by the conformal anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 09:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 12:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 15:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

However both the shortest path node betweenness\nand the linearly scaled betweenness can only show rankings for all the nodes in\na network. In this paper we explore the mathematical concept of pair-dependency\non intermediate nodes, adapting the concept to criminal relationships and\nintroducing a new source-intermediate reliance measure. To illustrate our\nmeasure, we apply it to rank the nodes in the Enron email dataset and the\nNoordin Top Terrorist networks.

The schemes are based on rigorous methods of\nmatched asymptotic expansions, which account for the object's finite size,\nrequire no \"regularization\" of divergent quantities, and are valid for strong\nfields and relativistic speeds. Up to couplings of the object's multipole\nmoments to the external background curvature, these schemes have established\nthat at least through second order in perturbation theory, the object's motion\nsatisfies a generalized equivalence principle: it moves on a geodesic of a\ncertain smooth metric satisfying the vacuum Einstein equation. I describe the\nfoundations of this result, particularly focusing on the fundamental notion of\nhow a small object's motion is represented in perturbation theory. The three\ncommon representations of perturbed motion are (i) the \"Gralla-Wald\"\ndescription in terms of small deviations from a reference geodesic, (ii) the\n\"self-consistent\" description in terms of a worldline that obeys a\nself-accelerated equation of motion, and (iii) the \"osculating geodesics\"\ndescription, which utilizes both (i) and (ii). Because of the coordinate\nfreedom in general relativity, any coordinate description of motion in\nperturbation theory is intimately related to the theory's gauge freedom. In\nthis review I describe asymptotic solutions of the Einstein equations adapted\nto each of the three representations of motion, and I discuss the gauge freedom\nassociated with each.
