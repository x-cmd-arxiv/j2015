Our goal is to achieve better insight\ninto the composition and evolution of evaporating very small grains (eVSGs) and\nPAHs through analyzing the infrared (IR) aliphatic and aromatic emission bands.\nWe combined spectro-imagery in the near- and mid-IR to study the spatial\nevolution of the emission bands in the prototypical PDR NGC 7023. We used\nnear-IR spectra obtained with AKARI to trace the evolution of the 3.3$\\mu$m and\n3.4$\\mu$m bands, which are associated with aromatic and aliphatic C-H bonds on\nPAHs. The spectral fitting involves an additional broad feature centred at\n3.45$\\mu$m. Mid-IR observations obtained with Spitzer are used to discriminate\nthe signatures of eVSGs, neutral and cationic PAHs. We correlated the spatial\nevolution of all these bands with the intensity of the UV field to explore the\nprocessing of their carriers. The intensity of the 3.45$\\mu$m plateau shows an\nexcellent correlation with that of the 3.3$\\mu$m aromatic band (correlation\ncoefficient R = 0.95), indicating that the plateau is dominated by the emission\nfrom aromatic bonds. The ratio of the 3.4$\\mu$m and 3.3$\\mu$m band intensity\n($I_{3.4}/I_{3.3}$) decreases by a factor of 4 at the PDR interface from the\nmore UV-shielded to the more exposed layers. The transition region between the\naliphatic and aromatic material is found to correspond spatially with the\ntransition zone between neutral PAHs and eVSGs. We conclude that the\nphoto-processing of eVSGs leads to the production of PAHs with attached\naliphatic sidegroups that are revealed by the 3.4$\\mu$m emission band.

Moreover, systemic mass loss may lead to observational signatures\nthat are still to be found. We investigate the impact of the outflowing gas and\nthe possible presence of dust grains on the spectral energy distribution (SED).\nWe used the 1D plasma code Cloudy and compared the results with the 3D\nMonte-Carlo radiative transfer code Skirt for dusty simulations. The\ncircumbinary mass-distribution and binary parameters are computed with\nstate-of-the-art binary calculations done with the Binstar evolution code. The\noutflowing material reduces the continuum flux-level of the stellar SED in the\noptical and UV. Due to the time-dependence of this effect, it may help to\ndistinguish between different ejection mechanisms. Dust, if present, leads to\nobservable infrared excesses even with low dust-to-gas ratios and traces the\ncold material at large distances from the star. By searching for such dust\nemission in the WISE catalogue, we found a small number of Algols showing\ninfrared excesses, among which the two rather surprising objects SX Aur and CZ\nVel. We find that some binary B[e] stars show the same strong Balmer continuum\nas we predict with our models. However, direct evidence of systemic mass loss\nis probably not observable in genuine Algols, since these systems no longer\neject mass through the hotspot mechanism.

This distinguishes our method from most\nother projection-type methods for variational inequalities with monotone\nmapping.

However, while neurophysiologists have long been able to record\nthe responses of neurons in awake, behaving animals, it is another matter\nentirely to say what a given neuron does. A key problem is that in many sensory\ndomains, the space of all possible stimuli that one might encounter is\neffectively infinite; in vision, for instance, natural scenes are\ncombinatorially complex, and an organism will only encounter a tiny fraction of\npossible stimuli. As a result, even describing the response properties of\nsensory neurons is difficult, and investigations of neuronal functions are\nalmost always critically limited by the number of stimuli that can be\nconsidered. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop, optimization-based\nexperimental framework for characterizing the response properties of sensory\nneurons, building on past efforts in closed-loop experimental methods, and\nleveraging recent advances in artificial neural networks to serve as as a\nproving ground for our techniques. Specifically, using deep convolutional\nneural networks, we asked whether modern black-box optimization techniques can\nbe used to interrogate the \"tuning landscape\" of an artificial neuron in a\ndeep, nonlinear system, without imposing significant constraints on the space\nof stimuli under consideration. We introduce a series of measures to quantify\nthe tuning landscapes, and show how these relate to the performances of the\nnetworks in an object recognition task. To the extent that deep convolutional\nneural networks increasingly serve as de facto working hypotheses for\nbiological vision, we argue that developing a unified approach for studying\nboth artificial and biological systems holds great potential to advance both\nfields together.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 17:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}

A question readily accessible to atomic systems is\nrelated to the speed of propagation of matter-waves as a function of the\nlattice geometry. To address this issue, we have investigated theoretically the\nquantum transport of non-interacting and weakly-interacting ultracold fermionic\natoms in several 2D optical lattice geometries. We find that the triangular\nlattice has a higher propagation velocity compared to the square lattice,\ndespite supporting longer paths. The body-centered square lattice has even\nlonger paths, nonetheless the propagation velocity is yet faster. This apparent\nparadox arises from the mixing of the momentum states which leads to different\ngroup velocities in quantum systems. Standard band theory provides an\nexplanation and allows for a systematic way to search and design systems with\ncontrollable matter-wave propagation. Moreover, the presence of a flat band\nsuch as in a two-leg ladder geometry leads to a dynamical density\ndiscontinuity, which contrasts the behavior of mobile and localized atoms in\nquantum transport.

Current experimental methods to analyze synaptic network\nstructure on the cellular level, however, cover only small fractions of\nfunctional neuronal circuits, typically without a simultaneous record of\nneuronal spiking activity. Here we present a method for the reconstruction of\nlarge recurrent neuronal networks from thousands of parallel spike train\nrecordings. We employ maximum likelihood estimation of a generalized linear\nmodel of the spiking activity in continuous time. For this model the point\nprocess likelihood is concave, such that a global optimum of the parameters can\nbe obtained by gradient ascent. Previous methods, including those of the same\nclass, did not allow recurrent networks of that order of magnitude to be\nreconstructed due to prohibitive computational cost and numerical\ninstabilities. We describe a minimal model that is optimized for large networks\nand an efficient scheme for its parallelized numerical optimization on generic\ncomputing clusters. For a simulated balanced random network of 1000 neurons,\nsynaptic connectivity is recovered with a misclassification error rate of less\nthan 1% under ideal conditions. We show that the error rate remains low in a\nseries of example cases under progressively less ideal conditions. Finally, we\nsuccessfully reconstruct the connectivity of a hidden synfire chain that is\nembedded in a random network, which requires clustering of the network\nconnectivity to reveal the synfire groups. Our results demonstrate how synaptic\nconnectivity could potentially be inferred from large-scale parallel spike\ntrain recordings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 18:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2015 11:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Since the luminosity of such flare is proportional\nto the gaseous mass in the circumprimary disc, estimating such mass accurately\nis important. Previous investigations of this issue have produced contradictory\nresults, with some authors estimating super-Eddington flares and large disc\nmass, while others suggesting that the \"fossil\" disc mass is very low, even\nless than a Jupiter mass. Here, we perform simple 1D calculations to show that\nsuch very low estimates of the disc mass are an artifact of the specific\nimplementation of the tidal torque in 1D models. In particular, for moderate\nmass ratios of the binary, the usual formula for the torque used in 1D models\nsignificantly overestimates the width of the gap induced by the secondary and\nthis artificially leads to a very small leftover circumprimary disc. Using a\nmodified torque, calibrated to reproduce the correct gap width as estimated by\n3D models, leads to fossil disc masses of the order of one solar mass. The\nrapid accretion of the whole circumprimary disc would produce peak luminosities\nof the order of 1-20 times the Eddington luminosity. Even if a significant\nfraction of the gas escapes accretion by flowing out the secondary orbit during\nthe merger (an effect not included in our calculations), we would still predict\nclose to Eddington luminosities that might be easily detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 21:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

One key factor affecting the final outcome is whether mass transfer\nremains dynamically stable or instead diverges, leading to the tidal disruption\nof the donor and the merger of the binary. It is typically thought that for low\nratios of the donor mass to the accretor mass, mass transfer remains stable,\nespecially if accretion occurs via a disk. In this Letter, we examine low mass\nratio double white dwarf binaries and find that the initial phase of\nhydrogen-rich mass transfer leads to a classical nova-like outburst on the\naccretor. Dynamical friction within the expanding nova shell shrinks the orbit\nand causes the mass transfer rate to increase dramatically above the accretor's\nEddington limit, possibly resulting in a binary merger. If the binary survives\nthe first hydrogen-rich nova outbursts, dynamical friction within the\nsubsequent helium-powered nova shells pushes the system even more strongly\ntowards merger.

By diffractive free-space\npropagation of the transmitted wave field, this method is sensitive not only to\nabsorption but also to refractive phase shifts induced by the specimen,\npermitting three-dimensional nanoscale imaging of quasi-transparent samples\nsuch as biological cells. However, the reconstruction of the specimen structure\nfrom the observed data constitutes an algorithmically challenging nonlinear\nill-posed inverse problem, mainly due to the characteristic loss of phase\ninformation in the detection of the wave field.\n  In this work, regularized Newton methods are developed for the solution of\nthis tomographic phase retrieval problem, based on a detailed analysis of its\nmathematical structure.

We find a fairly complete picture: some adjoint functors exist,\nincluding a few which were previously unexplored, while others do not exist\nbecause of the failure of finite generation for Chow groups in various\nsituations. For some base fields, we determine exactly which adjoint functors\nexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 22:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Bounded\nsusceptibility also arises in distributed computing applications with download\nbandwidth constraints, and in human epidemics under quarantine policies.\n  Network epidemics have been extensively studied in literature; prior work\ncharacterizes the graph structures required to ensure fast spreading under the\nSI dynamics, and long lifetime under the SIS dynamics. In particular, these\nconditions turn out to be meaningful for two classes of networks of practical\nrelevance -- dense, uniform (i.e., clique-like) graphs, and sparse, structured\n(i.e., star-like) graphs.

We consider the hypothesis that these\ngaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding\nthe dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing\nestimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce\nswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of\nplanetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive\ndisks. For a nominal non-resonant model of the HL Tau system with five planets,\nwe find a maximum mass for the outer three bodies of approximately 2 Neptune\nmasses. In a resonant configuration, these planets can reach at least the mass\nof Saturn. The inner two planets' masses are unconstrained by dynamical\nstability arguments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 01:56:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 13:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Compared with the substitutional atoms such as Al, there\nis a large repulsive interaction between oxygen interstitials at the octahedral\nsite and an <a>-type screw dislocation core, since the volume for the\ninterstitial atom between Ti lattice sites is largely reduced in the core.\nDifferential displacement maps and distributions of interstitial volume\nsurrounding the dislocation core show that the interaction with an oxygen\ninterstitial is very short ranged (~ 5 Angstrom) and directional, mainly\nlocated on the prismatic plane where the majority of lattice displacements in\nthe <a> screw dislocation core occurs.

In this article, we present a novel generative\napproach to music emotion modeling, with a specific focus on the\nvalence-arousal (VA) dimension model of emotion. The presented generative\nmodel, called \\emph{acoustic emotion Gaussians} (AEG), better accounts for the\nsubjectivity of emotion perception by the use of probability distributions.\nSpecifically, it learns from the emotion annotations of multiple subjects a\nGaussian mixture model in the VA space with prior constraints on the\ncorresponding acoustic features of the training music pieces. Such a\ncomputational framework is technically sound, capable of learning in an online\nfashion, and thus applicable to a variety of applications, including\nuser-independent (general) and user-dependent (personalized) emotion\nrecognition and emotion-based music retrieval. We report evaluations of the\naforementioned applications of AEG on a larger-scale emotion-annotated corpora,\nAMG1608, to demonstrate the effectiveness of AEG and to showcase how\nevaluations are conducted for research on emotion-based MIR.

Though each of them have been\nvariously recognized in previous works as expressions of the excitability of\nthe cortical tissue and the associated nonlinear dynamics, a unified picture of\ntheir determinant factors (dynamical and architectural) is desirable and not\nyet available. Progress has also been partially hindered by the use of a\nvariety of statistical measures to define the network events of interest.

A rate model, including synaptic excitation and inhibition\nwith no imposed topology, synaptic short-term depression, and finite-size\nnoise, accounts for all these different, coexisting phenomena. We find that\ntheir emergence is largely regulated by the proximity to an oscillatory\ninstability of the dynamics, where the non-linear excitable behavior leads to a\nself-amplification of activity fluctuations over a wide range of scales in\nspace and time. In this sense, the cultured network dynamics is compatible with\nan excitation-inhibition balance corresponding to a slightly sub-critical\nregime.

We show here that the largest abundance discrepancies are\nreached in planetary nebulae with close binary central stars. This is\nillustrated by deep spectroscopy of three nebulae with a post common-envelope\n(CE) binary star. Abell 46 and Ou5 have O++/H+ abundance discrepancy factors\nlarger than 50, and as high as 300 in the inner regions of Abell 46. Abell 63\nhas a smaller discrepancy factor around 10, but still above the typical values\nin ionized nebulae. Our spectroscopic analysis supports previous conclusions\nthat, in addition to \"standard\" hot (Te~10000 K) gas, a colder (Te~1000 K)\nionized component that is highly enriched in heavy elements also exists. These\nnebulae have low ionized masses, between 0.001 and 0.1 solar masses depending\non the adopted electron densities and temperatures. Since the much more massive\nred-giant envelope is expected to be entirely ejected in the CE phase, the\ncurrently observed nebulae would be produced much later, in post-CE mass loss\nepisodes when the envelope has already dispersed. These observations add\nconstraints to the abundance discrepancy problem. Possible explanations are\nrevised. Some are naturally linked to binarity, such as for instance\nhigh-metallicity nova ejecta, but it is difficult at this stage to depict an\nevolutionary scenario consistent with all the observed properties.

There are $n$ sites (or loci), a finite number of letters (or\nalleles) at every site, and we do not make any scaling assumptions. In\nparticular, we do not assume a diffusion limit. We consider the following\nmarginal ancestral recombination process. Let $S = \\{1,...,n\\}$ and $\\mathcal\nA=\\{A_1, ..., A_m\\}$ be a partition of $S$. We concentrate on the joint\nprobability of the letters at the sites in $A_1$ in individual $1$, $...$, and\nat the sites in $A_m$ in individual $m$, where the individuals are sampled from\nthe current population without replacement. Following the ancestry of these\nsites backwards in time yields a process on the set of partitions of $S$,\nwhich, in the diffusion limit, turns into a marginalised version of the\n$n$-locus ancestral recombination graph. With the help of an\ninclusion-exclusion principle, we show that the type distribution corresponding\nto a given partition may be represented in a systematic way, with the help of\nso-called recombinators and sampling functions. The same is true of correlation\nfunctions (known as linkage disequilibria in genetics) of all orders.\n  We prove that the partitioning process (backward in time) is dual to the\nMoran population process (forward in time), where the sampling function plays\nthe role of the duality function. This sheds new light on the work of\nBobrowski, Wojdyla, and Kimmel (2010). The result also leads to a closed system\nof ordinary differential equations for the expectations of the sampling\nfunctions, which can be translated into expected type distributions and\nexpected linkage disequilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 12:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 12:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

In such materials, the valley index is being considered as an\ninformation carrier. Consequently, relaxation mechanisms leading to loss of\nvalley information are of interest. Here, we calculate the rate of valley\nrelaxation induced by charged impurities in graphene. A special model of\ngraphene is applied, where the $p_z$ orbitals are two-dimensional Gaussian\nfunctions, with a spatial extension characterised by an effective Bohr radius\n$a_\\textrm{eB}$. We obtain the valley relaxation rate by solving the Boltzmann\nequation, for the case of noninteracting electrons, as well as for the case\nwhen the impurity potential is screened due to electron-electron interaction.\nFor the latter case, we take into account local-field effects and evaluate the\ndielectric matrix in the random phase approximation. Our main findings: (i) The\nvalley relaxation rate is proportional to the electronic density of states at\nthe Fermi energy. (ii) Charged impurities located in the close vicinity of the\ngraphene plane, at distance $d \\lesssim 0.3\\,\\textrm{\\AA}$, are much more\nefficient in inducing valley relaxation than those farther away, the effect of\nthe latter being suppressed exponentially with increasing graphene-impurity\ndistance $d$. (iii) Both in the absence and in the presence of\nelectron-electron interaction, the valley relaxation rate shows pronounced\ndependence on the effective Bohr radius $a_\\textrm{eB}$. The trends are\ndifferent in the two cases: in the absence (presence) of screening, the valley\nrelaxation rate decreases (increases) for increasing effective Bohr radius.\nThis last result highlights that a quantitative calculation of the valley\nrelaxation rate should incorporate electron-electron interactions as well as an\naccurate knowledge of the electronic wave functions on the atomic length scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 12:13:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 13:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

In the case of a single image this is called the\nShape-from-Shading (SfS) problem and it is known to be ill-posed even in a\nsimplified version like the vertical light source case. A huge number of works\ndeals with the orthographic SfS problem based on the Lambertian reflectance\nmodel, the most common and simplest model which leads to an eikonal type\nequation when the light source is on the vertical axis. In this paper we want\nto study non-Lambertian models since they are more realistic and suitable\nwhenever one has to deal with different kind of surfaces, rough or specular. We\nwill present a unified mathematical formulation of some popular orthographic\nnon-Lambertian models, considering vertical and oblique light directions as\nwell as different viewer positions. These models lead to more complex\nstationary nonlinear partial differential equations of Hamilton-Jacobi type\nwhich can be regarded as the generalization of the classical eikonal equation\ncorresponding to the Lambertian case.

Via this unified approach, we are able to develop a semi-Lagrangian\napproximation scheme for the Oren-Nayar and the Phong model and to prove a\ngeneral convergence result.

In particular, we\ntested the effects of the integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF) on\nvarious predicted abundance patterns. The IGIMF depends on the star formation\nrate and metallicity and predicts less massive stars in a regime of low star\nformation, as it is the case in dwarf spheroidals. We adopted a detailed\nchemical evolution model following the evolution of $\\alpha$-elements, Fe and\nEu, and assuming the currently best set of stellar yields. We also explored\ndifferent yield prescriptions for the Eu, including production from neutron\nstar mergers. Although the uncertainties still present in the stellar yields\nand data prevent us from drawing firm conclusions, our results suggest that the\nIGIMF applied to Sgr predicts lower [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios than classical IMFs\nand lower [hydrostatic/explosive] $\\alpha$-element ratios, in qualitative\nagreement with observations. In our model, the observed high [Eu/O] ratios in\nSgr is due to reduced O production, resulting from the IGIMF mass cutoff of the\nmassive oxygen-producing stars, as well as to the Eu yield produced in neutron\nstar mergers, a more promising site than core-collapse supernovae, although\nmany uncertainties are still present in the Eu nucleosynthesis. We find that a\nmodel, similar to our previous calculations, based on the late addition of iron\nfrom the Type Ia supernova time-delay (necessary to reproduce the shape of\n[X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relations) but also including the reduction of massive\nstars due to the IGIMF, better reproduces the observed abundance ratios in Sgr\nthan models without the IGIMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 13:30:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 09:21:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 19:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Given a mathematical graph\nrepresentation of a network, methods from graph theory enable a precise\ninvestigation of its properties. Software for the analysis of graphs is widely\navailable and has been applied to graphs describing large scale networks such\nas social networks, protein-interaction networks, etc. In these applications,\ngraph acquisition, i.e., the extraction of a mathematical graph from a network,\nis relatively simple. However, for many network-like structures, e.g. leaf\nvenations, slime molds and mud cracks, data collection relies on images where\ngraph extraction requires domain-specific solutions or even manual. Here we\nintroduce Network Extraction From Images, NEFI, a software tool that\nautomatically extracts accurate graphs from images of a wide range of networks\noriginating in various domains. While there is previous work on graph\nextraction from images, theoretical results are fully accessible only to an\nexpert audience and ready-to-use implementations for non-experts are rarely\navailable or insufficiently documented. NEFI provides a novel platform allowing\npractitioners from many disciplines to easily extract graph representations\nfrom images by supplying flexible tools from image processing, computer vision\nand graph theory bundled in a convenient package. Thus, NEFI constitutes a\nscalable alternative to tedious and error-prone manual graph extraction and\nspecial purpose tools. We anticipate NEFI to enable the collection of larger\ndatasets by reducing the time spent on graph extraction. The analysis of these\nnew datasets may open up the possibility to gain new insights into the\nstructure and function of various types of networks.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations. However, the calibration curve obtained in this way\ndepends on the composition of the cosmic rays, which can introduce biases in\ncomposition analyses when parameters with a strong dependence on primary energy\nare considered. In this work we develop an analytical method to study these\neffects. We consider AMIGA, the low energy extension of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory corresponding to the surface detectors, to illustrate the use of\nthe method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 14:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Albeit uncertain, these data enable the possibility to start\nunraveling complex multivariable, multiscale relationships if the appropriate\nstatistical methods are applied.\n  Here, we investigate the potential of the wavelet cross-correlation method as\na tool for identifying multiscale interactions, feedback and regime shifts in\ngeophysical systems. The ability of wavelet cross-correlation to resolve the\nfast and slow components of coupled systems is tested on synthetic data of\nknown directionality, and then applied to observations to study one of the most\ncritical interactions between land and atmosphere: the coupling between soil\nmoisture and near-ground air temperature. Results show that our method is not\nonly able to capture the dynamics of the soil moisture-temperature coupling\nover a wide range of temporal scales (from days to several months) and climatic\nregimes (from wet to dry), but also to consistently identify the magnitude and\ndirectionality of the coupling. Consequently, wavelet cross-correlations are\npresented as a promising tool for the study of multiscale interactions, with\nthe potential of being extended to the analysis of causal relationships in the\nEarth system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 14:45:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

The obtained results\nare so appealing that in quest for correlation lengths and associated universal\ncritical indices $\\nu$, which characterize the divergence of correlation\nlengths on approaching critical points, one might be inclined to substitute the\nhard task of determining an asymptotic behavior of a two-point correlation\nfunction by an easier one, of determining the quantum-critical scaling of the\nquantum fidelity.

Our aim in this paper is to fill up this gap, at least\npartially, by verifying the laws of quantum-critical scaling theory of quantum\nfidelity in a $2D$ case. To this end, we study correlation functions and\nquantum fidelity of $2D$ exactly solvable models, which are interacting,\nquasifree, spinfull, lattice-fermion models.

These facts follow from the\nobtained by us analytical asymptotic formulae for two-point correlation\nfunctions. In such new circumstances we discuss the behavior of quantum\nfidelity from the perspective of quantum-critical scaling theory.

The rotational orientation of most pulsars can\nbe inferred only from the (``fiducial') polarization angle of their radiation,\nwhen their beam points directly at the Earth and the emitting polar fluxtube\nfield is $\\parallel$ to the rotation axis. Earlier studies have been\nunrevealing owing to the admixture of different types of radiation (core and\nconal, two polarization modes), producing both $\\parallel$ or $\\perp$\nalignments. In this paper we analyze the some 50 pulsars having three\ncharacteristics: core radiation beams, reliable absolute polarimetry, and\naccurate proper motions. The ``fiducial' polarization angle of the core\nemission, we then find, is usually oriented $\\perp$ to the proper-motion\ndirection on the sky. As the primary core emission is polarized $\\perp$ to the\nprojected magnetic field in Vela and other pulsars where X-ray imaging reveals\nthe orientation, this shows that the proper motions usually lie $\\parallel$ to\nthe rotation axes on the sky. Two key physical consequences then follow: first,\nto the extent that supernova ``kicks' are responsible for pulsar proper\nmotions, they are mostly $\\parallel$ to the rotation axis; and second that most\npulsar radiation is heavily processed by the magnetospheric plasma such that\nthe lowest altitude ``parent' core emission is polarized $\\perp$ to the\nemitting field, propagating as the extraordinary (X) mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 15:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Specifically, we are\ninterested in the efficiency of local power assignment schemes, or oblivious\npower schemes, in approximating wireless scheduling. Oblivious power schemes\nare motivated by networking scenarios when power levels must be decided in\nadvance, and not as part of the scheduling computation.\n  We first show that the known algorithms fail to obtain sub-logarithmic\nbounds; that is, their approximation ratio are $\\tilde\\Omega(\\log\n\\max(\\Delta,n))$, where $n$ is the number of links, $\\Delta$ is the ratio of\nthe maximum and minimum link lengths, and $\\tilde\\Omega$ hides\ndoubly-logarithmic factors.

L.\nSiegel on his 1932 account of Riemanns unpublished work on the zeta function.\nBy application of standard asymptotic methods for integral estimation, and the\nuse of certain approximations pertaining to special functions, it proves\npossible to derive a new zeta-sum for the Hardy function Z(t). In itself this\nnew zeta-sum (whose terms made up of elementary functions, but are unlike those\nthat arise from the analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series) proves to be\na computationally inefficient method for calculation of Z(t). However, by\nfurther, independent analysis, it proves possible to correlate the terms the\nnew zeta-sum with the terms of the Riemann-Siegel formula, thought, since its\ndiscovery by Siegel, to be the most efficient means of calculating Z(t). Closer\nexamination of this correlation reveals that is possible to formulate a hybrid\nasymptotic formula for Z(t) consisting of a sum containing both Riemann-Siegel\nterms and terms from the new zeta-sum, in such a way as to reduce the overall\nCPU time required by a factor between 14-15 percent. Alongside the obvious\ncomputational benefits of such a result, the very existence of the new zeta-sum\nitself highlights new theoretical avenues of study in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 16:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

The PVFs are absorption features with minima indicating typical\nphotospheric (i.e., bulk ejecta) velocities (usually ~9000-15,000 km/s near\nB-band maximum brightness). In this work we undertake the most in-depth study\nof HVFs ever performed. The dataset used herein consists of 445 low-resolution\noptical and near-infrared (NIR) spectra (at epochs up to 5 d past maximum\nbrightness) of 210 low-redshift SNe Ia that follow the \"Phillips relation.\" A\nseries of Gaussian functions is fit to the data in order to characterise\npossible HVFs of Ca II H&K, Si II {\\lambda}6355, and the Ca II NIR triplet. The\ntemporal evolution of the velocities and strengths of the PVFs and HVFs of\nthese three spectral features is investigated, as are possible correlations\nwith other SN Ia observables. We find that while HVFs of Ca II are regularly\nobserved (except in underluminous SNe Ia, where they are never found), HVFs of\nSi II {\\lambda}6355 are significantly rarer, and they tend to exist at the\nearliest epochs and mostly in objects with large photospheric velocities. It is\nalso shown that stronger HVFs of Si II {\\lambda}6355 are found in objects that\nlack C II absorption at early times and that have red ultraviolet/optical\ncolours near maximum brightness. These results lead to a self-consistent\nconnection between the presence and strength of HVFs of Si II {\\lambda}6355 and\nmany other mutually correlated SN~Ia observables, including photospheric\nvelocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 21:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 21:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}
