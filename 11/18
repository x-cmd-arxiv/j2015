All the clusters' parameters\nsuch as radii, deprojected distances, reddenings, ages and metallicities have\nbeen obtained by appyling essentially the same procedures which are briefly\ndescribed here. We have used empirical cumulative distribution functions to\nexamine age, metallicity and deprojected distance distributions for different\ncluster subsamples of the catalogue. Our new sample made up of 82 additional\nclusters recently studied by us represents about a 40% increase in the total\nnumber of LMC SCs observed up to now in the Washington photometric system. In\nparticular, we report here the fundamental parameters obtained for the first\ntime for 42 of these clusters. We found that single LMC SCs are typically older\nthan multiple SCs. Both single and multiple SCs exhibit asymmetrical\ndistributions in log (age). We compared cluster ages derived through isochrone\nfittings obtained using different models of the Padova group. Although $t_G$\nand $t_B$ ages obtained using isochrones from Girardi et al. (2002) and Bressan\net al. (2012), respectively, are consistent in general terms, we found that\n$t_B$ values are not only typically larger than $t_G$ ages but also that\nBressan et al.'s age uncertainties are clearly smaller than the corresponding\nGirardi et al. values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 16:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Various small NEOs\nhave been discovered with orbits that can be linked to 2P and the Taurid\nmeteoroid stream. Maribo and Sutter's Mill are CM type carbonaceous chondrites\nthat fell in Denmark on Jan 17, 2009 and Apr 22, 2012, respectively. Their\npre-atmospheric orbits place them in the middle of the Taurid meteoroid stream,\nwhich raises the intriguing possibility that comet 2P could be the parent body\nof CM chondrites. To investigate whether a relationship between comet 2P, the\nTaurid complex associated NEOs, and CM chondrites exists, we performed\nphotometric and spectroscopic studies of these objects in the visible\nwavelength range. We observed 2P and 10 NEOs on Aug 2, 2011 with FORS at the\nVLT. Images in the R filter, used to investigate the possible presence of\ncometary activity around the nucleus of 2P and the NEOs, show that no resolved\ncoma is present. None of the FORS spectra show the 700 nm absorption feature\ndue to hydrated minerals that is seen in the CM chondrite meteorites. All\nobjects show featureless spectra with moderate reddening slopes at $\\lambda <\n800$nm. Apart for 2003 QC10 and 1999 VT25, which show a flatter spectrum, the\nspectral slope of the observed NEOs is compatible with that of 2P. However,\nmost of the NEOs show evidence of a silicate absorption in lower S/N data at\n$\\lambda > 800$nm, which is not seen in 2P, which suggests that they are not\nrelated. Despite similar orbits, we find no spectroscopic evidence for a link\nbetween 2P, the Taurid complex NEOs and the Maribo and Sutter's Mill\nmeteorites. However, we cannot rule out a connection to the meteorites either,\nas the spectral differences may be caused by secondary alteration of the\nsurfaces of the NEOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 16:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

It will be shown\nthat in spite of this improved method the LHC poses serious difficulties for\nsuch an analysis. Some principle difficulties are due to the special character\nof scientific projects.

Recently, examples of\nlonger-term emission variability have emerged that are often correlated with\nchanges in the rotational properties of the pulsar. To further illuminate this\nrelationship, we have developed techniques to identify emission and rotation\nvariability in pulsar data, and determine correlations between the two.\nIndividual observations may be too noisy to identify subtle changes in the\npulse profile. We use Gaussian process (GP) regression to model noisy\nobservations and produce a continuous map of pulse profile variability.\nGenerally, multiple observing epochs are required to obtain the pulsar spin\nfrequency derivative ($\\dot{\\nu}$). GP regression is, therefore, also used to\nobtain $\\dot{\\nu}$, under the hypothesis that pulsar timing noise is primarily\ncaused by unmodelled changes in $\\dot{\\nu}$. Our techniques distinguish between\ntwo types of variability: changes in the total flux density versus changes in\nthe pulse shape. We have applied these techniques to 168 pulsars observed by\nthe Parkes radio telescope, and see that although variations in flux density\nare ubiquitous, substantial changes in the shape of the pulse profile are rare.\nWe reproduce previously published results and present examples of profile shape\nchanging in seven pulsars; in particular, a clear new example of correlated\nchanges in profile shape and rotation is found in PSR~J1602$-$5100. In the\nshape changing pulsars, a more complex picture than the previously proposed two\nstate model emerges.

We follow\nthe processing of dust grains that formed in the Type II-b supernova by\nmodelling the sputtering of grains. The dust is located in dense ejecta clumps\ncrossed by the reverse shock. Further sputtering in the inter-clump medium once\nthe clumps are disrupted by the reverse shock is investigated. The dust\nevolution in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P supernovae and their remnants\nis also studied. We study oxygen-rich clumps that describe the ejecta oxygen\ncore, and carbon-rich clumps that correspond to the outermost carbon-rich\nejecta zone. We consider the dust components formed in the supernova, several\nreverse shock velocities and inter-clump gas temperatures, and derive dust\ngrain size distributions and masses as a function of time. We find that\nnon-thermal sputtering in clumps is important and accounts for reducing the\ngrain population by ~ 40% to 80% in mass, depending on the clump gas\nover-density and the grain type and size. A Type II-b supernova forms small\ngrains that are sputtered within clumps and in the inter-clump medium. For Cas\nA, silicate grains do not survive thermal sputtering in the inter-clump medium.\nOur derived masses of currently processed silicate, alumina and carbon grains\nin Cas A agree well with values derived from observations. Grains produced by\nType II-P supernovae better survive the remnant phase. For dense ejecta clumps,\ndust survival efficiencies range between 42% and 98% in mass. For the SN1987A\nmodel, the derived surviving dust mass is in the range ~ 0.06-0.13 Msolar. This\ntype of dense supernovae may efficiently provide galaxies with dust.\nSpecifically, silicate grains over 0.1 micron and other grains over 0,05 micron\nsurvive thermal sputtering in the remnant. Therefore, pre-solar grains of\nsupernova origin possibly form in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P\nsupernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 15:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

One of the problems that is being addressed on\nthis new light is the temperature anisotropy of solar wind protons and\nelectrons.

Here\nwe study the role of dark matter halo on the grand-design, $m=2$, spiral modes\nin a galactic disc by carrying out a global mode analysis in the WKB\napproximation. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule is used to determine how\nmany discrete global spiral modes are permitted. First a typical superthin LSB\ngalaxy, UGC 7321 is studied by taking only the galactic disc, modelled as\nfluid; and then the disc embedded in a dark matter halo. We find that both\ncases permit the existence of global spiral modes. This is in contrast to\nearlier results where the inclusion of dark matter halo was shown to nearly\nfully suppress local, swing-amplified spiral features. Although technically\nglobal modes are permitted in the fluid model as shown here, we argue that due\nto lack of tidal interactions, these are not triggered in LSB galaxies. For\ncomparison, we carried out a similar analysis for the Galaxy, for which the\ndark matter halo does not dominate in the inner regions. We show that here too\nthe dark matter halo has little effect, hence the disc embedded in a halo is\nalso able to support global modes.

By renormalization group\napproach we derive first the effective theory close to the critical line at\npositive chemical potential. This is the sum of two terms: a Dirac action\n$S_D$, found in the short-range Ising universality class, and a CS breaking\nterm $S_{AN}$. While $S_D$ originates from low-energy excitations, $S_{AN}$\nderives from the higher energy modes where singularities develop, due to the\nlong-range nature of the model. At criticality $S_{AN}$ flows to zero if\n$\\alpha > 2$, while if $\\alpha < 2$ it dominates and determines the breakdown\nof the CS. Out of criticality $S_{AN}$ breaks, in the considered approximation,\nthe effective Lorentz invariance (ELI) for every finite $\\alpha$. As $\\alpha$\nincreases, such ELI breakdown becomes less and less pronounced and in the\nshort-range limit $\\alpha \\to \\infty$ the ELI is restored. To test the validity\nof the effective theory, we compared the two-fermion static correlations and\nthe von Neumann entropy obtained from them with the ones calculated on the\nlattice, finding agreement.

This remarkable variation in genome size is the\noutcome of complex interactions between various evolutionary factors such as\npoint mutation rate, population size, insertions and deletions, and genome\nediting mechanisms that may be specific to certain taxonomic lineages. While\ncomparative genomics analyses have uncovered some of the relationships between\nthese diverse evolutionary factors, we still do not understand what drives\ngenome size evolution. Specifically, it is not clear how primordial mutational\nprocesses of base substitutions, insertions, and deletions influence genome\nsize evolution in asexual organisms. Here, we use digital evolution to\ninvestigate genome size evolution by tracking genome edits and their fitness\neffects in real time. In agreement with empirical data, we find that mutation\nrate is inversely correlated with genome size in asexual populations. We show\nthat at low point mutation rate, insertions are significantly more beneficial\nthan deletions, driving genome expansion and acquisition of phenotypic\ncomplexity. Conversely, high mutational load experienced at high mutation rates\ninhibits genome growth, forcing the genomes to compress genetic information.\nOur analyses suggest that the inverse relationship between mutation rate and\ngenome size is a result of the tradeoff between evolving phenotypic innovation\nand limiting the mutational load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 20:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

In this article we re-visit the relation between\noptical obscuration and X-ray absorption in AGNs. We make use of our \"dust\ncolor\" method (Burtscher et al. 2015) to derive the optical obscuration A_V and\nconsistently estimated X-ray absorbing columns using 0.3--150 keV spectral\nenergy distributions. We also take into account the variable nature of the\nneutral gas column N_H and derive the Seyfert sub-classes of all our objects in\na consistent way.\n  We show in a sample of 25 local, hard-X-ray detected Seyfert galaxies (log\nL_X / (erg/s) ~ 41.5 - 43.5) that there can actually be a good agreement\nbetween optical and X-ray classification. If Seyfert types 1.8 and 1.9 are\nconsidered unobscured, the threshold between X-ray unabsorbed and absorbed\nshould be chosen at a column N_H = 10^22.3 / cm^2 to be consistent with the\noptical classification.\n  We find that N_H is related to A_V and that the N_H/A_V ratio is\napproximately Galactic or higher in all sources, as indicated previously. But\nin several objects we also see that deviations from the Galactic ratio are only\ndue to a variable X-ray column, showing that (1) deviations from the Galactic\nN_H/A_V can simply be explained by dust-free neutral gas within the broad line\nregion in some sources, that (2) the dust properties in AGNs can be similar to\nGalactic dust and that (3) the dust color method is a robust way to estimate\nthe optical extinction towards the sublimation radius in all but the most\nobscured AGNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 10:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Previous observations led to the hypothesis that for\nclose-in giant planets, spin-orbit alignment is enforced by tidal interactions.\nHere, we examine two problems with this hypothesis. First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 21:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 22:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

By employing the Chevalier\n\\& Imamura linearization method and the Nakayama instability boundary\nconditions, we discover that there are regions of parameter space where\ndisks/shocks with outflows can be stable or unstable. In regions of\ninstability, we find that preshock deceleration is always unstable to the\nzeroth mode with zero frequency of oscillation, but is always stable to the\nfundamental mode and overtones. Furthermore, we also find that preshock\nacceleration is always unstable to the zeroth mode and that the fundamental\nmode and overtones become increasingly less stable as the shock location moves\naway from the horizon when the disk half-height expands above $\\sim 12$\ngravitational radii at the shock radius.

Instead, heuristic or empirical approaches are used to select tilings.\nWe argue that conflict misses, traditionally neglected or seen as a small\nconstant effect, are the only fundamentally important cache miss category, that\nthey form a solid basis by which caches can become modellable, and that models\nleaning on cache associatvity analysis can be used to generate cache performant\ntilings.

For equilateral triangles, the lowest six\nenergy states (including spin) are grouped in an energy shell, are localized\nonly around corner areas, and are separated by a large energy gap from the\nstates with higher energy which are localized on the sides of the triangle. The\nenergy levels strongly depend on the aspect ratio of the triangle sides, i.e.,\nthickness/length ratio, in such a way that the energy differences are not\nmonotonous functions of this ratio.

One that has\nbeen considered only occasionally in the literature is external\nphotoevaporation by far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from nearby, massive stars,\ndespite the fact that nearly half of all disks will experience\nphotoevaporation. Another effect apparently not considered in the literature is\na spatially and temporally varying value of $\\alpha$ in the disk [where the\nturbulent viscosity $\\nu$ is $\\alpha$ times the sound speed C times the disk\nscale height H]. Here we use the formulation of Bai \\& Stone (2011) to relate\n$\\alpha$ to the ionization fraction in the disk, assuming turbulent transport\nof angular momentum is due to the magnetorotational instability. We find that\ndisk evolution is most sensitive to the surface area of dust. Typically $\\alpha\n\\lesssim 10^{-5}$ in the inner disk ($< 2$ AU), rising to $\\sim 10^{-1}$ beyond\n20 AU. This drastically alters the structure of the disk and the flow of mass\nthrough it: while the outer disk rapidly viscously spreads, the inner disk\nhardly evolves; this leads to a steep surface density profile with a slope < p\n> $\\approx$ 2 - 5 in the 5-30 AU region) that is made steeper by external\nphotoevaporation. We also find that the combination of variable $\\alpha$ and\nexternal photoevaporation eventually causes gas as close as 3 AU, previously\naccreting inward, to be drawn outward to the photoevaporated outer edge of the\ndisk. These effects have drastic consequences for planet formation and volatile\ntransport in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 23:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

It is still not\nclear whether the compact object of the system or the companion Be star is\nresponsible for the long-term modulation. We study here the stability of Plong.\nSuch a stability is expected if Plong is due to periodic (P2) Doppler boosting\nof periodic (P1) ejections from the accreting compact object of the system. On\nthe contrary it is not expected if Plong is related to variations in the mass\nloss of the companion Be star. We built a database of 36.8 yr of radio\nobservations of LSI +61 303 covering more than 8 long-term cycles. We performed\ntiming and correlation analysis. In addition to the two dominant features at P1\nand P2, the timing analysis gives a feature at Plong=1628 \\pm 48 days. The\ndetermined value of Plong agrees with the beat of the two dominant features,\ni.e. Pbeat=1/(\\nu1 -\\nu2)=1626 \\pm 68 d. The correlation coefficient of the\nradio data oscillates at multiples of Pbeat. Cycles in varying Be stars change\nin length and disappear after 2-3 cycles following the well-studied case of the\nbinary system zeta Tau. On the contrary, in LSI +61 303 the long-term period is\nquite stable and repeats itself over the available 8 cycles. The long-term\nmodulation in LSI +61 303 accurately reflects the beat of periodical Doppler\nboosting (induced by precession) with the periodicity of the ejecta. The peak\nof the long-term modulation occurs at the coincidence of the maximum number of\nejected particles with the maximum Doppler boosting of their emission; this\ncoincidence occurs every 1/(\\nu1 - \\nu2) and creates the long-term modulation\nobserved in LSI +61 303.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 23:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

At the same time, there is a molecular\nstar formation law that is linear in the main and outer parts of disks and in\ndIrrs because the duration of individual structures in the molecular phase is\nalso the dynamical time scale, canceling the additional 0.5 power of surface\ndensity. The total gas consumption time scales directly with the midplane\ndynamical time, quenching star formation in the inner regions if there is no\naccretion, and sustaining star formation for ~100 Gyr or more in the outer\nregions with no qualitative change in gas stability or molecular cloud\nproperties. The ULIRG track follows from high densities in galaxy collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 00:54:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

However, there is no\naccompanying \"proof of correctness\" for the generative model, showing that the\nfeedforward deep net is the correct inference method for recovering the hidden\nlayer given the input. Furthermore, these models are complicated.\n  The current paper takes a more theoretical tack.

Unlike traditional uni-modal cases, where raw\nfeatures are extracted and directly measured, the heterogeneous nature of cross\nmodal tasks requires the intrinsic semantic representation to be compared in a\nunified framework. This paper studies the learning of different representations\nthat can be retrieved across different modality contents. A novel approach for\nmining cross-modal representations is proposed by incorporating explicit linear\nsemantic projecting in Hilbert space. The insight is that the discriminative\nstructures of different modality data can be linearly represented in\nappropriate high dimension Hilbert spaces, where linear operations can be used\nto approximate nonlinear decisions in the original spaces. As a result, an\nefficient linear semantic down mapping is jointly learned for multimodal data,\nleading to a common space where they can be compared. The mechanism of \"feature\nup-lifting and down-projecting\" works seamlessly as a whole, which accomplishes\ncrossmodal retrieval tasks very well. The proposed method, named as shared\ndiscriminative semantic representation learning (\\textbf{SDSRL}), is tested on\ntwo public multimodal dataset for both within- and inter- modal retrieval. The\nexperiments demonstrate that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in\nmost scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 05:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}

We find that a spectrum of diffuse light in\nthe vicinity, but not directly in the line-of-sight, of the SN has absorbing\nsystems nearly identical to those obtained for the \"pure\" SN line-of-sight.\nTherefore, basically all Na I D systems seen toward SN 2014J must originate\nfrom foreground material that extends to at least ~40 pc in projection and none\nat the CSM scale. A fluctuation in the column densities at a scale of ~20 pc is\nalso identified. After subtracting the diffuse, \"background\" spectrum, the\nlate-time SN Na I D profile along the SN line-of-sight is consistent with the\nprofile in the near-maximum brightness spectra. The lack of variability on a ~1\nyear timescale is consistent with the ISM interpretation for the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 06:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 17:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

One can deem the reduced number as an effective\ndimensionality of the set of sparse signals and accordingly, define an\neffective oversampling rate as the ratio between the actual sampling rate and\nthe effective dimensionality. A natural conjecture is that the error of Sigma\nDelta quantization, previously shown to decay with the vanilla oversampling\nrate, should now decay with the effective oversampling rate when carried out in\nthe regime of compressed sensing. Confirming this intuition is one of the main\ngoals in this direction.\n  The study of quantization in CS has so far been limited to proving error\nconvergence results for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sensing matrices, as the\nnumber of bits and/or the number of samples grow to infinity. In this paper, we\nprovide a first result for the more realistic Fourier sensing matrices. The\nmajor idea is to randomly permute the Fourier samples before feeding them into\nthe quantizer. We show that the random permutation can effectively increase the\nlow frequency power of the measurements, thus enhance the quality of\n$\\Sigma\\Delta$ quantization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 06:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 22:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 01:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

Many state of the art methods naively use holistic\nvisual features with language features into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodule, neglecting the sophisticated interaction between them. This coarse\nmodeling also blocks the possibilities of exploring finer-grained local\nfeatures that contribute to the question answering dynamically over time.\n  This paper addresses this fundamental problem by directly modeling the\ntemporal dynamics between language and all possible local image patches. When\ntraversing the question words sequentially, our end-to-end approach explicitly\nfuses the features associated to the words and the ones available at multiple\nlocal patches in an attention mechanism, and further combines the fused\ninformation to generate dynamic messages, which we call episode. We then feed\nthe episodes to a standard question answering module together with the\ncontextual visual information and linguistic information.

In datasets with solely nominal input\nvariables, we observe records with the exact same input $x^u$, but different\nreal valued outputs due to the inherent noise in the system. Existing\nprediction interval estimation methods do not use representations that can\naccurately model such inherent noise in the case of nominal inputs. We propose\na new prediction interval estimation method tailored for this type of data,\nwhich is prevalent in biology and medicine. We call this method Distribution\nAdaptive Prediction Interval Estimation given Nominal inputs (DAPIEN) and has\nfour main phases. First, we select a distribution function that can best\nrepresent the inherent noise of the system for all unique inputs. Then we infer\nthe parameters $\\theta_i$ (e.g. $\\theta_i=[mean_i, variance_i]$) of the\nselected distribution function for all unique input vectors $x^u_i$ and\ngenerate a new corresponding training set using pairs of $x^u_i, \\theta_i$.\nIII). Then, we train a model to predict $\\theta$ given a new $x_u$. Finally, we\ncalculate the prediction interval for a new sample using the inverse of the\ncumulative distribution function once the parameters $\\theta$ is predicted by\nthe trained model. We compared DAPIEN to the commonly used Bootstrap method on\nthree synthetic datasets. Our results show that DAPIEN provides tighter\nprediction intervals while preserving the requested coverage when compared to\nBootstrap. This work can facilitate broader usage of regression methods in\nmedicine and biology where it is necessary to provide tight prediction\nintervals while preserving coverage when input variables are nominal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 08:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 08:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

We proposed to construct a maximum likelihood model for this\nproblem, and to learn the model parameter, we minimize a com- plex loss\nfunction corresponding to the desired complex performance measure. To optimize\nthe loss function, we approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. We also\npropose impose the sparsity to the model parameter to obtain a sparse model. An\nobjective is constructed by combining the upper bound of the loss function and\nthe sparsity of the model parameter, and we develop an iterative algorithm to\nminimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkage- thresholding algorithm\nframework. The experiments on optimization on three different complex\nperformance measures, including F-score, receiver operating characteristic\ncurve, and recall precision curve break even point, over three real-world\napplications, aircraft event recognition of civil aviation safety, in- trusion\ndetection in wireless mesh networks, and image classification, show the\nadvantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 11:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}

The formation processes\nfor these cores, however, as well as their structures, temperatures, Mach\nnumbers, etc., and the boundedness and mass distribution functions of the\nresulting stars, should depend on environment, as should the characteristic\nmass, density, and column density at which cloud self-gravity dominates other\nforces. Because the environments for high and low redshift star formation\ndiffer significantly, we expect the resulting gas to stellar conversion details\nto differ also. At high redshift, the universe is denser and more gas-rich, so\nthe active parts of galaxies are denser and more gas rich too, leading to\nslightly shorter gas consumption timescales, higher cloud pressures, and\ndenser, more massive, bound stellar clusters at the high mass end. With shorter\nconsumption times corresponding to higher relative cosmic accretion rates, and\nwith the resulting higher star formation rates and their higher feedback\npowers, the ISM has greater turbulent speeds relative to the rotation speeds,\nthicker gas disks, and larger cloud and star complex sizes at the\ncharacteristic Jeans length. The result is a more chaotic appearance at high\nredshift, bridging the morphology gap between today's quiescent spirals and\ntoday's major-mergers, with neither spiral nor major-merger processes actually\nin play at that time.

This paper is concerned with the evolution of\ngenealogical information forward in time. For this purpose we define and\nanalytically characterize a path-valued Markov process that contains in its\nstate at time $t$ the extended ancestral lines (adding genealogical distances)\nof the population alive at time $t$. The main result is a representation for\nthe conditional distribution of the extended ancestral lines of a subpopulation\nalive at a fixed time $T$ (present time) given the type information of the\nsubpopulation at time $T$ in terms of the distribution of the sample paths (up\nto time $T$) of a special Markov process (different from the ancestral\nselection graph) to which we refer as backward process. This representation\nallows us both to prove that the extended ancestral lines converge in the limit\n$T \\to \\infty$ if the type information converges in the limit $T \\to \\infty$\nand to study the resulting limit of the extended ancestral lines by means of\nthe backward process. The limit theorem has two applications: First, we can\nrepresent the stationary type distribution of the common ancestor type process\nin terms of the equilibrium distribution of a functional of the backward\nprocess, where in the two type case we recover the common ancestor process of\nFearnhead if we let the population size tend to infinity. Second, we obtain\nthat the conditioned genealogical distance of two individuals given the types\nof the two individuals is distributed as a certain stopping time of a further\nfunctional of the backward process which is a new approach towards a proof that\ngenealogical distances are stochastically smaller under selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 13:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}

A functional model is designed to mimic the coherent flow in the\nstreaks. The control parameters of the model are extracted from Direct\nNumerical Simulations (DNS) statistical data. A Reynolds stress is proposed to\nstudy the effect on the instability of this additional force maintaining the\nbaseflow. Local (quasi-parallel) temporal stability analysis is performed on\nthat model to investigate the linear development of the spanwise vorticity.\nResults show that average profiles, even if they have an inflection, are\nstable: the shear layers inside the velocity streaks are responsible for the\nvorticity formation. Emphasis is put on the convective or absolute nature of\nthe instability, depending on the location in the band. This shows that a\ntransition from a convective to an absolute instability occurs in the zone in\nbetween fully turbulent and laminar flow. The group velocity of the most\nunstable modes compare well to the advection velocity of spanwise vorticity\nmeasured in DNS. This investigation is completed by the global (non-parallel)\nstability analysis of a typical band case.

The excised model is motivated by a formula\nfor central values of these $L$-functions in a paper by Kohnen and Zagier. This\nformula indicates that for a finite set of $L$-functions from a family of\nquadratic twists, the central values are all either zero or are greater than\nsome positive cutoff. The excised model imposes this same condition on the\ncentral values of characteristic polynomials of matrices from $SO(2N)$.\nStrangely, the cutoff on the characteristic polynomials that results in a\nconvincing model for the $L$-function zeros is significantly smaller than that\nwhich we would obtain by naively transferring Kohnen and Zagier's cutoff to the\n$SO(2N)$ ensemble. In this current paper we investigate a modification to the\nexcised model. It lacks the simplicity of the original excised ensemble, but it\nserves to explain the reason for the unexpectedly low cutoff in the original\nexcised model. Additionally, the distribution of central $L$-values is\n`choppier' than the distribution of characteristic polynomials, in the sense\nthat it is a superposition of a series of peaks: the characteristic polynomial\ndistribution is a smooth approximation to this. The excised model didn't\nattempt to incorporate these successive peaks, only the initial cutoff. Here we\nexperiment with including some of the structure of the $L$-value distribution.\nThe conclusion is that a critical feature of a good model is to associate the\ncorrect mass to the first peak of the $L$-value distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In events with strong flares, the correlation coefficients of\nhigh-energy proton fluences with microwave and soft X-ray fluences are higher\nthan those with the speeds of coronal mass ejections. The results indicate a\nstatistically larger contribution of flare processes to high-energy proton\nfluxes. Acceleration by shock waves seems to be less important at high energies\nin events associated with strong flares, although its contribution is probable\nand possibly prevails in weaker events.

Predictions of the spectral variations\nof light fluence in tissue are challenging since the spatial distribution of\noptical properties in tissue cannot be resolved in high resolution or with high\naccuracy by current methods. Spectral corruption has fundamentally limited the\nquantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic methods and impeded the\nlong sought-after goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO2) deep in\ntissues; a critical but still unattainable target for the assessment of\noxygenation in physiological processes and disease. We discover a new principle\nunderlying light fluence in tissues, which describes the wavelength dependence\nof light fluence as an affine function of a few reference base spectra,\nindependently of the specific distribution of tissue optical properties. This\nfinding enables the introduction of a previously undocumented concept termed\neigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT) that can effectively\naccount for wavelength dependent light attenuation without explicit knowledge\nof the tissue optical properties. We validate eMSOT in more than 2000\nsimulations and with phantom and animal measurements. We find that eMSOT can\nquantitatively image tissue sO2 reaching in many occasions a better than\n10-fold improved accuracy over conventional spectral optoacoustic methods.\nThen, we show that eMSOT can spatially resolve sO2 in muscle and tumor;\nrevealing so far unattainable tissue physiology patterns.

Our ADMM updates each of the primal variables\n$x_0,\\ldots,x_p,y$, followed by updating the dual variable. We separate the\nvariable $y$ from $x_i$'s as it has a special role in our analysis.\n  The developed convergence guarantee covers a variety of nonconvex functions\nsuch as piecewise linear functions, $\\ell_q$ quasi-norm, Schatten-$q$\nquasi-norm ($0<q<1$), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped\nabsolute deviation (SCAD) penalty. It also allows nonconvex constraints such as\ncompact manifolds (e.g., spherical, Stiefel, and Grassman manifolds) and linear\ncomplementarity constraints. Also, the $x_0$-block can be almost any lower\nsemi-continuous function.\n  By applying our analysis, we show, for the first time, that several ADMM\nalgorithms applied to solve nonconvex models in statistical learning,\noptimization on manifold, and matrix decomposition are guaranteed to converge.\n  Our results provide sufficient conditions for ADMM to converge on (convex or\nnonconvex) monotropic programs with three or more blocks, as they are special\ncases of our model.\n  ADMM has been regarded as a variant to the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).\nWe present a simple example to illustrate how ADMM converges but ALM diverges\nwith bounded penalty parameter $\\beta$. Indicated by this example and other\nanalysis in this paper, ADMM might be a better choice than ALM for some\nnonconvex \\emph{nonsmooth} problems, because ADMM is not only easier to\nimplement, it is also more likely to converge for the concerned scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 09:25:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 23:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 09:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 01:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 12:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 03:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-31"}
