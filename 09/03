We demonstrate our finding on the dynamics of the\ncenter-of-mass position--momentum uncertainty product of a freely expanding as\nwell as of a trapped BEC. This time-dependent many-body phenomenon is explained\nby the existence of time-dependent correlations which manifest themselves in\nthe system's reduced two-body density matrix used to evaluate the uncertainty\nproduct. Our work demonstrates that one has to use a many-body propagation\ntheory to describe an out-of-equilibrium BEC, even in the infinite particle\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 16:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

In this work, we develop an advanced evolutionary\nalgorithm, which incorporates kernelization techniques to compute large\nindependent sets in huge sparse networks. A recent exact algorithm has shown\nthat large networks can be solved exactly by employing a branch-and-reduce\ntechnique that recursively kernelizes the graph and performs branching.\nHowever, one major drawback of their algorithm is that, for huge graphs,\nbranching still can take exponential time. To avoid this problem, we\nrecursively choose vertices that are likely to be in a large independent set\n(using an evolutionary approach), then further kernelize the graph. We show\nthat identifying and removing vertices likely to be in large independent sets\nopens up the reduction space---which not only speeds up the computation of\nlarge independent sets drastically, but also enables us to compute high-quality\nindependent sets on much larger instances than previously reported in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 16:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

This explains the violation of Bell\ninequalities despite 2-time position correlations. We relate this fact to\nso-called surrealistic trajectories that, in our model, correspond to slowly\nmoving pointers. Next, we emphasize that the nice feature of Bohmian mechanics,\nwhich doesn't distinguish microscopic and macroscopic systems, implies that the\nquantum weirdness of quantum physics also shows up at the macro-scale. Finally,\nwe discuss the fact that Bohmian mechanics is attractive to philosophers, but\nnot so much to physicists and argue that the Bohmian community is responsible\nfor the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 16:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

Quantum key distribution (QKD)\npromises security based on the laws of physics and has rapidly grown from\nproof-of-concept to robust demonstrations and even deployment of commercial\nsystems. Despite these advances, QKD has not been widely adopted, and practical\nlarge-scale deployment will likely require integrated chip-based devices for\nimproved performance, miniaturisation and enhanced functionality, fully\nintegrated into classical communication networks. Here we report low error\nrate, GHz clocked QKD operation of an InP transmitter chip and a SiO$_x$N$_y$\nreceiver chip --- monolithically integrated devices that use state-of-the-art\ncomponents and manufacturing processes from the telecom industry. We use the\nreconfigurability of these devices to demonstrate three important QKD protocols\n--- BB84, Coherent One Way (COW) and Differential Phase Shift (DPS) --- with\nperformance comparable to state-of-the-art. These devices, when combined with\nintegrated single photon detectors, satisfy the requirements at each of the\nlevels of future QKD networks --- from point-of-use through to backbone --- and\nopen the way to operation in existing and emerging classical communication\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 16:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

Continued availability of a modern data center is the\nresult of a complex orchestration among many internal and external actors\nincluding computing hardware, multiple layers of intricate software, networking\nand storage devices, electrical power and cooling plants. During the course of\ntheir operation, many of these components produce large amounts of data in the\nform of event and error logs that are essential not only for identifying and\nresolving problems but also for improving data center efficiency and\nmanagement. Most of these activities would benefit significantly from data\nanalytics techniques to exploit hidden statistical patterns and correlations\nthat may be present in the data. The sheer volume of data to be analyzed makes\nuncovering these correlations and patterns a challenging task. This paper\npresents BiDAl, a prototype Java tool for log-data analysis that incorporates\nseveral Big Data technologies in order to simplify the task of extracting\ninformation from data traces produced by large clusters and server farms. BiDAl\nprovides the user with several analysis languages (SQL, R and Hadoop MapReduce)\nand storage backends (HDFS and SQLite) that can be freely mixed and matched so\nthat a custom tool for a specific task can be easily constructed. BiDAl has a\nmodular architecture so that it can be extended with other backends and\nanalysis languages in the future. In this paper we present the design of BiDAl\nand describe our experience using it to analyze publicly-available traces from\nGoogle data clusters, with the goal of building a realistic model of a complex\ndata center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 16:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Due\nto the power-law decrease of typical {\\gamma}-ray and cosmic-ray spectra of\nastrophysical sources a majority of detected air showers are of low energies,\nthus being detected by CT 5 only, which motivates the need for a reconstruction\nalgorithm based on information from CT 5 alone.

Despite the commonality of this\nphenomena, there are no known general mechanisms able to cause an exponentially\nspreading dis- ease to begin spreading faster. Indeed most features of real\nworld social networks, e.g. clustering1,2 and community structure3, and of\nhuman behaviour, e.g. social distancing4 and increased hygiene5, will slow\ndisease spread. Here, we consider a model where individuals with essential\nsocietal roles-e.g. teachers, first responders, health-care workers, etc.- who\nfall ill are replaced with healthy individuals. We refer to this process as\nrelational exchange. Relational exchange is also a behavioural process, but one\nwhose effect on disease transmission is less obvious. By incorporating this\nbehaviour into a dynamic network model, we demonstrate that replacing\nindividuals can accelerate disease transmission. Furthermore, we find that the\neffects of this process are trivial when considering a standard mass-action\nmodel, but dramatic when considering network structure. This result highlights\nanother critical shortcoming in mass-action models, namely their inability to\naccount for behavioural processes. Lastly, using empirical data, we find that\nthis mechanism parsimoniously explains observed patterns across more than\nseventeen years of influenza and dengue virus data. We anticipate that our\nfindings will advance the emerging field of disease forecasting and will better\ninform public health decision making during outbreaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 17:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

Our simple analytic arguments\nsuggest that for collisions between clouds larger than R~10 pc the lifetime of\nthe broad bridge is more likely to be determined by the lifetime of the\ncollision rather than the radiative or wind feedback disruption timescale.\nHowever for smaller clouds feedback becomes much more effective. This is\nbecause the radiative feedback timescale scales with the ionising flux Nly as\nR^{7/4}Nly^{-1/4} so a reduction in cloud size requires a relatively large\ndecrease in ionising photons to maintain a given timescale.

Evidences for self interaction would have striking\nimplications for particle nature of DM. In order to reconcile such\nastrophysical observations for self interaction with particle properties for\nDM, we consider the general scenario of self interacting Dirac fermionic DM,\n$\\chi$. Also since the exact particle physics model for DM is yet to be probed,\nwe simply adopt the effective model independent framework for DM self\ninteraction which occurs via the most general effective 4-fermion operators\ninvariant under both Lorentz and CPT transformations. From the thorough\ninvestigation of the interrelations among the parameters in this framework,\nnamely, the effective DM self couplings ($G_{i}$), DM mass ($m_{\\chi}$) and\nrelative velocity ($v_{\\rm rel}$), it can be inferred that $G_{i}$ decrease\nwith increasing $m_{\\chi}$ for a given DM self interaction strength. Moreover,\nfor few types of effective operators the values of $G_{i}$ fall off with\nincreasing $v_{\\rm rel}$ while they remain roughly constant for a wide range of\n$v_{\\rm rel}$ for other cases. In addition, the parameter space in this\nframework is constrained by the claimed observational results of ${\\sigma \\over\nm_{\\chi}}$ on cluster scales (Abell 3827, Bullet Cluster) after averaging the\nDM self interaction cross sections over DM velocity distribution in the\ncluster. This puts interesting constraints on the values of effective DM self\ncouplings for different fermionic DM masses for various effective operators\n(scalar, vector, etc.) of DM self interactions in this scenario. Some other\nimplications of DM effective self interaction are also discussed in this model\nindependent framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 20:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}

Thin rims require strong\nmagnetic field amplification beyond simple shock compression if rim widths are\nonly limited by electron energy losses.

We measured rim widths around Tycho's supernova\nremnant in 5 energy bands using an archival 750 ks Chandra observation. Rims\nnarrow with increasing energy and are well described by either loss-limited or\ndamped scenarios, so X-ray rim width-energy dependence does not uniquely\nspecify a model.

The wind mass-loss parameters determine the density structure of\nthe surrounding medium. Combined with the velocity of the SN shock wave, this\nregulates the shock acceleration process. In this article we discuss the\nessential parameters that control the particle acceleration and gamma-ray\nemission in SNe, with particular reference to the Type IIb SN 1993J. The shock\nwave expanding into the high density medium leads to fast particle\nacceleration, giving rise to rapidly-growing plasma instabilities driven by the\nacceleration process itself. The instabilities grow over intraday timescales.\nThis growth, combined with the interplay of non-linear processes, results in\nthe amplification of the magnetic field at the shock front, which can\nadequately account for the magnetic field strengths deduced from radio\nmonitoring of the source.

Severe\nlithography and material limitations seen below the 20 nm node, however, are\nchallenging the fundamental premise of affordable CMOS scaling. Just continuing\nto co-optimize leaf cell circuit and layout designs with process technology\ndoes not enable us to exploit the challenges of a sub-20 nm CMOS. For\naffordable scaling it is imperative to work past sub-20 nm technology\nimpediments while exploiting its features. To this end, we propose to broaden\nthe scope of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) to be more holistic by\nincluding micro-architecture design and CAD, along with circuits, layout and\nprocess technology. Applying such holistic DTCO to the most significant block\nin a system-on-chip (SoC), embedded memory, we can synthesize smarter and\nefficient embedded memory blocks that are customized to application needs.\n  To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed holistic DTCO process, we designed,\nfabricated and tested several design experiments in a state-of-the-art IBM\n14SOI process. DTCOed leaf cells, standard cells and SRAM bitcells were robust\nduring testing, but failed to meet node to node area scaling requirements.\nHolistic DTCO, when applied to a widely used parallel access SRAM sub-block,\nconsumed 25% less area with a 50% better performance per watt compared to a\ntraditional implementation using compiled SRAM blocks and standard cells. To\nextend the benefits of holistic DTCO to other embedded memory intensive\nsub-blocks in SoCs, we developed a readily customizable smart memory synthesis\nframework (SMSF). We believe that such an approach is important to establish an\naffordable path for sub-20 nm scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 21:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}

Rules enable a precise encoding of biochemical\ninteractions at the resolution of sites within molecules, but obtaining an\nintegrated global view from sets of rules remains challenging. Current\nautomated approaches to rule visualization fail to address the complexity of\ninteractions between rules, limiting either the types of rules that are allowed\nor the set of interactions that can be visualized simultaneously. There is a\nneed for scalable visualization approaches that present the information encoded\nin rules in an intuitive and useful manner at different levels of detail. We\nhave developed new automated approaches for visualizing both individual rules\nand complete rule-based models. We find that a more compact representation of\nan individual rule promotes promotes understanding the model assumptions\nunderlying each rule. For global visualization of rule interactions, we have\ndeveloped a method to synthesize a network of interactions between sites and\nprocesses from a rule-based model and then use a combination of user-defined\nand automated approaches to compress this network into a readable form. The\nresulting diagrams enable modelers to identify signaling motifs such as\ncascades, feedback loops, and feed-forward loops in complex models, as we\ndemonstrate using several large-scale models.

MapReduce based systems achieve massive scalability by partitioning\nthe data and running query tasks on those partitions in parallel. Therefore,\neffective data partitioning is critical for task parallelization, load\nbalancing, and directly affects system performance. However, several pitfalls\nof spatial data partitioning make this task particularly challenging. First,\ndata skew is very common in spatial applications. To achieve best query\nperformance, data skew need to be reduced. Second, spatial partitioning\napproaches generate boundary objects that cross multiple partitions, and add\nextra query processing overhead. Consequently, boundary objects need to be\nminimized. Third, the high computational complexity of spatial partitioning\nalgorithms combined with massive amounts of data require an efficient approach\nfor partitioning to achieve overall fast query response. In this paper, we\nprovide a systematic evaluation of multiple spatial partitioning methods with a\nset of different partitioning strategies, and study their implications on the\nperformance of MapReduce based spatial queries. We also study sampling based\npartitioning methods and their impact on queries, and propose several MapReduce\nbased high performance spatial partitioning methods.

The latter is a model of coagulation introduced by\nBertoin which may exhibit gelation.\n  In our model, a large number of particles are initially given a prescribed\nnumber of arms. These arms are activated independently after exponential times\nand successively linked together. However, when the size of a cluster goes\nabove a fixed threshold, it falls instantaneously into the gel, meaning that it\nno longer interacts with the other particles in solution.\n  The concentrations in this model asymptotically obey Smoluchowski's equation\nwith limited aggregations. In this article, we study the discrete features of\nthis model. We are able to argue that it remains closely related with a\nconfiguration model. We specifically obtain explicit expressions for the\nparameters of this configuration model, which show that it is subcritical\nbefore gelation, but remains critical afterwards. As a consequence, the\nasymptotic distribution of a typical cluster in solution is that of a\nsubcritical Galton-Watson tree before gelation, while it is that of a critical\nGalton-Watson tree after gelation.

All the studied samples of series Pd1-xNixTe (x = 0.0 to\n1.0) are crystallized in hexagonal crystal structure within the space group\nP63/mmc. Unit cell volume shrinks almost linearly upon Ni doping in Pd1-xNixTe.\nThe normal state residual resistivity increases with Ni substitution on Pd\nsite. Both the electrical resistivity and magnetic measurements revealed that\nTc decreases with increase of Ni concentration in Pd1-xNixTe and is not\nobserved down to 2K for x=0.30 i.e., 30% of Ni doping at Pd site.\nInterestingly, this is unusual for magnetic Ni doping in a known type-II BCS\ntype superconductor. Magnetic Ni must suppress the superconductivity much\nfaster. Interestingly, the isothermal magnetization measurements for NiTe\nrevealed that Ni is non-magnetic in Pd1-xNixTe structure and hence the Tc\ndepression is mainly due to disorder. The magneto-transport measurements\nrevealed that flux is better pinned for 20% Ni doped PdTe as compared to other\ncompositions of Pd1-xNixTe. The magnetic field dependence of specific heat of\nPd1-xNixTe for x=0.01 was studied and the estimated value of the normalized\nspecific-heat jump,is found to be 1.42, which is under BCS weak-coupling limit.\nSummarily, we report the impact of Ni doping in Pd1-xNixTe superconductor and\nconclude that Ni substitutes at Pd site, suppress superconductivity moderately\nand is of non magnetic nature in this system.

A heterogeneous team allows for the robots to\nbecome \"specialized\", accomplish sub-goals more effectively, and thus increase\nthe overall mission efficiency. Two main scenarios are considered in this work.\nIn the first case study we exploit mobility to implement a power control\nalgorithm that increases the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR)\namong certain members of the network.

We study scaling of per capita incomes for separate census\ndefined income categories against population size for the whole of Australia.\nAcross several urban area definitions, we find that lowest incomes grow just\nlinearly or sublinearly ($\\beta = 0.94$ to $1.00$), whereas highest incomes\ngrow superlinearly ($\\beta = 1.00$ to $1.21$), with total income just\nsuperlinear ($\\beta = 1.03$ to $1.05$).

Next, we construct a suitable basis of the coin space in which the limit\ndensity of the Wigner walk acquires a much simpler form. This allows us to\nidentify various dynamical regimes which are otherwise hidden in the standard\nbasis description.

One such model and\nmethod is a Fokker-Planck approximation to the Boltzmann equation, which can be\nsolved numerically by a stochastic particle method. The stochastic nature of\nthis method leads to noisy estimates of the thermodynamic quantities one wishes\nto sample when the signal is small in comparison to the thermal velocity of the\ngas. Recently, Gorji et al have proposed a method which is able to greatly\nreduce the variance of the estimators, by creating a correlated stochastic\nprocess which acts as a control variate for the noisy estimates. However, there\nare potential difficulties involved when the geometry of the problem is\ncomplex, as the method requires the density to be solved for independently.\n  Importance sampling is a variance reduction technique that has already been\nshown to successfully reduce the noise in direct simulation Monte Carlo\ncalculations. In this paper we propose an importance sampling method for the\nFokker-Planck stochastic particle scheme. The method requires minimal change to\nthe original algorithm, and dramatically reduces the variance of the estimates.\nWe test the importance sampling scheme on a homogeneous relaxation, planar\nCouette flow and a lid-driven-cavity flow, and find that our method is able to\ngreatly reduce the noise of estimated quantities. Significantly, we find that\nas the characteristic speed of the flow decreases, the variance of the noisy\nestimators becomes independent of the characteristic speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 10:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Thus, we\nemphasize that chaotic cycles, which are inevitable in economics, are not only\ninterior properties of economic models, but also can be considered as a result\nof interaction of several economical systems. This provides a comprehension of\nchaos (unpredictability, lack of forecasting) and control of chaos as a global\neconomic phenomenon from the deterministic point of view.\n  We suppose that the results of our paper are contribution to the mixed\nexogenous-endogenous theories of business cycles in classification by P.A.\nSamuelson [76].

This applies in particular to the propagation of cosmic rays from\ntheir sources to Earth, responsible for energy suppressions due to pion\nphotoproduction by UHE protons (the Greisen-Zatsepin Kuzmin limit) and photo\ndisintegration of UHE nuclei (the Gerasimova-Rozental limit). A suppression in\nthe flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these\ninteractions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current\nexperiments. However, such an observation is still not conclusive on the origin\nof the suppression.

In this paper, we\ndevelop a theory of super-resolution from short-time Fourier transform (STFT)\nmeasurements. Specifically, we present a recovery method similar in spirit to\nthe one in [3] for pure Fourier measurements. For a STFT Gaussian window\nfunction of width $\\sigma = 1/(4f_c)$ this method succeeds provably if $\\Delta\n> 1/f_c$, without restrictions on $f_c$. Our theory is based on a\nmeasure-theoretic formulation of the recovery problem, which leads to\nconsiderable generality in the sense of the results being grid-free and\napplying to spike trains on both $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{T}$. The case of\nspike trains on $\\mathbb{R}$ comes with significant technical challenges. For\nrecovery of spike trains on $\\mathbb{T}$ we prove that the correct solution can\nbe approximated---in weak-* topology---by solving a sequence of\nfinite-dimensional convex programming problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 12:03:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 09:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

In this paper, we overcome this problem by\napplying, for the first time, a recently developed safe optimization algorithm,\nSafeOpt, to the problem of automatic controller parameter tuning. Given an\ninitial, low-performance controller, SafeOpt automatically optimizes the\nparameters of a control law while guaranteeing safety. It models the underlying\nperformance measure as a Gaussian process and only explores new controller\nparameters whose performance lies above a safe performance threshold with high\nprobability. Experimental results on a quadrotor vehicle indicate that the\nproposed method enables fast, automatic, and safe optimization of controller\nparameters without human intervention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 13:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 15:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 09:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}

The fit of these data by a\nlocal FR model provides the axial magnetic field strength, the radius, the\nmagnetic flux and the helicity per unit length along the FR axis. We show that\nthese quantities are statistically independent of the position along the FR\naxis. We then derive the generic shape and length of the FR axis from two sets\nof MCs.

We also include\nin the study two sets of small FRs which do not have all the typical\ncharacteristics of MCs. While small FRs are at least ten times more numerous\nthan MCs, the magnetic flux and helicity are dominated by the contribution from\nthe larger MCs. They carry in one year the magnetic flux of about 25 large\nactive regions and the magnetic helicity of 200 of them.

We have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies at\nz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of LyC photons escaping from\ngalaxy halos. UV deep imaging in the COSMOS field obtained with the prime focus\ncamera LBC at the LBT telescope was used together with a catalog of\nspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to build\na sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with L>0.5L*. We obtained deep LBC images of\ngalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27<z<3.40 both in the R\nand deep U bands. A sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escape\nfractions>28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, with\nthe exception of two marginal detections (S/N~2) in the U band, all the other 8\ngalaxies are most likely contaminated by the UV flux of low-z interlopers\nlocated close to the high-z targets. The average escape fraction derived from\nthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel<2%. The implied\nHI photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the IGM\nionized at z~3, as observed in the Lyman forest of high-z QSO spectra or by the\nproximity effect. These results support a scenario where high redshift,\nrelatively bright (L>0.5L*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustain\nthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic IGM at z~3. Star-forming\ngalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (L<<L*) can be the\nmajor contributors to the reionization of the Universe only if their physical\nproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10.

Compared to the famous analogue for\nHausdorff dimension -- namely \\emph{Marstrand's Projection Theorem} -- a\nstriking difference is that the words `at least' cannot be dispensed with: in\nfact, for many planar self-similar sets of dimension $s < 1$, we prove that the\nAssouad dimension of projections can attain both values $s$ and $1$ for a set\nof directions of positive measure.\n  For self-similar sets, our investigation splits naturally into two cases:\nwhen the group of rotations is discrete, and when it is dense.

For energy densities\nhigher than the new mass scale of the theory, a gravitating dust component is\nshown to generically induce an accelerated expansion of the Universe. Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are\nself-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than\na threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime. Above this\nthreshold, the Universe may bounce thereby avoiding a singularity. Another\ndistinctive feature is that the accelerated expansion is of the\nsuperinflationary kind, namely the first Hubble flow function is negative. We\nshow however that the tensor modes are never excited and the tensor-to-scalar\nratio is always vanishing, independently of the energy scale of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 17:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 14:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

Most studies on\ndynamic failure focus on the behaviour of bulk systems in one, two and three\ndimensions under impact and explosive loading, showing universal power law\nbehaviour of fragment size distribution. However, hardly any studies have been\ndevoted to fragmentation of shells. We present a detailed experimental and\ntheoretical study on the fragmentation of closed thin shells of various\nmaterials, due to an excess load inside the system and impact with a hard wall.\nCharacteristic fragmentation mechanisms are identified by means of a high speed\ncamera and fragment shapes and mass distributions are evaluated. Theoretical\nrationalisation is given by means of stochastic break-up models and large-scale\ndiscrete element simulations with spherical shell systems under different\nextreme loading situations. By this we ex-plain fragment shapes and\ndistributions and prove a power law for the fragment mass distribution.\nSatisfactory agreement between experimental findings and nu-merical predictions\nof the exponents of the power laws for the fragment shapes is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 08:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

The\nmeasured linewidth is the sum of the linewidths of the two laser systems.\nAssuming that the two are equal, we find that the linewidth of each ECDL\nmeasured over a time period of 2 \\textmu s is about 0.3 MHz.

Despite its growth in the past few\ndecades, this platform has experienced different challenges. They all arise\nfrom the concern of data safety that the nature of sharing in the cloud\npresents. This paper looks to identify the benefits of using a cloud computing\nplatform and the issue of information security. The paper also reviews the\nconcept of information hiding and its relevance to the cloud. This technique\nhas two ways about it that impact how people use cloud computing in their\norganizations and even for personal implementations. First it presents the\npotential to circulate harmful information and files that can adversely affect\nthe data those users upload on those platforms. It is also the basis of the\nstrategies such as steganalysis and cryptographic storage architecture that are\nessential for data security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 17:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
