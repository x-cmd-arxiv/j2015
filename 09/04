This will increase insurance premiums, in\na way that is independent of a customer's contribution to the causes of climate\nchange. Insurance provides a financial mechanism that mitigates some of the\nconsequences of climate change, allowing damage from increasingly frequent\nevents to be repaired. We observe that the insurance industry could reclaim any\nincrease in claims due to climate change, by increasing the insurance premiums\non energy producers for example, without needing government intervention or a\nnew tax. We argue that this insurance-led levy must acknowledge both present\ncarbon emissions and a modern industry's carbon inheritance, that is, to\nrecognise that fossil-fuel driven industrial growth has provided the\ninnovations and conditions needed for modern civilisation to exist and develop.\nA tax or levy on energy production is one mechanism that would recognise carbon\ninheritance through the increased (energy) costs for manufacturing and using\nmodern technology, and can also provide an incentive to minimise carbon\nemissions, through higher costs for the most polluting industries. The\nnecessary increases in insurance premiums would initially be small, and will\nrequire an event attribution (EA) methodology to determine their size.

In FeSe,\nthe magnetic order is absent below the structural transition temperature\n$T_{str}=90$K, in stark contrast that the magnetism emerges slightly below\n$T_{str}$ in other families. To understand such amazing material dependence, we\ninvestigate the spin-fluctuation-mediated orbital order ($n_{xz}\\neq n_{yz}$)\nby focusing on the orbital-spin interplay driven by the strong-coupling effect,\ncalled the vertex correction. This orbital-spin interplay is very strong in\nFeSe because of the small ratio between the Hund's and Coulomb interactions\n($\\bar{J}/\\bar{U}$) and large $d_{xz},d_{yz}$-orbitals weight at the Fermi\nlevel. For this reason, in the FeSe model, the orbital order is established\nirrespective that the spin fluctuations are very weak, so the magnetism is\nabsent below $T_{str}$. In contrast, in the LaFeAsO model, the magnetic order\nappears just below $T_{str}$ both experimentally and theoretically. Thus, the\norbital-spin interplay due to the vertex correction is the key ingredient in\nunderstanding the rich phase diagram with nematicity and magnetism in Fe-based\nsuperconductors in a unified way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 17:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 07:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Site and bond\npercolation on this ensemble is solved exactly in the infinite size limit using\nprobability generating functions [i.e., the percolation threshold, the size and\nthe composition of the giant (extensive) and small components]. Several\nexamples and applications are also provided. (iii) Our approach can be adapted\nto model interdependent graphs---whose most striking feature is the emergence\nof an extensive component via a discontinuous phase transition---in an equally\ngeneral fashion. We show how a graph can successively undergo a continuous then\na discontinuous phase transition, and preliminary results suggest that\nclustering increases the amplitude of the discontinuity at the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 18:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Experimental\nresults further suggest that dynamics may be understood as long-timescale\ntransitions between multiple low-dimensional attractors. To identify\nmultistable regimes of our model, we develop a method for systematic generation\nof bifurcation diagrams and their analysis in an interpretable low-dimensional\nsubspace, showing the existence and nature of multistable input responses at a\nglance. Stimulation of the PLM neuron pair, experimentally associated with\nforward movement and shown in simulation to drive a limit cycle, defines our\nlow-dimensional projection space. We then obtain bifurcation diagrams for\nsingle-neuron excitation over a range of amplitudes and which classify whether\nthe dynamics in this projection space are associated with a limit cycle, fixed\npoint, or multiple states. In the specific case of compound input into both the\nPLM pair and ASK pair we discover bistability of a limit cycle and a fixed\npoint, with transitional timescales between different states being much longer\nthan other timescales in the system. This suggests consistency of our model\nwith the characterization of dynamics in neural systems as long-timescale\ntransitions between discrete, low-dimensional attractors corresponding to\nbehavioral states.

Joint photons can sample an\nobject collectively, resulting in faster phase accumulation and higher spatial\nresolution, while common components of noise can be subtracted. Even more, they\ncan accomplish this while physically separate, due to the nonlocal properties\nof quantum mechanics. Indeed, nearly all quantum optics experiments rely on\nthis separation, using individual point detectors that are scanned to measure\ncoincidence counts and correlations. Scanning, however, is tedious, time\nconsuming, and ill-suited for imaging. Moreover, the separation of beam paths\nadds complexity to the system while reducing the number of photons available\nfor sampling, and the multiplicity of detectors does not scale well for greater\nnumbers of photons and higher orders of entanglement. We bypass all of these\nproblems here by directly imaging collinear photon pairs with an\nelectron-multiplying CCD camera. We show explicitly the benefits of quantum\nnonlocality by engineering the spatial entanglement of the illuminating photons\nand introduce a new method of correlation measurement by converting time-domain\ncoincidence counting into spatial-domain detection of selected pixels. We show\nthat classical transport-of-intensity methods are applicable in the quantum\ndomain and experimentally demonstrate nearly optimal (Heisenberg-limited) phase\nmeasurement for the given quantum illumination.

For that reason, the\nmost metal-poor stars in the bulge of the Milky Way provide excellent tracers\nof the chemistry of the high-redshift universe.

We highlight two galaxies in our sample where strong\ngravitational lensing masses favour MW-like IMFs. Like the high-{\\sigma} sample\non average, these galaxies have strong Na I 1.14 \\mu m; taken in isolation\ntheir sodium indices imply bottom-heavy IMFs which are hard to reconcile with\nthe lensing masses. An alternative full-spectrum-fitting approach, applied to\nthe high-\\sigma sample, recovers an IMF less heavy than Salpeter, but\nunder-predicts the Na I 1.14 \\mu m line at the 5{\\sigma} level. We conclude\nthat current models struggle to reproduce this feature in the most massive\ngalaxies without breaking other constraints, and caution against over-reliance\non the sodium lines in spectroscopic IMF studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 20:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

The broadband\nfrequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by LOFAR's\nmultibeaming capabilities, make MSSS the first survey of the sort anticipated\nto be carried out with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Two of the\nsixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlap\nthe frequency coverage of large-area Very Large Array (VLA) and Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) surveys at 74 MHz and 151 MHz respectively. The survey\nperformance is illustrated within the \"MSSS Verification Field\" (MVF), a region\nof 100 square degrees centered at J2000 (RA,Dec)=(15h,69deg).

Using a\ntorus-obscuration model, we demonstrate that in addition to negative bias, due\nto absorption in the torus, in finding obscured AGN in hard X-ray flux limited\nsurveys, there is also positive bias in finding unobscured AGN, due to Compton\nreflection in the torus. These biases can be even stronger taking into account\nplausible intrinsic collimation of hard X-ray emission along the axis of the\nobscuring torus. Given the AGN luminosity function, which steepens at high\nluminosities, these observational biases lead to a decreasing observed fraction\nof obscured AGN with increasing luminosity even if this fraction has no\nintrinsic luminosity dependence. We find that if the central hard X-ray source\nin AGN is isotropic, the intrinsic (i.e. corrected for biases) obscured AGN\nfraction still shows a declining trend with luminosity, although the intrinsic\nobscured fraction is significantly larger than the observed one: the actual\nfraction is larger than $\\sim 85$% at $L\\lesssim 10^{42.5}$ erg/s (17--60 keV),\nand decreases to $\\lesssim 60$% at $L\\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg/s.

For a general central orbit problem the\nhodograph is the inverse of the pedal curve of the orbit, (i.e. its polar\nreciprocal), rotated through a right angle. Hamilton showed that for the\nKepler/Coulomb problem, the hodograph is a circle whose centre is in the\ndirection of a conserved eccentricity vector. The addition of an inverse cube\nlaw force induces the eccentricity vector to precess and with it the hodograph.\nThe same effect is produced by a cosmic string. If one takes the relativistic\nmomentum to define the hodograph, then for the Sommerfeld (i.e. the special\nrelativistic Kepler/Coulomb problem) there is an effective inverse cube force\nwhich causes the hodograph to precess. If one uses Schwarzschild coordinates\none may also define a a hodograph for timelike or null geodesics moving around\na black hole. Iheir pedal equations are given. In special cases the hodograph\nmay be found explicitly. For example the orbit of a photon which starts from\nthe past singularity, grazes the horizon and returns to future singularity is a\ncardioid, its pedal equation is Cayley's sextic the inverse of which is\nTschirhausen's cubic. It is also shown that that provided one uses Beltrami\ncoordinates, the hodograph for the non-relativistic Kepler problem on\nhyperbolic space is also a circle. An analogous result holds for the the round\n3-sphere. In an appendix the hodograph of a particle freely moving on a group\nmanifold equipped with a left-invariant metric is defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 21:46:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 10:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

First, the opinionated documents constitute an\nevolving stream, where both the author's attitude and the vocabulary itself may\nchange. Second, labels of documents are scarce and labels of words are\nunreliable, because the sentiment of a word depends on the (unknown) context in\nthe author's mind. Most of the research on mining over opinionated streams\nfocuses on the first aspect of the problem, whereas for the second a continuous\nsupply of labels from the stream is assumed. Such an assumption though is\nutopian as the stream is infinite and the labeling cost is prohibitive. To this\nend, we investigate the potential of active stream learning algorithms that ask\nfor labels on demand. Our proposed ACOSTREAM 1 approach works with limited\nlabels: it uses an initial seed of labeled documents, occasionally requests\nadditional labels for documents from the human expert and incrementally adapts\nto the underlying stream while exploiting the available labeled documents. In\nits core, ACOSTREAM consists of a MNB classifier coupled with \"sampling\"\nstrategies for requesting class labels for new unlabeled documents. In the\nexperiments, we evaluate the classifier performance over time by varying: (a)\nthe class distribution of the opinionated stream, while assuming that the set\nof the words in the vocabulary is fixed but their polarities may change with\nthe class distribution; and (b) the number of unknown words arriving at each\nmoment, while the class polarity may also change. Our results show that active\nlearning on a stream of opinionated documents, delivers good performance while\nrequiring a small selection of labels\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 22:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-07"}

First, evanescent field\ncouplers were developed by fixing tapered microfibers in mechanically robust\nplatforms. The tapers were obtained by chemical etching techniques. Using these\nplatforms, WGMs modal numbers, coupling regimes and quality factors were\ndetermined for various spheres and compared with theory. Second, the\nspectroscopic properties of photonic molecules formed by spheres with better\nthan 0.05% uniformity of WGM resonances were studied. It was shown that various\nspatial configurations of coupled-cavities present relatively stable mode\nsplitting patterns in the fiber transmission spectra which can be used as\nspectral signatures to distinguish such photonic molecules. The third part is\nthe study of giant resonant propulsion forces exerted on microspheres. This\neffect was observed in suspensions of polystyrene spheres with sufficiently\nlarge diameters. By integrating optical tweezers for individual sphere\nmanipulation, the wavelength detuning between a tunable laser and WGMs in each\nof the spheres was precisely controlled. Resonant enhancement of optical forces\nwas directly demonstrated in experiments. The spectral shape, position and\nmagnitude of the observed propulsion force peaks were explained by efficient\ntransfer of light momentum to microspheres under resonant conditions. The peak\nmagnitude of the resonant force is shown to approach total absorption limit\nimposed by the conservation of momentum. The transverse movement of the spheres\nduring the propulsion process was studied and the existence of a stable radial\ntrap was demonstrated. Giant resonant propulsion forces can be used for\nlarge-scale sorting of microspheres with ultrahigh uniform resonant properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 23:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-07"}

Our sample comprises\n40 clusters identified as being dynamically relaxed and hot (i.e., massive) in\nPapers I and II of this series. Here we consider the thermodynamics of the\nintracluster medium, in particular the profiles of density, temperature and\nrelated quantities, as well as integrated measurements of gas mass, average\ntemperature, total luminosity and center-excluded luminosity. We fit power-law\nscaling relations of each of these quantities as a function of redshift and\ncluster mass, which can be measured precisely and with minimal bias for these\nrelaxed clusters using hydrostatic arguments. For the thermodynamic profiles,\nwe jointly model the density and temperature and their intrinsic scatter as a\nfunction of radius, thus also capturing the behavior of the gas pressure and\nentropy. For the integrated quantities, we also jointly fit a multidimensional\nintrinsic covariance. Our results reinforce the view that simple hydrodynamical\nmodels provide a good description of relaxed clusters outside their centers,\nbut that additional heating and cooling processes are important in the inner\nregions (radii $r < 0.5r_{2500} \\approx 0.15r_{500}$). The thermodynamic\nprofiles remain regular, with small intrinsic scatter, down to the smallest\nradii where deprojection is straightforward ($\\sim 20$ kpc); within this\nradius, even the most relaxed systems show clear departures from spherical\nsymmetry. Our results suggest that heating and cooling are continuously\nregulated in a tight feedback loop, allowing the cluster atmosphere to remain\nstratified on these scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 01:44:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 21:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

The\ndynamics of the distribution of the phenotype are generated by combining\ndistributions of each of its components.

Then, hydrogen escapes easily\ninto space through hydrodynamic escape driven by strong extreme ultraviolet\nradiation from the young Sun. The focus is on the intense impact bombardment\nduring the terminal stage of planetary accretion as generators of a significant\namount of reducing agent.

For a choice of parameters\nrespecting current constraints from radio to gamma-rays, and assuming a proton\nspectral index of -2, we find that hadronic interactions in clusters contribute\nby less than 10% to the IceCube flux, and much less to the total extragalactic\ngamma-ray background observed by Fermi. They account for less than 1% for\nspectral indexes <-2. The high-energy neutrino flux observed by IceCube can be\nreproduced without violating radio constraints only if a very hard (and\nspeculative) spectral index >-2 is adopted. However, this scenario is in\ntension with the high-energy IceCube data, which seem to suggest a spectral\nenergy distribution of the neutrino flux that decreases with the particle\nenergy. We stress that our results are valid for all kind of sources injecting\nCR protons into the ICM, and that, while IceCube can test the most optimistic\nscenarios for spectral indexes >=-2.2 by stacking few nearby massive objects,\nclusters of galaxies cannot give any relevant contribution to the extragalactic\ngamma-ray and neutrino backgrounds in any realistic scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 08:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-07"}

In contrast to general multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)\ncellular schemes, multibeam satellite architectures suffer from different\nchallenges. First, satellite communications standards embed more than one user\nin each frame in order to increase the channel coding gain. This leads to the\ndifferent so-called multigroup multicast model, whose optimization requires\ncomputationally complex operations. Second, when the data traffic is generated\nby several Earth stations (gateways), the precoding matrix must be\ndistributively computed and attain additional payload restrictions. Third,\nsince the feedback channel is adverse (large delay and quantization errors),\nthe precoding must be able to deal with such uncertainties. In order to solve\nthe aforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage precoding design in order\nto both limit the multibeam interference and to enhance the intra-beam minimum\nuser signal power (i.e. the one that dictates the rate allocation per beam). A\nrobust version of the proposed precoder based on a first perturbation model is\npresented. This mechanism behaves well when the channel state information is\ncorrupted. Furthermore, we propose a per beam user grouping mechanism together\nwith its robust version in order to increase the precoding gain. Finally, a\nmethod for dealing with the multiple gateway architecture is presented, which\noffers high throughputs with a low inter-gateway communication. The conceived\ndesigns are evaluated in a close-to-real beam pattern and the latest broadband\ncommunication standard for satellite communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 09:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

An ensemble of\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers held in a diamond plate is pumped by a 532 nm\nlaser. Its photoluminescence is imaged through an optical microscope and\nmonitored by a digital camera. The microwave signal is converted to an\noscillating magnetic field in the area of the NV centers by a loop shaped\nantenna. Induced magnetic resonances are detected through a decrease of the NV\ncenters photoluminescence. A magnetic field gradient induces a Zeeman shift of\nthe resonances and transforms the frequency information into spatial\ninformation, which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the microwave signal\nin the entire frequency bandwidth of the device. The time dependent spectral\nanalysis of an amplitude modulated microwave signal is demonstrated over a\nbandwidth of 600 MHz, associated to a frequency resolution of 7 MHz and a\nrefresh rate of 4 ms. With such integration time, a field of a few hundreds of\n{\\mu}W can be detected. Since the optical properties of NV centers can be\nmaintained even in high magnetic field, we estimate that an optimized device\ncould allow frequency analysis in a range of 30 GHz, only limited by the\namplitude of the magnetic field gradient. In addition, an increase of the NV\ncenters quantity could lead both to an increase of the microwave sensitivity\nand to a decrease of the minimum refresh rate down to a few {\\mu}s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 10:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between the\ndiffusion regimes of GBPs and the associated longitudinal magnetic field\nstrengths. Two high resolution observations of different magnetized\nenvironments were acquired with the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope. Each\nobservation was recorded simultaneously with G-band filtergrams and Narrow-band\nFilter Imager (NFI) Stokes I and V images. GBPs are identified and tracked\nautomatically, and then categorized into several groups by their longitudinal\nmagnetic field strengths, which are extracted from the calibrated NFI\nmagnetograms using a point-by-point method. The Lagrangian approach and the\ndistribution of diffusion indices approach are adopted separately to explore\nthe diffusion regime of GBPs for each group. It is found that the values of\ndiffusion index and diffusion coefficient both decrease exponentially with the\nincreasing longitudinal magnetic field strengths whichever approach is used.\nThe empirical formulas deduced from the fitting equations are proposed to\ndescribe these relations. Stronger elements tend to diffuse more slowly than\nweak elements, independently of the magnetic flux of the surrounding medium.\nThis may be because the magnetic energy of stronger elements is not negligible\ncompared with the kinetic energy of the gas, and therefore the flows cannot\nperturb them so easily.Yang\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 12:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

Our current inability to\nanticipate recruitment failures has led to costly management actions and in\nsome cases complete fishery collapse. Time series observations of fish\nrecruitment reflect an interplay of underlying population processes,\nenvironmental forcing, measurement error, and process error. Given that the\nerror component is often very strong, an important unresolved question is\nwhether any non-random signal can be uncovered in the annual fluctuations of\nrecruitment time series. Here, we address this fundamental question in an\nanalysis of 569 fish populations from a global database of recruitment. Using a\nnonparametric time series analysis method, we find overwhelming evidence for\nnon-random dynamics operating in the recruitment process. Unlike previous\nexplorations of this topic, our approach does not require the specification of\na stock-recruitment model, and it can be used on recruitment estimates derived\nfrom a wide-range of abundance estimation methods. The evidence for\nnon-randomness is robust across a wide range of fish families and abundance\nestimation methods. We also find that the statistical support for\nnon-randomness increases consistently with the number of observations of a fish\nstock. This result provides the encouraging news that with continued\nobservations, and the appropriate covariates, we should ultimately be able to\nuncover the mechanistic drivers of fish recruitment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 13:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-07"}

We derive a generic dispersion\nrelation governing linear sausage waves in pressure-less straight tubes, for\nwhich the transverse density inhomogeneity takes place in a layer of arbitrary\nwidth $l$ and is of arbitrary form. We find that $P$ and $\\tau$ depend on the\ncombination of $[R/v_{\\rm Ai}, L/R, l/R, \\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e}]$, where $R$\nis the loop radius, $L$ is the looplength, $v_{\\rm Ai}$ is the internal\nAlfv\\'en speed, and $\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e}$ is the density contrast.

Research priorities are now moving from planet detection to planet\ncharacterization. In this context, transiting exoplanets are of special\ninterest due to the wealth of data made available by their orbital\nconfiguration. Here, I introduce two methods to gain new insights into the\natmospheric and interior properties of exoplanets.\n  The first method aims to map an exoplanet's atmosphere based on the scanning\nobtained while it is occulted by its host star. I introduce the basics of\neclipse mapping, its caveats, and a framework to mitigate their effects via\nglobal analyses including transits, phase curves, and radial velocity\nmeasurements. I use this method to create the first 2D map and the first cloud\nmap of an exoplanet for the hot-Jupiters HD189733b and Kepler-7b, respectively.\nUltimately temperature, composition, and circulation patterns could be\nconstrained in 3D, a significant asset for informing atmospheric models.\n  The second method, MassSpec, aims to determine transiting planet masses and\natmospheric properties solely from transmission spectra. Determination of an\nexoplanet's mass is key to understanding its basic properties, including its\npotential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are\nmainly based on radial velocity measurements, which are not suited for planets\nwith low masses, large semi-major axes, or those orbiting faint or active\nstars. I demonstrate that a planet's mass has to be accounted for by\natmospheric retrieval methods to avoid biases and that JWST could determine the\nmass and atmospheric properties of half a dozen Earth-sized planets in their\nhost's habitable zones over its lifetime, which could lead to the first\nidentification of a habitable exoplanet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 15:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-07"}

In the last years, several extensions have\nbeen built at the Tunka site, e.g., a scintillator array named Tunka-Grande, a\nsophisticated air-Cherenkov-detector prototype named HiSCORE, and the radio\nextension Tunka-Rex.

The dynamics of belief systems has been studied mainly from\ntwo distinct perspectives, namely how cognitive biases lead to individual\nbelief rigidity and how social influence leads to social conformity. Here we\npropose a unifying framework that connects cognitive and social forces together\nin order to study the dynamics of societal belief evolution. Each individual is\nendowed with a network of interacting beliefs that evolves through interaction\nwith other individuals in a social network. The adoption of beliefs is affected\nby both internal coherence and social conformity. Our framework explains how\nsocial instabilities can arise in otherwise homogeneous populations, how small\nnumbers of zealots with highly coherent beliefs can overturn societal\nconsensus, and how belief rigidity protects fringe groups and cults against\ninvasion from mainstream beliefs, allowing them to persist and even thrive in\nlarger societies. Our results suggest that strong consensus may be insufficient\nto guarantee social stability, that the cognitive coherence of belief-systems\nis vital in determining their ability to spread, and that coherent\nbelief-systems may pose a serious problem for resolving social polarization,\ndue to their ability to prevent consensus even under high levels of social\nexposure. We therefore argue that the inclusion of cognitive factors into a\nsocial model is crucial in providing a more complete picture of collective\nhuman dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 15:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 21:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}
