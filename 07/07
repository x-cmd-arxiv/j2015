The latter\nhas the structure of the square of the superfield magnitude square. A vacuum\ncondensate of the latter is illustrated to develop giving rise to supersymmetry\nbreaking with a soft mass term for the superfield. We report also the effective\ntheory picture with a real superfield composite, illustrating the matching\neffective potential analysis and the vacuum solution conditions for the\ncomponents. The nature of its fermionic part as the Goldstone mode is\npresented.

The priority rule is set by applying green colours\nfor given stages and yellow colours for antagonistic ones, in such a way that\nthe stages with green colour have priority over the ones with yellow colour.\nThe idea of introducing this time window is to reduce the red time inside the\ncycle, and by that, increase the capacity of the network junctions.

The inferred power at small\nscales tends to be larger if (i)~the cluster is at lower redshift, and/or\n(ii)~there are deeper observations and hence more lensed images. In contrast,\nlens reconstructions assuming LTM show higher power at small scales even with\nfewer lensed images; it appears the small scale power in the LTM\nreconstructions is dominated by light information, rather than the lensing\ndata. The average lensing derived $P_{\\rm M}(k)$ shows lower power at small\nscales as compared to that of simulated clusters at redshift zero, both\ndark-matter only and hydrodynamical. The possible reasons are: (i)~the\navailable strong lensing data are limited in their effective spatial resolution\non the mass distribution, (ii)~HFF clusters have yet to build the small scale\npower they would have at $z\\sim 0$, or (iii)~simulations are somehow\noverestimating the small scale power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 16:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 16:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Under the\npotential outcomes framework, we can define causal effects as comparisons\nbetween the potential outcomes under treatment and control. However,\nunfortunately, the average causal effect, often the parameter of interest, is\ndifficult to interpret for ordinal outcomes. To address this challenge, we\npropose to use two causal parameters, which are defined as the probabilities\nthat the treatment is beneficial and strictly beneficial for the experimental\nunits. However, although well-defined for any outcomes and of particular\ninterest for ordinal outcomes, the two aforementioned parameters depend on the\nassociation between the potential outcomes, and are therefore not identifiable\nfrom the observed data without additional assumptions. Echoing recent advances\nin the econometrics and biostatistics literature, we present the sharp bounds\nof the aforementioned causal parameters for ordinal outcomes, under fixed\nmarginal distributions of the potential outcomes. Because the causal estimands\nand their corresponding sharp bounds are based on the potential outcomes\nthemselves, the proposed framework can be flexibly incorporated into any chosen\nmodels of the potential outcomes, and are directly applicable to randomized\nexperiments, unconfounded observational studies, and randomized experiments\nwith noncompliance.

Agents\nusing automatic processing act quickly and so are more likely to acquire\nresources, but agents using controlled processing are better planners and so\nmake more effective use of the resources they have. Using the replicator\nequation, we characterize the conditions under which automatic or controlled\nagents dominate, when coexistence is possible, and when bistability occurs. We\nthen extend the replicator equation to consider feedback between the state of\nthe population and the environment. Under conditions where having a greater\nproportion of controlled agents either enriches the environment or enhances the\ncompetitive advantage of automatic agents, we find that limit cycles can occur,\nleading to persistent oscillations in the population dynamics.

Two\nspecific choices for the MDM multiplet are studied: a fermionic $SU(2)_L$\nquintuplet and a scalar $SU(2)_L$ septuplet. The lightest right-handed\nneutrino, with tiny Yukawa couplings, never reaches thermal equilibrium in the\nearly universe and is produced by freeze-in.

Now we turn to closed\nstrings, which should be the duals of glueballs. We look at the rotating folded\nclosed string in both flat and curved backgrounds.\n  A basic prediction of the closed string model is that the slope of Regge\ntrajectories is half that of open strings. We propose that a simple method to\nidentify glueballs is to look for resonances that belong to trajectories with a\nslope of approximately 0.45 GeV^-2, half the meson slope. We therefore look at\nthe experimental spectra of flavorless light mesons to see if such a scheme,\nwhere some of the states are placed on open string trajectories and some on\nclosed ones, can fit known experimental data. We look at the f_0 (J^PC = 0^++)\nand f_2 (2^++) resonances. As there is no preference for a single scheme of\nsorting the different states into meson and glueball trajectories, we present\nseveral possibilities, each identifying a different state as the glueball. We\nsupplement each scheme with predictions for the masses of excited glueballs.\n  We show that the width of the decay into two mesons is different for\nglueballs and mesons thus providing a supplementary tool to distinguish between\nthem. In addition, we look at some lattice QCD results for glueball spectra and\ncheck their compatibility with the closed string model.\n  One of the main conclusions of this paper is that an extension of\nexperimental data on the spectrum of flavorless hadrons is needed, in\nparticular in the region between around 2.4 GeV and 3 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 20:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 21:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 20:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

We report on new photometric\ntransit observations of WASP-14 b obtained within the framework of \"Transit\nTiming Variations @ Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative\" (TTV@YETI). We\ncollected 19 light-curves of 13 individual transit events using six telescopes\nlocated in five observatories distributed in Europe and Asia. From light curve\nmodelling, we determined the planetary, stellar, and geometrical properties of\nthe system and found them in agreement with the values from the discovery\npaper. A test of the robustness of the transit times revealed that in case of a\nnon-reproducible transit shape the uncertainties may be underestimated even\nwith a wavelet-based error estimation methods. For the timing analysis we\nincluded two publicly available transit times from 2007 and 2009. The long\nobservation period of seven years (2007-2013) allowed us to refine the transit\nephemeris. We derived an orbital period 1.2 s longer and 10 times more precise\nthan the one given in the discovery paper. We found no significant periodic\nsignal in the timing-residuals and, hence, no evidence for TTV in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 20:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

The basic idea behind detecting outlier patterns is\ncomparison of their relative frequencies with frequent patterns. Their\nfrequencies of appearance are less and thus have lesser support in the data.\nDetecting outlier patterns is an important data mining task which will reveal\nsome interesting facts. The search for periodicity of patterns gives the\nbehavior of these patterns across time as to when they repeat likely. This in\nturn helps in prediction of events. These patterns are found in Time\nseries-data, social networks etc. In this paper, an algorithm for periodic\noutlier pattern detection is proposed with the usage of a Constraint Based FP\n(Frequent Pattern)-tree as the underlying data structure for time series data.\nThe growth of the tree is limited by using level and monotonic constraints. The\nprotein sequence of bacteria named E.Coli is collected and periodic outlier\npatterns in the sequence are identified. Further the enhancement of results is\nobtained by finding the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) in defining candidate\noutlier patterns. The comparative results between STNR-out (Suffix Tree Noise\nResilient for Outlier Detection) and proposed algorithm are illustrated. The\nresults show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 06:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

While most previous statistical debugging methods generalize over\nmany executions of a single program, TFLMs are trained on a corpus of\npreviously seen buggy programs, and learn to identify recurring patterns of\nbugs. Widely-used fault localization techniques such as TARANTULA evaluate the\nsuspiciousness of each line in isolation; in contrast, a TFLM defines a joint\nprobability distribution over buggy indicator variables for each line. Joint\ndistributions with rich dependency structure are often computationally\nintractable; TFLMs avoid this by exploiting recent developments in tractable\nprobabilistic models (specifically, Relational SPNs).

To compensate for the severe path loss in mmWave systems,\nlarge antenna arrays are generally used to achieve significant beamforming\ngains. However, due to the high hardware and power consumption cost associated\nwith radio frequency (RF) chains, it is desirable to achieve the large-antenna\ngains, but with only limited number of RF chains for mmWave communications. To\nthis end, we study in this paper a new lens antenna array enabled mmWave MIMO\ncommunication system. We first show that the array response of the proposed\nlens antenna array at the receiver/transmitter follows a \"sinc\" function, where\nthe antenna with the peak response is determined by the angle of arrival\n(AoA)/departure (AoD) of the received/transmitted signal. By exploiting this\nunique property of lens antenna arrays along with the multi-path sparsity of\nmmWave channels, we propose a novel low-cost and capacity-achieving MIMO\ntransmission scheme, termed \\emph{orthogonal path division multiplexing\n(OPDM)}. For channels with insufficiently separated AoAs and/or AoDs, we also\npropose a simple \\emph{path grouping} technique with group-based small-scale\nMIMO processing to mitigate the inter-path interference. Numerical results are\nprovided to compare the performance of the proposed lens antenna arrays for\nmmWave MIMO system against that of conventional arrays, under different\npractical setups. It is shown that the proposed system achieves significant\nthroughput gain as well as complexity and hardware cost reduction, both making\nit an appealing new paradigm for mmWave MIMO communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 08:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

The workshop recognized that\nreliance on scientific software is pervasive in all areas of world-leading\nresearch today. The workshop participants then proceeded to explore different\nperspectives on the concept of sustainability. Key enablers and barriers of\nsustainable scientific software were identified from their experiences. In\naddition, recommendations with new requirements such as software credit files\nand software prize frameworks were outlined for improving practices in\nsustainable software engineering. There was also broad consensus that formal\ntraining in software development or engineering was rare among the\npractitioners. Significant strides need to be made in building a sense of\ncommunity via training in software and technical practices, on increasing their\nsize and scope, and on better integrating them directly into graduate education\nprograms.

We find that a porosity\ngradient has a much larger effect on the uniformity of adsorption than it does\non the total adsorption. This allows us to understand how a decreasing porosity\ncan lead to a greater filter efficiency, by lowering the risk of localized\nblocking while maintaining the rate of total contaminant removal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 09:28:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 14:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

There is no evidence for a faint end slope steep enough to correspond\nwith galaxy formation models, unless those models invoke either strong feedback\nprocesses or use warm dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 09:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

We adapt this proof to the more general setting of VCSP to show that each\nVCSP with a fixed finite (valued) constraint language is equivalent to one\nwhere the constraint language consists of one $\\{0,\\infty\\}$-valued binary\nfunction (i.e. a digraph) and one finite-valued unary function, the latter\nproblem known as the (extended) Minimum Cost Homomorphism Problem for digraphs.\nWe also show that our reduction preserves some important algebraic properties\nof the (valued) constraint language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 12:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

The accretion flow on the lower $\\Sigma$ branch of the N-shape\nis optically thick, advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) while that on the\nupper one is neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). The middle branch has a\nnegative slope on the $\\Sigma$-$\\dot{M}$ plane, meaning that the flow on this\nbranch is secularly unstable. To investigate how the instability affects the\nflow structure and what observable signatures are produced, we study the time\nevolution of the unstable hyperaccretion flow in response to variable mass\ninjection rates by solving the height-averaged equations for viscous accretion\nflows. When a transition occurs from the lower branch to the upper branch (or\nfrom the upper branch to the lower branch), the surface density rapidly\nincreases (decreases) around that transition region, which induces locally\nenhanced mass flow (referred to as non-steady mass flow) into (out of) that\nregion. We confirm that the non-steady flow can create a kind of disturbance\nand that it propagates over the whole disk. However, the non-steady mass flow\nis not strong enough to induce coherent transition over the whole disk, unless\nthe mass injection rate varies with time. When the injection rate continuously\nchanges, the neutrino luminosity varies intermittently, thus producing\nstep-function-like light curves, as the radiation efficiency discontinuously\nchanges every time the local transition occurs.

In this paper, we describe the \"strata multilayer stochastic block\nmodel'' (sMLSBM), a probabilistic model for multilayer community structure. The\ncentral extension of the model is that there exist groups of layers, called\n\"strata'', which are defined such that all layers in a given stratum have\ncommunity structure described by a common stochastic block model (SBM). That\nis, layers in a stratum exhibit similar node-to-community assignments and SBM\nprobability parameters. Fitting the sMLSBM to a multilayer network provides a\njoint clustering that yields node-to-community and layer-to-stratum\nassignments, which cooperatively aid one another during inference.

We present trajectories for\nthe growth of $q$ during circumbinary disc accretion and argue that the period\ndistribution of stellar \"twin\" binaries is strong evidence for the importance\nof circumbinary accretion. We also show that our parametrisation of binary\naccretion increases the minimum mass ratio needed for spin alignment of\nsupermassive black holes to $q \\sim 0.4$, with potentially important\nimplications for the magnitude of velocity kicks acquired during black hole\nmergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 15:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Emerging molecular outflows can be used to determine\nthe influence of fragmentation and multiplicity on protostellar evolution\nthrough the correlation of outflow forces of intermediate mass protostars with\nthe luminosity. The aim of this paper is to derive outflow forces from outflows\nof six intermediate mass protostellar regions and validate the apparent\ncorrelation between total luminosity and outflow force seen in earlier work, as\nwell as remove uncertainties caused by different methodology. By comparing CO\n6--5 observations obtained with APEX with non-LTE radiative transfer model\npredictions, optical depths, temperatures, densities of the gas of the\nmolecular outflows are derived. Outflow forces, dynamical timescales and\nkinetic luminosities are subsequently calculated. Outflow parameters, including\nthe forces, were derived for all sources.

The role of fragmentation on outflows is an important ingredient to\nunderstand clustered star formation and the link between low and high-mass star\nformation.

To find and characterise these\ncompanions and determine their orbits is thus an important consideration to\nunderstand planet formation and evolution. For transiting systems even unbound\nfield stars are of interest if they are within the photometric aperture of the\nlight curve measurement. Then they contribute a constant flux offset to the\ntransit light curve and bias the derivation of the stellar and planetary\nparameters if their existence is unknown. Close stellar sources are, however,\neasily overlooked by common planet surveys due to their limited spatial\nresolution. We therefore performed high angular resolution imaging of 49\ntransiting exoplanet hosts to identify unresolved binaries, characterize their\nspectral type, and determine their separation. The observations were carried\nout with the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope using the Lucky Imaging camera AstraLux\nNorte. All targets were imaged in i' and z' passbands.
