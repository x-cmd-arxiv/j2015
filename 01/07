The data encompasses 5 independent survey\nfields co-spatial with spectroscopic LBG data and covering a larger total area\nthan previously analysed for LAE number counts and clustering. This affords an\nimproved analysis over previous work by minimising the effects of cosmic\nvariance and allowing the cross-clustering analysis of LAEs and LBGs. Our\nphotometric sample consists of $\\approx600$ LAE candidates, over an area of\n1.07~deg$^2$, with equivalent widths of $\\gtrsim65$~\\AA\\ and a flux limit of\n$\\approx2\\times10^{-17}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. From spectroscopic follow-up,\nwe measured a success rate of $78\\pm18\\%$. We find the $R$-band continuum\nluminosity function to be $\\sim10\\times$ lower than the luminosity function of\nLBGs at this redshift, consistent with previous studies. Exploiting the large\narea of the survey, we estimate the LAE auto-correlation function and find a\nclustering length of $r_0=2.86\\pm0.33~h^{-1}$~Mpc, low compared to the $z\\sim3$\nLBG population, but somewhat higher than previous LAE measurements. This\ncorresponds to a median halo mass of $M_{\\rm\nDM}=10^{11.0\\pm0.3}~h^{-1}~$M$_{\\odot}$. We present an analysis of clustering\nlength versus continuum magnitude and find that the measurements for LAEs and\nLBGs are consistent at faint magnitudes. Our combined dataset of LAEs and LBGs\nallows us to measure, for the first time, the LBG-LAE cross-correlation,\nfinding a clustering length of $r_0=3.29\\pm0.57~h^{-1}$~Mpc and a LAE halo mass\nof $10^{11.1\\pm0.4}~h^{-1}$~M$_{\\odot}$.

We formulate a relaxation of the Fisherian sharp null hypothesis\nof constant effect that accommodates the scale-free nature of ordinal\nnon-numeric data. We develop a Bayesian procedure to estimate the proposed\ncausal estimands that leverages the rank likelihood. We illustrate these\nmethods with an application to educational outcomes in the General Social\nSurvey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 16:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

The orbital ($\\sim0.70\\,\\mu_B$)\nand spin ($\\sim-0.30\\,\\mu_B$) moments of U at 2.1K and 17T (H//c) have been\ndetermined. Their ratio ($\\sim-2.3$) suggests a significant delocalization of\nthe 5$f$ electron states. The similar field dependences of the local U/Co and\nthe macroscopic magnetization indicate that the Co moment is induced by the U\nmoment. The XMCD at the Co/Ge-K edges reveal the presence of small Co-4$p$ and\nGe-4$p$ orbital moments parallel to the macroscopic magnetization. In addition,\nthe Co-3$d$ moment is estimated to be at most of the order of 0.1$\\mu_B$ at\n17T. Our results rule out the possibility of an unusual polarisability of the U\nand Co moments as well as their antiparallel coupling.

Using the time\nseries of temporal topic distributions learned by LDTM, we conduct Granger\ncausality tests to measure the social correlation relationships between pairs\nof users. We call the combination of our LDTM and Granger causality tests as\nTemporal Social Correlation. By conducting extensive experiments on\nbibliographic data, where authors are analogous to users, we show that the\nordering of authors' name on their publications plays a statistically\nsignificant role in the interaction of research topics among the authors. We\nalso present a case study to illustrate the correlational relationships between\npairs of authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 19:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

We\nmeasure radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray fluxes in three regions along the\njet determined by the infrared and X-ray morphology. Radio through X-ray\nspectra in these regions demonstrate that the emission can be interpreted as\nsynchrotron emission from a broken power-law distribution of electron energies.\nWe find significant differences in the high energy spectra with increasing\ndistance from the nucleus. Specifically, the high energy slope increases from\n0.86 to 1.72 from 1 kpc to 12 kpc along the jet, and the spectral break\nlikewise increases in frequency along the jet from 10-100's of GHz to ~20 THz.\nThus the ratio of IR to X-ray flux in the jet increases by at least an order of\nmagnitude with increasing distance from the nucleus.

The effects of mass\nloading, turbulence, and jet deceleration, however these processes modify the\njet flow in detail, must be causing a change in the electron energy\ndistribution and the efficiency of particle acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 19:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

To determine the\npositions and identification of coronal bright points we used a segmentation\nalgorithm. A linear fit of their central meridian distance and latitude versus\ntime was utilised to derive velocities. We obtained 906 velocity measurements\nin a time interval of only 2 days.

Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational\namplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their\nprojected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational\namplitudes of the Kepler KOIs with those of Kepler single stars can provide a\nmeasure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of\nKepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and\n33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with\nhigh significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of\n10%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs\nare systematically lower. After correcting for an observational bias, we\nestimate that the amplitudes of the hot KOIs are smaller than the single stars\nby about the same factor of 10%. The border line between the relatively larger\nand smaller amplitudes, relative to the amplitudes of the single stars, occurs\nat about 6000K.

Over the past decade, much\nprogress has been made in theoretical simulations and observations of HI in\ngalaxies. However, recent HI surveys on both single dish radio telescopes and\ninterferometers, while providing detailed information on global HI properties,\nthe dark matter distribution in galaxies, as well as insight into the\nrelationship between star formation and the interstellar medium, have been\nlimited to the local universe.

With the SKA1 the greatest improvement over our current measurements\nis the capability to image galaxies at reasonable linear resolution and good\ncolumn density sensitivity to much higher redshifts (0.2 < z < 1.7). So one\nwill not only be able to increase the number of detections to study the\nevolution of the HI mass function, but also have the sensitivity and resolution\nto study inflows and outflows to and from galaxies and the kinematics of the\ngas within and around galaxies as a function of environment and cosmic time out\nto previously unexplored depths. The increased sensitivity of SKA2 will allow\nus to image Milky Way-size galaxies out to redshifts of z=1 and will provide\nthe data required for a comprehensive picture of the HI content of galaxies\nback to z~2 when the cosmic star formation rate density was at its peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 20:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

We have explored the\nparameter space of this scenario, computed the gamma ray spectrum for each\nphenomenologically viable solution and then performed a chi^2 fit to the\nexcess.

Furthermore, we have incorporated limits from direct\ndetection experiments, LHC bounds and also the constraints from Fermi-LAT on\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and gamma ray spectral lines. In addition, we\nhave estimated the effect of the most recent Fermi-LAT reprocessed data (Pass\n8). In general, we obtain good fits to the GCE when the RH sneutrino\nannihilates mainly into pairs of light singlet-like scalar or pseudoscalar\nHiggs bosons that subsequently decay in flight, producing four-body final\nstates and spectral features that improve the goodness of the fit at large\nenergies. The best fit (chi^2=20.8) corresponds to a RH sneutrino with a mass\nof 64 GeV which annihilates preferentially into a pair of light singlet-like\npseudoscalar Higgs bosons (with masses of order 60 GeV).

We examine the consistency and reliability of fitting\nthree widely-used stellar evolution models to fifteen combinations of optical\nand near-IR photometry for the old open cluster NGC 188. The optical filter\nresponse curves match those of the theoretical systems and are thus not the\nsource of fit inconsistencies. NGC 188 is ideally suited to the present study\nthanks to a wide variety of high-quality photometry and available proper\nmotions and radial velocities which enable us to remove non-cluster members and\nmany binaries.

We show that the historically-favored\nthree band combinations of UBV and VRI can be meaningfully inconsistent with\neach other and with longer baseline datasets such as UBVRIJHKs.

The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each\nreproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the\nsimulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show\nanalytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that\nreduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are\ngreatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by\ninjecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with\nthe observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling\nrelations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of\nthe reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of\ngalaxies with stellar mass <~ M* (the \"knee\" of the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,\nwhile those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from\naccretion onto their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in\norder to reproduce the observed galaxy population.

This algorithm, denoted\npSART, replaces the monoenergetic forward projection operation used by SART\nwith a post-log, polyenergetic forward projection, while leaving the rest of\nthe algorithm unchanged. While the proposed algorithm provides good results\nempirically, convergence of the algorithm was not established mathematically in\nthe original paper.\n  Methods: We analyze pSART as a nonlinear fixed point iteration by explicitly\ncomputing the Jacobian of the iteration. A necessary condition for convergence\nis that the spectral radius of the Jacobian, evaluated at the fixed point, is\nless than one. A short proof of convergence for SART is also provided as a\nbasis for comparison.\n  Results: We show that the pSART algorithm is not guaranteed to converge, in\ngeneral. The Jacobian of the iteration depends on several factors, including\nthe system matrix and how one models the energy dependence of the linear\nattenuation coefficient. We provide a simple numerical example that shows that\nthe spectral radius of the Jacobian matrix is not guaranteed to be less than\none. A second set of numerical experiments using realistic CT system matrices,\nhowever, indicates that conditions for convergence are likely to be satisfied\nin practice.\n  Conclusion: Although pSART is not mathematically guaranteed to converge, our\nnumerical experiments indicate that it will tend to converge at roughly the\nsame rate as SART for system matrices of the type encountered in CT imaging.\nThus we conclude that the algorithm is still a useful method for reconstruction\nof polyenergetic CT data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 23:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 19:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 21:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

On\none hand, recent patch-wise methods can be represented as a low-rank matrix\napproximation problem whose convex relaxation usually depends on nuclear norm\nminimization (NNM). Here, we extend the NNM to the nonconvex schatten p-norm\nminimization with additional weights assigned to different singular values,\nwhich is referred to as the Weighted Schatten p-Norm Minimization (WSNM). An\nefficient algorithm is also proposed to solve the WSNM problem. The proposed\nWSNM not only gives better approximation to the original low-rank assumption,\nbut also considers physical meanings of different data components. On the other\nhand, due to the naive aggregation schema which integrates all the denoised\npatches into a whole image, current patch-wise denoising methods always produce\nvarious degree of artifacts in denoised results.

Monitoring the\noptical spectra could provide hints towards the origin of these very different\nbehaviours. We analyse a large set of spectroscopic observations of HD45314 and\nHD60848, extending over 20 years. We further attempt to fit the H-alpha line\nprofiles of both stars with a simple model of emission line formation in a\nKeplerian disk. Strong variations in the strengths of the H-alpha, H-beta, and\nHe I 5876 emission lines are observed for both stars. In the case of HD60848,\nwe find a time lag between the variations in the equivalent widths of these\nlines. The emission lines are double peaked with nearly identical strengths of\nthe violet and red peaks. The H-alpha profile of this star can be successfully\nreproduced by our model of a disk seen under an inclination of 30 degrees. In\nthe case of HD45314, the emission lines are highly asymmetric and display\nstrong line profile variations. We find a major change in behaviour between the\n2002 outburst and the one observed in 2013. This concerns both the relationship\nbetween the equivalent widths of the various lines and their morphologies at\nmaximum strength (double-peaked in 2002 versus single-peaked in 2013). Our\nsimple disk model fails to reproduce the observed H-alpha line profiles of\nHD45314. Our results further support the interpretation that Oe stars do have\ndecretion disks similar to those of Be stars. Whilst the emission lines of\nHD60848 are explained by a disk with a Keplerian velocity field, the disk of\nHD45314 seems to have a significantly more complex velocity field that could be\nrelated to the phenomenon that produces its peculiar X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 07:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

In the corresponding effective Maxwell equation these dipoles are\ndescribed by three dimensional delta function potentials. We review the\napproaches handling these: the selfadjoint extension,\nregularization/renormalisation and the zero range potential methods. Their\nclose interrelations are discussed in detail and compared with the\nelectrostatic approach which drops the contributions from the self fields. For\na homogeneous two dimensional lattice of dipoles we write down the complete\nsolutions, which allow, for example, for an easy numerical treatment of the\nscattering of the electromagnetic field on the lattice or for investigating\nplasmons. Using these formulas, we consider the limiting case of vanishing\nlattice spacing. For a scalar field and for the TE polarization of the\nelectromagnetic field this transition is smooth and results in the results\nknown from the continuous sheet. Especially for the TE polarization, we\nreproduce the results known from the hydrodynamic model describing a two\ndimensional electron gas. For the TM polarization, for polarizability parallel\nand perpendicular to the lattice, in both cases, the transition is singular.\nFor the parallel polarizability this is surprising and different from the\nhydrodynamic model. For perpendicular polarizability this is what was known in\nliterature. We also investigate the case when the transition is done with\ndipoles described by smeared delta function, i.e., keeping a regularization.\nHere, for TM polarization for parallel polarizability, when subsequently doing\nthe limit of vanishing lattice spacing, we reproduce the result known from the\nhydrodynamic model. In case of perpendicular polarizability we need an\nadditional renormalization to reproduce the result obtained previously by\nstepping back from the dipole approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 08:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We investigate typical properties of clumps (and smaller cores)\nresulting from this fragmentation process.

The plasma disruption is\ncaused by strong stochastic magnetic field formed due to nonlinearly excited\nlow-mode number magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes. It is hypothesized that the\nrunaway electron beam is formed in the central plasma region confined by an\nintact magnetic surface due to the acceleration of electrons by the inductive\ntoroidal electric field. In the case of plasmas with the safety factor $q(0)<1$\nthe most stable runaway electron beams are formed by the intact magnetic\nsurface located between the magnetic surface $q=1$ and the closest low--order\nrational surface $q=m/n>1$ ($q=5/4$, $q=4/3$, ...). The thermal quench time the\ncurrent quench time are estimated. The runaway electron beam current is modeled\nas a sum of toroidally symmetric part and a small amplitude helical current\nwith a predominant $m/n=1/1$ component. The runaway electrons are lost due to\ntwo effects: ($i$) by outward drift of electrons in a toroidal electric field\nuntil they touch wall and ($ii$) by the formation of stochastic layer of\nrunaway electrons at the beam edge. Such a stochastic layer for high--energy\nrunaway electrons is formed in the presence of the $m/n=1/1$ MHD mode. It has a\nmixed topological structure with a stochastic region open to wall. The effect\nof external resonant magnetic perturbations on runaway electron loss is\ndiscussed. A possible cause of the sudden MHD signals accompanied by runaway\nelectron bursts is explained by the redistribution of runaway current during\nthe resonant interaction of high--energetic electron orbits with the $m/n=1/1$\nMHD mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 09:15:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 15:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

As an initial example of such a study,\nthe recipe in (Green & Wald, 2012) for going between N-body results and a\nperturbed FLRW metric in the Newtonian gauge is used to study light propagation\nthrough quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The study is conducted by deriving a\nset of ODEs giving an expression for the angular diameter distance in the\nNewtonian gauge metric. The accuracy of the results obtained from the ODEs is\nestimated by using the ODEs to determine the distance-redshift relation in mock\nN-body data based on quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The results are then\ncompared to the exact relations. From this comparison it is seen that the\nobtained ODEs can accurately reproduce the distance-redshift relation along\nboth radial and non-radial geodesics in spherically symmetric models. The\nreproduction of geodesics in non-symmetric Szekeres models is slightly less\naccurate, but still good. These results indicate that the employment of\nperturbed FLRW metrics for standard ray tracing techniques yields fairly\naccurate results, at least regarding distance-redshift relations. It is\npossible though, that this conclusion will be rendered invalid if other typical\nray tracing approximations are included and if light is allowed to travel\nthrough several structures instead of just one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 09:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 16:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2015 08:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

AES algorithm has many sources of parallelism. In this paper, a design of\nparallel AES on the multiprocessor platform is presented. While most of the\nprevious designs either use pipelined parallelization or take advantage of the\nMix_Column parallelization, our design is based on combining pipelining of\nrounds and parallelization of Mix_Column and Add_Round_Key transformations.\nThis model is divided into two levels: the first is pipelining different\nrounds, while the second is through parallelization of both the Add_Round_Key\nand the Mix_Column transformations. Previous work proposed for pipelining AES\nalgorithm was based on using nine stages, while, we propose the use of eleven\nstages in order to exploit the sources of parallelism in both initial and final\nround. This enhances the system performance compared to previous designs. Using\ntwo-levels of parallelization benefits from the highly independency of\nAdd_Round_Key and Mix_Column/ Inv_Mix_Colum transformations. The analysis shows\nthat the parallel implementation of the AES achieves a better performance. The\nanalysis shows that using pipeline increases significantly the degree of\nimprovement for both encryption and decryption by approximately 95%. Moreover,\nparallelizing Add_Round_Key and Mix_Column/ Inv_Mix_Column transformations\nincreases the degree of improvement by approximately 98%.

Since\nthe X-ray flux is less attenuated, a high X-ray-to-optical flux ratio (Fx/Fo)\nis expected to be an efficient tool to find out these obscured accreting\nsources. We explore here via optical spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy and\ninfrared photometry the most extreme cases of this population (those with Fx/Fo\n>50, EXO50 sources hereafter), using a well defined sample of seven X-ray\nsources extracted from the 2XMM catalogue. Five EXO50 sources (about 70 percent\nof the sample) in the bright flux regime explored by our survey (f(2-10 keV) >\n1.5E-13 cgs) are associated with obscured AGN (Nh > 1.0E22 cm-2), spanning a\nredshift range between 0.75 and 1 and characterised by 2-10 keV intrinsic\nluminosities in the QSO regime (e.g. well in excess to 1.0E44 cgs).

Overall the EXO50 Type 2 QSOs do\nnot seem to be different from standard X-ray selected Type 2 QSOs in terms of\nnuclear absorption; a very high AGN/host galaxy ratio seems to play a major\nrole in explaining their extreme properties. Interestingly three out of five\nEXO50 Type 2 QSO objects can be classified as Extreme Dust Obscured Galaxies\n(EDOGs), suggesting that a very high AGN/host ratios (along with the large\namount of dust absorption) could be the natural explanation also for a part of\nthe EDOG population. The remaining two EXO50 sources are classified as BL Lac\nobjects, having rather extreme properties, and which are good candidates for\nTeV emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 11:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper we study a\nconceptual model of athermal load-induced unfolding and use a minimalistic\nsetting allowing one to emphasize the role of long-range interactions while\nmaintaining full analytical transparency. Our model can be viewed as a\ndescription of a parallel bundle of N bistable units confined between two\nshared rigid backbones that are loaded through a series spring. We show that\nthe ground states in this model correspond to synchronized, single phase\nconfigurations where all individual units are either folded or unfolded. We\nthen study the fine structure of the wiggly energy landscape along the reaction\ncoordinate linking the two coherent states and describing the optimal mechanism\nof cooperative unfolding. Quite remarkably, our study shows the fundamental\ndifference in the size and structure of the folding-unfolding energy barriers\nin the hard (fixed displacements) and soft (fixed forces) loading devices which\npersists in the continuum limit. We argue that both, the synchronization and\nthe non-equivalence of the mechanical responses in hard and soft devices, have\ntheir origin in the dominance of long-range interactions. We then apply our\nminimal model to skeletal muscles where the power-stroke in acto-myosin\ncrossbridges can be interpreted as passive folding. A quantitative analysis of\nthe muscle model shows that the relative rigidity of myosin backbone provides\nthe long-range interaction mechanism allowing the system to effectively\nsynchronize the power-stroke in individual crossbridges even in the presence of\nthermal fluctuations. In view of the prototypical nature of the proposed model,\nour general conclusions pertain to a variety of other biological systems where\nelastic interactions are mediated by effective backbones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 12:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

To ascertain the existence of power-law distributions of\ninter-spike intervals (ISI) occurring during the progression of status\nepilepticus (SE), so that the emergence of critical states could be reasonably\nhypothesized as being part of the intrinsic nature of the SE. Methods. Status\nepilepticus was induced by pilocarpine administration in post-natal 21-day rats\n(n=8). For each animal, 24 hours of EEG from the onset of the SE were analyzed\naccording to the analytical procedure suggested by Clauset et al. (2009) which\ncombines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on\nthe Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and likelihood ratios. The analytical\nprocedure was implemented by the freely available R software package\n\"poweRlaw\". Time of calculations was considerably shorten by the exploitation\nof High-Throughput Computing technology, a.k.a. Grid Computing technology.\nResults. The progression of the SE is characterized by the emergence of\npower-law correlations of ISI whose likelihood of occurrence increases the more\nthe time from the onset of the SE elapses. Log-normal distribution of ISI is\nhowever widely represented. Additionally, undetermined distributions of ISI are\nrepresented as well, although confined within a restricted temporal window. The\nfinal stage of SE appears dominated only by power-law and log-normal\ndistributions of ISI. Significance. The emergence of power-law correlations of\nISI concretely supports the concept of the occurrence of critical states during\nthe progression of SE. It is reasonably speculated, as a working hypothesis,\nthat the occurrence of power-law distributions of ISI within the early stages\nof the SE could be a hallmark of the establishment of the route to\nepileptogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 13:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

The behavior of the Polyakov\nloop close to the critical temperature is studied in terms of the color fields\ninside the clusters of overlapping strings, which are produced in high energy\nhadronic collisions. The non-Abelian nature of the color fields implies an\nenhancement of the transverse momentum and a suppression of the multiplicities\nrelative to the non overlapping case. The prediction of this framework are\ncompared with experimental results from the SPS, RHIC and LHC for $pp$ and AA\ncollisions.\n  Rapidity distributions, probability distributions of transverse momentum and\nmultiplicities, Bose-Einstein correlations, elliptic flow and ridge structures\nare used to evaluate these comparison. The thermodynamical quantities, the\ntemperature, and energy density derived from RHIC and LHC data and Color String\nPercolation Model (CSPM) are used to obtain the shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio ($\\eta/s$). It was observed that the inverse of ($\\eta/s$)\nrepresents the trace anomaly $\\Delta =(\\varepsilon-3P)/T^{4}$. Thus the\npercolation approach within CSPM can be successfully used to describe the\ninitial stages in high energy heavy ion collisions in the soft region in high\nenergy heavy ion collisions. The thermodynamical quantities, temperature and\nthe equation of state are in agreement with the lattice QCD calculations.

The simulation aims to\ncreate a visually intuitive way of understanding how the series of amplitude\nversus driving frequency graphs are obtained by showing how the displacement of\nthe system changes over time as it transits from the transient to the steady\nstate.\n  A suggested how to use the model is added to help educators and students in\ntheir teaching and learning, where we explained the theoretical steady state\nequation, time conditions when the model starts allowing data recording of\nmaximum amplitudes to closely match the theoretical equation and steps to\ncollect different runs of degree of damping.

The\npH-driven interactions trigger volume phase transitions between the swollen and\ncollapsed states of the gel.For a robust set of material parameters, we find a\nclass of solutions of the governing system that oscillate between such states,\nand cause the membrane to rhythmically swell, allowing for transport of the\ndrug, fuel and reaction products across it, and collapse, hampering all\ntransport across it. The frequency of the oscillations can be adjusted so that\nit matches the natural frequency of the hormone to be released. The work is\nlinked to extensive laboratory experimental studies of the device built by\nSiegel's team. The thinness of the membrane and its clamped boundary, together\nwith the homogeneously held conditions in the experimental apparatus, justify\nneglecting spatial dependence on the fields of the problem.

The\nidentification of the relevant parameter set of the model is aided by a Hopf\nbifurcation study of steady state solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 16:15:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 23:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}
