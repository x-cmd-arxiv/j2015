By combining chemical,\nbiochemical and hydrodynamic evidences, we identify a mechanism, unrelated to\nthe presence of internal gas vesicles, allowing the sudden collective upward\nmigration in test tubes of several cyanobacterial strains (Microcystis\naeruginosa PCC 7005, Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 and Synechocystis sp.

The final state consists in a foamy layer of biomass at the air-liquid\ninterface, in which micro-organisms remain alive for weeks, the medium lying\nbelow being almost completely depleted of cyanobacteria. These \"laboratory\nblooms\" start with the aggregation of cells at high ionic force in\ncyanobacterial strains that produce anionic extracellular polymeric substances\n(EPS). Under appropriate conditions of nutrients and light intensity, the high\nphotosynthetic activity within cell clusters leads the dissolved oxygen (DO) to\nsupersaturate and to nucleate into bubbles. Trapped within the EPS, these\nbubbles grow until their buoyancy pulls the biomass towards the free surface.\nBy investigating a wide range of spatially homogeneous environmental conditions\n(illumination, salinity, cell and nutrient concentration) we identify\nspecies-dependent thresholds and timescales for bloom formation.

The first\ndispersal strategy is driven by the prey-predator interaction strength, and the\nsecond dispersal is prompted by the local population density of predators which\nis referred as the passive dispersal. The dispersal strategies using by\npredator are measured by the proportion of the predator population using the\npassive dispersal strategy which is a parameter ranging from 0 to 1. We focus\non how the dispersal strategies and the related dispersal strengths affect\npopulation dynamics of prey and predator, hence generate different spatial\ndynamical patterns in heterogeneous environment. We provide local and global\ndynamics of the proposed model. Based on our analytical and numerical analysis,\ninteresting findings could be summarized as follow: (1) If there is no prey in\none patch, then the large value of dispersal strength and the large predator\npopulation using the passive dispersal in the other patch could drive predator\nextinct at least locally. However, the intermediate predator population using\nthe passive dispersal could lead to multiple interior equilibria and\npotentially stabilize the dynamics; (2) For symmetric patches (i.e., all the\nlife history parameters are the same except the dispersal strengths), the large\npredator population using the passive dispersal can generate multiple interior\nattractors; (3) The dispersal strategies can stabilize the system, or\ndestabilize the system through generating multiple interior equilibria that\nlead to multiple attractors; and (4) The large predator population using the\npassive dispersal could lead to no interior equilibrium but both prey and\npredator can coexist through fluctuating dynamics for almost all initial\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 18:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 07:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

First\na Siamese convolutional network is trained with deep supervision on a labeled\ntraining dataset. This network projects texts into a similarity manifold. The\nDeeply Supervised Siamese network learns visual similarity of texts. Then a\nK-nearest neighbor classifier is used to predict unlabeled text based on\nsimilarity distance to labeled texts. The performance of the model is evaluated\non three datasets of machine-print and hand-written text combined. We\ndemonstrate that the model reduces the cost of human estimation by $50\\%-85\\%$.\nThe error of the system is less than $0.5\\%$. The proposed model outperform\nconventional Siamese network by finding visually-similar barely-readable and\nreadable text, e.g. machine-printed, handwritten, due to deep supervision. The\nresults also demonstrate that the predicted labels are sometimes better than\nhuman labels e.g. spelling correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 18:46:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 20:59:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 00:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 16:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 01:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

The general scope of the work\nis the symbolic associations of object-word mappings as it happens in language\ndevelopment in infants. In other words, two different representations of the\nsame abstract concepts can associate in both directions. This scenario has been\nlong interested in Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, and Neuroscience. In\nthis work, we extend a recent approach for multimodal sequences (visual and\naudio) to also cope with missing elements in one or both modalities. Our method\nuses two parallel Long Short-Term Memories (LSTMs) with a learning rule based\non EM-algorithm. It aligns both LSTM outputs via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).

The\ninteraction is modeled with a QED-PIC code and the results are compared with\nthose obtained with a standard PIC code with the addition of a classical\nradiation reaction module and with theoretical predictions. While classical\nradiation reaction is a continuous process, in QED, radiation emission is\nstochastic. The two pictures reconcile in the limit when the emitted photons\nenergy is small compared to the energy of the emitting electrons. The energy\nspread of the electron distribution function always tends to decrease with\nclassical radiation reaction, whereas the stochastic QED emission can also\nenlarge it. These two tendencies compete in the QED-dominated regime. Our\nanalysis, supported by the QED module, reveals an upper limit to the maximal\nattainable energy spread due to stochasticity that depends on laser intensity\nand the electron beam average energy. Beyond this limit, the energy spread\ndecreases. These findings are verified for different laser pulse lengths\nranging from short ~ 30 fs pulses presently available to the long ~ 150 fs\npulses expected in the near-future laser facilities, and compared with a\ntheoretical model.

The results of the study provide evidence that game\ndevelopment organizations must deal with multiple business key factors to\nremain competitive and handle the high pressure in the digital game industry.\nFurthermore, the results of the study support the theoretical assertion that\nkey business factors play an important role in game business performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 20:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

This paper presents an approach to drainage direction\nassignment which is not restricted by a flat's shape, number of outlets, or\nsurrounding topography. Flow is modeled by superimposing a gradient away from\nhigher terrain with a gradient towards lower terrain resulting in a drainage\nfield exhibiting flow convergence, an improvement over methods which produce\nregions of parallel flow. This approach builds on previous work by Garbrecht\nand Martz (1997), but presents several important improvements. The improved\nalgorithm guarantees that flats are only resolved if they have outlets. The\nalgorithm does not require iterative application; a single pass is sufficient\nto resolve all flats. The algorithm presents a clear strategy for identifying\nflats and their boundaries. The algorithm is not susceptible to loss of\nfloating-point precision. Furthermore, the algorithm is efficient, operating in\nO( N ) time whereas the older algorithm operates in O( N^(3/2) ) time. In\ntesting, the improved algorithm ran 6.5 times faster than the old for a 100 x\n100 cell flat and 69 times faster for a 700 x 700 cell flat. In tests on actual\nDEMs, the improved algorithm finished its processing 38--110 times sooner while\nrunning on a single processor than a parallel implementation of the old\nalgorithm did while running on 16 processors.

Using the recently made rigorous IST for\nvector fields associated with the so-called Pavlov equation\n$v_{xt}+v_{yy}+v_xv_{xy}-v_yv_{xx}=0$, we have recently esatablished that, in\nthe nonlocal part of its evolutionary form $v_{t}=\nv_{x}v_{y}-\\partial^{-1}_{x}\\,\\partial_{y}\\,[v_{y}+v^2_{x}]$, the formal\nintegral $\\partial^{-1}_{x}$ corresponding to the solutions of the Cauchy\nproblem constructed by such an IST is the asymmetric integral\n$-\\int_x^{\\infty}dx'$.

A similar result, in which the parabola is replaced\nby the circle, is already known in the literature and finds applications in\ntomography. Indeed, in a two-dimensional linear tomographic problem with a\nconvex opaque obstacle, only the integrals along the straight lines\nnon-intersecting the obstacle are known, and in the class of potentials\n$f(X,Y)$ with polynomial decay we do not have unique solvability of the inverse\nproblem anymore. Therefore, for the problem with an obstacle, it is natural not\nto try to reconstruct the complete potential, but only some integral\ncharacteristics like the integral over the boundary of the obstacle. Due to the\nabove two lemmas, this can be done, at the moment, for opaque bodies having as\nboundary a parabola and a circle (an ellipse).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 20:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}

The\nsimulations are carried out using a new code ${\\rm\\it grim}$, which evolves a\ncovariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal\neffects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are\nmodeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference\nbetween the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model\nrelies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering\nand velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities. We find that the\npressure anisotropy grows to match the magnetic pressure, at which point it\nsaturates due to the mirror instability. The pressure anisotropy produces\noutward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD\nturbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the\nwall of the jet. We also find that, at least in our axisymmetric simulations,\nconduction has a small effect on the disc evolution because (1) the heat flux\nis constrained to be parallel to the field and the field is close to\nperpendicular to temperature gradients, and (2) the heat flux is choked by an\nincrease in effective collisionality associated with the mirror instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

In this work, we\npropose an alternative approach to assessing topologically induced edge states\nin free and interacting fermionic systems. We do so by focussing on the\nfermionic covariance matrix. This matrix is often tractable either analytically\nor numerically and it precisely captures the relevant correlations of the\nsystem. By invoking the concept of monogamy of entanglement we show that highly\nentangled states supported across a system bi-partition are largely\ndisentangled from the rest of the system, thus appearing usually as gapless\nedge states. We then define an entanglement qualifier that identifies the\npresence of topological edge states based purely on correlations present in the\nground states. We demonstrate the versatility of this qualifier by applying it\nto various free and interacting fermionic topological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 21:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

The AMS experiment has now\nreported that the proton-to-helium ratio as function of rigidity $R$\n(momentum-to-charge ratio) falls off steadily as p/He $\\sim R^\\Delta$, with\n$\\Delta\\approx$-0.08 between $R\\sim$40 GV and $R\\sim$2 TV. Besides, the single\nspectra of proton and helium are found to progressively harden at $R\\gtrsim$100\nGV. The p/He anomaly is generally ascribed to particle-dependent acceleration\nmechanisms occurring in Galactic CR sources. However, this explanation poses a\nchallenge to the known mechanisms of particle acceleration since they are\nbelieved to be \"universal\", composition blind, rigidity mechanisms. Using the\nnew AMS data, we show that the p/He anomaly can be simply explained in terms of\na two-component scenario where the GeV-TeV flux is ascribed to a hydrogen-rich\nsource, possibly a nearby supernova remnant, characterized by a soft\nacceleration spectrum. This simple idea provides a common interpretation for\nthe p/He ratio and for the single spectra of proton and helium: both anomalies\nare explained by a flux transition between two components. The \"universality\"\nof particle acceleration in sources is not violated in this model. A\ndistinctive signature of our scenario is the high-energy flattening of the p/He\nratio at multi-TeV energies, which is hinted at by existing data and will be\nresolutely tested by new space experiments ISS-CREAM and CALET.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 21:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 22:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 20:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

Filling them so\nthey are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain were impermeable, is\noften necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm\npresented here---called Priority-Flood---unifies and improves on the work of a\nnumber of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm\noperates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to\ndetermine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or\ndigital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for\nboth integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time,\nrespectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once\nthey have been found, an O(m lg m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m\ndoes not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of\nany known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this\nimproved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37% faster than the\noriginal. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely-used\ndepression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a\nrun-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a\nsingle processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and\nimplement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++\nreference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on\nirregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be\nadapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either\nincremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental\nelevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior\nworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 21:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

Following\noutbreaks in the European Union and elsewhere, many governments enacted\nlegislation designed to limit the spread of such diseases via elimination or\nreduction of one-species feedback loops in agricultural systems. However,\ntwo-species feedback loops---those in which infectious material from\none-species is consumed by a secondary species whose tissue is then consumed by\nthe first species---were not universally prohibited and have not been studied\nbefore. Here we present a basic ecological disease model which examines the\nrole feedback loops may play in the spread of BSE and related diseases.

Efficient algorithms based on multi-clique-width are still possible\nfor interesting tasks like computing the independent set polynomial or testing\n$c$-colorability.

However,\nthe prevalence and policies of these Web proxies are generally opaque to users\nand difficult to measure without privileged access to devices and servers. In\nthis paper, we present a methodology to detect the presence of Web proxies\nwithout requiring access to low-level packet traces on a device, nor access to\nservers being contacted. We demonstrate the viability of this technique using\ncontrolled experiments, and present the results of running our approach on\nseveral production networks and popular Web sites. Next, we characterize the\nbehaviors of these Web proxies, including caching, redirecting, and content\nrewriting. Our analysis can identify how Web proxies impact network\nperformance, and inform policies for future deployments.

The success of two-phase xenon detectors for\ndark matter searches relies on their ability to distinguish electron recoil\n(ER) background events from nuclear recoil (NR) signal events. Typically, the\nNR-ER discrimination is obtained from the ratio of the electroluminescence\nlight (S2) to the prompt scintillation light (S1). Analysis of the S1 pulse\nshape is an additional discrimination technique that can be used to distinguish\nNR from ER.

However, recent studies have shown that\ndeep learning, like other machine learning techniques, is vulnerable to\nadversarial samples: inputs crafted to force a deep neural network (DNN) to\nprovide adversary-selected outputs. Such attacks can seriously undermine the\nsecurity of the system supported by the DNN, sometimes with devastating\nconsequences. For example, autonomous vehicles can be crashed, illicit or\nillegal content can bypass content filters, or biometric authentication systems\ncan be manipulated to allow improper access. In this work, we introduce a\ndefensive mechanism called defensive distillation to reduce the effectiveness\nof adversarial samples on DNNs. We analytically investigate the\ngeneralizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive\ndistillation when training DNNs. We also empirically study the effectiveness of\nour defense mechanisms on two DNNs placed in adversarial settings. The study\nshows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation\nfrom 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be\nexplained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial\nsample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10^30. We also find that\ndistillation increases the average minimum number of features that need to be\nmodified to create adversarial samples by about 800% on one of the DNNs we\ntested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 04:51:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 13:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

For these collective behaviours\nto take hold, the individuals must be able to emit, sense and react to signals.\nWhen dealing with simple organisms and robots, these signals are necessarily\nvery elementary, e.g. a cell might signal its presence by releasing chemicals\nand a robot by shining light. An additional challenge arises because the motion\nof the individuals is often noisy, e.g. the orientation of cells can be altered\nby Brownian motion and that of robots by an uneven terrain. Therefore, the\nemphasis is on achieving complex and tunable behaviors from simple autonomous\nagents communicating with each other in robust ways. Here, we show that the\ndelay between sensing and reacting to a signal can determine the individual and\ncollective long-term behavior of autonomous agents whose motion is\nintrinsically noisy. We experimentally demonstrate that the collective\nbehaviour of a group of phototactic robots capable of emitting a radially\ndecaying light field can be tuned from segregation to aggregation and\nclustering by controlling the delay with which they change their propulsion\nspeed in response to the light intensity they measure. We track this transition\nto the underlying dynamics of this system, in particular, to the ratio between\nthe robots' sensorial delay time and the characteristic time of the robots'\nrandom reorientation. Supported by numerics, we discuss how the same mechanism\ncan be applied to control active agents, e.g. airborne drones, moving in a\nthree-dimensional space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 08:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

In this paper, a novel\nnon-destructive test (NDT) method based on flexural free vibration is\nintroduced to investigate the viscoelastic properties of fiber-reinforced\ncomposites. Three different types of industrial fibers (carbon, glass, and\nhemp) and an unsaturated polyester resin were selected to produce bar-shaped\ncomposites via pultrusion technique. These composite bars were used in a simple\nNDT method which just required a wooden hammer, two elastic jaws, a microphone\nand a recorder software program to perform the experiment. The composite bars\nwere mounted on elastic jaws and hit by a wooden hammer at one end of the\nspecimen as a perpendicular impulse. The produced sound at the other side of\nthe bars was recorded. By analyzing the recorded sounds by means of fast\nFourier transform (FFT), viscoelastic properties such as flexural elastic\nmodulus and the loss parameter (Tan {\\delta}) were calculated for the\nfiber-reinforced composites. For determination of flexural elastic modulus, the\nfirst three modes of vibration in FFT graphs were analyzed using Temuschenco\ntheory. Also, Tan {\\delta} was determined by analyzing the drop in the\nintensity of vibrational energy as a function of time. Although there was a\nslight discrepancy between the calculated values from the NDT method and the\nactual data from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) approach, a good\nagreement was achieved between NDT and DMTA results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 11:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

It is argued that in the unbroken symmetry phase,\nwhere only proper collections of field components as colorless states are\ndetected, it is logical to assume that the same happens for the dual\ncoordinates, making matrix coordinates the natural candidates to capture the\ninternal dynamics of baryonic confined states. The proposed matrix coordinates\nhappen to be the same appearing in the bound-state of D0-branes of string\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 19:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Both free-standing films and\nfilms deposited on a dielectric substrate are considered. The computations are\nperformed for a Au film and a sapphire substrate. According to our results, for\nfree-standing Au films consisting of one and three atomic layers the respective\nrelative error arising from the use of an isotropic (bulk) dielectric\npermittivity is equal to 73% and 37% for the van der Waals energy, and 70% and\n35% for the pressure. We tabulate the energy and pressure van der Waals\ncoefficients of thin Au films computed with account of their anisotropy. It is\nshown that the bulk permittivity of Au can be used for the films consisting of\nmore than 30 atomic layers, i.e., more than approximately 7 nm thickness. The\nrole of relativistic effects is also investigated and shown to be important\neven for the films consisting of two or three layers. The obtained results can\nfind applications in the investigation of stability of thin films and\ndevelopment of novel nanoscale devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 08:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}
