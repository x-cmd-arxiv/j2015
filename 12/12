We consider a regime relevant for\nthe relativistic heavy ion collisions, $\\alpha_s eB\\ll T^2\\ll eB$, so that\nthermal excitations of light quarks are restricted to the lowest Landau level\n(LLL) states. In the vanishing light-quark mass limit, we find\n$\\kappa_\\perp^{\\rm LO}\\propto \\alpha_s^2 T eB$ in the leading order that arises\nfrom screened Coulomb scatterings with (1+1)-dimensional LLL quarks, while\n$\\kappa_\\parallel$ gets no contribution from the scatterings with LLL quarks\ndue to kinematic restrictions. We show that the first non-zero leading order\ncontributions to $\\kappa_\\parallel^{\\rm LO}$ come from the two separate\neffects: 1) the screened Coulomb scatterings with thermal gluons, and 2) a\nfinite light-quark mass $m_q$.

The ingress/egress duration measurements of the more recent events agree\nwell with those from the 2010-2011 event, providing strong evidence that the\nnew dimmings are kinematically associated with the same occulting source.\nTherefore, we suggest that both the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 dimming events,\nmeasured using data from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope and the\nKutztown University Observatory, are also occultations of RW Aur A by tidally\ndisrupted circumstellar material. Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the\neccentric fly-by of RW Aur B suggest the occulting body to be a bridge of\nmaterial connecting RW Aur A and B. These simulations suggest the possibility\nof additional occultations, supported by the observations presented in this\nwork. The color evolution of the dimmings suggest that the tidally stripped\ndisk material includes dust grains ranging in size from small grains at the\nleading edge, typical of star forming regions, to large grains, ices or pebbles\nproducing grey or nearly grey extinction deeper within the occulting material.\nIt is not known whether this material represents arrested planet building prior\nto the tidal disruption event, or perhaps accelerated planet building as a\nresult of the disruption event, but in any case the evidence suggests the\npresence of advanced planet building material in the space between RW Aur A and\nB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 17:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

A general understanding for flexibility is not yet clearly\ndefined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions based on\nbackground information. The term flexibility is commonly defined as the ability\nto adapt to changes. For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to\nadapt the available network resources, such as flows or topology, to changes of\ndesign requirements, e.g., shorter latency budgets or different traffic\ndistributions. Recent concepts such as Software Defined Networking, Network\nVirtualization and Network Function Virtualization have emerged claiming to\nprovide more flexibility in networks.

We propose a\nradiation mechanism for fast radio bursts where the emission arises from\ncollisionless Bremsstrahlung in strong plasma turbulence excited by\nrelativistic electron beams. We discuss possible astrophysical scenarios in\nwhich this process might operate. The emitting region is a turbulent plasma hit\nby a relativistic jet, where Langmuir plasma waves produce a concentration of\nintense electrostatic soliton-like regions (cavitons).

The errors inherent in the\nfinite-temperature Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations are\nanalyzed by comparing the entropies of the grand canonical and canonical\nensembles, as well as the level density at the neutron resonance threshold,\nwith shell model Monte Carlo (SMMC) calculations, which are accurate up to\nwell-controlled statistical errors.

In the absence of a pairing\ncondensate, we confirm that the usual saddle-point approximation to extract the\nnumber-projected densities is not a significant source of error compared to\nother errors inherent to the mean-field theory.

The obtained 86GHz image clearly confirms some important jet features\nknown at lower frequencies, i.e., a wide-opening angle jet base, a\nlimb-brightened intensity profile, a parabola-shape collimation profile and a\ncounter jet. The limb-brightened structure is already well developed at <\n0.2mas (< 28Rs, projected) from the core, where the corresponding apparent\nopening angle becomes as wide as ~100 degrees. The subsequent jet collimation\nnear the black hole evolves in a complicated manner; there is a \"constricted\"\nstructure at tens Rs from the core, where the jet cross section is locally\nshrinking.

We take into account a finite brane width and a scale invariance (SI)\nbreaking dilaton-brane coupling, both of which should be included in a\nrealistic setup. Provided that the microscopic size of the brane is not tuned\nmuch smaller than the fundamental bulk Planck length, we find that either the\n4D curvature or the size of the extra dimensions is unacceptably large. Since\nthis result is independent of the dilaton-brane couplings, it provides the\nbiggest challenge to the SLED program.\n  In addition, to clarify its potential with respect to the cosmological\nconstant problem, we infer the amount of tuning on model parameters required to\nobtain a sufficiently small 4D curvature. A first answer was recently given in\n[arXiv:1508.01124], showing that 4D flat solutions are only ensured in the SI\ncase by imposing a tuning relation, even if a brane-localized flux is included.\nIn this companion paper, we find that the tuning can in fact be avoided for\ncertain SI breaking brane-dilaton couplings, but only at the price of worsening\nthe phenomenological problem.\n  Our results are obtained by solving the full coupled Einstein-dilaton system\nin a completely consistent way. The brane width is implemented using a\nwell-known ring regularization. In passing, we note that for the couplings\nconsidered here the results of [arXiv:1508.01124] (which only treated\ninfinitely thin branes) are all consistently recovered in the thin brane limit,\nand how this can be reconciled with the concerns about their correctness,\nrecently brought up in [arXiv:1509.04201].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 20:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

For this reason, their matter content\nshould be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon\nfraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction. We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit\nrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\\rm\ngas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\\left(M_{\\rm\n500}/10^{14}M_\\odot\\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. The baryon budget of galaxy\nclusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a\nfactor of two at $r_{\\rm 500}$. Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias\n$1-b=M_X/M_{\\rm WL}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtained\nusing lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. Comparing our gas fraction\nmeasurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our results\nfavour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the\nbaryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in\ncontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might\nsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias\n$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should\ntranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to\nour current understanding of galaxy clusters.

The no-hair theorem and, hence, general relativity can be\ntested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such\nhigher-order moments.

First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A*\nwith current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital\nprecessions.

Here we report a rare observation of a coronal loop\nrooted in the dark umbra of a sunspot without any traces of light bridges or\numbral dots. We used the slit-jaw images and spectroscopic data from IRIS and\nconcentrate on the line profiles of O IV and Si IV that show persistent strong\nredshifted components in the loop rooted in the umbra. Using the ratios of O\nIV, we can estimate the density and thus investigate the mass flux. The coronal\ncontext and temperature diagnostics of these observations is provided through\nthe EUV channels of AIA. The coronal loop, embedded within cooler downflows,\nhosts supersonic downflows. The speed of more than 100 km s$^{-1}$ is on the\nsame order of magnitude in the transition region lines of O IV and Si IV, and\nis even seen at comparable speed in the chromospheric Mg II lines. At a\nprojected distance of within $1\"$ of the footpoint, we see a shock transition\nto smaller downflow speeds of about 15 km s$^{-1}$ being consistent with mass\nconservation across a stationary isothermal shock. We see no direct evidence\nfor energy input into the loop because the loop is rooted in the dark uniform\npart of the umbra with no light bridges or umbral dots near by.

A poorly performing sub-system may become a serious performance\nbottleneck for the entire system if its serviceability and the capacity is over\nutilized by increased service demand from upstream systems.

We find that a dark matter beam produced by a $Z'$\nboson in the GeV mass range is both broader and more energetic than the\nneutrino beam. The reach for dark matter is maximized for a detector sensitive\nto hard neutral-current scatterings, placed at a sizable angle off the neutrino\nbeam axis.

Accretion is allowed through angular\nmomentum transport and the solution of the equations of radiation\nhydrodynamics. Our methods adopt flux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics\nfor the dusty, infrared pressure driven part of the flow, along with X-ray\nheating and cooling.

In this paper, we study the problem of query answering over\nquads augmented with forall-existential bridge rules that enable\ninteroperability of reasoning between triples in various contexts. We call a\nset of quads together with such expressive bridge rules, a quad-system. Query\nanswering over quad-systems is undecidable, in general. We derive decidable\nclasses of quad-systems, for which query answering can be done using forward\nchaining. Sound, complete and terminating procedures, which are adaptations of\nthe well known chase algorithm, are provided for these classes for deciding\nquery entailment. Safe, msafe, and csafe class of quad-systems restrict the\nstructure of blank nodes generated during the chase computation process to be\ndirected acyclic graphs (DAGs) of bounded depth. RR and restricted RR classes\ndo not allow the generation of blank nodes during the chase computation\nprocess. Both data and combined complexity of query entailment has been\nestablished for the classes derived. We further show that quad-systems are\nequivalent to forall-existential rules whose predicates are restricted to\nternary arity, modulo polynomial time translations. We subsequently show that\nthe technique of safety, strictly subsumes in expressivity, some of the well\nknown and expressive techniques, such as joint acyclicity and model faithful\nacyclicity, used for decidability guarantees in the realm of forall-existential\nrules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2015 09:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

We discovered some\nnew distinctive features, whose position on the $eV$ axis is determined by the\ncritical power required for the injection of nonequilibriumquasiparticles. At\nthis level of power the band gap $\\Delta $ decreases abruptly in the vicinity\nof the contact. A correction to the point-contact spectrum, with the sign\nopposite to that of the usual correction, arises in the region of phonon\nenergies. The maxima in the $Ta$ spectrum become sharper and their position on\nthe energy axis becomes stabilized near the values $e{{V}_{ph}}=7.0$, 11.3,\n15.5, and 18 $meV$, which correspond to low phonon group velocities $\\partial\n\\omega /\\partial q\\simeq 0$ in $Ta$. This is confirmed by the existence of\ncorresponding flattenings on the dispersion relations $\\omega (q)$ of lattice\nvibrations. Slow phonons are created near the $N-S$ interface in quasiparticle\nrecombination and relaxation processes and cause a decrease in $\\Delta $ and an\nincrease in the differential resistance in the vicinity of $e{{V}_{ph}}$. An\nexcess quasiparticle charge is accumulated in the region of the contact,\nproducing a correction to the resistance, which decreases as $eV$, $T$, and $H$\nincrease. These mechanisms are particularly effective in dirty contacts, thus\npermitting phonon spectroscopy in the superconducting state even when the\ncurrent flow occurs in a nearly thermal mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2015 14:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

In particular, the cross-correlations between a\nbright and a faint population of galaxies contain also a dipole. In this paper\nwe present the first attempt to measure this dipole. We discuss the four types\nof effects that contribute to the dipole: relativistic distortions, evolution\neffect, wide-angle effect and large-angle effect. We show that the first three\ncontributions are intrinsic anti-symmetric contributions that do not depend on\nthe choice of angle used to measure the dipole. On the other hand the\nlarge-angle effect appears only if the angle chosen to extract the dipole\nbreaks the symmetry of the problem. We show that the relativistic distortions,\nthe evolution effect and the wide-angle effect are too small to be detected in\nthe LOWz and CMASS sample of the BOSS survey. On the other hand with a specific\ncombination of angles we are able to measure the large-angle effect with high\nsignificance. We emphasise that this large-angle dipole does not contain new\nphysical information, since it is just a geometrical combination of the\nmonopole and the quadrupole. However this measurement, which is in excellent\nagreement with theoretical predictions, validates our method for extracting the\ndipole from the two-point correlation function and it opens the way to the\ndetection of relativistic effects in future surveys like e.g. DESI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2015 15:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 11:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-06-09"}

A 2-parameter non-geometric CL-central algebra comprises a pair of\ndiscrete coupled and conserved quc attributes -- electric charge and\n'chirality'. Chirality, without any physics counterpart, renders CL a\nsupersymmetry and provides our present universe with nuclear forces -- 'strong\ninteractions'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 17:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 00:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 15:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 16:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 2019 16:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 20:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

Systems containing topological constraints and/or composed of\nimmobile particles, e.g. lattice models and chemical gelation, were studied in\nconventional works on percolation. Coordinates of the randomly distributed\nparticles in the conventional lattice models are limited to discrete lattice\npoints. Moreover, each particle is spatially fixed at the distributed position,\nwhich results in a temporally unchanged network structure. Although each\npolymer in the chemical gels can spontaneously move in the continuous space,\nthe network structure is fixed when cross-linking reaction ends. By contrast to\nthese conventional systems, all the molecules in the present system freely move\nand spontaneously diffuse in the continuous space. The network structure of the\npresent molecules continues changing dynamically. The percolation and critical\nphenomena of such dynamic network structures are examined here. We reveal that\nthese phenomena also occur in the present system, and that both the\nuniversality class and percolation threshold are independent from the\nextra-molecular topological constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 18:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 08:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 09:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 09:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 12:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 2019 09:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 22:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-05"}
