The question of the\nhomogeneity, granularity, or possibly glassiness of the material on the verge\nof this transition is intimately related to this fundamental issue.

However,\nexisting training methods for such networks are either biologically\nimplausible, or require a real-time continuous error signal to guide the\nlearning process. This is in contrast with most behavioral tasks, which only\nprovide time-sparse, delayed rewards. Here we show that a biologically\nplausible reward-modulated Hebbian learning algorithm, previously used in\nfeedforward models of birdsong learning, can train recurrent networks based\nsolely on delayed, phasic reward signals at the end of each trial. The method\nrequires no dedicated feedback or readout networks: the whole network\nconnectivity is subject to learning, and the network output is read from one\narbitrarily chosen network cell. We use this method to successfully train a\nnetwork on a delayed nonmatch to sample task (which requires memory, flexible\nassociations, and non-linear mixed selectivities). Using decoding techniques,\nwe show that the resulting networks exhibit dynamic coding of task-relevant\ninformation, with neural encodings of various task features fluctuating widely\nover the course of a trial. Furthermore, network activity moves from a\nstimulus-specific representation to a response-specific representation during\nresponse time, in accordance with neural recordings in behaving animals for\nsimilar tasks.

In string theory only sub-Planckian axion decay constants have\nbeen found in any controlled regime. However in field theory it is possible to\ngenerate an enhanced super-Planckian decay constant by an appropriate aligned\nmixing between axions with individual sub-Planckian decay constants. We study\nthe possibility of such a mechanism in string theory. In particular we\nconstruct a new realisation of an alignment scenario in type IIA string theory\ncompactifications on a Calabi-Yau where the alignment is induced through\nfluxes. Within field theory the original decay constants are taken to be\nindependent of the parameters which induce the alignment. In string theory\nhowever they are moduli dependent quantities and so interact gravitationally\nwith the physics responsible for the mixing. We show that this gravitational\neffect of the fluxes on the moduli can precisely cancel any enhancement of the\neffective decay constant. This censorship of an effective super-Planckian decay\nconstant depends on detailed properties of Calabi-Yau moduli spaces and occurs\nfor all the examples and classes that we study. We expand these results to a\ngeneral superpotential assuming only that the axion superpartners are fixed\nsupersymmetrically and are able to show for a large class of Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds, but not all, that the cancellation effect occurs and is independent\nof the superpotential. We also study simple models where the moduli are fixed\nnon-supersymmetrically and find that similar cancellation behaviour can emerge.\nFinally we make some comments on a possible generalisation to axion monodromy\ninflation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 20:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 09:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-10"}

This device is based on a micro-electromechanical\nsystem (MEMS) incorporating InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) on a PMNPT-on-silicon\nsubstrate. The entangled photon emissions from single QDs can be tuned by more\nthan 3000 times of the radiative linewidth without spoiling the entanglement.\nWith a footprint of several hundred microns, our design facilitates the\nminiaturization and scalable integration of indistinguishable entangled photon\nsources on silicon. When interfaced with silicon-based quantum photonic\ncircuits, this device will offer a vast range of exciting possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 21:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

The paper was withdrawn from submission> One of the\nobjectives of a Delaunay mesh refinement algorithm is to produce meshes with\ntetrahedral elements having a bounded aspect ratio, which is the ratio between\nthe radius of the circumscribing and inscribing spheres. The refinement is\ncarried out by inserting additional Steiner vertices inside the circumsphere of\na poor-quality tetrahedron (to remove the tetrahedron) at a sufficient distance\nfrom existing vertices to guarantee the termination and size optimality of the\nalgorithm. This technique eliminates tetrahedra whose ratio of the radius of\nthe circumscribing sphere and the shortest side, the radius-edge ratio, is\nlarge. Slivers, almost-planar tetrahedra, which have a small radius-edge ratio,\nbut a large aspect ratio, are avoided by small random perturbations of the\nSteiner vertices to improve the aspect ratio. Additionally, geometric\nconstraints, called \"petals\", have been shown to produce smaller high-quality\nmeshes in 2D Delaunay refinement algorithms.

The\nfeasibility of their dense deployments depends on the existence of a high\ndata-rate transport network that can provide high-data backhaul from an\naggregation node where data traffic originates and terminates, to every such\nsmall cell. Due to the limited range of radio signals in the high frequency\nbands, multihop wireless connection may need to be established between each\naccess node and an aggregation node. In this paper, we present a novel\ntransmission scheme for wireless multihop backhaul for 5G networks. The scheme\nconsists of 1) {\\em group successive relaying} that established a relay\nschedule to efficiently exploit half-duplex relays and 2) an optimized\nquantize-map-and-forward (QMF) coding scheme that improves the performance of\nQMF and reduces the decoding complexity and the delay. We derive an achievable\nrate region of the proposed scheme and attain a closed-form expression in the\nasymptotic case for several network models of interests. It is shown that the\nproposed scheme provides a significant gain over multihop routing (based on\ndecode-and-forward), which is a solution currently proposed for wireless\nmultihop backhaul network. Furthermore, the performance gap increases as a\nnetwork becomes denser. For the proposed scheme, we then develop\nenergy-efficient routing that determines {\\em groups} of participating relays\nfor every hop. To reflect the metric used in the routing algorithm, we refer to\nit as {\\em interference-harnessing} routing. By turning interference into a\nuseful signal, each relay requires a lower transmission power to achieve a\ndesired performance compared to other routing schemes. Finally, we present a\nlow-complexity successive decoder, which makes it feasible to use the proposed\nscheme in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 05:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

Two\napproximation methods are introduced respectively, namely the ensemble approach\nand the dominating-term assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 05:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 03:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

However, this\nverification is facing severe challenges. First, in realistic settings, the\ncomputing entities only have imperfectly synchronized clocks. A proper timing\nmodel is essential to the interpretation of the trace of system execution.\nSecond, the specification should be able to express properties with real-time\nconstraints despite the asynchrony, and the semantics should be interpreted\nover the currently-observed and continuously-growing trace. To address these\nchallenges, we propose PARO - the partially synchronous system observation\nframework, which i) adopts the partially synchronous model of time, and\nintroduces the lattice and the timed automata theories to model the trace of\nsystem execution; ii) adopts a tailored subset of TCTL to specify temporal\nproperties, and defines the 3-valued semantics to interpret the properties over\nthe currently-observed finite trace; iii) constructs the timed automaton\ncorresponding to the trace at runtime, and reduces the satisfaction of the\n3-valued semantics over finite traces to that of the classical boolean\nsemantics over infinite traces.

Motivated by a growing mosaic of materials, we\nespecially consider a broad range of nearest-neighbour interactions consisting\nof Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya as well as anisotropic ferro$-$ and antiferromagnetic\ncoupling. We present a three-fold mapping on the kagome lattice which\ntransforms the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet and XXZ model onto two\nlines of time-reversal invariant Hamiltonians. The mapping is exact for\nclassical and quantum spins alike, i.e. it preserves the energy spectrum of the\noriginal Heisenberg and XXZ models.

These ground states\nsupport a variety of phenomena such as ferromagnetically induced pinch points\nin the structure factor and the possibility for spontaneous scalar chirality.\nFor quantum spin$-1/2$, the XXZ model has been recently shown to be a quantum\nspin liquid. Applying our three-fold mapping to the XXZ model gives rise to a\nconnected network of quantum spin liquids, centered around a paragon of quantum\ndisorder, namely the Ising antiferromagnet.

However, its performance is limited in terms of data rate and\nlatency. Free Space Optical (FSO) backhaul, on the other hand, offers a higher\ndata rate but is sensitive to weather conditions. To combine the advantages of\nRF and FSO backhauls, this paper proposes a cost-efficient backhaul network\nusing the hybrid RF/FSO technology. To ensure a resilient backhaul, the paper\nimposes a given degree of redundancy by connecting each node through $K$\nlink-disjoint paths so as to cope with potential link failures. Hence, the\nnetwork planning problem considered in this paper is the one of minimizing the\ntotal deployment cost by choosing the appropriate link type, i.e., either\nhybrid RF/FSO or optical fiber (OF), between each couple of base-stations while\nguaranteeing $K$ link-disjoint connections, a data rate target, and a\nreliability threshold. The paper solves the problem using graph theory\ntechniques. It reformulates the problem as a maximum weight clique problem in\nthe planning graph, under a specified realistic assumption about the cost of OF\nand hybrid RF/FSO links. Simulation results show the cost of the different\nplanning and suggest that the proposed heuristic solution has a\nclose-to-optimal performance for a significant gain in computation complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 15:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 23:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}
