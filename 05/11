A minimal model\nof hydrodynamically coupled oscillators can reproduce semi-quantitatively the\ncharacteristics of the average metachronal dynamics, and the emergence of\ndefects. We systematically study the model's behaviour by assessing the effect\nof changing intrinsic rotor characteristics, including oscillator stiffness and\nthe nature of their internal driving force, as well as their geometric\nproperties and spatial arrangement. Our results suggest that metachronal\ncoordination follows from deformations in the oscillators' limit cycles induced\nby hydrodynamic stresses, and that defects result from sufficiently steep local\nbiases in the oscillators' intrinsic frequencies. Additionally, we find that\nrandom variations in the intrinsic rotor frequencies increase the robustness of\nthe average properties of the emergent metachronal waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2015 19:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

The effective\nhydraulic pore radius is related to a characteristic hydraulic length, the\nfluctuation in local hydraulic radii is related to a constriction factor, the\nlength of streamlines is characterized by a tortuosity, and the fractional\nvolume conducting flow from inlet to outlet is described by an effective\nporosity.

This\nentails finding a natural way of extending important functions f from the reals\nto the reals to functions f* from the surreals to the surreals, and naturally\ndefining integration on the f*. The usual square root, log, and exp were\nnaturally extended to No by Bach, Conway, Kruskal, and Norton, retaining their\nusual properties. Later Norton also proposed a treatment of integration, but\nKruskal discovered it has flaws. In his recent survey [2, p. 438], Siegel\ncharacterizes the question of the existence of a reasonable definition of\nsurreal integration as \"perhaps the most important open problem in the theory\nof surreal numbers.\" This paper addresses this and related unresolved issues\nwith positive and negative results. In the positive direction, we show that\nsemi-algebraic, semi-analytic, analytic, meromorphic, or more generally\n\\'Ecalle-Borel transseriable functions extend naturally to No, and an integral\nwith good properties exists on them. In the negative direction, we show there\nis a fundamental set-theoretic obstruction to naturally extending many larger\nfamilies of functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 03:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 21:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 22:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

We consider dust with a variety of sizes (stopping\ntime $t_s = 10^{-2}\\Omega^{-1} - 10^{2}\\Omega^{-1}$, from fully coupled with\nthe gas to the decoupling limit. We find that a vortex is destroyed by dust\nfeedback when the total dust-to-gas mass ratio within the vortex is larger than\n30-50%, independent of the dust size. The dust distribution can still be\nasymmetric in some cases after the vortex has been destroyed. With smaller\namounts of dust, a vortex can survive for at least 100 orbits, and the maximum\ndust surface density within the vortex can be more than 100 times larger than\nthe gas surface density, potentially facilitating planetesimal formation. On\nthe other hand, in these stable vortices, small ($t_s < \\Omega^{-1}$) and large\n($t_s > \\Omega^{-1}$) dust grains concentrate differently and affect the gas\ndynamics in different ways. The distribution of large dust is more elongated\nthan that of small dust. Large dust ($t_s > \\Omega^{-1}$) concentrates in the\ncentre of the vortex and feedback leads to turn-over in vorticity towards the\ncentre, forming a quiescent region within an anticyclonic vortex. Such a\nturn-over is absent if the vortex is loaded with small grains. We demonstrate\nthat, in protoplanetary discs where both large and small dust grains are\npresent and under the right condition, the concentration of large dust towards\nthe vortex centre can lead to a quiescent centre, repelling the small dust and\nforming a small dust ring around the vortex centre. Such anticorrelations\nbetween small and large dust within vortices may explain the discrepancy\nbetween ALMA and near-IR scattered light observations in the asymmetric region\nof transitional discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 04:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

In most previous studies, for CSI acquisition, pilot\nsymbols were employed, which leads to a reduction of spectral and energy\nefficiency; and an impractical assumption that the background radiation\ncomponent is perfectly known was made. In this paper, we develop an efficient\nand robust sequence receiver, which acquires the CSI and the background\ninformation implicitly and requires no knowledge about the channel model\ninformation. It is robust since it can automatically estimate the CSI and\nbackground component and detect the data sequence accordingly. Its decision\nmetric has a simple form and involves no integrals, and thus can be easily\nevaluated. A Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm is adopted to improve the\nsearch efficiency, and a selective-store strategy is adopted to overcome a\npotential error floor problem as well as to increase the memory efficiency. To\nfurther simplify the receiver, a decision-feedback symbol-by-symbol receiver is\nproposed as an approximation of the sequence receiver. By simulations and\ntheoretical analysis, we show that the performance of both the sequence\nreceiver and the symbol-by-symbol receiver, approach that of detection with\nperfect knowledge of the CSI and background radiation, as the length of the\nwindow for forming the decision metric increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 09:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Computing correlation\nfunctions in imaginary time and using their long-time behavior, we extract the\nlowest excitation energy versus momentum using improved fitting procedures and\na generalized moment method. The velocity is then obtained from the dispersion\nrelation.

The time\nseparation between these X-ray observations range from 2 days to 8 months. On\nthese timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and in\ncovering fraction. This is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. The\nmost significant variation occurred in September 2013 when the source\nbrightened for two weeks. A higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lower\nobscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shape\nduring the flare.

Due to a\nserver breakdown, a copy of a file can be lost, it can be retrieved if another\ncopy of the same file is stored on other servers. In the case where no other\ncopy of a given file is present in the network, it is definitively lost. In\norder to have multiple copies of a given file, it is assumed that each server\ncan devote a fraction of its processing capacity to duplicate files on other\nservers to enhance the durability of the system.\n  A simplified stochastic model of this network is analyzed. It is assumed that\na copy of a given file is lost at some fixed rate and that the initial state is\noptimal: each file has the maximum number $d$ of copies located on the servers\nof the network. Due to random losses, the state of the network is transient and\nall files will be eventually lost. As a consequence, a transient\n$d$-dimensional Markov process $(X(t))$ with a unique absorbing state describes\nthe evolution this network. By taking a scaling parameter $N$ related to the\nnumber of nodes of the network. a scaling analysis of this process is\ndeveloped. The asymptotic behavior of $(X(t))$ is analyzed on time scales of\nthe type $t\\mapsto N^p t$ for $0\\leq p\\leq d{-}1$. The paper derives asymptotic\nresults on the decay of the network: Under a stability assumption, the main\nresults state that the critical time scale for the decay of the system is given\nby $t\\mapsto N^{d-1}t$. When the stability condition is not satisfied, it is\nshown that the state of the network converges to an interesting local\nequilibrium which is investigated. As a consequence it sheds some light on the\nrole of the key parameters $\\lambda$, the duplication rate and $d$, the maximal\nnumber of copies, in the design of these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 12:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 08:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

We find that masses can be\nunder/over-estimated up to 50% depending on the degree of relaxation reached by\nthe cluster, the available range of observed masses and distances of radial\nvelocity measures from the cluster center and the strength of the tidal field.\nThe mass function slope appears to be better constrainable and less sensitive\nto model inadequacies unless strongly dynamically evolved clusters and a\nnon-optimal location of the measured luminosity function are considered. The\ndegree and the characteristics of the anisotropy developed in the N-body\nsimulations are not adequately reproduced by popular analytic models and can be\ndetected only if accurate proper motions are available.

Based on this representation, we\ndetermine the set of pairwise vertex adjacency conditions that can populate\nthis graph with edges so as to guarantee decodability or aggregation for the\nvertices of each clique in this graph. We then develop the algorithmic\nprocedures that can be applied on the designed graph model to optimize any\nperformance metric for this ONC subclass.

Traditionally, there exist disconnected open-open or closed-closed\nconfigurations in the solution space of the Tseytlin's action.

These deviations can\naccumulate over large distances, making astrophysical measurements the most\nsensitive tests of Lorentz symmetry. One effect of Lorentz invariance violation\nis an energy dependent photon dispersion of the vacuum resulting in differences\nof the light travel time from distant objects.

In some more recent papers, however, electrons play a new\nimportant role in the shock dynamics and thermodynamics, especially at the\nsolar-wind termination shock. They react on the shock electric field in a very\nspecific way, leading to suprathermal nonequilibrium distributions of the\ndownstream electrons, which can be represented by a kappa distribution\nfunction. In this paper, we discuss why this anticipated hot electron\npopulation has not been seen by the plasma detectors of the Voyager spacecraft\ndownstream of the solar-wind termination shock. We show that hot nonequilibrium\nelectrons induce a strong negative electric charge-up of any spacecraft\ncruising through this downstream plasma environment.

Main challenges arising in organizing impromptu\nactivities are mostly due to the requirements of making timely invitations in\naccordance with the potential activity locations, corresponding to the\nlocations of and the relationship among the candidate attendees. Various\ncombinations of candidate attendees and activity locations create a large\nsolution space. Thus, in this paper, we propose Multiple Rally-Point Social\nSpatial Group Query (MRGQ), to select an appropriate activity location for a\ngroup of nearby attendees with tight social relationships. Although MRGQ is\nNP-hard, the number of attendees in practice is usually small enough such that\nan optimal solution can be found efficiently. Therefore, we first propose an\nInteger Linear Programming optimization model for MRGQ. We then design an\nefficient algorithm, called MAGS, which employs effective search space\nexploration and pruning strategies to reduce the running time for finding the\noptimal solution. We also propose to further optimize efficiency by indexing\nthe potential activity locations. A user study demonstrates the strength of\nusing MAGS over manual coordination in terms of both solution quality and\nefficiency. Experimental results on real datasets show that our algorithms can\nprocess MRGQ efficiently and significantly outperform other baseline\nalgorithms, including one based on the commercial parallel optimizer IBM CPLEX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 15:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 10:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

The sparing number of a graph $G$ is\nthe minimum number of edges with singleton set-labels required for a graph $G$\nto admit a weak IASI. In this paper, we introduce the notion of $k$-sieve\ngraphs of a given graph and study their sparing numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 10:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

The results indicate that temperature significantly influenced\nthe mass yield, energy yield and heating value of oil palm empty fruit bunch\n(OPEFB) briquettes during torrefaction. The solid uniform compact nature of EFB\nbriquettes ensured a slow rate of pyrolysis or devolatization which enhanced\ntorrefaction.
