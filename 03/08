Oeljeklaus and Toma used them to disprove a\nconjecture on the Betti numbers of spaces carrying LCK metrics. Mysteriously,\nthe volume for this metric gives the discriminant and Dirichlet regulator of\nthe number field. Totally unlike the above topological aspects, there does not\nseem to be a conceptual reason why this should be expected. Is it a\ncoincidence? We explore this and see what happens if we (entirely\nexperimentally!) regard them as \"baby siblings\" of, say, hyperbolic manifolds\ncoming from number fields.

In this framework the algorithm is shown\na pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then\npredicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a\nreal valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting\nscenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut\namong others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning\nalgorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$\nis the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of\n$O(\\sqrt{n \\log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework\nconcerns closing the above gap.\n  In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main\nresults. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming\nbased algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a), in fact achieves a regret of\n$O(\\sqrt{nLT})$. Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely,\nwe show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower\nregret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem\nwhich is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a\nrelated conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike\nplanted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known\nquasi-polynomial time algorithms.\n  Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we\nhope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other\nonline learning scenarios as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 17:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 19:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-25"}

Recently, experiments and computer\nsimulations have reported an energy dependence of the exponent increasing with\nthe imparted energy.

We use\nthese data to refine the orbital ephemeris, photometric parameters, and\nmeasured physical properties of the two systems. One transit event for each\nobject was observed simultaneously in three passbands ($gri$) using the BUSCA\nimager.

Ti substitution experiments reveal that the MIT is robust up to\n20% Ti substitutions and occurs even in extremely thin V-rich lamellas in\nspinodally decomposed TiO2-VO2 composites, indicating that the MIT is\ninsensitive to hole doping and essentially takes on a local character. These\nobservations suggest that either electron correlation in the Mott-Hubbard sense\nor Peierls (Fermi-surface) instability plays a minor role on the MIT.

In recent years however, and motivated, in part, by a\nquest for a quantum analog of the PCP theorem researches have tried to\nestablish whether or not we can preserve quantum entanglement at \"constant\"\ntemperatures that are independent of system size. This would imply that any\nquantum state with energy at most, say 0.05 of the total available energy of\nthe Hamiltonian, would be highly-entangled. To this date, no such systems were\nfound, and moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians\non robust, albeit \"non-physical\" topologies, namely expanders, does not\nguarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such\nrobustness may be possible after all: We construct an infinite family of\nO(1)-local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum\nerror-correcting code with the following property of inapproximability: any\nquantum state with energy at most 0.05 w.r.t. the total available energy cannot\nbe even approximately simulated by classical circuits of bounded\n(sub-logarithmic) depth. In a sense, this implies that even providing a\n\"witness\" to the fact that the local Hamiltonian can be \"almost\" satisfied,\nalready requires some measure of long-range entanglement. Our construction is\nbut a first step in what, we believe, is a whole range of possible entanglement\n- robust local Hamiltonians. A natural next step, we believe, is to devise such\nlocal Hamiltonians that resist approximation in terms of bounded-depth quantum\ncircuits (e.g. NLTS), and even find such robust forms of entanglement that are\nuseful for some computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2015 12:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 17:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 00:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 19:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

This class includes the exponential moments whose\nproperties play a key role in the proof of a well-known inequality of Wassily\nHoeffding, for sums of independent and bounded random variables whose mean is\nassumed to be known. As a result we can generalise and improve upon this\ninequality. We show that Hoeffding's bound is optimal in a broader sense. Our\napproach allows to obtain \"missing\" factors in Hoeffding's inequality whose\nexistence is motivated by the central limit theorem. The later result is a\nrather weaker version of a theorem that is due to Michel Talagrand. Using ideas\nfrom the theory of Bernstein polynomials, we show that the Bernstein-Hoeffding\nmethod can be adapted to case in which one has information on higher moments of\nthe random variables. Moreover, we consider the performance of the method under\nadditional information on the conditional distribution of the random variables\nand, finally, we show that the method reduces to Markov's inequality when\nemployed to non-negative and unbounded random variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2015 15:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 16:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

The ultimate goal is to give a construction that\nmatches what is given by the probabilistic method --- an extractor for two\nindependent $n$-bit weak random sources with min-entropy as small as $\\log\nn+O(1)$. Previously, the best known result in the two-source case is an\nextractor by Bourgain \\cite{Bourgain05}, which works for min-entropy $0.49n$;\nand the best known result in the general case is an earlier work of the author\n\\cite{Li13b}, which gives an extractor for a constant number of independent\nsources with min-entropy $\\mathsf{polylog(n)}$. However, the constant in the\nconstruction of \\cite{Li13b} depends on the hidden constant in the best known\nseeded extractor, and can be large; moreover the error in that construction is\nonly $1/\\mathsf{poly(n)}$.\n  In this paper, we make two important improvements over the result in\n\\cite{Li13b}. First, we construct an explicit extractor for \\emph{three}\nindependent sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy $k \\geq \\mathsf{polylog(n)}$.\nIn fact, our extractor works for one independent source with poly-logarithmic\nmin-entropy and another independent block source with two blocks each having\npoly-logarithmic min-entropy. Thus, our result is nearly optimal, and the next\nstep would be to break the $0.49n$ barrier in two-source extractors. Second, we\nimprove the error of the extractor from $1/\\mathsf{poly(n)}$ to\n$2^{-k^{\\Omega(1)}}$, which is almost optimal and crucial for cryptographic\napplications. Some of the techniques developed here may be of independent\ninterests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2015 15:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}
