The optical turbulence parameters are also\ncalculated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with\nthe Trinquet-Vernin model, which describes optical effects of atmospheric\nturbulence by using the local meteorological parameters. This paper presents\nassessment of the optical parameters involved in high angular resolution\nastronomy. Its includes seeing, isoplanatic angle, coherence time, coherence\netendue, vertical profiles of optical turbulence intensity _n^2(h)$ and\nhorizontal wind speed V(h). The median seeing is respectively 1.01 arcsec, 1.17\narcsec and 1.07arcsec as measured with the DIMM, the SSS and predicted with WRF\nmodel.

This\npredicate reduces to evaluating the sign of a multivariate polynomial of degree\n$d+2$ in the coordinates of the points $x, \\, p_0,\\, \\ldots,\\, p_d$. Despite\nmuch progress on exact geometric computing, the fact that the degree of the\npolynomial increases with $d$ makes the evaluation of the sign of such a\npolynomial problematic except in very low dimensions. In this paper, we propose\na new approach that is based on the witness complex, a weak form of the\nDelaunay complex introduced by Carlsson and de Silva. The witness complex\n$\\mathrm{Wit} (L,W)$ is defined from two sets $L$ and $W$ in some metric space\n$X$: a finite set of points $L$ on which the complex is built, and a set $W$ of\nwitnesses that serves as an approximation of $X$. A fundamental result of de\nSilva states that $\\mathrm{Wit}(L,W)=\\mathrm{Del} (L)$ if $W=X=\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nIn this paper, we give conditions on $L$ that ensure that the witness complex\nand the Delaunay triangulation coincide when $W$ is a finite set, and we\nintroduce a new perturbation scheme to compute a perturbed set $L'$ close to\n$L$ such that $\\mathrm{Del} (L')= \\mathrm{wit} (L', W)$. Our perturbation\nalgorithm is a geometric application of the Moser-Tardos constructive proof of\nthe Lov\\'asz local lemma. The only numerical operations we use are (squared)\ndistance comparisons (i.e., predicates of degree 2). The time-complexity of the\nalgorithm is sublinear in $|W|$. Interestingly, although the algorithm does not\ncompute any measure of simplex quality, a lower bound on the thickness of the\noutput simplices can be guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 17:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

This paper studies these procedures as a Markov\nprocess on the social network that is indexed by a tree. Each node in this tree\ncorresponds to an observation and each edge in the tree corresponds to a\nreferral. Indexing with a tree (instead of a chain) allows for the sampled\nunits to refer multiple future units into the sample. In survey sampling, the\ndesign effect characterizes the additional variance induced by a novel sampling\nstrategy. If the design effect is some value $DE$, then constructing an\nestimator from the novel design makes the variance of the estimator $DE$ times\ngreater than it would be under a simple random sample with the same sample size\n$n$. Under certain assumptions on the referral tree, the design effect of\nnetwork sampling has a critical threshold that is a function of the referral\nrate $m$ and the clustering structure in the social network, represented by the\nsecond eigenvalue of the Markov transition matrix, $\\lambda_2$. If $m <\n1/\\lambda_2^2$, then the design effect is finite (i.e. the standard estimator\nis $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent). However, if $m > 1/\\lambda_2^2$, then the design\neffect grows with $n$ (i.e. the standard estimator is no longer\n$\\sqrt{n}$-consistent). Past this critical threshold, the standard error of the\nestimator converges at the slower rate of $n^{\\log_m \\lambda_2}$. The Markov\nmodel allows for nodes to be resampled; computational results show that the\nfindings hold in without-replacement sampling. To estimate confidence intervals\nthat adapt to the correct level of uncertainty, a novel resampling procedure is\nproposed.

It has been found\nthat three stages can be identified in the relaxation of the L23-water system\nunder study. At the first stage, a portion of water at the removal of excess\npressure rapidly flows out in the pressure reduction time, i.e., following a\ndecrease in the pressure. It has been shown that, at temperatures below the\ndispersion transition temperature $T < T_d = 284 K$, e.g., $T = 277 K$, the\ndegree of filling ${\\theta}$ decreases from 1 to 0.8 in 10 s, following the\nvariation of excess pressure. At the second stage of relaxation, the degree of\nfilling ${\\theta}$ varies slowly according to a power law ${\\theta} \\sim\nt^{-\\alpha}$ with the exponent ${\\alpha} < 0.1$ in the time $t \\sim 10^5$ s.\nThis corresponds to a slow relaxation of the formed metastable state of the\nnonwetting liquid in the porous medium. At the third stage when $t > 10^5$ s,\nthe formed metastable state decays, which is manifested in the transition to a\npower-law dependence ${\\theta}(t)$ with a larger exponent. The extrusion-time\ndistribution function of pores has been calculated along with the time\ndependence of the degree of filling, which qualitatively describes the observed\nanomalously slow relaxation and crossover of the transition to the stage of\ndecay with a power-law dependence ${\\theta}(t)$ with a larger exponent. It has\nbeen shown that the relaxation and decay of the metastable state of the\nconfined nonwetting liquid at ${\\theta}>{\\theta_c}$ are attributed to the\nappearance of local configurations of liquid clusters in confinement and their\ninteraction inside the infinite percolation cluster of filled pores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 18:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

None of the\nstellar binaries currently known to host planets has a period shorter than 7\ndays, despite the large number of eclipsing binaries found in the Kepler target\nlist with periods shorter than a few days. These compact binaries are believed\nto have evolved from wider orbits into their current configurations via the\nso-called Lidov-Kozai migration mechanism, in which gravitational perturbations\nfrom a distant tertiary companion induce large-amplitude eccentricity\noscillations in the binary, followed by orbital decay and circularization due\nto tidal dissipation in the stars. Here we explore the orbital evolution of\nplanets around binaries undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. We show\nthat planets may survive and become misaligned from their host binary, or may\ndevelop erratic behavior in eccentricity, resulting in their consumption by the\nstars or ejection from the system as the binary decays. Our results suggest\nthat circumbinary planets around compact binaries could still exist, and we\noffer predictions as to what their orbital configurations should be like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 20:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 19:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

This technique is tailored specifically to data from\nthe Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey.\nBecause LAMOST obtains roughly 3000 stellar spectra simultaneously within each\n~5-degree diameter \"plate\" that is observed, we can use the stellar parameters\nof the observed stars to account for the stellar luminosity function and target\nselection effects. This removes biasing assumptions about the underlying\npopulations, both due to predictions of the luminosity function from stellar\nevolution modeling, and from Galactic models of stellar populations along each\nline of sight. Using calibration data of stars with known distances and stellar\nparameters, we show that our method recovers distances for most stars within\n~20%, but with some systematic overestimation of distances to halo giants.

A bulge-disk decomposition\nwas made for each of the thirty published galaxies, and a MOND Poisson solver\nwas used to simultaneously compute, from the baryonic mass distributions, model\nrotation curves and vertical velocity dispersion profiles, which were compared\nto the measured values. The two main free parameters, the stellar disk's\nmass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) and its exponential scale-height ($h_z$), were\nestimated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo modelling. The average best-fit K-band\nstellar mass-to-light ratio was $M/L \\simeq 0.55 \\pm 0.15$. However, to match\nthe DiskMass Survey data, the vertical scale-heights would have to be in the\nrange $h_z=200$ to $400$ pc which is a factor of two lower than those derived\nfrom observations of edge-on galaxies with a similar scale-length. The reason\nis that modified gravity versions of MOND characteristically require a larger\n$M/L$ to fit the rotation curve in the absence of dark matter and therefore\npredict a stronger vertical gravitational field than Newtonian models. It was\nfound that changing the MOND acceleration parameter, the shape of the velocity\ndispersion ellipsoid, the adopted vertical distribution of stars, as well as\nthe galaxy inclination, within any realistic range, all had little impact on\nthese results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 20:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

Crucial ingredients of this connection are scale factor\nmatrices relating each distinct quark-level substructure (e.g.,\nquark-antiquark, four-quark) to its mesonic counterpart. The scale factors and\nmixing angles are combined into a projection matrix to obtain the physical\n(hadronic) projection of the QCD correlation function matrix.

Exact\nsummation also guarantees identical results with parallel and serial\nimplementations, since the exact sum is independent of order. The new methods\nuse variations on the concept of a \"superaccumulator\" - a large fixed-point\nnumber that can exactly represent the sum of any reasonable number of\nfloating-point values. One method uses a \"small\" superaccumulator with\nsixty-seven 64-bit chunks, each with 32-bit overlap with the next chunk,\nallowing carry propagation to be done infrequently. The small superaccumulator\nis used alone when summing a small number of terms. For big summations, a\n\"large\" superaccumulator is used as well. It consists of 4096 64-bit chunks,\none for every possible combination of exponent bits and sign bit, plus counts\nof when each chunk needs to be transferred to the small superaccumulator. To\nadd a term to the large superaccumulator, only a single chunk and its\nassociated count need to be updated, which takes very few instructions if\ncarefully implemented. On modern 64-bit processors, exactly summing a large\narray using this combination of large and small superaccumulators takes less\nthan twice the time of simple, inexact, ordered summation, with a serial\nimplementation. A parallel implementation using a small number of processor\ncores can be expected to perform exact summation of large arrays at a speed\nthat reaches the limit imposed by memory bandwidth. Some common methods that\nattempt to improve accuracy without being exact may therefore be pointless, at\nleast for large summations, since they are slower than computing the sum\nexactly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 01:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

The system exhibits its non-trivial topology by developing edge\nlocalized quasi-energy states which lie in a gap of the quasi energy spectrum.\nThese states represent a non-equilibrium analogue of the topologically\nprotected edge-states in equilibrium topological insulators. In equilibrium\nthese edge-states lead to very specific transport properties, in particular the\ntwo-terminal conductivity of these systems is $2e^2/h$. Here we explore the\ntransport properties of the edge-states in a Floquet topological insulator. In\nstark contrast to the equilibrium result, we find that the two terminal\nconductivity of these edge states is significantly different from $2e^2/h$.\nThis fact notwithstanding, we find that for certain external potential\nstrengths the conductivity is smaller than $2e^2/h$ and robust to the effects\nof disorder and smooth changes to the Hamiltonian's parameters.

We use\nthis expression to derive, in a closed form, the DRF of several cyclostationary\nprocesses arising in practice. We first consider the DRF of a combined sampling\nand source coding problem. It is known that the optimal coding strategy for\nthis problem involves source coding applied to a signal with the same structure\nas one resulting from pulse amplitude modulation (PAM). Since a PAM-modulated\nsignal is cyclostationary, our DRF expression can be used to solve for the\nminimal distortion in the combined sampling and source coding problem. We also\nanalyze in more detail the DRF of a source with the same structure as a\nPAM-modulated signal, and show that it is obtained by reverse waterfilling over\nan expression that depends on the energy of the pulse and the baseband process\nmodulated to obtain the PAM signal. This result is then used to study the\ninformation content of a PAM-modulated signal as a function of its symbol time\nrelative to the bandwidth of the underlying baseband process. In addition, we\nalso study the DRF of sources with an amplitude-modulation structure, and show\nthat the DRF of a narrow-band Gaussian stationary process modulated by either a\ndeterministic or a random phase sine-wave equals the DRF of the baseband\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 02:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 17:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

However, except for some\ntheoretical results, such as existence and uniqueness, little progress has been\nmade towards computing IDT on simplicial surfaces. To date the only way for\nconstructing IDTs is the edge-flipping algorithm, which iteratively flips the\nnon-Delaunay edge to be locally Delaunay. Although the algorithm is\nconceptually simple and guarantees to stop in finite steps, it has no known\ntime complexity. Moreover, the edge-flipping algorithm may produce non-regular\ntriangulations, which contain self-loops and/or faces with only two edges. In\nthis paper, we propose a new method for constructing IDT on manifold triangle\nmeshes. Based on the duality of geodesic Voronoi diagrams, our method can\nguarantee the resultant IDTs are regular. Our method has a theoretical\nworst-case time complexity $O(n^2\\log n)$ for a mesh with $n$ vertices.

The first is distance preservers, which are sparse subgraphs that agree\nwith the distances of the original graph on a given set of demand pairs. Prior\nwork on distance preservers has exploited only a simple structural property of\nshortest paths, called consistency, stating that one can break shortest path\nties such that no two paths intersect, split apart, and then intersect again\nlater. We prove that consistency alone is not enough to understand distance\npreservers, by showing both a lower bound on the power of consistency and a new\ngeneral upper bound that polynomially surpasses it. Specifically, our new upper\nbound is that any $p$ demand pairs in an $n$-node undirected unweighted graph\nhave a distance preserver on $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + np^{1/3})$ edges. We leave a\nconjecture that the right bound is $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + n)$ or better.\n  The second part of this paper leverages these distance preservers in a new\nconstruction of additive spanners, which are subgraphs that preserve all\npairwise distances up to an additive error function.

However, the presence of magneto-dipole interaction\ninfluences the order-disorder transition: depending on the strength of\nmagneto-dipole interaction the transition from the ferromagnetic to the\nsuperparamagnetic state is accompanied either by creation of vortices or\ndomains of opposite magnetization. We show that the temperature hysteresis loop\noccurs due to non-monotonic behavior of exchange interaction versus\ntemperature. The origin of this hysteresis is related to the presence of stable\nmagnetic domains which are robust against thermal fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 05:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

The first is distance preservers, which are sparse subgraphs that agree\nwith the distances of the original graph on a given set of demand pairs. Prior\nwork on distance preservers has exploited only a simple structural property of\nshortest paths, called consistency, stating that one can break shortest path\nties such that no two paths intersect, split apart, and then intersect again\nlater. We prove that consistency alone is not enough to understand distance\npreservers, by showing both a lower bound on the power of consistency and a new\ngeneral upper bound that polynomially surpasses it. Specifically, our new upper\nbound is that any $p$ demand pairs in an $n$-node undirected unweighted graph\nhave a distance preserver on $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + np^{1/3})$ edges. We leave a\nconjecture that the right bound is $O(n^{2/3}p^{2/3} + n)$ or better.\n  The second part of this paper leverages these distance preservers in a new\nconstruction of additive spanners, which are subgraphs that preserve all\npairwise distances up to an additive error function. We give improved error\nbounds for spanners with relatively few edges; for example, we prove that all\ngraphs have spanners on $O(n)$ edges with $+O(n^{3/7 + \\varepsilon})$ error.\nOur construction can be viewed as an extension of the popular path-buying\nframework to clusters of larger radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 07:35:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 16:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

We believe that 3D models have\nthe potential in generating a large number of images of high variation, which\ncan be well exploited by deep CNN with a high learning capacity. Towards this\ngoal, we propose a scalable and overfit-resistant image synthesis pipeline,\ntogether with a novel CNN specifically tailored for the viewpoint estimation\ntask. Experimentally, we show that the viewpoint estimation from our pipeline\ncan significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL 3D+ benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 08:16:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

Species\nclimatic preferences were derived from their current distributions using\nclassification trees while habitats preferences were derived from the Red Data\nBook of the Flora of Cyprus.

Pseudo-streamers or unipolar\nstreamer are coronal structures which separate coronal holes of the same\npolarity, without a current sheet in the outer corona; unlike bipolar streamer\nthat separate coronal holes of opposite magnetic polarity. In this study, two\nexamples of these structures have been identified in the period of Carrington\nrotation 2067, by applying a potential-field source-surface extrapolation of\nthe photospheric field measurements. We present a spectroscopic analysis of a\npseudo-streamer and a bipolar streamer observed in the period 12-17 March 2008\nat high spectral and spatial resolution by the Ultraviolet Coronagraph\nSpectrometer (UVCS; Kohl et al., 1995) onboard Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO).

The results of the\nanalysis show some peculiarities of the pseudo-streamer physical parameters in\ncomparison with those obtained for bipolar streamers: in particular, we have\nfound higher kinetic temperature and higher outflow velocities of O VI ions and\nlower electron density values. In conclusion, we point out that\npseudo-streamers produce a \"hybrid\" type of outflow that is intermediate\nbetween slow and fast solar wind and they are a possible source of slow/fast\nwind in not dipolar solar magnetic field configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 09:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

In this work, an anisotropic non-singular elastic\nrepresentation of dislocation fields is developed to accurately represent the\nnear-core stresses of dislocations in $\\alpha$-iron.

Using a novel magnetic bond-order potential to model atomic\ninteractions in iron, molecular statics calculations are performed, and an\noptimization procedure is developed to extract the required length parameter.\nResults show the method can accurately replicate the magnitude and decay of the\nnear-core dislocation stresses even for atoms belonging to the core itself.\nComparisons with the singular isotropic and anisotropic theories show the\nnon-singular anisotropic theory leads to a substantially more accurate\nrepresentation of the stresses of both screw and edge dislocations near the\ncore, in some cases showing improvements in accuracy of up to an order of\nmagnitude. The spatial extent of the region in which the singular and\nnon-singular stress differ substantially is also discussed. The general\nprocedure we describe may in principle be applied to accurately model the\nnear-core dislocation stresses of any arbitrarily shaped dislocation in\nanisotropic cubic media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 09:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

Such an\nevolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient\nclimate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for\nenhanced carbon sequestration. With an infinitely long sequence of even-aged\nforest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due\nto the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore\nalso involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and\nallow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of\nforest rotations.\n  Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land,\nthe initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length\nof the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters,\nthe optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is\nreleased to the atmosphere upon harvest. This effect is not, however, entirely\nmonotonous. Consequently, the currently optimal harvest ages are generally\nlower with higher rates of carbon price increase. This creates an interesting\ntemporal aspect, suggesting that the supply of wood and carbon sequestration by\nforests can change considerably during subsequent rotations under an increasing\nprice on carbon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 10:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 08:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

These emergent behaviours can be verified to\nassess their correctness, through techniques like model checking. Model\nchecking exhaustively explores all possible behaviours, based on a discrete\nmodel of the system, such as a swarm in a grid. A common problem in model\nchecking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model\nare numerous. We propose a novel implementation of symmetry reduction, in the\nform of encoding navigation algorithms relatively with respect to a reference,\nbased on the symmetrical properties of swarms in grids. We applied the relative\nencoding to a swarm navigation algorithm, Alpha, modelled for the NuSMV model\nchecker. A comparison of the state-space and verification results with an\nabsolute (or global) and a relative encoding of the Alpha algorithm highlights\nthe advantages of our approach, allowing model checking larger grid sizes and\nnumber of robots, and consequently, verifying more complex emergent behaviours.\nFor example, a property was verified for a grid with 3 robots and a maximum\nallowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased\nto 16x16 using a relative encoding. Also, the time to verify a property for a\nswarm of 3 robots in a 6x6 grid was reduced from almost 10 hours to only 7\nminutes. Our approach is transferable to other swarm navigation algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 12:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 14:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

In order to understand the\nnature of this tangled web of magnetic fields, its magnetic skeleton, which\nforms the boundaries between topologically distinct flux domains, may be\ndetermined. The magnetic skeleton consists of null points, separatrix surfaces,\nspines and separators. The skeleton is often used to clearly visualize key\nelements of the magnetic configuration, but parts of the skeleton are also\nlocations where currents and waves may collect and dissipate.\n  In this review, the nature of the magnetic skeleton on both global and local\nscales, over solar cycle time scales, is explained. The behaviour of wave\npulses in the vicinity of both nulls and separators is discussed and so too is\nthe formation of current layers and reconnection at the same features. Each of\nthese processes leads to heating of the solar atmosphere, but collectively do\nthey provide enough heat, spread over a wide enough area, to explain the energy\nlosses throughout the solar atmosphere? Here, we consider this question for the\nthree different solar regions: active regions, open-field regions and the quiet\nSun.\n  We find that the heating of active regions and open-field regions is highly\nunlikely to be due to reconnection or wave dissipation at topological features,\nbut it is possible that these may play a role in the heating of the quiet Sun.\nIn active regions, the absence of a complex topology may play an important role\nin allowing large energies to build up and then, subsequently, be explosively\nreleased in the form of a solar flare. Additionally, knowledge of the intricate\nboundaries of open-field regions (which the magnetic skeleton provides) could\nbe very important in determining the main acceleration mechanism(s) of the\nsolar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 12:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

Until recently, it has been cost\nprohibitive to determine the asymptotic limit of key energetic and structural\nproperties with respect to increasingly large QM regions. Leveraging recent\nadvances in electronic structure efficiency and accuracy, we investigate\ncatalytic properties in catechol O-methyltransferase, a representative example\nof a methyltransferase critical to human health. Using QM regions ranging in\nsize from reactants-only (64 atoms) to nearly one-third of the entire protein\n(940 atoms), we show that properties such as the activation energy approach\nwithin chemical accuracy of the large-QM asymptotic limits rather slowly,\nrequiring approximately 500-600 atoms if the QM residues are chosen simply by\ndistance from the substrate. This slow approach to asymptotic limit is due to\ncharge transfer from protein residues to the reacting substrates. Our large\nQM/MM calculations enable identification of charge separation for fragments in\nthe transition state as a key component of enzymatic methyl transfer rate\nenhancement. We introduce charge shift analysis that reveals the minimum number\nof protein residues (ca. 11-16 residues or 200-300 atoms for COMT) needed for\nquantitative agreement with large-QM simulations. The identified residues are\nnot those that would be typically selected using criteria such as chemical\nintuition or proximity.

We found that the non-Markovianity dynamics in different time\nscale crucially depends on the system-environment coupling strength and other\nphysical parameters such as the initial temperature of the environment and the\ninitial state of the system. In particular, we obtain the short-time and\nlong-time behaviors of non-Markovianity for different spectral densities. We\nalso find that the thermal fluctuation always reduce the non-Markovian memory\neffect. Also, the non-Markovianity measure shows non-trivial initial state\ndependence in different time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 14:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Low- and intermediate-mass stars lose copious amounts of mass during\nthe asymptotic giant branch (AGB) which obscure the central star making it\ndifficult to study the stellar spectra and determine the stellar mass. In this\nstudy, we present observational data that can be used to determine lower limits\nto the stellar mass. Method: Spectra of nine heavily reddened AGB stars taken\nby the Herschel Space Observatory display numerous molecular emission lines.\nThe strongest emission lines are due to H2O. We search for the presence of\nisotopologues of H2O in these objects. Result: We detected the 16O and 17O\nisotopologues of water in these stars, but lines due to H2^{18}O are absent.\nThe lack of 18O is predicted by a scenario where the star has undergone\nhot-bottom burning which preferentially destroys 18O relative to 16O and 17O.\nFrom stellar evolution calculations, this process is thought to occur when the\nstellar mass is above 5 Msun for solar metallicity. Hence, observations of\ndifferent isotopologues of H2O can be used to help determine the lower limit to\nthe initial stellar mass. Conclusion: From our observations, we deduce that\nthese extreme OH/IR stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses of >= 5 Msun.\nTheir high mass-loss rates of ~ 1.0e-4 Msun/yr may affect the enrichment of the\ninterstellar medium and the overall chemical evolution of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 14:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 10:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The largest difference in\nconductivity of approximately 20% was observed at a porosity of around 30%.\nThis crystal structure dependent thermal conductivity can be understood by\nconsidering the local heat flux disorder created by a staggered hole structure.\nNumerical simulation using the Monte Carlo technique was also employed and also\nshowed the lower thermal conductivity for a triangular lattice structure.\nBesides gaining a deeper understanding of nanoscale thermal phonon transport,\nthis information would be useful in the design of highly efficient\nthermoelectric materials created by nanopatterning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 15:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

In this work, a network coding tree algorithm which enhances\nthe efficiency of the multiple access system (MAS) is presented. For MAS,\nexisting works tried to avoid the collisions while collisions happen frequently\nunder heavy load. By introducing network coding to MAS, our proposed algorithm\nachieves a better performance of throughput and delay.

It\nrequires undamaged packets, while the packets which were not lost are usually\ndamaged in real scenarios. Hence, an additional error correction layer is often\nrequired: adding some level of redundancy to each packet to be able to repair\neventual damages. This approach requires a priori knowledge of the final damage\nlevel of every packet - insufficient redundancy leads to packet loss,\noverprotection means suboptimal channel rate. However, the sender may have\ninaccurate or even no a priori information about the final damage levels, for\nexample in applications like broadcasting, degradation of a storage medium or\ndamage of picture watermarking.\n  Joint Reconstruction Codes (JRC) setting is introduced and discussed in this\npaper for the purpose of removing the need of a priori knowledge of damage\nlevel and sub-optimality caused by overprotection and discarding underprotected\npackets. It is obtained by combining both processes: reconstruction from\nmultiple packets and forward error correction. The decoder combines the\nresultant informational content of all received packets accordingly to their\nactual noise level, which can be estimated a posteriori individually for each\npacket. Assuming binary symmetric channel (BSC) of $\\epsilon$ bit-flip\nprobability, every potentially damaged bit carries\n$R_0(\\epsilon)=1-h_1(\\epsilon)$ bits of information, where $h_1$ is the Shannon\nentropy. The minimal requirement to fully reconstruct the message is that the\nsum of rate $R_0(\\epsilon)$ over all bits is at least the size of the message.\nWe will discuss sequential decoding for the reconstruction purpose, which\nstatistical behavior can be estimated using Renyi entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 17:28:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 16:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

This uncertainty is associated with the task of synchronizing the\nspike trains of different duration representing different words. The\nuncertainty involves peculiar quantum features, so that word comparison amounts\nto measurement-based-quantum computation. Such a quantum behavior explains the\nonset and decay of the memory window connecting successive pieces of a\nlinguistic text. The behavior here discussed is applicable to other reported\nevidences of quantum effects in human linguistic processes, so far lacking a\nplausible framework, since either no efforts to assign an appropriate quantum\nconstant had been associated or speculating on microscopic processes dependent\non Planck's constant resulted in unrealistic decoherence times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 13:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

In\nthe SPA model, nodes are embedded in a metric space, and each node has a sphere\nof influence whose size increases if the node gains an in-link, and otherwise\ndecreases with time. In this paper, we study the behaviour of the SPA model\nwhen the distribution of the nodes is non-uniform. Specifically, the space is\ndivided into dense and sparse regions, where it is assumed that the dense\nregions correspond to coherent communities. We prove precise theoretical\nresults regarding the degree of a node, the number of common neighbours, and\nthe average out-degree in a region. Moreover, we show how these theoretically\nderived results about the graph properties of the model can be used to\nformulate a reliable estimator for the distance between certain pairs of nodes,\nand to estimate the density of the region containing a given node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 00:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
