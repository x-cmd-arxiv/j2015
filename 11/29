We explore the possibility that such an excess\ncan arise from a $Z'$ boson which acquires mass through a $U(1)_X$ Stueckelberg\nextension. The corresponding $Z'$ gauge boson is leptophobic with a mass of\naround 2 TeV and has interactions with $SU(2)_L$ Yang-Mills fields and gauge\nfields of the hypercharge. The analysis predicts $Z'$ decays into $WW$ and $ZZ$\nas well as into $Z\\gamma$. Further three-body as well as four-body decays of\nthe $Z'$ such as $WWZ, WW\\gamma, WWZZ$ etc are predicted. In the analysis we\nuse the helicity formalism which allows us to exhibit the helicity structure of\nthe $Z'$ decay processes in an transparent manner. In particular, we are able\nto show the set of vanishing helicity amplitudes in the decay of the massive\n$Z'$ into two vector bosons due to angular momentum conservation with a special\nchoice of the reference momenta.

The proposed approach tackles the\ndesign problems through solving a dominating set problem on the power network\ngraph. A combined branch-decomposition and dynamic programming procedure is\napplied to solve the dominating set problem. Contrary to standard integer\nprogramming and heuristic/evolutionary approaches for power network design, the\nproposed approach is exact and requires only polynomial computation time if the\ngraph is planar and has small branch-width. A planarization technique is\nexplored for problem instances with nonplanar graphs. A case study in this\npaper with benchmark power networks verifies that planarity and small\nbranch-width are not uncommon in practice. The case study also indicates that\nthe proposed method shows promise in computation efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 20:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 14:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

This collaborative representation is then\nused to label the test sample. It was a common belief that sparseness of the\nrepresentation is the key to success for this classification scheme. However,\nmore recently, it has been claimed that it is the collaboration and not the\nsparseness that makes the scheme effective. This claim is attractive as it\nallows to relinquish the computationally expensive sparsity constraint over the\nrepresentation. In this paper, we first extend the analysis supporting this\nclaim and then show that sparseness explicitly contributes to improved\nclassification, hence it should not be completely ignored for computational\ngains. Inspired by this result, we augment a dense collaborative representation\nwith a sparse representation and propose an efficient classification method\nthat capitalizes on the resulting representation.

This can result in inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI), which can have degrading effects on performance.

The main idea is originated from the\nfundamental duality between the sparsity in the primary space and the\nlow-rankness of a structured matrix in the spectral domain, which shows that a\nlow-rank interpolator in the spectral domain can enjoy all the benefit of\nsparse recovery with performance guarantees.

Although Suzaku does not spatially\nresolve the SN ejecta from the swept-up ISM due to the limited angular\nresolution, its excellent energy resolution has enabled clear separation of\nemission lines in the soft X-ray band. This leads to the finding that the\n`spatially-integrated' spectra of the evolved (~10^4 yr) SNRs are still\nsignificantly contributed by emission from the ejecta at the energies around 1\nkeV. The Fe/Ne mass ratios, determined mainly from the well-resolved Fe L-shell\nand Ne K-shell lines, clearly divide the observed SNRs into the Type Ia and\ncore-collapse groups, confirming some previous typing made by Chandra\nobservations that had utilized its extremely high angular resolution.

In that framework, the viscous\nstresses are computed from the so-called distortion tensor A, which is one of\nthe primary state variables. A very important key feature of the model is its\nability to describe at the same time the behavior of inviscid and viscous\ncompressible Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids with heat conduction, as well\nas the behavior of elastic and visco-plastic solids. This is achieved via a\nstiff source term that accounts for strain relaxation in the evolution\nequations of A. Also heat conduction is included via a first order hyperbolic\nevolution equation of the thermal impulse, from which the heat flux is\ncomputed. The governing PDE system is hyperbolic and fully consistent with the\nprinciples of thermodynamics. It is also fundamentally different from first\norder Maxwell-Cattaneo-type relaxation models based on extended irreversible\nthermodynamics. The connection between the HPR model and the classical\nhyperbolic-parabolic Navier-Stokes-Fourier theory is established via a formal\nasymptotic analysis in the stiff relaxation limit. From a numerical point of\nview, the governing partial differential equations are very challenging, since\nthey form a large nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that includes stiff source\nterms and non-conservative products. We apply the successful family of one-step\nADER-WENO finite volume and ADER discontinuous Galerkin finite element schemes\nin the stiff relaxation limit, and compare the numerical results with exact or\nnumerical reference solutions obtained for the Euler and Navier-Stokes\nequations.

However,\ncentralized signal processing in C-RANs involves high computational complexity\nthat quickly becomes unaffordable when the network grows to a huge size. Among\nthe first, this paper endeavours to design a scalable uplink signal detection\nalgorithm, in the sense that both the complexity per unit network area and the\ntotal computation time remain constant when the network size grows. To this\nend, we formulate the signal detection in C-RAN as an inference problem over a\nbipartite random geometric graph. By passing messages among neighboring nodes,\nmessage passing (a.k.a. belief propagation) provides an efficient way to solve\nthe inference problem over a sparse graph. However, the traditional\nmessage-passing algorithm is not guaranteed to converge, because the\ncorresponding bipartite random geometric graph is locally dense and contains\nmany short loops. As a major contribution of this paper, we propose a\nrandomized Gaussian message passing (RGMP) algorithm to improve the\nconvergence. Instead of exchanging messages simultaneously or in a fixed order,\nwe propose to exchange messages asynchronously in a random order. The proposed\nRGMP algorithm demonstrates significantly better convergence performance than\nconventional message passing. The randomness of the message update schedule\nalso simplifies the analysis, and allows the derivation of the convergence\nconditions for the RGMP algorithm. In addition, we propose a blockwise RGMP\n(B-RGMP) algorithm for practical implementation. The average computation time\nof B-RGMP remains constant when the network size increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2015 15:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 02:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 23:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 06:14:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 08:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}
