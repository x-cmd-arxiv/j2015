Objects like these are prime\ncandidates to be the source of the highest-energy cosmic rays, and thus of\nassociated neutrino emission. We present an analysis of neutrino emission from\nthe six blazars using observations with the ANTARES neutrino telescope.The\nstandard methods of the ANTARES candidate list search are applied to six years\nof data to search for an excess of muons --- and hence their neutrino\nprogenitors --- from the directions of the six blazars described by the TANAMI\nCollaboration, and which are possibly associated with two IceCube events. Monte\nCarlo simulations of the detector response to both signal and background\nparticle fluxes are used to estimate the sensitivity of this analysis for\ndifferent possible source neutrino spectra. A maximum-likelihood approach,\nusing the reconstructed energies and arrival directions of through-going muons,\nis used to identify events with properties consistent with a blazar origin.Both\nblazars predicted to be the most neutrino-bright in the TANAMI sample\n(1653$-$329 and 1714$-$336) have a signal flux fitted by the likelihood\nanalysis corresponding to approximately one event. This observation is\nconsistent with the blazar-origin hypothesis of the IceCube event IC14 for a\nbroad range of blazar spectra, although an atmospheric origin cannot be\nexcluded. No ANTARES events are observed from any of the other four blazars,\nincluding the three associated with IceCube event IC20.

A clear elucidation of how death ligands activate the type\n1 and type 2 apoptotic pathways in healthy and cancer cells may help develop\nbetter chemotherapeutic strategies. In this work, we use kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations to address the problem of type 1/ type 2 choice in death ligand\nmediated apoptosis of cancer cells.

Increased concentration of death ligands\nfrequently increased the type 1 activation fraction in cancer cells, and, in\ncertain cases changes the signaling phenotype from type 2 to type 1. Results of\nthis study also indicate that inherent differences between cancer and healthy\ncells, such as in the membrane module, may allow robust activation of cancer\ncell apoptosis by death ligand induction.

These models have many useful properties, but their fundamental\nattractive feature is their ability to reflect conditional independences\nbetween blocks of variables through graph separation, a consequence of the\nequivalence of the pairwise, local and global Markov properties demonstrated by\nPearl and Paz (1985). Modern day applications often necessitate working with\neither an infinite collection of variables (such as in a spatial-temporal\nfield) or approximating a large high-dimensional finite stochastic system with\nan infinite-dimensional system. However, it is unclear whether the conditional\nindependences present in an infinite-dimensional random vector or stochastic\nprocess can still be represented by separation criteria in an infinite graph.\nIn light of the advantages of using graphs as tools to represent stochastic\nrelationships, we undertake in this paper a general study of infinite graphical\nmodels. First, we demonstrate that naive extensions of the assumptions required\nfor the finite case results do not yield equivalence of the Markov properties\nin the infinite-dimensional setting, thus calling for a more in-depth analysis.\nTo this end, we proceed to derive general conditions which do allow\nrepresenting the conditional independence in an infinite-dimensional random\nsystem by means of graphs, and our results render the result of Pearl and Paz\nas a special case of a more general phenomenon. We conclude by demonstrating\nthe applicability of our theory through concrete examples of\ninfinite-dimensional graphical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 18:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

We characterized the A:a and\nB:b knob-hole interactions under varying solution conditions using Molecular\nDynamics simulations of the structural models of fibrin(ogen) fragment D\ncomplexed with synthetic peptides GPRP (knob 'A' mimetic) and GHRP (knob 'B'\nmimetic). The strength of A:a and B:b knob-hole complexes was roughly equal,\ndecreasing with pulling force; yet, the dissociation kinetics were sensitive to\nvariations in acidity (pH=5-7) and temperature (T=25-37 C). There were similar\nstructural changes in holes 'a' and 'b' during forced dissociation of the\nknob-hole complexes: elongation of loop I, stretching of interior region, and\ntranslocation of the moveable flap. The disruption of the knob-hole\ninteractions was not an \"all-or-none\" transition, as it occurred through\ndistinct two-step or single-step pathways with or without intermediate states.\nThe knob-hole bonds were stronger, tighter, and more brittle at pH=7 than at\npH=5. The B:b knob-hole bonds were weaker, looser, and more compliant than the\nA:a knob-hole bonds at pH=7, but stronger, tighter, and less compliant at pH=5.\nSurprisingly, the knob-hole bonds were stronger, not weaker, at elevated\ntemperature (T=37 C) compared to T=25 C due to the helix-to-coil transition in\nloop I, which helps stabilize the bonds. These results provide detailed\nqualitative and quantitative characteristics underlying the most significant\nnon-covalent interactions involved in fibrin polymerization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 20:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

The substrate has the tendency to localize or repel the interface at\ndifferent sites and one can show that a localization-delocalization transition\ntakes place when varying the average pinning potential $h$: the free energy\ndensity is zero in the delocalized regime, that is for $h$ smaller than a\nthreshold $h_c$, and it is positive for $h>h_c$.

If sufficient radiative acceleration is exerted on\nthe newly formed grains through absorption or scattering of stellar photons, an\noutflow can be triggered. Strong candidates for wind-driving dust species in\nM-type AGB stars are magnesium silicates (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ and MgSiO$_3$).

Detecting and describing\ndynamic couplings between structural regions is difficult in view of the\nmany-body nature of protein-protein interactions. By utilizing the GPU-based\ncomputational acceleration, we carried out simulations of the protein forced\nunfolding for the dimer WW-WW of the all-beta-sheet WW domains used as a model\nmultidomain protein. We found that while the physically non-interacting\nidentical protein domains (WW) show nearly symmetric mechanical properties at\nlow tension, reflected, e.g., in the similarity of their distributions of\nunfolding times, these properties become distinctly different when tension is\nincreased. Moreover, the uncorrelated unfolding transitions at a low pulling\nforce become increasingly more correlated (dependent) at higher forces. Hence,\nthe applied force not only breaks \"the mechanical symmetry\" but also couples\nthe physically non-interacting protein domains forming a multi-domain protein.\nWe call this effect \"the topological coupling\". We developed a new theory,\ninspired by Order statistics, to characterize protein-protein interactions in\nmulti-domain proteins. The method utilizes the squared-Gaussian model, but it\ncan also be used in conjunction with other parametric models for the\ndistribution of unfolding times. The formalism can be taken to the\nsingle-molecule experimental lab to probe mechanical cooperativity and domain\ncommunication in multi-domain proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 22:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

Our data mark the first\nmultiple-band mm & sub-mm observations of a BHXRB. During our observations the\nsystem was in the hard accretion state producing a steady, compact jet. The\nunique combination of radio and mm/sub-mm data allows us to directly measure\nthe spectral indices in and between the radio and mm/sub-mm regimes, including\nthe first mm/sub-mm spectral index measured for a BHXRB. Spectral fitting\nrevealed that both the mm (230 GHz) and sub-mm (350 GHz) measurements are\nconsistent with extrapolations of an inverted power-law from contemporaneous\nradio data (1--30 GHz). This indicates that, as standard jet models predict, a\npower-law extending up to mm/sub-mm frequencies can adequately describe the\nspectrum, and suggests that the mechanism driving spectral inversion could be\nresponsible for the high mm/sub-mm fluxes (compared to radio fluxes) observed\nin outbursting BHXRBs.

These messages contain position, speed,\nheading, and other vital information that makes the vehicles aware of their\nsurroundings. The drawback of exchanging periodic cooperative messages is that\nthey generate significant channel load. Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC)\nalgorithms have been proposed to minimize the channel load. However, while the\nrationale for periodic message exchange is to improve awareness, existing DCC\nalgorithms do not use awareness as a metric for deciding when, at what power,\nand at what rate the periodic messages need to be sent in order to make sure\nall vehicles are informed. We propose an environment- and context-aware DCC\nalgorithm combines power and rate control in order to improve cooperative\nawareness by adapting to both specific propagation environments (e.g., urban\nintersections, open highways, suburban roads) as well as application\nrequirements (e.g., different target cooperative awareness range). Studying\nvarious operational conditions (e.g., speed, direction, and application\nrequirement), ECPR adjusts the transmit power of the messages in order to reach\nthe desired awareness ratio at the target distance while at the same time\ncontrolling the channel load using an adaptive rate control algorithm. By\nperforming extensive simulations, including realistic propagation as well as\nenvironment modeling and realistic vehicle operational environments (varying\ndemand on both awareness range and rate), we show that ECPR can increase\nawareness by 20% while keeping the channel load and interference at almost the\nsame level.

Specifically, the random matrix theories (RMTs) are introduced as\nthe statistical foundations for random matrix models (RMMs); based on the RMMs,\nlinear eigenvalue statistics (LESs) are defined via the test functions as the\nsystem indicators. By comparing the values of the LES between the experimental\nand the theoretical ones, the anomaly detection is conducted. Furthermore, we\ndevelop 3D power-map to visualize the LES; it provides a robust auxiliary\ndecision-making mechanism to the operators. In this sense, the proposed method\nconducts EED with a pure statistical procedure, requiring no knowledge of\nsystem topologies, unit operation/control models, etc. The LES, as a key\ningredient during this procedure, is a high dimensional indictor derived\ndirectly from raw data. As an unsupervised learning indicator, the LES is much\nmore sensitive than the low dimensional indictors obtained from supervised\nlearning. With the statistical procedure, the proposed method is universal and\nfast; moreover, it is robust against traditional EED challenges (such as error\naccumulations, spurious correlations, and even bad data in core area). Case\nstudies, with both simulated data and real ones, validate the proposed method.\nTo manage large-scale distributed systems, data fusion is mentioned as another\ndata processing ingredient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 03:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 05:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Unlike the\nstate-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms which impose sparsity\nconstraints on a sample-by-sample basis, we instead treat the samples as a\nbatch, and impose the sparsity constraint on the whole. The benefit of\nbatchwise optimization is that the non-zeros can be better allocated across the\nsamples, leading to a better approximation of the whole. To accomplish this, we\npropose procedures to switch non-zeros in both rows and columns in the support\nof the coefficient matrix to reduce the reconstruction error. We prove in the\nproposed support switching procedure the objective of the algorithm, i.e., the\nreconstruction error, decreases monotonically and converges.

In\nparticular, it allows fault-free nodes to exploit the benefits of a broadcast\nchannel (a feature from reliable broadcast model) and allows faulty nodes to\nsend mismatching messages to different neighbors (a feature from point-to-point\nmodel) simultaneously. The {\\em selective broadcast} model is motivated by the\npotential for {\\em directional} transmissions on a wireless channel.\n  We provide a collection of results for a single-hop wireless network under\nthe new model. First, we present an algorithm for {\\em Multi-Valued} BB that is\norder-optimal in bit complexity. Then, we provide an algorithm that is designed\nto achieve BB efficiently in terms of message complexity. Third, we determine\nsome lower bounds on both bit and message complexities of BB problems in the\n{\\em selective broadcast model}. Finally, we present a conjecture on an \"exact\"\nlower bound on the bit complexity of BB under the {\\em selective broadcast}\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 06:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

The standard trellis based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm is\nused for turbo decoding.

Selecting the Bunch -Davies vacuum for a massless scalar field\nimplies a mixed reduced density matrix in a hyperbolic section of de Sitter\nspace. We stress that in the Bunch -Davies state the hyperbolic de Sitter\n$n$-point correlation functions have to match the planar de Sitter $n$-point\ncorrelation functions. The expressions for the planar and hyperbolic Bunch\n-Davies correlation functions only appear different because of the\ntransformation from planar to hyperbolic coordinates. Initial state induced\ndeviations from the standard inflationary predictions are instead obtained by\nconsidering the pure hyperbolic vacuum, as we verify explicitly by computing\nthe power - and bi -spectrum.

Due to the broadcast nature of radio\nwave propagation, the wireless transmission from the sensors to the sink can be\nreadily overheard by the eavesdropper for interception purposes. In an\ninformation-theoretic sense, the secrecy capacity of the wireless transmission\nis the difference between the channel capacity of the main link (from sensor to\nsink) and that of the wiretap link (from sensor to eavesdropper). If the\nsecrecy capacity becomes non-positive due to the wireless fading effect, the\nsensor's data transmission could be successfully intercepted by the\neavesdropper and an intercept event occurs in this case. However, in industrial\nenvironments, the presence of machinery obstacles, metallic frictions and\nengine vibrations makes the wireless fading fluctuate drastically, resulting in\nthe degradation of the secrecy capacity. As a consequence, an optimal sensor\nscheduling scheme is proposed in this paper to protect the legitimate wireless\ntransmission against the eavesdropping attack, where a sensor with the highest\nsecrecy capacity is scheduled to transmit its sensed information to the sink.\nClosed-form expressions of the probability of occurrence of an intercept event\n(called intercept probability) are derived for the conventional round-robin\nscheduling and the proposed optimal scheduling schemes. Also, an asymptotic\nintercept probability analysis is conducted to provide an insight into the\nimpact of the sensor scheduling on the wireless security. Numerical results\ndemonstrate that the proposed sensor scheduling scheme outperforms the\nconventional round-robin scheduling in terms of the intercept probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 14:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

In a\nsecond step, the 2-particle-irreducible formalism is applied: This formalism\nallows for a numerical evaluation of the hydrodynamic parameters for all\ntemperatures below the critical temperature.

However, while the ergodic capacity and instantaneous capacity of\na wireless channel have been extensively studied, they are in many cases not\nsufficient for use in assessing if data transmission over the channel meets the\nquality of service (QoS) requirements. To address this limitation, we advocate\na set of wireless channel capacity concepts, namely \"cumulative capacity\",\n\"maximum cumulative capacity\", \"minimum cumulative capacity\", and \"range of\ncumulative capacity\", and for each, study its properties by taking into\nconsideration the impact of the underlying dependence structure of the\ncorresponding stochastic process. Specifically, their cumulative distribution\nfunction (CDFs) are investigated extensively, where copula is adopted to\nexpress the dependence structures. Results considering both generic and\nspecific dependence structures are derived. In particular, in addition to\ni.i.d., a specially investigated dependence structure is comonotonicity, i.e,\nthe time series of wireless channel capacity are increasing functions of a\ncommon random variable. Appealingly, copula can serve as a unifying technique\nfor obtaining results under various dependence assumptions, e.g. i.i.d. and\nMarkov dependence, which are widely seen in stochastic network calculus.\nMoreover, some other characterizations of cumulative capacity are also studied,\nincluding moment generating function, Mellin transform, and stochastic service\ncurve. With these properties, we believe QoS assessment of data transmission\nover the channel can be further performed, e.g. by applying analytical\ntechniques and results of the stochastic network calculus theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 13:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 20:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}
