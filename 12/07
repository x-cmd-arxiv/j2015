In present case thre are three-waves nonlinear\ninteractions. Using the asymptotic mul- tiscale we deduced nonlinear wave\npackets interaction equations: three magneto-Poincare waves interaction, three\nmagnetostrophic waves inter- action, the interaction of two magneto-Poincare\nand one magnetostrophic wave and two magnetostrophic and one magneto-Poincare\nwave interac- tion. The existence of decay instabilities and parametric\namplifications is predicted. We found following four types of decay\ninstabilities: magneto- Poincare wave decays into two magneto-Poincare waves,\nmagnetostrophic wave decays into two magnetostrophic waves, magneto-Poincare\nwave de- cays into one magneto-Poincare wave and one magnetostrophic wave,\nmagnetostrophic wave decays into one magnetostrophic wave and one\nmagneto-Poincare wave. Also following mechanisms of parametric amplifications\nwere found: parametric amplification of magneto-Poincare waves, parametric\namplification of magnetostrophic waves, magneto-Poincare wave amplification in\nmagnetostrophic wave presence nd magnetostrophic wave amplification in\nmagneto-Poincare wave presence. The instabilities growth rates and parametrical\namplifications factors were found respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 16:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

In this paper, a comprehensive\nframework using deep neural networks to convert both timbre and prosodic\nfeatures is proposed.

The latter allows to solve the problem of the limiting transition\nfrom the quantum region to the region of classical chaotic motion (Poincar\\'e\nregion) without violating the analogue of Arnold's theorem on quantum mapping.\nThe expression characterizing a measure of deviation of the quantum\nprobabilistic currents and thus the appearance of quantum chaos in a dynamical\nsystem is determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 19:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

The losses are accounted by a Rayleigh dissipative function. As we\nhave shown previously, for such a composite system the modes split into two\ndistinct classes, high-loss and low-loss, according to their dissipative\nbehavior. A principal result of this paper is that for any such system a rather\nuniversal phenomenon of selective overdamping occurs. Namely, first of all the\nhigh-loss modes are all overdamped, i.e., non-oscillatory, as are an equal\nnumber of low-loss modes. Second of all, the rest of the low-loss modes remain\noscillatory (i.e., the underdamped modes) each with an extremely high quality\nfactor (Q-factor) that actually increases as the loss of the lossy component\nincreases. We prove that selective overdamping is a generic phenomenon in\nLagrangian systems with gyroscopic forces and give an analysis of the\noverdamping phenomena in such systems. Moreover, using perturbation theory, we\nderive explicit formulas for upper bound estimates on the amount of loss\nrequired in the lossy component of the composite system for the selective\noverdamping to occur in the generic case, and give Q-factor estimates for the\nunderdamped modes. Central to the analysis is the introduction of the notion of\na \"dual\" Lagrangian system and this yields significant improvements on some\nresults on modal dichotomy and overdamping. The effectiveness of the theory\ndeveloped here is demonstrated by applying it to an electric circuit with a\ngyrator element and a high-loss resistor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 20:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

'Classical' GPS/CSS objects are extremely\nluminous radio sources with a compact double morphology, commonly thought to\nrepresent the earliest stages in the life cycle of powerful radio galaxies\n(e.g. O'Dea 1998).

These\nless powerful objects, with typical 1.4 GHz radio luminosities of $10^{23}$ to\n$10^{25}$ W/Hz, include peaked-spectrum radio sources with a core-jet\nmorphology on parsec scales as well as high-frequency GPS-like peaked\ncomponents embedded within lower-frequency extended emission.

These are particularly\nchallenging and necessary when exploring processes that exhibit long-range\ncorrelations. The most common signatures employed rely on second-order temporal\nstatistics and lead, for example, to identifying long memory in processes with\npower-law autocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$.\nHowever, most stochastic processes hide their memory in higher-order temporal\ncorrelations. Information measures---specifically, divergences in the mutual\ninformation between a process' past and future (excess entropy) and minimal\npredictive memory stored in a process' causal states (statistical\ncomplexity)---provide a different way to identify long memory in processes with\nhigher-order temporal correlations. However, there are no ergodic stationary\nprocesses with infinite excess entropy for which information measures have been\ncompared to autocorrelation functions and Hurst exponents. Here, we show that\nfractal renewal processes---those with interevent distribution tails $\\propto\nt^{-\\alpha}$---exhibit long memory via a phase transition at $\\alpha = 1$.\nExcess entropy diverges only there and statistical complexity diverges there\nand for all $\\alpha < 1$. When these processes do have power-law\nautocorrelation function and Hurst exponent greater than $1/2$, they do not\nhave divergent excess entropy. This analysis breaks the intuitive association\nbetween these different quantifications of memory. We hope that the methods\nused here, based on causal states, provide some guide as to how to construct\nand analyze other long memory processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2015 23:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

On the other hand, the expansion rate at different\nepochs, i.e. the observational Hubble parameter data $H(z)$, are obtained from\ndifferential ageing of passively evolving galaxies or from baryon acoustic\noscillations and thus are not affected by cosmic opacity.

In particular, our\nalgorithms compute $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximations of DTW and ED in time\nnear-linear for point sequences drawn from k-packed or k-bounded curves, and\nsubquadratic for backbone sequences. Roughly speaking, a curve is\n$\\kappa$-packed if the length of its intersection with any ball of radius $r$\nis at most $\\kappa \\cdot r$, and a curve is $\\kappa$-bounded if the sub-curve\nbetween two curve points does not go too far from the two points compared to\nthe distance between the two points. In backbone sequences, consecutive points\nare spaced at approximately equal distances apart, and no two points lie very\nclose together. Recent results suggest that a subquadratic algorithm for DTW or\nED is unlikely for an arbitrary pair of point sequences even for $d=1$. Our\nalgorithms work by constructing a small set of rectangular regions that cover\nthe entries of the dynamic programming table commonly used for these distance\nmeasures.

Based on the causality principle and the assumption that the\nusual microwave absorption lineshape around FMR is Lorentzian, general forms of\ndynamic susceptibility of an arbitrary sample and the corresponding dc-voltage\nlineshape are obtained. Our main findings are: 1) The dynamic susceptibility is\nnot a Polder tensor for material with arbitrary anisotropy. Two off-diagonal\nelements are not in general opposite to each other. However, the linear\nresponse coefficient of magnetization to total rf field is a Polder tensor.\nThis may explain why two off-diagonal elements are always assumed to be\nopposite to each other in analyses. 2) The frequency dependence of dynamic\nsusceptibility near FMR is fully characterized by six numbers while its field\ndependence is fully characterized by seven numbers. 3) A recipe of how to\ndetermine these numbers by standard microwave absorption measurements for an\narbitrary sample is proposed. Our results allow one to unambiguously separate\nthe contribution of the anisotropic magnetoresistance to dc-voltage from that\nof the anomalous Hall effect. With these results, one can reliably extract the\ninformation of spin pumping and the inverse spin Hall effect, and determine the\nspin-Hall angle. 4) The field-dependence of susceptibility matrix at a fixed\nfrequency may have several peaks when the effective field is not monotonic of\nthe applied field. In contrast, the frequency-dependence of susceptibility\nmatrix at a fixed field has only one peak. Furthermore, in the case that\nresonance frequency is not sensitive to the applied field, the field dependence\nof susceptibility matrix, as well as dc-voltage, may have another non-resonance\nbroad peak.

However, high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HRTEM) technique provides a limited sensitivity of 0.01 nm on the\nvariation of the lattice spacing and requires vacuum conditions. Here we\ndemonstrate a highly-sensitive detection of the lattice distortion in single\nbent ZnO NWs by second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. As the curvature\nof the single bent ZnO NW increases to 21 mm-1 (<4% bending distortion), it\nshows a significant decrease (~70%) in the SHG intensity ratio between\nperpendicular and parallel excitation polarization with respect to c-axis of\nZnO NWs. Importantly, the extraordinary non-axisymmetrical SHG polarimetric\npatterns are also observed, indicating the twisting distortion around c-axis of\nZnO NWs.

Under- standing of\nalgorithms for their solution has been greatly enhanced by a deep understanding\nof the linear inverse problem. In the applied communities ensemble-based\nfiltering methods have recently been used to solve inverse problems by\nintroducing an artificial dynamical sys- tem. This opens up the possibility of\nusing a range of other filtering methods, such as 3DVAR and Kalman based\nmethods, to solve inverse problems, again by introducing an artificial\ndynamical system. The aim of this paper is to analyze such methods in the\ncontext of the ill-posed linear inverse problem. Statistical linear inverse\nproblems are studied in the sense that the observational noise is assumed to be\nderived via realization of a Gaussian random variable. We investigate the\nasymptotic behavior of filter based methods for these inverse problems.\nRigorous convergence rates are established for 3DVAR and for the Kalman\nfilters, including minimax rates in some instances. Blowup of 3DVAR and a\nvariant of its basic form is also presented, and optimality of the Kalman\nfilter is discussed. These analyses reveal a close connection between\n(iterative) regularization schemes in deterministic inverse problems and filter\nbased methods in data assimilation.

The latter is commonly referred\nto as the Applegate mechanism. Following Brinkworth et al.

The framework is\nemployed to derive the general conditions under which the Applegate mechanism\ncan work, and is subsequently applied to a sample of 16 close binary systems\nwith potential planets, including 11 PCEBs. Further, we present a detailed\nderivation and study of analytical models which allow for an straightforward\nextension to other systems. Using our full numerical framework, we show that\nthe Applegate mechanism can clearly explain the observed eclipsing time\nvariations in 4 of the systems, while the required energy to produce the\nquadrupole moment variations is too high in at least 8 systems. In the\nremaining 4 systems, the required energy is comparable to the available energy\nproduced by the star, which we consider as borderline cases. Therefore, the\nApplegate mechanism cannot uniquely explain the observed period time variations\nfor this entire population. Even in systems where the required energy is too\nhigh, the Applegate mechanism may provide an additional scatter, which needs to\nbe considered in the derivation and analysis of planetary models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 10:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Hyperspectral images can be used to identify chemical plumes,\nhowever the task can be extremely challenging. Assuming we know a priori that\nsome chemical plume, with a known frequency spectrum, has been photographed\nusing a hyperspectral sensor, we can use standard techniques like the so called\nmatched filter or adaptive cosine estimator, plus a properly chosen threshold\nvalue, to identify the position of the chemical plume. However, due to noise\nand sensors fault, the accurate identification of chemical pixels is not easy\neven in this apparently simple situation. In this paper we present a\npost-processing tool that, in a completely adaptive and data driven fashion,\nallows to improve the performance of any classification methods in identifying\nthe boundaries of a plume. This is done using the Multidimensional Iterative\nFiltering (MIF) algorithm (arXiv:1411.6051, arXiv:1507.07173), which is a\nnon-stationary signal decomposition method like the pioneering Empirical Mode\nDecomposition (EMD) method. Moreover, based on the MIF technique, we propose\nalso a pre-processing method that allows to decorrelate and mean-center a\nhyperspectral dataset. The Cosine Similarity measure, which often fails in\npractice, appears to become a successful and outperforming classifier when\nequipped with such pre-processing method.

Recently, an upsurge\nof theoretical inquiry has strived towards rendering the models more realistic\nby incorporating the temporal aspects of networks of contacts, societal and\nonline, that are of interest in the study of epidemics (and other similar\ndiffusion processes). However, temporal dynamics have predominantly focused on\nlink fluctuations and nodal activities, and less attention has been paid to the\ngrowth of the underlying network. Many real networks grow: online networks are\nevidently in constant growth, and societal networks can grow due to migration\nflux and reproduction. The effect of network growth on the epidemic properties\nof networks is hitherto unknown---mainly due to the predominant focus of the\nnetwork growth literature on the so-called steady-state. This paper takes a\nstep towards alleviating this gap. We analytically study the degree dynamics of\na given arbitrary network that is subject to growth. We use the theoretical\nfindings to predict the epidemic properties of the network as a function of\ntime. We observe that the introduction of new individuals into the network can\nenhance or diminish its resilience against endemic outbreaks, and investigate\nhow this regime shift depends upon the connectivity of newcomers and on how\nthey establish connections to existing nodes. Throughout, theoretical findings\nare corroborated with Monte Carlo simulations over synthetic and real networks.\nThe results shed light on the effects of network growth on the future epidemic\nproperties of networks, and offers insights for devising a-priori immunization\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 12:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

An\nextremely large positive diamagnetic coefficient is observed when an electron\nin the wetting layer combines with a hole in the quantum dot; the coefficient\nis nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of the exciton states\nconfined in the quantum dots. Recombination of electrons with holes in a\nquantum dot of the coupled system leads to an unusual negative diamagnetic\neffect, which is five times stronger than that in a pure quantum dot system.\nThis effect can be attributed to the expansion of the wavefunction of remaining\nelectrons in the wetting layer or the spread of electrons in the excited states\nof the quantum dot to the wetting layer after recombination. In this case, the\nwavefunction extent of the final states in the quantum dot plane is much larger\nthan that of the initial states because of the absence of holes in the quantum\ndot to attract electrons.

In this study, using large scale classical, atomistic molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations using TIP4P-Ew and TIP3P models of water, we show\nthat salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), caesium\nchloride (CsCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl$_2$) have a long range effect on\nthe dipolar correlations, which can not be explained by the notion of structure\nmaking and breaking by dissolved ions.

High priority ACs are allowed to transmit more often than low\npriority ACs, providing a way of prioritising delay sensitive traffic like\nvoice calls or video streaming. Further, EDCA also considers the intricacies\nrelated to the management of multiple queues, virtual collisions and traffic\ndifferentiation. Nevertheless, EDCA falls short in efficiency when performing\nin dense WLAN scenarios. Its collision-prone contention mechanism degrades the\noverall throughput to the point of starving low priority ACs, and produce\npriority inversions at high number of contenders.

Contrary to\nEDCA, CSMA/ECA uses a contention mechanism with a deterministic backoff\ntechnique which is capable of constructing collision-free schedules for many\nnodes with multiple active ACs, extending the network capacity without starving\nlow priority ACs, as experienced in EDCA. This work analyses traffic\ndifferentiation with CSMA/ECA by describing the mechanisms used to construct\ncollision-free schedules with multiple queues. Additionally, evaluates the\nperformance under different traffic conditions and a growing number of\ncontenders.

Loop currents and charge ordering are driven by\ndistinct components of the short-range Coulomb interactions: loop currents\nresult from the repulsion between nearest-neighbor copper and oxygen orbitals,\nwhile charge order results from repulsion between neighboring oxygen orbitals.\nWe find that the leading piLC phase has an antiferromagnetic pattern similar to\npreviously discovered staggered flux phases, and that it emerges abruptly at\nhole dopings p below the van Hove filling. Subsequent charge ordering\ntendencies in the piLC phase reveal that diagonal d-charge density waves (dCDW)\nare suppressed by the loop currents while axial order competes more weakly. In\nsome cases we find a wide temperature range below the loop-current transition,\nover which the susceptibility towards an axial dCDW is large. In these cases,\nshort-range axial charge order may be induced by doping-related disorder. A\nunique feature of the coexisting dCDW and piLC phases is the emergence of an\nincommensurate modulation of the loop currents.

By assuming that DL is the regulation mechanism for the\nstellar angular velocity during the early stages of pMS, we use our models and\nobservational data to constrain disk lifetimes (Tdisk) of a sample of low-mass\nstars in the ONC and NGC2264. The period distributions of the ONC and NGC2264\nare bimodal and depend on the stellar mass. To follow the rotational evolution\nof these two clusters' stars, we generated some sets of evolutionary tracks. We\nassumed that the evolution of fast rotators can be modeled by considering\nconservation of AM during all stages and of moderate rotators by considering\nconservation of angular velocity during the first stages of evolution. With\nthese models we estimate a mass and an age for all stars. For the ONC, we\nassume that the secondary peak in the period distribution is due to high-mass\nobjects locked in their disks, with a locking period (Plock) of ~8 days. For\nNGC2264 we make two hypotheses: (1) the stars in the secondary peak are locked\nwith Plock=5 days, and (2) NGC2264 is in a later stage in the rotational\nevolution (this implies in a DL scenario with Plock=8 days, a Tdisk of 1 Myr\nand, after that, constant AM evolution). We simulated the period distribution\nof NGC2264 when its mean age was 1 Myr. Dichotomy and bimodality appear in the\nsimulated distribution, presenting one peak at 2 days and another one at 5-7\ndays, indicating that the assumption of Plock=8 days is plausible. Our\nhypotheses are compared with observational disk diagnoses available in the\nliterature. DL models with Plock=8 days and 0.2 Myr<=Tdisk<=3 Myr are\nconsistent with observed periods of moderate rotators of the ONC.

We prove that this approach allows for a\ncharacterisation of such transitions in a purely group theoretical framework,\nand provide explicit computations and specific examples.

Unfortunately, GPS\ntiming is expected to have an accuracy no better than about 5 ns. In practice,\nin particular in AERA, the GPS clocks exhibit drifts on the order of tens of\nns. We developed a technique to correct for the GPS drifts, and an independent\nmethod is used for cross-checks that indeed we reach nanosecond-scale timing\naccuracy by this correction. First, we operate a \"beacon transmitter\" which\nemits defined sine waves detected by AERA antennas recorded within the physics\ndata. The relative phasing of these sine waves can be used to correct for GPS\nclock drifts. In addition to this, we observe radio pulses emitted by\ncommercial airplanes, the position of which we determine in real time from\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcasts intercepted with a software-defined\nradio. From the known source location and the measured arrival times of the\npulses we determine relative timing offsets between radio detector stations. We\ndemonstrate with a combined analysis that the two methods give a consistent\ntiming calibration with an accuracy of 2 ns or better. Consequently, the beacon\nmethod alone can be used in the future to continuously determine and correct\nfor GPS clock drifts in each individual event measured by AERA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 14:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 11:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

The DNA molecule consists of two\ninterwound strands, the Watson Strand (W) and the Crick Strand (C). The two\nstrands are bonded to each other via a backbone of base-pairings and these\nbonds can be broken by certain enzymes present in the cell. In reproduction of\nDNA the bonds between the two strands are broken and the two strands then\nacquire the needed complementary base molecules from the cellular environment\nto reconstitute each a separate copy of the DNA. At this level the situation\ncan be described by a symbolism like this. DNA = <W|C> -------> <W| E |C>\n--------> <W| |C><W| |C> = <W|C><W|C> = DNA DNA. Here E stands for the\nenvironment of the cell. The first arrow denotes the separation of the DNA into\nthe two strands. The second arrow denotes the action between the bare strands\nand the environment that leads to the production of the two DNA molecules. The\npaper considers and compares many formalisms for self-replication, including\naspects of quantum formalism and the Temperley-Lieb algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 06:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

The Kohn-Sham method, based on a fictitious system\nof non-interacting particles, is the work horse of the theory. The particular\nform of the Kohn-Sham wavefunction admits only idem-potent one electron density\nmatrices whereas wavefunctions of correlated electrons in post-Hartree-Fock\nmethods invariably have fractional occupation numbers. Here we show that by\ngeneralizing the orbital concept, and introducing a suitable dot-product as\nwell as a probability density a non-interacting system can be chosen that can\nrepresent the one-electron density matrix of any system, even one with\nfractional occupation numbers. This fictitious system ensures that the exact\nelectron density is accessible within density functional theory. It can also\nserve as the basis for reduced density matrix functional theory. Moreover, to\naid the analysis of the results the orbitals may be assigned energies from a\nmean-field Hamiltonian. This produces energy levels that are akin to\nHartree-Fock orbital energies such that conventional analyses based on Koopmans\ntheorem are available. Finally, this system is convenient in formalisms that\ndepend on creation and annihilation operators as they are trivially applied to\nsingle determinant wavefunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 03:50:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:22:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 02:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 18:34:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 15:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

These density functional\ncalculations led to the determination of structural, electronic and optical\nproperties, including the values of lattice constants and bulk moduli as a\nfunction of composition. Here, we investigate the latter properties, but by\nemploying a thermodynamical model which has been suggested for the formation\nand migration of defects in solids including several recent applications in\nsemiconductors. The following crucial difference emerges when comparing the\npresent results with those deduced by density functional calculations: Among\nthe alloys studied, GGA calculations identify that PbS$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ exhibits\nthe most evident non-linear variation of the bulk modulus versus the\ncomposition, while according to the thermodynamical model such an evident\nnon-linear behavior -and maybe somewhat stronger- is also expected for\nPbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$. A tentative origin of this diversity is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 09:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-01"}

In 83.3% of the cases the correct category code was one of the\nthree most likely category codes identified by the classifier.
