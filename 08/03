J1952.2+2925 has a pure\nthermal spectrum which is equally well fitted either by the blackbody model\nwith a temperature of $\\approx 215$ eV and an emitting area radius of $\\approx\n0.6$ km or by magnetized neutron star atmosphere models with temperatures of\n80-90 eV. In the latter case the thermal emission can come from the entire\nneutron star surface which temperature is consistent with standard neutron star\ncooling scenarios. We place also an upper limit on the J1952.2+2925 nonthermal\nflux. The derived spectral parameters are generally compatible with published\nones based only on the Chandra data, but they are much more accurate due to the\ninclusion of XMM-Newton data. No pulsations were found and we placed an upper\nlimit for the J1952.2+2925 pulsed emission fraction of 40 per cent. Utilizing\nthe interstellar absorption-distance relation, we estimated the distance to DA\n495, which can be as large as 5 kpc if J1952.2+2925 emission is described by\nthe atmosphere models.

However,\ncharacterizing the SPFs of these extrasolar debris disks is challenging because\nonly a limited range of scattering angles are visible to Earth-based observers.\nBy contrast, Saturn's tenuous rings can be observed over a much broader range\nof geometries, so their SPFs can be much better constrained. Since these rings\nare composed of small particles released from the surfaces of larger bodies,\nthey are reasonable analogs to debris disks and so their SPFs can provide\ninsights into the plausible scattering properties of debris disks. This work\nexamines two of Saturn's dusty rings: the G ring (at 167,500 km from Saturn's\ncenter) and the D68 ringlet (at 67,600 km). Using data from the cameras onboard\nthe Cassini spacecraft, we are able to estimate the rings' brightnesses at\nscattering angles ranging from 170 to 0.5 degrees. We find that both of the\nrings exhibit extremely strong forward-scattering peaks, but for scattering\nangles above 60 degrees their brightnesses are nearly constant. These SPFs can\nbe well approximated by a linear combination of three Henyey-Greenstein\nfunctions, and are roughly consistent with the SPFs of irregular particles from\nlaboratory measurements. Comparing these data to Fraunhofer and Mie models\nhighlights several challenges involved in extracting information about particle\ncompositions and size distributions from SPFs alone. The SPFs of these rings\nalso indicate that the degree of forward scattering in debris disks may be\ngreatly underestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 17:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 16:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

Next I have explicitly derived, a set of\nhigher order inflationary consistency relationships, which would help us to\nbreak the degeneracy between various class of inflationary models by\ndifferentiating them. I also provided two simple examples of Effective Theory\nof inflation- inflection-point model and saddle-point model to check the\ncompatibility of the prescribed methodology in the light of Planck 2015 and\nPlanck 2015 +BICEP2/Keck Array data. Finally, I have also checked the validity\nof the prescription by estimating the cosmological parameters and fitting the\ntheoretical CMB TT, TE and EE angular power spectra with the observed data\nwithin the multipole range $2<l<2500$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 18:12:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 05:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

While the idea of RF-EH is appealing, it is not\nalways beneficial to attempt to harvest energy; in environments where the\nambient energy is low, nodes could consume more energy being awake with their\nharvesting circuits turned on than what they can extract from the ambient radio\nsignals; it is then better to enter a sleep mode until the ambient RF energy\nincreases. Towards this end, we consider a scenario with intermittent energy\narrivals and a wireless node that wakes up for a period of time (herein called\nthe time-slot) and harvests energy. If enough energy is harvested during the\ntime-slot, then the harvesting is successful and excess energy is stored;\nhowever, if there does not exist enough energy the harvesting is unsuccessful\nand energy is lost.\n  We assume that the ambient energy level is constant during the time-slot, and\nchanges at slot boundaries. The energy level dynamics are described by a\ntwo-state Gilbert-Elliott Markov chain model, where the state of the Markov\nchain can only be observed during the harvesting action, and not when in sleep\nmode. Two scenarios are studied under this model.

The comet exhibited a weak 10 micron silicate\nfeature ~1.18 +/- 0.03 above the underlying best-fit 215.32 +/- 0.95 K\ncontinuum blackbody. Thermal modeling of the observed spectral energy\ndistribution indicates that the coma grains are fractally solid with a porosity\nfactor D = 3 and the peak in the grain size distribution, a_peak = 0.6 micron,\nlarge. The sub-micron coma grains are dominated by amorphous carbon, with a\nsilicate-to-carbon ratio of 0.80 (+0.25) (- 0.20). The silicate crystalline\nmass fraction is 0.20 (+0.30) (-0.10), similar to with other dynamically new\ncomets exhibiting weak 10 micron silicate features. The bolometric dust albedo\nof the coma dust is 0.14 +/- 0.01 at a phase angle of 34.76 degrees, and the\naverage dust production rate, corrected to zero phase, at the epoch of our\nobservations was Afrho ~ 5340~cm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 22:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The central controller periodically computes application-level\nresource allocation for each radio element with respect to runtime traffic\ndemands and channel conditions, and disseminate these allocation decisions as\nservice-oriented policies to respect element. The radio elements then\nindependently determine flow-level resource allocation within each application\nto accomplish these policies. We formulate the application-level resource\nallocation as an optimization problem and develop a fast algorithm to solve it\nwith a provably approximate guarantee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 03:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

The idea that shape and texture\ninformation (e.g. edge or orientation) are the key features for visual\nrepresentation is ingrained and dominated in current multimedia and computer\nvision communities. A number of low-level features have been proposed by\ncomputing local gradients (e.g. SIFT, LBP and HOG), and have achieved great\nsuccesses on numerous multimedia applications. In this paper, we present a\nsimple yet efficient local descriptor for image classification, referred as\nLocal Color Contrastive Descriptor (LCCD), by leveraging the neural mechanisms\nof color contrast. The idea originates from the observation in neural science\nthat color and shape information are linked inextricably in visual cortical\nprocessing. The color contrast yields key information for visual color\nperception and provides strong linkage between color and shape. We propose a\nnovel contrastive mechanism to compute the color contrast in both spatial\nlocation and multiple channels. The color contrast is computed by measuring\n\\emph{f}-divergence between the color distributions of two regions. Our\ndescriptor enriches local image representation with both color and contrast\ninformation. We verified experimentally that it can compensate strongly for the\nshape based descriptor (e.g. SIFT), while keeping computationally simple.\nExtensive experimental results on image classification show that our descriptor\nimproves the performance of SIFT substantially by combinations, and achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmark datasets. It\nimproves recent Deep Learning model (DeCAF) [1] largely from the accuracy of\n40.94% to 49.68% in the large scale SUN397 database.

Existing relevant literature focuses mainly on\nmortality forecasting or pricing of longevity derivatives, while the full\nimplications and methods of using the state-space representation of the\nLee-Carter model in pricing retirement income products is yet to be examined.\nThe main contribution of this article is twofold. First, we provide a rigorous\nand detailed derivation of the posterior distributions of the parameters and\nthe latent process of the Lee-Carter model via Gibbs sampling. Our assumption\nfor priors is slightly more general than the current literature in this area.\nMoreover, we suggest a new form of identification constraint not yet utilised\nin the actuarial literature that proves to be a more convenient approach for\nestimating the model under the state-space framework. Second, by exploiting the\nposterior distribution of the latent process and parameters, we examine the\npricing range of annuities, taking into account the stochastic nature of the\ndynamics of the mortality rates. In this way we aim to capture the impact of\nlongevity risk on the pricing of annuities. The outcome of our study\ndemonstrates that an annuity price can be more than 4% under-valued when\ndifferent assumptions are made on determining the survival curve constructed\nfrom the distribution of the forecasted death rates. Given that a typical\nannuity portfolio consists of a large number of policies with maturities which\nspan decades, we conclude that the impact of longevity risk on the accurate\npricing of annuities is a significant issue to be further researched.

In this study, the beam line design used in PIXE analysis\nwas used to increase the production of isotopes instead of the typical\nlow-energy accelerator from a 13-MeV cyclotron. For PIXE analysis, the proton\nbeam should be focused at the target through the use of a nozzle after\ndegrading the proton beam energy from 13-MeV to 3-MeV using an energy degrader.\nPrevious studies have been conducted to determine the most appropriate material\nand thickness of the energy degrader. Based on the energy distribution of the\ndegraded proton beam and the neutron occurrence rate at the degrader an\naluminum nozzle of X thickness was determined to be the most appropriate nozzle\nconstruction. Neutrons are created by the collision of 3-MeV protons into the\nnozzle after passage through energy degrader. In addition, a sufficient\nintensity of proton beam is required for non-destructive analysis of PIXE.\nTherefore, in order to optimize nozzle design, it is necessary to consider the\nnumber of neutrons which arise from the collision of protons inside the nozzle,\nas well as the track direction of the generated secondary neutrons, with the\nprimary aim of ensuring a sufficient number of protons passing through the\nnozzle as a direct beam.

In this paper, a comparative analysis was carried\nout for two typical nozzle shapes in order to minimize losses of protons and\ngeneration of secondary neutrons.

During the training process, these subnetworks avoid\noverfitting with an implicit regularization scheme based on the fact that they\nmust share their parameters with other subnetworks. Using this framework, we\nhave made an empirical observation that can improve even more the performance\nof such models. We notice that these models assume a balanced initial\ndistribution of data points with respect to the domain of the piecewise linear\nactivation function. If that assumption is violated, then the piecewise linear\nactivation units can degenerate into purely linear activation units, which can\nresult in a significant reduction of their capacity to learn complex functions.\nFurthermore, as the number of model layers increases, this unbalanced initial\ndistribution makes the model ill-conditioned. Therefore, we propose the\nintroduction of batch normalisation units into deep feedforward neural networks\nwith piecewise linear activations, which drives a more balanced use of these\nactivation units, where each region of the activation function is trained with\na relatively large proportion of training samples. Also, this batch\nnormalisation promotes the pre-conditioning of very deep learning models.

In this\nstudy, we focus on the emergence of non-axisymmetric time-dependent flow\nstructures in terms of inertial waves which - in cylindrical geometry - form\nso-called Kelvin modes. For a precession ratio\n${\\rm{Po}}=\\Omega_p/\\Omega_c=0.014$ the amplitude of the forced Kelvin mode\nreaches up to one fourth of the rotation velocity of the cylindrical container\nconfirming that precession provides a rather efficient flow driving mechanism\neven at moderate values of ${\\rm{Po}}$.

These free Kelvin modes\nare triggered by non-linear interactions and may constitute a triadic resonance\nwith the fundamental forced mode when the height of the container matches their\naxial wave lengths. Our simulations reveal triadic resonances at aspect ratios\nclose to those predicted by the linear theory except around the primary\nresonance of the forced mode. In that regime we still identify various free\nKelvin modes, however, all of them exhibit a retrograde drift around the\nsymmetry axis of the cylinder and none of them can be assigned to a triadic\nresonance. The amplitudes of the free Kelvin modes always remain below the\nforced mode but may reach up to 6% of the of the container's angular velocity.\nThe properties of the free Kelvin modes will be used in future simulations of\nthe magnetic induction equation to investigate their ability to provide for\ndynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 07:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The impact of the underlying structure of compact dendrimers on\ndynamical processes has been much studied, yet the relation between the\ndynamical and structural properties of extended dendrimers remains not well\nunderstood. In this paper, we study the trapping problem in extended dendrimers\nwith generation-dependent segment lengths, which is different from that of\ncompact dendrimers where the length of the linear segments is fixed. We first\nconsider a particular case that the deep trap is located at the central node,\nand derive an exact formula for the average trapping time (ATT) defined as the\naverage of the source-to-trap mean first passage time over all starting points.\nThen, using the obtained result we deduce a closed-form expression for the ATT\nto an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain an explicit\nsolution to the ATT corresponding to the trapping issue with the trap uniformly\ndistributed in the polymer systems. We show that the trap location has a\nsubstantial influence on the trapping efficiency measured by the ATT, which\nincreases with the shortest distance from the trap to the central node, a\nphenomenon similar to that for compact dendrimers. In contrast to this\nresemblance, the leading terms of ATTs for the three trapping problems differ\ndrastically between extended and compact dendrimers, with the trapping\nprocesses in the extended dendrimers being less efficient than in compact\ndendrimers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 11:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

At a fixed weak imbalance (small polarization) the stable homogeneous\nsuperfluid occurs only above a certain temperature. The density of states has a\nminimum at the Fermi level, then a weak peak {\\it within the gap}, and then the\nlarge, gap edge, coherence features. On heating, this non monotonic energy\ndependence changes to a more conventional fluctuation driven pseudogap, with a\nmonotonic energy dependence. At large imbalance the ground state is FFLO and\n`pseudogapped' due to the modulated order. It changes to a gapless normal state\non heating, and then shows a pseudogap again at a higher temperature.

We assume emission is given by the general triaxial non-aligned model of\nJones, whose waveform under certain conditions reduces to that of a biaxial\nprecessing star, or a simple rigidly rotating triaxial aligned star. The\ntriaxial non-aligned and biaxial models can produce emission at both the star's\nrotation frequency ($f$) and $2f$, whilst the latter only emits at $2f$. We\nhave studied parameter estimation for signal models using both a set of\nphysical source parameters, and a set of waveform parameters that remove a\ndegeneracy. We have assessed the signal detection efficiency, and used Bayesian\nmodel selection to investigate how well we can distinguish between the three\nmodels. We found that for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) $\\gtrsim 6$ there is no\nsignificant loss in efficiency if performing a search for a signal at $f$ and\n$2f$ when the source is only producing emission at $2f$. However, for sources\nwith emission at both $f$ and $2f$ signals could be missed by a search only at\n$2f$.

A\npopular theoretical scenario for modeling memory function is the attractor\nneural network scenario, whose prototype is the Hopfield model. The model has a\npoor storage capacity, compared with the capacity achieved with perceptron\nlearning algorithms. Here, by transforming the perceptron learning rule, we\npresent an online learning rule for a recurrent neural network that achieves\nnear-maximal storage capacity without an explicit supervisory error signal,\nrelying only upon locally accessible information. The fully-connected network\nconsists of excitatory binary neurons with plastic recurrent connections and\nnon-plastic inhibitory feedback stabilizing the network dynamics; the memory\npatterns are presented online as strong afferent currents, producing a bimodal\ndistribution for the neuron synaptic inputs. Synapses corresponding to active\ninputs are modified as a function of the value of the local fields with respect\nto three thresholds. Above the highest threshold, and below the lowest\nthreshold, no plasticity occurs. In between these two thresholds,\npotentiation/depression occurs when the local field is above/below an\nintermediate threshold. We simulated and analyzed a network of binary neurons\nimplementing this rule and measured its storage capacity for different sizes of\nthe basins of attraction. The storage capacity obtained through numerical\nsimulations is shown to be close to the value predicted by analytical\ncalculations. We also measured the dependence of capacity on the strength of\nexternal inputs.

Our finding is based on our generic formula for\nall-order effective actions of internal moduli parameter of domain wall\nsolitons. It is known that the Nambu-Goldstone mode $Z$ associated with\nspontaneous breaking of translation symmetry obeys a Nambu-Goto effective\nLagrangian $\\sqrt{1 - (\\partial_0 Z)^2}$ detecting the speed of light\n($|\\partial_0 Z|=1$) in the target spacetime. Solitons can have internal moduli\nparameters as well, associated with a breaking of internal symmetries such as a\nphase rotation acting on a field. We obtain, for generic domain walls, an\neffective Lagrangian of the internal moduli $\\epsilon$ to all order in\n$(\\partial \\epsilon)$. The Lagrangian is given by a function of the Nambu-Goto\nLagrangian: $L = g(\\sqrt{1 + (\\partial_\\mu \\epsilon)^2})$. This shows\ngenerically the existence of an upper bound on $\\partial_0 \\epsilon$, i.e. a\nspeed limit in the internal space. The speed limit exists even for solitons in\nsome non-relativistic field theories, where we find that $\\epsilon$ is a type I\nNambu-Goldstone mode which also obeys a nonlinear dispersion to reach the speed\nlimit. This offers a possibility of detecting the speed limit in condensed\nmatter experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 14:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

This representation is to Bob and any external\nobserver, it cannot be to Alice (the problem solver).

In simulating scalar collapses in\nSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om geometries, Kruskal and Kruskal-like\ncoordinates are used, respectively, with the presence of $f'$ and a physical\nscalar field being taken into account. The dynamics in the vicinities of the\ncentral singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole and of the inner horizon of a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole is examined. Approximate analytic solutions for\ndifferent types of collapses are partially obtained. The scalar degree of\nfreedom $\\phi$, transformed from $f'$, plays a similar role as a physical\nscalar field in general relativity. Regarding the physical scalar field in\n$f(R)$ case, when $d\\phi/dt$ is negative (positive), the physical scalar field\nis suppressed (magnified) by $\\phi$, where $t$ is the coordinate time. For dark\nenergy $f(R)$ gravity, inside black holes, gravity can easily push $f'$ to $1$.\nConsequently, the Ricci scalar $R$ becomes singular, and the numerical\nsimulation breaks down. This singularity problem can be avoided by adding an\n$R^2$ term to the original $f(R)$ function, in which case an infinite Ricci\nscalar is pushed to regions where $f'$ is also infinite. On the other hand, in\ncollapse for this combined model, a black hole, including a central\nsingularity, can be formed. Moreover, under certain initial conditions, $f'$\nand $R$ can be pushed to infinity as the central singularity is approached.\nTherefore, the classical singularity problem, which is present in general\nrelativity, remains in collapse for this combined model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 15:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 01:30:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 09:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

The\nmatter inside the star satisfies the null, weak and strong energy conditions.\nFinally, we compare the masses and radii predicted from the model with\ncorresponding values in some observed stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 09:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 04:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-25"}

We argue\nthat the theory of quantum gravity has a strong constraining anchor in the\nsector of gravitational radiation ensuring reliable physical clues, albeit in a\nlimited observable form. In particular, all types of gravitational waves\nexpected to be observable in LIGO-like advanced detectors are fully quantum\nmechanical states of radiation. Exact equivalence of the full quantum gravity\ntheory with the familiar semiclassical theory is ensured in the radiation\nsector, in most real situations where the relevant quantum operator functions\nare normal ordered, by the analogue of the optical equivalence theorem in\nquantum optics. We show that this is indeed the case for detection of the waves\nfrom a massive binary system, a single gravitational atom, that emits coherent\nradiation. The idea of quantum-gravitational optics can assist in guiding along\nthe fuzzy roads to quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 10:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

Since the electricity\nuser's cost function depends on the aggregate load, which is unknown to the end\nusers, an aggregate load estimator is employed to estimate it. Based on the\ncommunication among the users about their estimations on the aggregate load,\nNash equilibrium seeking strategies are proposed for the electricity users. By\nusing singular perturbation analysis and Lyapunov stability analysis, a local\nconvergence result to the Nash equilibrium is presented for the energy\nconsumption game that may have multiple Nash equilibria. For the energy\nconsumption game with a unique Nash equilibrium, it is shown that the players'\nstrategies converge to the Nash equilibrium non-locally. More specially, if the\nunique Nash equilibrium is an inner Nash equilibrium, then the convergence rate\ncan be quantified. Energy consumption game with stubborn players is also\ninvestigated. Convergence to the best response strategies for the rational\nplayers is ensured. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness\nof the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 04:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 07:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 06:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}
