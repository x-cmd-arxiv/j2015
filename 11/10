For example, the magnetization of thin films of hard\nmagnetic materials is in general perpendicular to the thin-film plane, thanks\nto the strong out-of-plane anisotropy, but its direction changes periodically,\nforming an alternating spin-up and spin-down stripe pattern. The latter is\nstabilized by the competition between the ferromagnetic coupling and\ndipole-dipole interactions, and disappears when a moderate in-plane magnetic\nfield is applied. It has been suggested that such a behavior may be understood\nin terms of a self-induced stripe glassiness. In this paper we show that such a\nscenario is compatible with the experimental findings. The strong out-of-plane\nmagnetic anisotropy of the film is found to be beneficial for the formation of\nboth the stripe-ordered and glassy phases. At zero magnetic field the system\ncan form a glass only in a narrow interval of fairly large temperatures. An\nin-plane magnetic field, however, shifts the glass transition towards lower\ntemperatures, therefore enabling it at or below room temperature. In good\nqualitative agreement with the experimental findings, we show that a moderate\nin-plane magnetic field of the order of $30~{\\rm mT}$ can lead to the formation\nof defects in the stripe pattern, which sets the onset of the glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 16:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

While disordered\nnanometric inclusions have shown to modify their vortex phase diagram and to\nproduce enhancements of the critical current1,2, the effect of ordered oxide\nnanostructures remains essentially unexplored. This is due to the very small\nnanostructure size imposed by the short coherence length, and to the\ntechnological difficulties in the nanofabrication process. Yet, the novel\nphenomena occurring at oxide interfaces open a wide spectrum of technological\nopportunities to interplay with the superconductivity in cuprates. Here we show\nthat the unusual long range suppression of the superconductivity occurring at\nthe interface between manganites and cuprates affects vortex nucleation and\nprovides a novel vortex pinning mechanism. In particular, we show evidence of\ncommensurate pinning in YBCO films with ordered arrays of LCMO ferromagnetic\nnanodots. Vortex pinning results from the proximity induced reduction of the\ncondensation energy at the vicinity of the magnetic nanodots, and yields an\nenhanced friction between the nanodot array and the moving vortex lattice in\nthe liquid phase. This result shows that all-oxide ordered nanostructures\nconstitute a powerful, new route for the artificial manipulation of vortex\nmatter in cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 16:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

In many instances, correlators satisfy\nthe so-called \\textit{cluster decomposition property} (CDP), which means that\nthey tend to zero for space-like asymptotic distances. However, under certain\nconditions it is possible for correlators to violate this property. In the\ncontext of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a violation of the CDP for correlators\nof clusters involving coloured fields implies that the strength of the\ncorrelations between the coloured degrees of freedom in these clusters\nincreases at large distances, which is a sufficient condition for confinement.\nIn this paper we establish a criterion for when the CDP is violated. By\napplying this criterion to QCD, it turns out that certain lattice results\ninvolving the quark and gluon propagators can be interpreted as evidence that\nquarks and gluons are confined due to a violation of the CDP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 17:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 15:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 20:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

The most distant target in our sample, with a rectified galactocentric\ndistance >100 kpc, was the first PN discovered in the outer streams of M31. The\n[O III] 4363 auroral line was well detected in the spectra of all targets,\nenabling electron temperature determination. Ionic abundances are derived based\non the [O III] temperatures, and elemental abundances of helium, nitrogen,\noxygen, neon, sulfur, and argon are estimated.

Because real ground states should have all\nsymmetries of the nuclear Hamiltonian, these methods require subsequent\nsymmetry restoration.\n  Purpose: We implement and study Lipkin method of approximate variation after\nprojection applied to the restoration of the translational or rotational\nsymmetries.\n  Methods: We use Lipkin operators up to quadratic terms in momenta or angular\nmomenta with self-consistently determined values of the Peierls-Yoccoz\ntranslational masses or moments of inertia, respectively. Calculations based on\nSkyrme energy-density functional are performed for heavy, deformed, and paired\nnuclei.\n  Results: In deformed nuclei, the Peierls-Yoccoz translational masses along\nthree different principal-axes directions of the intrinsic system can be\ndifferent, which illustrates different widths of the total-momentum\ndistributions. Numerically, the differences are only of the order of a few per\ncent. For the rotational-symmetry restoration, the Lipkin method compares\nfavorably with the exact angular-momentum projection, which requires much\nlarger computational effort.\n  Conclusions: The Lipkin method of translational and rotational symmetry\nrestoration is a practical low-cost method of determining the corresponding\ncorrelation energies.

Using spectroscopic data from three 4-8-m telescopes\nand photometry spanning 22 years, we were able to derive the dynamical masses\nand radii of both stars with exquisite accuracy. Both stars in the system are\nvery similar in mass, radius and color, but the companion is a stable,\nnon-pulsating star. The Cepheid is slightly more massive and bigger (M_1 = 3.70\n+/- 0.03M_sun, R_1 = 28.6 +/- 0.2R_sun) than its companion (M_2 = 3.60 +/-\n0.03M_sun, R_2 = 26.6 +/- 0.2R_sun).

We adopt the\ncontinuous mass formalism or multi band (flavor) formalism of the unparticle\nsector by letting various microscopic parameters be mass-dependent. In\nparticular, we show that an effective mass that varies with the flavor index as\nwell as a running band edge and lifetime capture the AC and DC transport\nphenomenology of the cuprates. A key consequence of the running mass is that\nthe effective dynamical exponent can differ from the underlying bare critical\nexponent, thereby providing a mechanism for realizing the fractional values of\nthe dynamical exponent required in a previous analysis\\cite{ Hartnoll:2015sea}.\nWe also predict that regardless of the bare dynamical exponent, $z$, a non-zero\nanomalous dimension for the current is required.

The\nequivalent phenomenon in a $d+1$ gravitational construction is the running of\nthe charge along the radial direction.

Originally the luminosity was expected in high-energy X-rays\nor gamma-rays, however we conjecture that some of the battery power is emitted\nin the radio bandwidth. While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence\nrates are too low to make these a primary FRB source.

When\na graphene membrane is placed on a solid substrate, the adhesive interactions\nbetween graphene and the substrate could considerably suppress thermal\nrippling. On the other hand, the statistical nature of thermal rippling adds an\nentropic contribution to the graphene-substrate interactions. In this paper we\npresent a statistical mechanics analysis on thermal rippling of monolayer\ngraphene supported on a rigid substrate, assuming a generic form of van der\nWaals interactions between graphene and substrate at T = 0 K. The rippling\namplitude, the equilibrium average separation, and the average interaction\nenergy are predicted simultaneously and compared with molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. While the amplitude of thermal rippling is reduced by adhesive\ninteractions, the entropic contribution leads to an effective repulsion. As a\nresult, the equilibrium average separation increases and the effective adhesion\nenergy decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, the effect of a biaxial\npre-strain in graphene is considered, and a buckling instability is predicted\nat a critical compressive strain that depends on both the temperature and the\nadhesive interactions. Limited by the harmonic approximations, the theoretical\npredictions agree with MD simulations only for relatively small rippling\namplitudes but can be extended to account for the anharmonic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 22:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

With an increase in m at fix values of the\nother parameters, the field within the particle asymptotically converges to a\nperiodic function of m. The electric and magnetic type Mie resonances of\ndifferent orders overlap substantially. It may lead to a giant concentration of\nthe electromagnetic energy within the particle. At the same time, we\ndemonstrate that identical transformations of the solution for the outer\nproblem allow to present each partial scattered wave as a sum of two\npartitions. One of them corresponds to the m-independent wave, scattered by a\nperfectly reflecting particle and plays the role of a background, while the\nother is associated with the excitation of a sharply-m-dependent resonant Mie\nmode. The interference of the partitions brings about a typical asymmetric Fano\nprofile. The explicit expressions for the parameters of the Fano profile have\nbeen obtained \"from the first principles\" without any additional assumptions\nand/or fitting. In contrast to the inner problem, at an increase in m the\nresonant modes of the outer problem die out, and the scattered field converges\nto the universal, m-independent profile of the perfectly reflecting sphere.\nNumerical estimates of the discussed effects for a gallium phosphide particle\nare presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 23:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

It is considered as a key technology for\nthe fifth generation wireless networks and is already used in wireless LAN\n(e.g., IEEE 802.11ad). Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is\noften viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler\nspread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not true when\ndirectional beam is employed for communications. In this paper, closed form\nexpressions relating the channel coherence time and beamwidth are derived.\nUnlike prior work that assumed perfect beam pointing, the pointing error due to\nthe receiver motion is incorporated to show that there exists a non-zero\noptimal beamwidth that maximizes the coherence time. To investigate the\nmobility effect on the beam alignment which is an important feature in mmWave\nsystems, a novel concept of beam coherence time is defined. The beam coherence\ntime, which is an effective measure of beam alignment frequency, is shown to be\nmuch larger than the conventional channel coherence time and thus results in\nreduced beam alignment overhead. Using the derived correlation function, the\nchannel coherence time, and the beam coherence time, an overall performance\nmetric considering both the channel time-variation and the beam alignment\noverhead is derived. Using this metric, it is shown that beam alignment in\nevery beam coherence time performs better than the beam alignment in every\nchannel coherence time due to the large overhead for the latter case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2015 23:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Hence the tail latency (e.g. the 99th\npercentile of response time), rather than the average, of these components\ndetermines the overall service performance. When hosted on a cloud environment,\nthe components of a service typically co-locate with short batch jobs to\nincrease machine utilizations, and share and contend resources such as caches\nand I/O bandwidths with them. The highly dynamic nature of batch jobs in terms\nof their workload types and input sizes causes continuously changing\nperformance interference to individual components, hence leading to their\nlatency variability and high tail latency. However, existing techniques either\nignore such fine-grained component latency variability when managing service\nperformance, or rely on executing redundant requests to reduce the tail\nlatency, which adversely deteriorate the service performance when load gets\nheavier. In this paper, we propose PCS, a predictive and component-level\nscheduling framework to reduce tail latency for large-scale, parallel online\nservices. It uses an analytical performance model to simultaneously predict the\ncomponent latency and the overall service performance on different nodes. Based\non the predicted performance, the scheduler identifies straggling components\nand conducts near-optimal component-node allocations to adapt to the changing\nperformance interferences from batch jobs.

Based on the event rate calculations in Trott, Tingay & Wayth\n(2013), which assumes a standard candle luminosity of $8\\times10^{37}$\nJs$^{-1}$, we predict that with this choice of observational parameters, the\nMWA should detect ($\\sim10$,$\\sim2$,$\\sim0$) FRBs with spectral indices\ncorresponding to ($-$2, $-$1, 0), based on a 7$\\sigma$ detection threshold. We\nfind no FRB candidates above this threshold from our search, placing an event\nrate limit of $<700$ above 700 Jy.ms per day per sky and providing evidence\nagainst spectral indices $\\alpha<-1.2$ ($S\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha}$). We compare our\nevent rate and spectral index limits with others from the literature. We\nbriefly discuss these limits in light of recent suggestions that supergiant\npulses from young neutron stars could explain FRBs. We find that such\nsupergiant pulses would have to have much flatter spectra between 150 and 1400\nMHz than have been observed from Crab giant pulses to be consistent with the\nFRB spectral index limit we derive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 03:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Spiral arms are among the\nstructures predicted decades ago by numerical simulations of disk-planet\ninteraction and thus it is tempting to suspect that planetary perturbers are\nresponsible for the observed signatures.

The gas is accelerated vertically\naway from the midplane by the shocks to form shock bores, and the gas falling\nback toward the midplane breaks up into a turbulent surf near the Lindblad\nresonances. This turbulence, although localized, has high $\\alpha$ values,\nreaching 0.05 in the inner Lindblad resonance, and 0.1 in the outer one.

The main aspect of the proposed\napproach is that it incorporates an iterative rate-matching process into the\ndecoding of the received set of frames, such that: throughout inter-frame\ndecoding, the code-rate of each frame is progressively lowered to or below the\nappropriate value, prior to applying or re-applying conventional physical-layer\nchannel decoding on it. This iterative rate-matching process is asymptotically\nanalyzed in this paper. It is shown to be optimal, in the sense defined in the\npaper. Consequently, the data-rates achievable by the proposed scheme are\nderived. Overall, it is concluded that, compared to the existing solutions,\ninter-frame coding presents a better complexity versus data-rate tradeoff.

The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic\nsecond order logic of time and probability that is known to be decidable,\nexcept on a set of measure zero. We show that two distinct extensions of this\nlogic make model checking undecidable. One of these involves polynomial\ncombinations of probability terms, the other involves monadic second order\nquantification into the scope of probability operators. These results explain\nsome of the restrictions in previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 06:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

However, the in-network caching is vulnerable to cache pollution\nattacks (CPA), which can reduce cache hits by violating cache locality and\nsignificantly degrade the overall performance of NDN. To defend against CPA\nattacks, the most effective way is to first detect the attacks and then\nthrottle them. Since the CPA attack itself has already imposed a huge burden on\nvictims, to avoid exhausting the remaining resources on the victims for\ndetection purpose, we expect a lightweight detection solution. We thus propose\nELDA, an Efficient and Lightweight Detection scheme against cache pollution\nAttacks, in which we design a Lightweight Flajolet-Martin (LFM) sketch to\nmonitor the interest traffic.

We first consider Nori's Tannakian category of\nessentially finite bundles over an integral proper $k$-scheme $X$ with a\nrational point, in order to study an analogue of the Serre-Fr\\\"ohlich embedding\nproblem for Nori's fundamental group scheme. Then we consider Fontaine's\nTannakian categories of $B$-admissible representations, in order to obtain a\ngeneralization of both the classical Serre-Fr\\\"ohlich formula and Saito's\nanalogous result for Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representations. Finally we consider\nNori's category of mixed motives over a number field. These last two examples\nyield formulas relating the torsor of periods of an orthogonal motive to\nHasse-Witt invariants of the associated Betti and de Rham quadratic forms and\nto Stiefel-Withney invariants of the associated local $l$-adic orthogonal\nrepresentations. We give some computations for Artin motives and for the motive\nof a smooth hypersurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 08:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

To bridge\nthis gap we first calculate the statistical relationship between ionizing\nluminosity and Mpc-scale overdensity using detailed models of galaxy formation\ncomputed using relatively small volume - ($\\sim$100Mpc/$h$)$^{3}$, high\nresolution dark matter simulations.

A\ngood image descriptor is key to the retrieval pipeline and should reconcile two\ncontradictory requirements: providing recall rates as high as possible and\nbeing as compact as possible for fast matching. Following the recent successes\nof Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) for large scale image\nclassification, descriptors extracted from DCNNs are increasingly used in place\nof the traditional hand crafted descriptors such as Fisher Vectors (FV) with\nbetter retrieval performances. Nevertheless, the dimensionality of a typical\nDCNN descriptor --extracted either from the visual feature pyramid or the\nfully-connected layers-- remains quite high at several thousands of scalar\nvalues. In this paper, we propose Unsupervised Triplet Hashing (UTH), a fully\nunsupervised method to compute extremely compact binary hashes --in the 32-256\nbits range-- from high-dimensional global descriptors. UTH consists of two\nsuccessive deep learning steps. First, Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines\n(SRBM), a type of unsupervised deep neural nets, are used to learn binary\nembedding functions able to bring the descriptor size down to the desired\nbitrate. SRBMs are typically able to ensure a very high compression rate at the\nexpense of loosing some desirable metric properties of the original DCNN\ndescriptor space. Then, triplet networks, a rank learning scheme based on\nweight sharing nets is used to fine-tune the binary embedding functions to\nretain as much as possible of the useful metric properties of the original\nspace. A thorough empirical evaluation conducted on multiple publicly available\ndataset using DCNN descriptors shows that our method is able to significantly\noutperform state-of-the-art unsupervised schemes in the target bit range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 10:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

The large scale bow\nshock morphology is very similar and differences are primarily due to\nvariations in the assumed spatial resolution. However infra-red intensity\nslices (at 22 microns and 12 microns) show that the effects of a temperature\ngradient can be resolved at a realistic spatial resolution for an object at a\ndistance of 1 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 10:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Layered convection induced by compositional\ninhomogeneity has been proposed to account for the radius anomaly of hot\nJupiters. To reexamine the impact of the compositional inhomogeneity, we\nperform an evolutionary calculation by determining convection regime at each\nevolutionary time step according to the criteria from linear analyses. It is\nshown that the impact is limited in the case of the monotonic gradient of heavy\nelement abundance. The layered convection is absent for the first 1 Gyr from\nthe formation of hot Jupiters and instead overturning convection develops. The\nsuper-adiabaticity of the temperature gradient is limited by the neutrally\nstable state for the Ledoux stability criterion. The effect of the increased\nmass of heavy elements essentially compensates the effect of the delayed\ncontraction on the planetary radius caused by compositional inhomogeneity. In\naddition, even in the case where the layered convection is artificially\nimposed, this mechanism requires extremely thin layers (~ 10^1-10^3 cm) to\naccount for the observed radius anomaly. The long-term stability of such thin\nlayers remains to be studied. Therefore, if the criteria adopted in this paper\nare adequate, it might be difficult to explain the inflated radii of hot\nJupiters by monotonic gradient of heavy element abundance alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 11:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Recent\nanalyses of Martian meteorites have suggested that the water reservoirs have at\nleast three distinct hydrogen isotope compositions (D/H ratios): primordial and\nhigh D/H ratios, which are approximately the same and six times that of ocean\nwater on Earth, respectively, and a newly identified intermediate D/H ratio,\nwhich is approximately two to three times higher than that in ocean water on\nEarth. We calculate the evolution of the D/H ratios and the volumes of the\nwater reservoirs on Mars by modeling the exchange of hydrogen isotopes between\nmultiple water reservoirs and the atmospheric escape. The D/H ratio is slightly\nhigher in the topmost thin surface-ice layer than that in the atmosphere\nbecause of isotopic fractionation by sublimation, whereas the water-ice\nreservoir just below the exchangeable topmost surface layer retains the\nintermediate D/H signature found in Martian meteorites. We propose two possible\nmodels for constraining the volume of the ground ice considering the observed\nD/H ratios and geomorphological estimates of Paleo-oceans. The first assumes\nthat the atmospheric loss is dominated by the Jeans escape. In this case, the\nvolume of ground ice should be larger than the total volume of the observable\nsurface ice that mainly occurs as polar layered ice deposits. The other model\nassumes diffusion-limited atmospheric loss in which the interactive evolution\nof the multiple water reservoirs naturally accounts for the observed D/H\nratios. In this scenario, a large volume of ground ice does not necessarily\nexist currently on Mars as opposed to the perspective view proposed on the\nbasis of recent orbiter missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 11:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Most\napproaches to scenario generation are distribution-driven, that is, they\nattempt to construct a random vector which captures well in a probabilistic\nsense the uncertainty. On the other hand, a problem-driven approach may be able\nto exploit the structure of a problem to provide a more concise representation\nof the uncertainty.\n  In this paper we propose an analytic approach to problem-driven scenario\ngeneration. This approach applies to stochastic programs where a tail risk\nmeasure, such as conditional value-at-risk, is applied to a loss function.\nSince tail risk measures only depend on the upper tail of a distribution,\nstandard methods of scenario generation, which typically spread their scenarios\nevenly across the support of the random vector, struggle to adequately\nrepresent tail risk. Our scenario generation approach works by targeting the\nconstruction of scenarios in areas of the distribution corresponding to the\ntails of the loss distributions. We provide conditions under which our approach\nis consistent with sampling, and as proof-of-concept demonstrate how our\napproach could be applied to two classes of problem, namely network design and\nportfolio selection.

The classification of young stellar objects (YSOs) is typically done\nusing the infrared spectral slope or bolometric temperature, but either can\nresult in contamination of samples. More accurate methods to determine the\nevolutionary stage of YSOs will improve the reliability of statistics for the\nembedded YSO population and provide more robust stage lifetimes. Aims. We aim\nto separate the truly embedded YSOs from more evolved sources. Methods. Maps of\nHCO+ J=4-3 and C18O J=3-2 were observed with HARP on the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope (JCMT) for a sample of 56 candidate YSOs in Perseus and Taurus in\norder to characterize emission from high (column) density gas. These are\nsupplemented with archival dust continuum maps observed with SCUBA on the JCMT\nand Herschel PACS to compare the morphology of the gas and dust in the\nprotostellar envelopes. The spatial concentration of HCO+ J=4-3 and 850 micron\ndust emission are used to classify the embedded nature of YSOs. Results.\nApproximately 30% of Class 0+I sources in Perseus and Taurus are not Stage I,\nbut are likely to be more evolved Stage II pre-main sequence (PMS) stars with\ndisks. An additional 16% are confused sources with an uncertain evolutionary\nstage. Conclusions. Separating classifications by cloud reveals that a high\npercentage of the Class 0+I sources in the Perseus star forming region are\ntruly embedded Stage I sources (71%), while the Taurus cloud hosts a majority\nof evolved PMS stars with disks (68%). The concentration factor method is\nuseful to correct misidentified embedded YSOs, yielding higher accuracy for YSO\npopulation statistics and Stage timescales. Current estimates (0.54 Myr) may\noverpredict the Stage I lifetime on the order of 30%, resulting in timescales\nof 0.38 Myr for the embedded phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 15:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

A\nmobile sensor may change its position rapidly and thus require localization\ncalls frequently. A localization may require network wide information and\nincrease traffic over the network. It dissipates valuable energy for message\ncommunication. Thus localization is very costly. The control of the number of\nlocalization calls may save energy consumption, as it is rather expensive. To\nreduce the frequency of localization calls for a mobile sensor, we propose a\ntechnique that involves \\textit{Mobility Aware Interpolation} (MAINT) for\nposition estimation. It controls the number of localizations which gives much\nbetter result than the existing localization control schemes using mobility\naware extrapolation. The proposed method involves very low arithmetic\ncomputation overheads. We find analytical expressions for the expected error in\nposition estimation. A parameter, the time interval, has been introduced to\nexternally control the energy dissipation. Simulation studies are carried out\nto compare the performances of the proposed method with some existing\nlocalization control schemes as well as the theoretical results. The simulation\nresults shows that the expected error at any point of time may be computed from\nthis expression. We have seen that constant error limit can be maintained\nincreasing the time period of localization proportional to rate of change of\ndirection of its motion. Increasing time period, the energy may be saved with a\nstable error limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 07:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

When interpreting most observations,\nthis cosmological principle is applied stricto sensu: the light emitted by\ndistant sources is assumed to propagate through a Friedmann-Lema\\^itre\nspacetime. The main goal of the present thesis was to evaluate how reliable\nthis assumption is, especially when small scales are at stake. After having\nreviewed the laws of geometric optics in curved spacetime, and the standard\ninterpretation of cosmological observables, the dissertation reports a\ncomprehensive analysis of light propagation in Swiss-cheese models, designed to\ncapture the clumpy character of the Universe. The resulting impact on the\ninterpretation of the Hubble diagram is quantified, and shown to be relatively\nsmall, thanks to the cosmological constant. When applied to current supernova\ndata, the associated corrections tend however to improve the agreement between\nthe cosmological parameters inferred from the Hubble diagram and from the\ncosmic microwave background. This is a hint that the effect of small-scale\nstructures on light propagation may become non-negligible in the era of\nprecision cosmology. This motivated the development of a new theoretical\nframework, based on stochastic processes, which aims at describing small-scale\ngravitational lensing with a better accuracy. Regarding the isotropy side of\nthe cosmological principle, this dissertation addresses, on the one hand, the\npotential effect of a large-scale anisotropy on light propagation, by solving\nall the equations of geometric optics in the Bianchi I spacetime. On the other\nhand, possible sources of such an anisotropy, namely scalar-vector models for\ninflation or dark energy, are analysed. Most of them turn out to be excluded as\nphysically viable theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 15:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}
