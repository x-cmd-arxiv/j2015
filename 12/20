We apply the\nBardeen transfer Hamiltonian formalism, using atomistic band structure\ncalculations to account for the effect of the atomic structure on the tunneling\nprocess. The strong quantum-size confinement of the nanoribbons is mirrored by\nthe one-dimensional character of the electronic structure, resulting in\nproperties that differ significantly from the case of inter-layer tunneling,\nwhere tunneling occurs between bulk two-dimensional graphene sheets. The\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of the inter-ribbon tunneling structures\nexhibit resonance, as well as stepwise increases in current. Both features are\ncaused by the energetic alignment of one-dimensional peaks in the\ndensity-of-states of the ribbons. Resonant tunneling occurs if the sign of the\ncurvature of the coupled energy bands is equal, whereas a step-like increase of\nthe current occurs if the signs are opposite. Changing the doping modulates the\nonset- voltage of the effects as well as their magnitude. Doping through\nelectrostatic gating makes these structures promising for application towards\nsteep slope switching devices. Using the atomistic Bardeen transfer Hamiltonian\nmethod, inter-ribbon tunneling can be studied for the whole range of\ntwo-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. The\neffects of resonance and of step-like increases of the current, observed in\ngraphene ribbons, are also expected in ribbons made from these alternative\ntwo-dimensional materials, because these effects are manifestations of the\none-dimensional character of the density-of-states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 16:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 10:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

We find\nthat in the high-$z$, DM-dominated phase, the stellar and DM systems tend to be\ntriaxial, preferentially prolate and mutually aligned. The elongation is\nsupported by an anisotropic velocity dispersion that originates from the\nassembly of the galaxy along a dominant large-scale filament. We estimate that\ntorques by the dominant halo are capable of inducing the elongation of the\nstellar system and its alignment with the halo. Then, in association with the\ntransition to self-gravity, small-pericenter orbits puff up and the DM and\nstellar systems evolve into a more spherical and oblate configuration, aligned\nwith the gas disc and associated with rotation.

Using the sparsity property of the\nwater waves in the time or in the frequency domain, the compressive sampling\nalgorithm can be used as a tool for improving the performance of the spectral\nsimulation of the water waves. The methodology offered in this paper depends on\nthe idea of using a smaller number of spectral components compared to the\nclassical spectral method with a high number of components. After performing\nthe time integration with a smaller number of spectral components and using the\ncompressive sampling technique, it is shown that the water wave field can be\nreconstructed with a significantly better efficiency compared to the classical\nspectral method with a high number of spectral components, especially for long\ntime evolutions.\n  For the sparse water wave model in the time domain the well-known solitary\nwave solutions of the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation is considered.

Sticking\nto the original story behind this problem, suppose we have to deliver a bomb in\nsome distant point of the globe, the distance being much greater than the range\nof any individual airplane at our disposal. Therefore, the only feasible option\nto carry out this mission is to better utilize our fleet via mid-air refueling.\nStarting with several airplanes that can refuel one another, and gradually drop\nout of the flight until the single plane carrying the bomb reaches the target,\nhow would you plan the refueling policy?\n  The main contribution of Gamow and Stern was to provide a complete\ncharacterization of the optimal refueling policy for the special case of\nidentical airplanes. In spite of their elegant and easy-to-analyze solution,\nthe computational complexity of the general airplane refueling problem, with\narbitrary tank volumes and consumption rates, has remained widely open ever\nsince, as recently pointed out by Woeginger (Open Problems in Scheduling,\nDagstuhl 2010, page 24).

However, different users typically have their own preferences, for\nexample with respect to arranging objects on different shelves. As many of\nthese preferences depend on a variety of factors including personal taste,\ncultural background, or common sense, it is challenging for an expert to\npre-program a robot in order to accommodate all potential users. At the same\ntime, it is impractical for robots to constantly query users about how they\nshould perform individual tasks. In this work, we present an approach to learn\npatterns in user preferences for the task of tidying up objects in containers,\ne.g., shelves or boxes. Our method builds upon the paradigm of collaborative\nfiltering for making personalized recommendations and relies on data from\ndifferent users that we gather using crowdsourcing. To deal with novel objects\nfor which we have no data, we propose a method that compliments standard\ncollaborative filtering by leveraging information mined from the Web. When\nsolving a tidy-up task, we first predict pairwise object preferences of the\nuser. Then, we subdivide the objects in containers by modeling a spectral\nclustering problem. Our solution is easy to update, does not require complex\nmodeling, and improves with the amount of user data. We evaluate our approach\nusing crowdsourcing data from over 1,200 users and demonstrate its\neffectiveness for two tidy-up scenarios. Additionally, we show that a real\nrobot can reliably predict user preferences using our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 12:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

To utilize\nthis band, it is crucial to obtain the channel state information in order to\nperform beamforming and combining to compensate for severe path loss. In\ncontrast to lower frequencies, a typical millimeter wave channel consists of a\nfew dominant paths. Thus it is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains,\nangles of departure (AoDs), and angles of arrival (AoAs) of those paths.\nProposed in this paper is a dual timescale model to characterize abrupt channel\nchanges (e.g., blockage) and slow variations of AoDs and AoAs.

In years to come, usage of Internet may unravel more\npleasant surprises for us as far as novelty in its usage is concerned. As a\ndemocratic function of Internet, and relying on the open model on which it has\nbeen built, there has been concerted efforts in the direction of privacy\nprotection and use of privacy enhancing tools which have gained tangible\ntraction. Innovation in use of VPN, TLS/SSL and cryptographic tools are a\ntestimony to it. Another popular tool is Tor, which has gained widespread\npopularity as it is being increasingly used by anonymity seeking users to\neffectively maintain their discretion while surfing the web.\n  However, there is a darker side to increased proliferation of Internet in our\neveryday routine. We are certainly not living in a utopian age and there are\npotentials of misuse of Internet as well. Across every nook and cranny of\nInternet's sprawling virtual world, there are cyber criminals lurking n\ndangerous alleys to use the very same Internet as malevolent tool to abuse it\nand cause financial, physical and social harm to ordinary people. Failing to\nmanage the widespread spawning of World Wide Web has rendered it weak against\nmisuse. In last few decades especially, Internet has been inundated with\nmalware, ransomware, viruses, Trojans, illegal spy tools and what not created\nwith malignant sentiments. In this paper, we will analyze few of the subverting\nprivacy infrastructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 05:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

One well-known\nmodel is Budyko's system, which represents the coupled evolution of two\nvariables, the ice-line and the average earth surface temperature. The system\ndepends on natural parameters, such as the earth albedo, and the amount A of\ncarbon in the atmosphere.\n  We introduce a 3-dimensional extension of this model in which we regard A as\nthe third coupled variable of the system. We analyze the phase space and\ndependence on parameters, looking for Hopf bifurcations and the birth of\ncycling behavior. We interpret the cycles as climatic oscillations triggered by\nthe sensitivity in our regulation of carbon emissions at extreme temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 02:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-25"}

However, the\ntheoretical literature on magnetocaloric materials still adopts simple\nmolecular-field models in the description of important properties like the\nentropy variation that accompanies applied isothermal magnetic field cycling,\nfor instance. We apply a Green function theoretical treatment for such\nanalysis. The advantages of such approach are well-known since the details of\nthe crystal structure are incorporated in the model, as well as a precise\ndescription of correlations between spins of the transition metal ions can be\nobtained. For the sake of simplcity we adopt a simple one-exchange parameter\nHeisenberg model, and the observed first-order phase transitions are reproduced\nby the introduction of a biquadratic term in the hamiltonian. Good agreement\nwith experimental magnetocaloric data for FeMnAsxP1-x compounds is obtained, as\nwell as an agreement with the magnetic field dependence for these properties\npredicted from the Landau theory of continuous phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 17:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}
