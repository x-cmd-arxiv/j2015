The quintessential example is the secretary problem. If the\nsequence of elements is presented in uniformly random order there is an\nalgorithm that picks the maximum value with probability 1/e, whereas no\nnon-trivial performance guarantee is possible if the elements arrive in\nworst-case order. This work initiates an investigation into relaxations of the\nrandom-ordering hypothesis in online algorithms, by focusing on the secretary\nproblems. We present two sets of properties of distributions over permutations\nas sufficient conditions, called the block-independence property and\nuniform-induced-ordering property. We show these two are asymptotically\nequivalent by borrowing some techniques from the approximation theory.\nMoreover, we show they both imply the existence of secretary algorithms with\nconstant probability of correct selection, approaching the optimal constant 1/e\nin the limit. We substantiate our idea by providing several constructions of\ndistributions that satisfy block-independence. We also show that {\\Theta}(log\nlog n) is the minimum entropy of any permutation distribution that permits\nconstant probability of correct selection in the secretary problem with n\nelements. While our block-independence condition is sufficient for constant\nprobability of correct selection, it is not necessary; however, we present\ncomplexity-theoretic evidence that no simple necessary and sufficient criterion\nexists. Finally, we explore the extent to which the performance guarantees of\nother algorithms are preserved when one relaxes the uniform random ordering\nassumption, obtaining a positive result for Kleinberg's multiple-choice\nsecretary algorithm and a negative result for the weighted bipartite matching\nalgorithm of Korula and Pal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 16:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

This requires detailed knowledge of\nthe velocity field, which is not always available, such as when we only know a\nfew particle trajectories (ocean float data, for example). We propose an\nalternative approximation to topological entropy,applicable to two-dimensional\nflows, which uses only a finite number of trajectories as input data. To\nrepresent these sparse data sets, we use braids, algebraic objects that record\nhow strands, i.e., trajectories, exchange positions with respect to a\nprojection axis. Material curves advected by the flow are represented as\nsimplified loop coordinates. The exponential rate at which a braid deforms\nloops over a finite time interval as the strands exchange places is the\nFinite-Time Braiding Exponent (FTBE) and serves as a proxy for topological\nentropy of the two-dimensional flow. We demonstrate that FTBEs are robust with\nrespect to the value of numerical time step,details of braid representation,\nand choice of initial conditions inside the mixing region. We also explore how\nclosely the FTBEs approximate topological entropy depending on the number and\nlength of trajectories used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 16:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-07"}

In this work, the convergence of the T-DDA is investigated by\ncomparison against the exact results for two spheres separated by a vacuum gap.\nThe error associated with the T-DDA is reported for various sphere sizes,\nrefractive indices and vacuum gap thicknesses. The results reveal that for a\nfixed number of subvolumes, the accuracy of the T-DDA degrades as the\nrefractive index and the sphere diameter to gap ratio increase. A converging\ntrend is observed as the number of subvolumes increases. The large\ncomputational requirements associated with increasing the number of subvolumes,\nand the shape error induced by large sphere diameter to gap ratios, are\nmitigated by using a nonuniform discretization scheme. Nonuniform\ndiscretization is shown to significantly accelerate the convergence of the\nT-DDA, and is thus recommended for near-field thermal radiation simulations.\nErrors less than 5% are obtained in 74% of the cases studied by using up to\n82712 subvolumes.

The winning\nconditions and the voting power of each player are studied under the scope of\nvoting power indices, as well and the collective competence of the group.\nCoalitions and power indices are presented in relation to the Condorcet\ncriterion of optimality in voting systems, and weighted Borda count models are\nasserted as a way to implement them in practice. A special case of coalition\ngames, the weighted majority games (WMG) are presented as a restricted\nrealization in dichotomy choice situations. As a result, the weighted majority\nrules (WMR), an extended version of the simple majority rules, are asserted as\nthe theoretically optimal and complete solution to this type of coalition\ngaming. Subsequently, a generalized version of WMRs is suggested as the means\nto design a voting system that is optimal in the sense of both the correct\nclassification criterion and the Condorcet efficiency criterion. In the scope\nof Pattern Recognition, a generalized risk-based approach is proposed as the\nframework upon which any classifier combination scheme can be applied. A new\nfully adaptive version of WMRs is proposed as a statistically invariant way of\nadjusting the design process of the optimal WMR to the arbitrary\nnon-symmetrical properties of the underlying feature space.

Normal forms are computed in Poisson and symplectic formalisms, by\nmean of invariants and Lie-transforms respectively. The first procedure relies\non the quadratic invariants associated to the symmetries, and is carried out\nusing Gr\\\"obner bases. In the symplectic approach, hinging on the maximally\nsuperintegrable character of the isotropic oscillator, the normal form is\ncomputed {\\it a la} Delaunay, using a generalization of those variables for\n4-DOF systems. Due to the symmetries of the system, isolated as well as circles\nof stationary points and invariant tori should be expected. These solutions\nmanifest themselves rather differently in both approaches, due to the\nconstraints among the invariants versus the singularities associated to the\nDelaunay chart.\n  Taking the generalized van der Waals family as a benchmark, the explicit\nexpression of the Delaunay normalized Hamiltonian up to the second order is\npresented, showing that it may be extended to higher orders in a\nstraightforward way. The search for the relative equilibria is used for\ncomparison of their main features of both treatments.

Recently, new\ngenerations of storage devices have emerged, such as NAND flash-based\nsolid-state drives (SSDs), and with the renewed interest in near-data\nprocessing, they are increasingly becoming acceleration methods that can\naccompany parallel processing.

A\nfundamental problem of cloud-based social video sharing service is that users\nare located globally, who cannot be served with good service quality with a\nsingle cloud provider. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of\ndispersing instant social video contents to multiple cloud providers. The\nchallenge is that inter-cloud social \\emph{propagation} is indispensable with\nsuch multi-cloud social video hosting, yet such inter-cloud traffic incurs\nsubstantial operational cost.

Our\nmeasurement insights of the social propagation allow us to propose a heuristic\nalgorithm with acceptable complexity to solve the optimization problem, by\npartitioning a propagation-weighted social graph in two phases: a\npreference-aware initial cloud provider selection and a propagation-aware\nre-hosting.

Although this relational query semantics has practical\nvalue, we believe that the relational query semantics can only provide limited\ninsight in the structure of the graph data. To address the limits of the\nrelational query semantics, we introduce the all-path query semantics and the\nsingle-path query semantics. Under these path-based query semantics, a query is\nevaluated to all paths satisfying the conditions of the query, or,\nrespectively, to a single such path.\n  While focusing on context-free path queries, we provide a formal framework\nfor evaluating queries on graphs using both path-based query semantics. For the\nall-path query semantics, we show that the result of a query can be represented\nby a finite context-free grammar annotated with node-information relevant for\nderiving each path in the query result. For the single-path query semantics, we\npropose to search for a path of minimum length. We reduce the problem of\nfinding such a path of minimum length to finding a string of minimum length in\na context-free language, and for deriving such a string we propose a novel\nalgorithm.\n  Our initial results show that the path-based query semantics have added\npractical value and that query evaluation for both path-based query semantics\nis feasible, even when query results grow very large.

In this paper, we consider one instance of this challenge,\nthe pixels to torques problem, where an agent must learn a closed-loop control\npolicy from pixel information only. We introduce a data-efficient, model-based\nreinforcement learning algorithm that learns such a closed-loop policy directly\nfrom pixel information. The key ingredient is a deep dynamical model that uses\ndeep auto-encoders to learn a low-dimensional embedding of images jointly with\na predictive model in this low-dimensional feature space. Joint learning\nensures that not only static but also dynamic properties of the data are\naccounted for. This is crucial for long-term predictions, which lie at the core\nof the adaptive model predictive control strategy that we use for closed-loop\ncontrol. Compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods for\ncontinuous states and actions, our approach learns quickly, scales to\nhigh-dimensional state spaces and is an important step toward fully autonomous\nlearning from pixels to torques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 13:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 11:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 16:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
