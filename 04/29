Usually, it is used to learn the relation $x \\to y$ by\nexploiting the regularities in the input $x$.

The motivation of this work is to learn the output dependencies\nthat may lie in the output data in order to improve the prediction accuracy.\nUnfortunately, feedforward networks are unable to exploit the relations between\nthe outputs. In order to overcome this issue, we propose in this paper a\nregularization scheme for training neural networks for these particular tasks\nusing a multi-task framework.

We have explored the feasibility of the flux variation\ngradient (FVG) method for YSOs, using $H$ and $K$ band monitoring data of the\nstar forming region RCW\\,38 obtained at the University Observatory Bochum in\nChile. Simultaneous multi-epoch flux measurements follow a linear relation\n$F_{H}=\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot F_{K}$ for almost all YSOs with large variability\namplitude. The slope $\\beta$ gives the mean $HK$ color temperature $T_{var}$ of\nthe varying component. Because $T_{var}$ is hotter than the dust sublimation\ntemperature, we have tentatively assigned it to stellar variations. If the\ngradient does not meet the origin of the flux-flux diagram, an additional non-\nor less-varying component may be required. If the variability amplitude is\nlarger at the shorter wavelength, e.g. $\\alpha < 0$, this component is cooler\nthan the star (e.g. a circumstellar disk); vice versa, if $\\alpha > 0$, the\ncomponent is hotter like a scattering halo or even a companion star. We here\npresent examples of two YSOs, where the $HK$ FVG implies the presence of a\ncircumstellar disk; this finding is consistent with additional data at $J$ and\n$L$. One YSO shows a clear $K$-band excess in the $JHK$ color-color diagram,\nwhile the significance of a $K$-excess in the other YSO depends on the\nmeasurement epoch. Disentangling the contributions of star and disk it turns\nout that the two YSOs have huge variability amplitudes ($\\sim 3-5$\\,mag). The\n$HK$ FVG analysis is a powerful complementary tool to analyze the varying\ncomponents of YSOs and worth further exploration of monitoring data at other\nwavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 16:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We study linearized\ngravity in the presence of such a wall and find it to differ significantly from\nthe seemingly-analogous case of Dirichlet boundary conditions for fields of\nspins zero and one. In particular, using the Kodama-Ishibashi formalism, the\nboundary condition that must be imposed on scalar-sector master field with\nharmonic time dependence depends explicitly on their frequency. That this\nfeature first arises for spin-2 appears to be related to the second-order\nnature of the equations of motion. It gives rise to a number of novel\ninstabilities, though both global and planar Anti-de Sitter remain (linearly)\nstable in the presence of large-radius Dirichlet cutoffs. The instabilities\narise on the outside of spherical Dirichlet walls, and also inside sufficiently\nlarge such spherical walls in de Sitter space.

Previous to this work, the only known way to transform\nunpredictability into a key that was $\\eps$ indistinguishable from having\nmin-entropy was via pseudorandomness, for example by Goldreich-Levin (GL)\nhardcore bits. This approach has the inherent limitation that from a source\nwith $k$ bits of unpredictability entropy one can derive a key of length (and\nthus HILL entropy) at most $k-2\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ bits. In many settings, e.g.\nwhen dealing with biometric data, such a $2\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ bit entropy loss\nin not an option. Our main technical contribution is a theorem that states that\nin the high entropy regime, unpredictability implies HILL entropy. The loss in\ncircuit size in this argument is exponential in the entropy gap $d$. To\novercome the above restriction, we investigate if it's possible to first\n\"condense\" unpredictability entropy and make the entropy gap small. We show\nthat any source with $k$ bits of unpredictability can be condensed into a\nsource of length $k$ with $k-3$ bits of unpredictability entropy.

Near the center\nof the ring where the inter-layer coupling is negligible, we have Dirac Landau\nlevels which explain the appearance of the zero modes. Although the inter-layer\nhopping amplitudes become finite at higher momenta, the splitting of zero modes\nis exponentially small and they remain almost flat due to the finite artificial\nin-plane component of the magnetic field. The emergence of the density of\nstates peak at the Fermi level would be a hallmark of the ring dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 20:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 16:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 18:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

I\nanalyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,\nself-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a\nthick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a\nsimilar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if\nstar spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be\nregarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary\natmospheres. In this work, including our prior knowledge of H-C-N-O chemistry\nenables me to constrain the C/O ratio without detecting a single carbon-bearing\nmolecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 20:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

In particular, accurate\nrotational excitation rates are needed to interpret microwave and infrared\nobservations of the interstellar gas for nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium\nline formation. Theoretical cross sections and rate coefficients for\ncollisional deexcitation of rotationally excited HF in the vibrational ground\nstate are reported. The quantum-mechanical close-coupling approach implemented\nin the nonreactive scattering code MOLSCAT was applied in the cross section and\nrate coefficient calculations on an accurate 2D HF-He potential energy surface.\nEstimates of rate coefficients for H and H$_2$ colliders were obtained from the\nHF-He collisional data with a reduced-potential scaling approach. The\ncalculation of state-to-state rotational quenching cross sections for HF due to\nHe with initial rotational levels up to $j=20$ were performed for kinetic\nenergies from 10$^{-5}$ to 15000 cm$^{-1}$. State-to-state rate coefficients\nfor temperatures between 0.1 and 3000 K are also presented. The comparison of\nthe present results with previous work for lowly-excited rotational levels\nreveals significant differences. In estimating HF-H$_2$ rate coefficients, the\nreduced-potential method is found to be more reliable than the standard\nreduced-mass approach. The current state-to-state rate coefficient calculations\nare the most comprehensive to date for HF-He collisions. We attribute the\ndifferences between previously reported and our results to differences in the\nadopted interaction potential energy surfaces. The new He rate coefficients can\nbe used in a variety of applications. The estimated H$_2$ and H collision rates\ncan also augment the smaller datasets previously developed for H$_2$ and\nelectrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 21:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

Adopting an exploration policy directly\nonline, without understanding its impact on the production system, may have\nunwanted consequences - the system may sustain large losses, create user\ndissatisfaction, or collect exploration data which does not help improve\nranking quality. An offline framework is thus necessary to let us decide what\npolicy and how we should apply in a production environment to ensure positive\noutcome. Here, we describe such an offline framework.\n  Using the framework, we study a popular exploration policy - Thompson\nsampling. We show that there are different ways of implementing it in\nmulti-result ranking systems, each having different semantic interpretation and\nleading to different results in terms of sustained click-through-rate (CTR)\nloss and expected model improvement. In particular, we demonstrate that\nThompson sampling can act as an online learner optimizing CTR, which in some\ncases can lead to an interesting outcome: lift in CTR during exploration. The\nobservation is important for production systems as it suggests that one can get\nboth valuable exploration data to improve ranking performance on the long run,\nand at the same time increase CTR while exploration lasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 21:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

In this paper we show that a thermodynamic model based on the Maximum\nEntropy Principle, with dynamical prior information, can be constructed that\nadequately describes the dynamics and distribution of firms' growth. Our\ntheoretical framework is tested against a comprehensive data-base of Spanish\nfirms, which covers to a very large extent Spain's economic activity with a\ntotal of 1,155,142 firms evolving along a full decade. We show that the\nempirical exponent of Pareto's law, a rule often observed in the rank\ndistribution of large-size firms, is explained by the capacity of the economic\nsystem for creating/destroying firms, and can be used to measure the health of\na capitalist-based economy. Indeed, our model predicts that when the exponent\nis larger that 1, creation of firms is favored; when it is smaller that 1,\ndestruction of firms is favored instead; and when it equals 1 (matching Zipf's\nlaw), the system is in a full macroeconomic equilibrium, entailing \"free\"\ncreation and/or destruction of firms. For medium and smaller firm-sizes, the\ndynamical regime changes; the whole distribution can no longer be fitted to a\nsingle simple analytic form and numerical prediction is required. Our model\nconstitutes the basis of a full predictive framework for the economic evolution\nof an ensemble of firms that can be potentially used to develop simulations and\ntest hypothetical scenarios, as economic crisis or the response to specific\npolicy measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 21:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

We introduce a novel\nperspective on AdaBoost and random forests that proposes that the two\nalgorithms work for similar reasons. While both classifiers achieve similar\npredictive accuracy, random forests cannot be conceived as a direct\noptimization procedure. Rather, random forests is a self-averaging,\ninterpolating algorithm which creates what we denote as a \"spikey-smooth\"\nclassifier, and we view AdaBoost in the same light. We conjecture that both\nAdaBoost and random forests succeed because of this mechanism. We provide a\nnumber of examples and some theoretical justification to support this\nexplanation. In the process, we question the conventional wisdom that suggests\nthat boosting algorithms for classification require regularization or early\nstopping and should be limited to low complexity classes of learners, such as\ndecision stumps.

In\nsuch case, randomized method is a powerful way to estimate the spectral density\n(or density of states) of $A$. However, randomized methods developed so far for\nestimating spectral densities only extract information from different random\nvectors independently, and the accuracy is therefore inherently limited to\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{N_{v}})$ where $N_{v}$ is the number of random vectors. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that the \"$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{N_{v}})$ barrier\" can\nbe overcome by taking advantage of the correlated information of random vectors\nwhen properly filtered by polynomials of $A$.

By\nrepeatedly applying $A$ to the same set of random vectors and taking different\nlinear combination of the results, we can sweep through the entire spectrum of\n$A$ by building such low rank decomposition at different parts of the spectrum.\nUnder some assumptions, we demonstrate that a robust and efficient\nimplementation of such spectrum sweeping method can compute the spectral\ndensity accurately with $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ computational cost and\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory cost. Numerical results indicate that the new method\ncan significantly outperform existing randomized methods in terms of accuracy.\nAs an application, we demonstrate a way to accurately compute a trace of a\nsmooth matrix function, by carefully balancing the smoothness of the integrand\nand the regularized density of states using a deconvolution procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 00:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 06:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

In this manuscript, we explore the consequences of the hypothesis\nthat initial binding and consecutive rebinding give rise to a bond lifetime\ndensity that is non-Markovian as well. We study the combined effect of the two\nnon-Markovian waiting time probability densities and show that even for very\nshort times the decay of the fraction of occupied receptors deviates from an\nexponential. For long times, dissociation is slower than an exponential and the\nfate of the the steady-state bound receptor fraction critically depends on the\nextent of the deviation, relative to the rebinding time density, from the\nMarkovian limit: The population of occupied receptors may either decay\ncompletely or assume a non-vanishing value for small and strong deviations,\nrespectively.

A high-quality\ntreatment regime can improve patient outcomes while reducing cost, resource\nconsumption, and treatment burden. Thus, there is tremendous interest in\nestimating treatment regimes from observational and randomized studies.\nHowever, the development of treatment regimes for application in clinical\npractice requires the long-term, joint effort of statisticians and clinical\nscientists. In this collaborative process, the statistician must integrate\nclinical science into the statistical models underlying a treatment regime and\nthe clinician must scrutinize the estimated treatment regime for scientific\nvalidity. To facilitate meaningful information exchange, it is important that\nestimated treatment regimes be interpretable in a subject-matter context. We\npropose a simple, yet flexible class of treatment regimes whose members are\nrepresentable as a short list of if-then statements. Regimes in this class are\nimmediately interpretable and are therefore an appealing choice for broad\napplication in practice. We derive a robust estimator of the optimal regime\nwithin this class and demonstrate its finite sample performance using\nsimulation experiments. The proposed method is illustrated with data from two\nclinical trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 03:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

An improved protocol was proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n113, 030401 (2014)] to make the postselected weak measurement dramatically more\nefficient by using entanglement.

Since the secondary's rotation is\npresumable synchronized with the orbital period, its surface strictly divides\ninto a day and night side. Therefore, we may obtain the spectrum of its cool\nside during its transit and of its hot, irradiated side close to its\noccultation. We developed the Virtual Observatory (VO) tool TLISA to search for\nweak lines of a faint companion in a binary system.\n  We identified 53 spectral lines of the secondary in the ultraviolet-blue,\nvisual, and near-infrared XSHOOTER spectra that are strongest close to its\noccultation. We identified 57 (20 additional) lines in available UVES\n(Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph) spectra from 2001. The lines are\nmostly from C II-III and O II, typical for a low-mass star that is irradiated\nand heated by the primary. We verified the orbital period of P = 22597.033201\n+/- 0.00007 s and determined the orbital velocity Ksec = 232.9 (+16.6 / -6.5)\nkm/s of the secondary. The mass of the secondary is Msec = 0.081 (+0.018 /\n-0.010) Msun and, hence, it is not possible to reliably determine a brown dwarf\nor an M-type dwarf nature.\n  Although we identified many emission lines of the secondary's irradiated\nsurface, the resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of our UVES and XSHOOTER\nspectra are not good enough to extract a good spectrum of the secondary's\nnonirradiated hemisphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 07:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

At low\ntemperatures it highlights the local distinguishability of the ground state\nfrom the excited sub-manifolds, thus providing a method to locate quantum phase\ntransitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 09:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 14:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

The analysis of the problem is performed using a\nsecond-order viscoelastic model. The study is carried out in terms of the\nbipolar toroidal system of coordinates where the toroid is rotating about its\naxis of symmetry (z-axis). The problem is solved within the frame of slow flow\napproximation. Therefore, all variables in the governing equations are expanded\nin a power series of angular velocity. A set of successive partial differential\nequations is obtained. The equations of motion governing the first and\nsecond-order are formulated and solved for the first-order only in this paper.\nHowever, the solution of the second-order equations will be the subject of a\npart two of this series of papers. Analytically, Laplace's equation is solved\nvia the usual method of separation of variables. This method shows that, the\nsolution is given in a form of infinite sums over Legendre functions of the\nfirst and second kinds. From the obtained solution it is found that, the\nleading term, W(1), of the velocity represents the Newtonian flow. The\nsecond-order term shows that, the only non vanishing term is the stream\nfunction, which describes a secondary flow. The distribution of the surface\ntraction at the toroid surface is calculated and discussed. Considering\nhydrodynamically conditions, the effects of toroidal geometrical parameters on\nthe flow field are investigated in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 09:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

As an important subclass of\ndoubly nonnegative tensors, the completely positive tensors are further\nstudied.

However, the recent suggestion that a ring system\nmight exist (or have existed) about Rhea, a moon whose shape includes a strong\nprolate component pointed toward Saturn, raises the question of whether rings\naround a triaxial primary can be stable. We study the role of prolateness in\nthe behavior of rings around Rhea and extend our results to similar problems\nsuch as possible rings around exoplanets. Using a Hamiltonian approach, we\npoint out that the dynamical behavior of ring particles is governed by three\ndifferent time scales: the orbital period of the particles, the rotation period\nof the primary, and the precession period of the particles' orbital plane. In\nthe case of Rhea, two of these are well separated from the third, allowing us\nto average the Hamiltonian twice. To study the case of slow rotation of the\nprimary, we also carry out numerical simulations of a thin disk of particles\nundergoing secular effects and damping. For Rhea, the averaging reduces the\nHamiltonian to an oblate potential, under which rings would be stable only in\nthe equatorial plane. This is not the case for Iapetus; rather, it is the lack\nof a prolate component to its shape that allows Iapetus to host rings.\nPlausible exoplanets should mostly be in the same regime as Rhea, though other\noutcomes are possible. The numerical simulations indicate that, even when the\ndouble averaging is irrelevant, rings settle in the equatorial plane on an\napproximately constant time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 11:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

Previously we found a hint that taking into\naccount the effects of injections of small-scale magnetic fields generated,\ne.g., by turbulent dynamo action, into the large-scale galactic dynamo can\nresult in magnetic arm formation. We now investigate the joint roles of an\narm/interarm turbulent diffusivity contrast and injections of small-scale\nmagnetic field on the formation of large-scale magnetic field (\"magnetic arms\")\nin the interarm region. We use the relatively simple \"no-$z$\" model for the\ngalactic dynamo. This involves projection on to the galactic equatorial plane\nof the azimuthal and radial magnetic field components; the field component\northogonal to the galactic plane is estimated from the solenoidality condition.\nWe find that addition of diffusivity gradients to the effect of magnetic field\ninjections makes the magnetic arms much more pronounced. In particular, the\nregular magnetic field component becomes larger in the interarm space compared\nto that within the material arms.The joint action of the turbulent diffusivity\ncontrast and small-scale magnetic field injections (with the possible\nparticipation of other effects previously suggested) appears to be a plausible\nexplanation for the phenomenon of magnetic arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 12:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 18:54:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 09:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct\naccess to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously\ndifficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical\nmeasure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic\ndictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and\ngeographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases\nwhere a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts\nrepresented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies\nlinking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent\nthe pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly\nuneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than\nothers, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to\neach other.

Recent improvements of these\nenumeration algorithms rely on the use of bounds on path resources to discard\npartial solutions. The quality of the bounds determines the performance of the\nalgorithm. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a standard\nprocedure to generate bounds on paths resources in a general setting which\ncovers most resource constrained shortest path problems, among which stochastic\nversions.\n  In that purpose, we introduce a generalization of the resource constrained\nshortest path problem where the resources are taken in a monoid. The resource\nof a path is the monoid sum of the resources of its arcs. The problem consists\nin finding a path whose resource minimizes a non-decreasing cost function of\nthe path resource among the paths that respect a given constraint. Enumeration\nalgorithms are generalized to this framework. We use lattice theory to provide\npolynomial procedures to find good quality bounds. These procedures solve a\ngeneralization of the algebraic path problem, where arc resources belong to a\nlattice ordered monoid. The practical efficiency of the approach is proved\nthrough an extensive numerical study on some deterministic and stochastic\nresource constrained shortest path problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 14:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 16:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

A fiber containing\nentangled CNTs possesses higher loss tangents than a fiber spun from aligned\nCNTs. Liquid densification and polymer infiltration, the two common ways to\nincrease the interfacial friction and thus the fiber's tensile strength and\nmodulus, are found to efficiently reduce the damping coefficient. This is\nbecause the sliding tendency between CNT bundles can also be well suppressed by\nthe high packing density and the formation of covalent polymer cross-links\nwithin the fiber. The CNT/bismaleimide composite fiber exhibited the smallest\nloss tangent, nearly as the same as that of carbon fibers. At a higher level of\nthe assembly structure, namely a multi-ply CNT yarn, the inter-fiber friction\nand sliding tendency obviously influence the yarn's damping performance, and\nthe loss tangent can be tuned within a wide range, as similar to carbon fibers,\nnylon yarns, or cotton yarns.

In this study we analyzed how\nwell nucleosomes are positioned along the DNA as a function of strength of the\npreferential binding, correlation length of the binding energy landscape,\ninteractions between neighboring nucleosomes and others relevant system\nproperties. We analyze different scenarios: designed energy landscapes and\ngenerically disordered ones and derive conditions for good positioning. Using\nanalytic and numerical approaches we find that, even if the binding preferences\nare very weak, synergistic interplay between the interactions and the binding\npreferences is essential for a good positioning of nucleosomes, especially on\ncorrelated energy landscapes.
