We present results for a model of\nAlfven-wave-driven turbulence for three typical open magnetic field structures:\na polar coronal hole, an open flux tube neighboring an equatorial streamer, and\nan open flux tube near a strong-field active region. We compare time-steady,\none-dimensional turbulent heating models (Cranmer et al., 2007) against fully\ntime-dependent three-dimensional reduced-magnetohydrodynamics modeling of BRAID\n(van Ballegooijen et al., 2011). We find that the time-steady results agree\nwell with time-averaged results from BRAID. The time-dependence allows us to\ninvestigate the variability of the magnetic fluctuations and of the heating in\nthe corona. The high-frequency tail of the power spectrum of fluctuations forms\na power law whose exponent varies with height, and we discuss the possible\nphysical explanation for this behavior. The variability in the heating rate is\nbursty and nanoflare-like in nature, and we analyze the amount of energy lost\nvia dissipative heating in transient events throughout the simulation. The\naverage energy in these events is 10^21.91 erg, within the \"picoflare\" range,\nand many events reach classical \"nanoflare\" energies. We also estimated the\nmultithermal distribution of temperatures that would result from the\nheating-rate variability, and found good agreement with observed widths of\ncoronal differential emission measure (DEM) distributions. The results of the\nmodeling presented in this paper provide compelling evidence that turbulent\nheating in the solar atmosphere by Alfven waves accelerates the solar wind in\nopen flux tubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 16:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

At $m_H = 1500$ GeV, the highest mass point tested,\n$\\sigma_H\\cdot\\mathrm{BR}(H\\rightarrow WW)$ for a narrow-width Higgs boson is\nconstrained to be less than 22 fb and 6.6 fb at the 95% CL for the gluon fusion\nand vector-boson fusion production modes, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 17:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 17:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

While a treatment based\non single electron states correctly predicts the character of most materials\nthis approach can fail spectacularly, when the electrostatic repulsion between\nelectrons causes strong correlations. Not only can these favor new and subtle\nforms of order in metals, such as magnetism or superconductivity, they can even\ncause the electrons in a half-filled energy band to lock into position\naltogether, producing a correlated, or Mott insulator. Arguably the most\nextreme manifestation of electronic correlations in dense electronic matter,\nthe transition into the Mott insulating state raises a number of fundamental\nquestions. Foremost among these is the fate of the electronic Fermi surface and\nthe associated charge carrier mass, as the Mott transition is approached at low\ntemperature, which have been particularly controversial in the high temperature\nsuperconducting cuprates. We report the first direct observation of the Fermi\nsurface on the metallic side of a Mott insulating transition by high pressure\nquantum oscillatory measurements in NiS2. Our results point at a large Fermi\nsurface consistent with Luttinger's theorem and a strongly enhanced carrier\neffective mass, suggesting that electron localization occurs via a diverging\neffective mass and concomitant slowing down of charge carriers as predicted\ntheoretically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 17:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

Along with the bulk losses traditionally taken into\naccount, the surface and radiative ones are also considered as the physical\nmechanisms responsible for the plasmon damping. The second and third mechanisms\nare found to be essential for the surface plasmons and depend very differently\non the multipole mode order. The differential equations are obtained which\ndescribe the temporal evolution of every particular mode as that one of a\nlinear oscillator excited by the given external force, and the electron energy\nloss spectra are calculated. The changes in spectrum shape with the impact\nparameter and with the electron passage time are analyzed and found to be in\ngood enough agreement with the data of scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (STEM) experiments. It is shown that, in the general case, a\npronounced contribution to the formation of the loss spectrum is given by the\nboth surface and volume plasmons with low and high multipole indices. In\nparticular, at long electron passage time, the integral loss spectrum which is\ncalculated for the free-electron cluster model contains two main peaks: a broad\npeak from merging of many high-order multipole resonances of the surface\nplasmons and a narrower peak of nearly the same height from merged volume\nplasmons excited by the electrons that travel through the central region of the\ncluster. Comparatively complex dependences of the calculated excitation\ncoefficients and damping constants of various plasmons on the order of the\nexcited multipole result in wide diversity of possible types of the loss\nspectrum even for the same cluster material and should be taken into account in\ninterpretation of corresponding electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 17:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 19:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

To this aim, we study a two-layer multiplex in\nwhich the activity of users can be localized in each of the layer or shared\nbetween them, favoring that neighboring nodes within a layer focus their\nactivity on the same layer. This framework mimics the coexistence and\ncompetition of multiple communication channels, in a way that the prevalence of\na particular communication platform emerges as a result of the localization of\nusers activity in one single interaction layer. Our results indicate that there\nis a transition from localization (use of a preferred layer) to delocalization\n(combined usage of both layers) and that the prevalence of a particular layer\n(in the localized state) depends on their structural properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 17:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

We propose dynamical decoupling\nschemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems\nwith local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we\nintroduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs)\nand show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The\nderived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex\nschemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a\n$2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as\n$O(n \\log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled\nquadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays\nconstructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength\ndecoupling for any $\\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\\ell \\geq 2$, can be\nachieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\\ell-1} \\log n)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 17:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 22:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

During the last 30 years the surface of Pluto has been\ncharacterized, and its variability has been monitored, through continuous\nnear-infrared spectroscopic observations. But in the visible range only few\ndata are available. Aims. The aim of this work is to define the Pluto's\nrelative reflectance in the visible range to characterize the different\ncomponents of its surface, and to provide ground based observations in support\nof the New Horizons mission. Methods. We observed Pluto on six nights between\nMay and July 2014, with the imager/spectrograph ACAM at the William Herschel\nTelescope (La Palma, Spain). The six spectra obtained cover a whole rotation of\nPluto (Prot = 6.4 days). For all the spectra we computed the spectral slope and\nthe depth of the absorption bands of methane ice between 0.62 and 0.90 $\\mu$m.\nTo search for shifts of the center of the methane bands, associated with\ndilution of CH4 in N2, we compared the bands with reflectances of pure methane\nice. Results. All the new spectra show the methane ice absorption bands between\n0.62 and 0.90 $\\mu$m. The computation of the depth of the band at 0.62 $\\mu$m\nin the new spectra of Pluto, and in the spectra of Makemake and Eris from the\nliterature, allowed us to estimate the Lambert coefficient at this wavelength,\nat a temperature of 30 K and 40 K, never measured before. All the detected\nbands are blue shifted, with minimum shifts in correspondence with the regions\nwhere the abundance of methane is higher. This could be indicative of a\ndilution of CH4:N2 more saturated in CH4. The longitudinal and secular\nvariations of the parameters measured in the spectra are in accordance with\nresults previously reported in the literature and with the distribution of the\ndark and bright material that show the Pluto's albedo maps from New Horizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 17:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

The mean shape of first-passage paths is related to the\nmean shape of transition paths by a constant time shift. Since for large\nbarrier height $U$ the mean first-passage time scales exponentially in $U$\nwhile the mean transition path time scales linearly inversely in $U$, the time\nshift between first-passage and transition path shapes is substantial.

Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term\ncarbon cycle because it is responsible for CO$_2$ degassing at ridges and arcs,\nthe return of CO$_2$ to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh,\nweatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence\nof plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent\ngeodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for\nmaintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show\nthat the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are\nuninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial\natmospheric CO$_2$ conditions do not impact the final climate state reached\nwhen the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present\nand silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO$_2$ rich\natmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate\ntectonics on a planet.

With proper detuning, the cavity's internal radiation pressure\ncould either dampen or amplify the vibrations of the mirror; the former is the\nphysical principle behind opto-mechanical cooling by the back-action of cavity\nphotons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 19:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

Since\nz=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma_e) and\nlog(Sigma_1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter\nthat remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For\nSFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both\nSigma_e and Sigma_1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by\ngrowing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main\nsequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma^Q_e,\nSigma^Q_1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same\nmass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma^Q_e declines by a factor of 10\nsince z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma^Q_1. Thus, the common denominator\nfor quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar\ncore, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for\nquenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma^Q_1 at\neach redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped\nsequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and\nquenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative\nto that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and\nSersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs\nreach a maximum central density above Sigma^Q_1 > 9.5 M_sun/kpc^2. This\nthreshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify the\nstar-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 20:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

However, many factors can significantly\nimpact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the\npotentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during\ncosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time\ninterval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant\nrepercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the\nfields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting\nlate-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either\nthe first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we\nexamine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two\ntimescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced\ntogether. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to\nalter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many\norders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.\nSecond, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances\nwhich render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree\nof mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase\ntransition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a\n\"re-overdamping\" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system\nto behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or\nvacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities\nfor early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution. They also\nhighlight the importance of taking into account the time dependence associated\nwith phase transitions in cosmological settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 20:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

By calculating\nthe Fano factor $F$ for the case where only a single channel contributes to the\ntransport, it has been shown that the radiation produced at finite frequency\n$\\omega_0$ close to $e V_0/\\hbar$ and at low temperatures is nonclassical with\nsub-Poissonian statistics ($F<1$). The origin of this effect is the fermionic\nnature of the electrons producing the radiation, which reduces the probability\nof simultaneous emission of two or more photons. However, the Fano factor,\nbeing a time-averaged quantity, offers only limited information about the\nsystem. Here, we calculate the second-order coherence $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ for this\nsource of radiation. We show that due to the interference of two contributions,\ntwo photon processes (leading to bunching) are completely absent at zero\ntemperature for $T=50\\,\\%$. At low temperatures, we find a competition of the\ncontribution due to Gaussian current-current fluctuations (leading to bunching)\nwith the one due to non-Gaussian fluctuations (leading to antibunching). At\nslightly elevated temperatures, the non-Gaussian contribution becomes\nsuppressed whereas the Gaussian contributions remain largely independent of\ntemperature. We show that the competition of the two contributions leads to a\nnonmonotonic behavior of the second-order coherence as a function of time. As a\nresult, $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ obtains a minimal value for times $\\tau^* \\simeq\n\\omega_0^{-1}$. Close to this time, the second-order coherence remains below 1\nat temperatures where the Fano factor is already above 1. We identify realistic\nexperimental parameters that can be used to test the sub-Poissonian nature of\nthe radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 20:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination of\nstar formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshift\ndependent. Theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributions\nfrom the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint.\nExploiting the UltraVISTA catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of local\nultra massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, we\nquantify the role of the two mechanisms from z=2 to 0. We also compare our\nresults to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. At all\nredshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging from\nbeing isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within a\nprojected radius of 500 kpc. In models, progenitors have a systematically\nlarger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than in\nobservations, at all redshifts. Generally, in both observations and models, the\ninferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties.\nOverall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growth\nhistory of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z~2, both\nstar-formation and mergers at 1<z<2, and by mergers alone at z<1. Nonetheless,\ndetailed comparisons still point out to tensions between the expected mass\ngrowth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrect\nprogenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star formation rate and\nmass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 20:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2015 15:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 15:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

In order to apply Lasso technique in the, so called,\nprediction setting where it requires virtually no assumptions on dictionary\nand, moreover, to ensure fast convergence of Lasso estimator, we use a novel\nformulation of the optimization problem based on inversion of the dictionary\nelements. The total estimator of the delta contaminated mixing pdf is obtained\nusing a two-stage iterative procedure. We formulate conditions on the\ndictionary and the unknown mixing density that yield a sharp oracle inequality\nfor the norm of the difference between $g_0 (\\lambda)$ and its estimator and,\nthus, obtain a smaller error than in a minimax setting. Numerical simulations\nand comparisons with the Laguerre functions based estimator recently\nconstructed by Comte and Genon-Catalot (2015) also show advantages of our\nprocedure.

For this purpose\nwe supply a short account of the development in the area which evolved over the\nlast 9 decades, since the discovery of the neutron. The evolution of the\nphysics of the atomic nucleus went through many stages as more data become\navailable. We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons. Clearly statistical mechanics\ndoes not work for such finite system, neither does other theories applicable to\ncondensed matter systems. The richness of nuclear physics stems from these\nrestrictions. New theories and models are presently being developed. Theories\nof the structure and reactions of neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei, called\nexotic nuclei, halo nuclei, or Borromean nuclei deal with the wealth of\nexperimental data available in the last 35 years.

Large-scale disasters may cause\nhuge data loss and connectivity disruption in these networks. As our dependence\non network services increases, the need for novel survivability methods to\nmitigate the effects of disasters on communication networks becomes a major\nconcern. Software-Defined Networking (SDN), by centralizing control logic and\nseparating it from physical equipment, facilitates network programmability and\nopens up new ways to design disaster-resilient networks. On the other hand, to\nfully exploit the potential of SDN, along with data-plane survivability, we\nalso need to design the control plane to be resilient enough to survive network\nfailures caused by disasters. Several distributed SDN controller architectures\nhave been proposed to mitigate the risks of overload and failure, but they are\noptimized for limited faults without addressing the extent of large-scale\ndisaster failures. For disaster resiliency of the control plane, we propose to\ndesign it as a virtual network, which can be solved using Virtual Network\nMapping techniques. We select appropriate mapping of the controllers over the\nphysical network such that the connectivity among the controllers\n(controller-to-controller) and between the switches to the controllers\n(switch-to-controllers) is not compromised by physical infrastructure failures\ncaused by disasters. We formally model this disaster-aware control-plane design\nand mapping problem, and demonstrate a significant reduction in the disruption\nof controller-to-controller and switch-to-controller communication channels\nusing our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 21:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

However, the duration of\nshort STFT frames are inherently limited by the nonstationarity of speech\nsignals. The main contribution of this paper is a demonstration of speech\nenhancement and automatic speech recognition in the presence of reverberation\nand noise by extending the length of analysis windows. We accomplish this\nextension by performing enhancement in the short-time fan-chirp transform\n(STFChT) domain, an overcomplete time-frequency representation that is coherent\nwith speech signals over longer analysis window durations than the STFT. This\nextended coherence is gained by using a linear model of fundamental frequency\nvariation of voiced speech signals. Our approach centers around using a\nsingle-channel minimum mean-square error log-spectral amplitude (MMSE-LSA)\nestimator proposed by Habets, which scales coefficients in a time-frequency\ndomain to suppress noise and reverberation. In the case of multiple\nmicrophones, we preprocess the data with either a minimum variance\ndistortionless response (MVDR) beamformer, or a delay-and-sum beamformer (DSB).\nWe evaluate our algorithm on both speech enhancement and recognition tasks for\nthe REVERB challenge dataset.

A 2D simulation of the electric fields shows that the isolated\npixel-circuitry outside the BPW creates local minimums in the electric\npotentials at the interface between the sensor and buried oxide layers. Thus, a\npart of signal charge is trapped there and is not collected to the BPW. Based\non this result, we modified the placement of the in-pixel circuitry so that the\nelectric fields would converge toward the BPW. We confirmed that the CCE at\npixel borders is successfully improved with the updated model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 01:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

We consider the setup where the single-antenna mobile users operate\nin half- duplex, while each antenna at the BS is capable of full-duplex\ntransmissions, i.e., it can transmit and receive simultaneously using the same\nfrequency spectrum. The fundamental challenge in this system is intra-cell\ninter-node interference, generated by the transmissions of uplink users to the\nreceptions at the downlink users. The key operational challenge is estimating\nand aggregating inter-mobile channel estimates, which can potentially overwhelm\nany gains from full-duplex operation.\n  In this work, we propose a scalable and distributed scheme to optimally\nmanage the inter-node interference by utilizing a \"one- hop information\narchitecture\". In this architecture, the BS only needs to know the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) from the downlink users. Each\nuplink user needs its own SINR, along with a weighted signal-plus-noise metric\nfrom its one-hop neighboring downlink users, which are the downlink users that\nit interferes with. The proposed one-hop information architecture does not\nrequire any network devices to comprehensively gather the vast inter-node\ninterference channel knowledge, and hence significantly reduces the overhead.\nBased on the one-hop information architecture, we design a distributed power\ncontrol algorithm and implement such architecture using overheard feedback\ninformation. We show that, in typical asymptotic regimes with many users and\nantennas, the proposed distributed power control scheme improves the overall\nnetwork utility and reduces the transmission power of the uplink users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 01:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

The Large-Sized Telescope (LST) of CTA\ntargets 20 GeV -- 1 TeV gamma rays and has 1855 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)\ninstalled in the focal plane camera. With the 23 m mirror dish, the night sky\nbackground (NSB) rate amounts to several hundreds MHz per pixel. In order to\nrecord clean images of gamma-ray showers with minimal NSB contamination, a fast\nsampling of the signal waveform is required so that the signal integration time\ncan be as short as the Cherenkov light flash duration (a few ns). We have\ndeveloped a readout board which samples waveforms of seven PMTs per board at a\nGHz rate. Since a GHz FADC has a high power consumption, leading to large heat\ndissipation, we adopted the analog memory ASIC \"DRS4\". The sampler has 1024\ncapacitors per channel and can sample the waveform at a GHz rate. Four channels\nof a chip are cascaded to obtain deeper sampling depth with 4096 capacitors.\nAfter a trigger is generated in a mezzanine on the board, the waveform stored\nin the capacitor array is subsequently digitized with a low speed (33 MHz) ADC\nand transferred via the FPGA-based Gigabit Ethernet to a data acquisition\nsystem. Both a low power consumption (2.64 W per channel) and high speed\nsampling with a bandwidth of $>$300 MHz have been achieved. In addition, in\norder to increase the dynamic range of the readout we adopted a two gain system\nachieving from 0.2 up to 2000 photoelectrons in total. We finalized the board\ndesign for the first LST and proceeded to mass production. Performance of\nproduced boards are being checked with a series of quality control (QC) tests.\nWe report the readout board specifications and QC results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 02:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The multiple memberships of vertices and thus the strong overlaps\namong communities render many detection algorithms invalid. We develop a\nPartial Community Merger Algorithm (PCMA) for detecting communities with\nsignificant overlaps as well as slightly overlapping and disjoint ones. It is a\nbottom-up approach based on properly reassembling partial information of\ncommunities revealed in ego networks of vertices to reconstruct complete\ncommunities. Noise control and merger order are the two key issues in\nimplementing this idea. We propose a novel similarity measure between two\nmerged communities that can suppress noise and an efficient algorithm that\nrecursively merges the most similar pair of communities. The validity and\naccuracy of PCMA is tested against two benchmarks and compared to four existing\nalgorithms. It is the most efficient one with linear complexity and it\noutperforms the compared algorithms when vertices have multiple memberships.\nPCMA is applied to two huge online social networks, Friendster and Sina Weibo.\nMillions of communities are detected and they are of higher qualities than the\ncorresponding metadata groups. We find that the latter should not be regarded\nas the ground-truth of structural communities. The significant overlapping\npattern found in the detected communities confirms the need of new algorithms,\nsuch as PCMA, to handle multiple memberships of vertices in social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 04:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2017 17:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-04"}

Content caching at base stations (BSs) is a\npromising approach to alleviate the backhaul burden and reduce user-perceived\nlatency. In this paper, we consider a wireless caching network where all the\nBSs are connected to a central controller via backhaul links. In such a\nnetwork, users can obtain the required data from candidate BSs if the data are\npre-cached. Otherwise, the user data need to be first retrieved from the\ncentral controller to local BSs, which introduces extra delay over the\nbackhaul. In order to reduce the download delay, the caching placement strategy\nneeds to be optimized. We formulate such a design problem as the minimization\nof the average download delay over user requests, subject to the caching\ncapacity constraint of each BS. Different from existing works, our model takes\nBS cooperation in the radio access into consideration and is fully aware of the\npropagation delay on the backhaul links. The design problem is a mixed integer\nprogramming problem and is highly complicated, and thus we relax the problem\nand propose a low-complexity algorithm. Simulation results will show that the\nproposed algorithm can effectively determine the near-optimal caching placement\nand provide significant performance gains over conventional caching placement\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 04:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

Considering full\nnonlinear formalism, it is assumed that the single-mode field, atom-field\ncoupling and Kerr medium are all $f$-deformed. By using the adiabatic\nelimination method, it is shown that, the Hamiltonian of the considered system\ncan be reduced to an effective Hamiltonian with two two-level atoms and\n$f$-deformed Stark shift. In spite of the fact that, the system seems to be\ncomplicated, under initial conditions which may be prepared for the atoms\n(coherent superposition of their ground and upper states) and the field\n(coherent state), the explicit form of the state vector of the entire system is\nanalytically obtained. Then, the entanglement dynamics between different\nsubsystems (i.e. \"field-two atoms\", \"atom-(field+atom)\" and \"atom-atom\") are\nevaluated through appropriate measures like von Neumann entropy, tangle and\nconcurrence. In addition, the effects of intensity-dependent coupling, deformed\nKerr medium, detuning parameter, deformed Stark shift and multi-photon process\non the considered entanglement measures are numerically analyzed, in detail. It\nis shown that the degree of entanglement between subsystems can be controlled\nby selecting the evolved parameters, suitably. Briefly, the Kerr medium highly\ndecreases the amount of different considered measures of entanglement,\nespecially for two-photon transition.

The SGD achieves low\nbackground by combining a Compton camera scheme with a narrow field-of-view\nactive shield. The Compton camera in the SGD is realized as a hybrid\nsemiconductor detector system which consists of silicon and cadmium telluride\n(CdTe) sensors. The design of the SGD Compton camera has been finalized and the\nfinal prototype, which has the same configuration as the flight model, has been\nfabricated for performance evaluation. The Compton camera has overall\ndimensions of 12 cm x 12 cm x 12 cm, consisting of 32 layers of Si pixel\nsensors and 8 layers of CdTe pixel sensors surrounded by 2 layers of CdTe pixel\nsensors. The detection efficiency of the Compton camera reaches about 15% and\n3% for 100 keV and 511 keV gamma rays, respectively. The pixel pitch of the Si\nand CdTe sensors is 3.2 mm, and the signals from all 13312 pixels are processed\nby 208 ASICs developed for the SGD. Good energy resolution is afforded by\nsemiconductor sensors and low noise ASICs, and the obtained energy resolutions\nwith the prototype Si and CdTe pixel sensors are 1.0--2.0 keV (FWHM) at 60 keV\nand 1.6--2.5 keV (FWHM) at 122 keV, respectively. This results in good\nbackground rejection capability due to better constraints on Compton\nkinematics. Compton camera energy resolutions achieved with the final prototype\nare 6.3 keV (FWHM) at 356 keV and 10.5 keV (FWHM) at 662 keV, respectively,\nwhich satisfy the instrument requirements for the SGD Compton camera (better\nthan 2%). Moreover, a low intrinsic background has been confirmed by the\nbackground measurement with the final prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 07:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

Recently the maximum phase of the current solar\ncycle (SC) 24, in many relations anomalous when compared with solar cycles of\nthe second half of the 20-th century, came to the end. The corresponding phase\nin the GCR intensity cycle is also in progress. In this paper we study\ndifferent aspects of the sunspot, heliospheric and GCR behavior around this\nphase. Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) The maximum phase of the sunspot\nSC 24 ended in 06.2014, the development of the sunspot cycle being similar to\nthose of SC 14, 15 (the Glaisberg minimum). The maximum phase of SC 24 in the\nGCR intensity is still in progress. 2) The inversion of the heliospheric\nmagnetic field consists of three stages, characterized by the appearance of the\nglobal heliospheric current sheet (HCS), connecting all longitudes. In two\ntransition dipole stages beside the global HCS there are additional local HCSs,\nwhile the inversion stage lies between two transition dipole ones and there is\nno global HCS in this stage. The inversion stage of the current SC 24 is the\nlongest when compared with those for SC 21-23. The second transition dipole\nstage and hence the whole inversion period of the heliospheric magnetic field\nin SC 24 provisionally ended in 08.2014. 3) The behavior of the GCR intensity\nin the period of the sunspot maximum phase and the inversion of the\nheliospheric magnetic fields for SC 21-23 demonstrates all the characteristic\nfeatures for this period: the two-gap structure corresponding to two-peak\nstructure in the sunspot activity, and the energy hysteresis. In the current SC\n24 the GCR intensity shows rather unusual features and we should wait for one\nor even two years to see the whole picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 09:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

For the time being there is a long-lasting controversy on how\nthese long-term variations, observed for more than 50 years in the inner\nheliosphere, are formed. It is widely believed that the 11-year variation is\ndue entirely to the toroidal branch of solar activity (the area and number of\nsunspots, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field etc) because of the\ndiffusion, convection and adiabatic energy loss, while the much smaller 22-year\nvariation is caused by the particle drifts connected with the poloidal branch\nof solar activity (the high-latitude solar magnetic fields). At the same time,\nboth past and more recent numerical simulations indicate that the contribution\nof particle drifts could be significant for both 22- and 11-year variations in\nthe GCR intensities. However, even those who agree on the significant influence\nof drifts appear to have different perceptions on the mechanisms of this\ninfluence. In this paper, we present an analysis of the possible causes of the\nfirst point of view (small role of drifts in the 11-year GCR variation) and the\nreasons why one can expect the significant contri- bution of the processes\nconnected with the poloidal branch of solar activity in both types of the\nlong-term variations of the GCR characteristics. Then we briefly discuss some\nnumerical methods suggested in the past and recently and the approaches and\nperspectives for the sought-for methods are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 09:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

In the heavily electron-doped FeSe-based\nsuperconductors, the dominant factors and the exact working mechanism that is\nresponsible for the high Tc need to be clarified. In particular, a clean\ncontrol of carrier concentration remains to be a challenge for revealing how\nsuperconductivity and Fermi surface topology evolves with carrier concentration\nin bulk FeSe. Here, we report the evolution of superconductivity in the FeSe\nthin flake with systematically regulated carrier concentrations by\nliquid-gating technique. High-temperature superconductivity at 48 K can be\nachieved only with electron doping tuned by gate voltage in FeSe thin flake\nwith Tc less than 10 K.

The\ndescription of drift velocity field for the periods of the HMF inversion is\nsuggested, although it has drawbacks. 3) As the conditions in the heliosphere\nare quite different around the sunspot maximum and during the periods of low\nsolar activity (both with respect to the HMF polarity distribution and with the\npresence or absence of the large-scale barriers), the suggestion that both the\nstep-like changes of the GCR intensity and Gnevyshev Gap effect could have the\nsame nature, looks questionable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 10:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

As part of the UVMag\nconsortium created to develop UV facilities in space (e.g. the Arago mission\nproposed to ESA), we are studying an innovative concept of polarimeter that is\nrobust, simple, and efficient on a wide spectral range. The idea, based on the\narticle by Sparks et al. (2012), is to use polarization scramblers to create a\nspatial modulation of the polarization. Along the height of the wedges of the\nscramblers, the thickness of the birefringent material crossed by the light,\nand thus the retardance, vary continuously. This variation creates an intensity\nmodulation of the light related to the entrance polarization state. Analyzing\nthis modulation with a linear polarizer, and dispersing the light spectrally in\nthe orthogonal spatial direction, enables the measurement of the full Stokes\nvector over the entire spectrum. This determination is performed with a\nsingle-shot measurement and without any moving parts in the system. After a\nquick introduction to the concept and optical design, this article presents the\ntolerancing study of the optical bench using this spectropolarimeter. The\nimpact of different error sources, such as, birefringence uncertainty or\ndecenter of the wedges, is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 10:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

A minisuperspace approximation rather than truncation\nis thereby obtained. By this approximation, the spatial averaging scale of\nminisuperspace models is identified with an infrared scale (but not a regulator\nor cut-off) delimiting the modes included in the minisuperspace model. Some\nversions of the models studied here have discrete space or modifications of the\nHamiltonian expected from proposals of loop quantum gravity. They shed light on\nthe question of how minisuperspace models of quantum cosmology can capture\nfeatures of full quantum gravity. While it is shown that modifications of the\nHamiltonian can well be described by minisuperspace truncations, some related\nphenomena such as signature change, confirmed and clarified here for modified\nscalar field theories, require at least a perturbative treatment of\ninhomogeneity beyond a strict minisuperspace model. The new methods suggest a\nsystematic extension of minisuperspace models by a canonical effective\nformulation of perturbative inhomogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 10:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In\ntraditional solids, the resistance to shear is associated with the emergence of\nbroken translational symmetry as exhibited by a non-uniform density pattern,\nwhich results from either minimizing the energy cost or maximizing the entropy\nor both. In this work, we focus on a class of systems, where this paradigm is\nchallenged. We show that shear-driven jamming in dry granular materials is a\ncollective process controlled solely by the constraints of mechanical\nequilibrium. We argue that these constraints lead to a broken translational\nsymmetry in a dual space that encodes the statistics of contact forces and the\ntopology of the contact network. The shear-jamming transition is marked by the\nappearance of this broken symmetry. We extend our earlier work, by comparing\nand contrasting real space measures of rheology with those obtained from the\ndual space. We investigate the structure and behavior of the dual space as the\nsystem evolves through the rigidity transition in two different shear\nprotocols. We analyze the robustness of the shear-jamming scenario with respect\nto protocol and packing fraction, and demonstrate that it is possible to define\na protocol-independent order parameter in this dual space, which signals the\nonset of rigidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 13:10:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 20:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Sulfur forms a range of open and closed S$_n$ species in the gas\nphase, which has led to speculation on the composition of sulfur vapours as a\nfunction of temperature and pressure for over a century. Unlike elemental gases\nsuch as O$_2$ and N$_2$, there is no widely accepted thermodynamic potential\nfor sulfur. Here we combine a first-principles global structure search for the\nlow energy clusters from S$_2$ to S$_8$ with a thermodynamic model for the\nmixed-allotrope system, including the Gibbs free energy for all gas-phase\nsulfur on an atomic basis. A strongly pressure-dependent transition from a\nmixture dominant in S$_2$ to S$_8$ is identified. A universal chemical\npotential function, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}(T,P)$, is proposed with wide utility in\nmodelling sulfurisation processes including the formation of metal chalcogenide\nsemiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 14:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 11:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 18:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

In practice,\nwhen the transformations are estimated from data, this property is lacking.\nThis work addresses the problem of synchronizing transformations that are not\ntransitively consistent. Once the transformations have been synchronized, they\nsatisfy the transitive consistency condition - a transformation from frame $A$\nto frame $C$ is equal to the composite transformation of first transforming A\nto B and then transforming B to C. The coordinate frames correspond to nodes in\na graph and the transformations correspond to edges in the same graph. Two\ndirect or centralized synchronization methods are presented for different graph\ntopologies; the first one for quasi-strongly connected graphs, and the second\none for connected graphs. As an extension of the second method, an iterative\nGauss-Newton method is presented, which is later adapted to the case of affine\nand Euclidean transformations. Two distributed synchronization methods are also\npresented for orthogonal matrices, which can be seen as distributed versions of\nthe two direct or centralized methods; they are similar in nature to standard\nconsensus protocols used for distributed averaging. When the transformations\nare orthogonal matrices, a bound on the optimality gap can be computed.\nSimulations show that the gap is almost right, even for noise large in\nmagnitude. This work also contributes on a theoretical level by providing\nlinear algebraic relationships for transitively consistent transformations.

In particular, a weak magnetic field results in a high\nflux of Galactic cosmic rays that extends to the top of the planetary\natmosphere. We wish to quantify the flux of Galactic cosmic rays to an\nexoplanetary atmosphere as a function of the particle energy and of the\nplanetary magnetic moment. We numerically analyzed the propagation of Galactic\ncosmic-ray particles through planetary magnetospheres. We evaluated the\nefficiency of magnetospheric shielding as a function of the particle energy (in\nthe range 16 MeV $\\le$ E $\\le$ 524 GeV) and as a function of the planetary\nmagnetic field strength (in the range 0 ${M}_\\oplus$ $\\le$ {M} $\\le$ 10\n${M}_\\oplus$).

Blueshifts of about 2 km/s are seen near the entrance of a\ngranular light bridge on the limbward side of the spot. They lie next to a\nstrongly redshifted patch that appeared 6 mins earlier. Both patches are seen\nfor 25 mins until the end of the sequence. The blueshifts coincide with an\nelongated emerging granule, while the redshifts appear at the end of it. In the\nphotosphere, the development of the blueshifts is accompanied by a simultaneous\nincrease in field strength and inclination, with the field becoming nearly\nhorizontal. In the redshifted patch, the magnetic field is equally horizontal\nbut of opposite polarity. An intense brightening is seen in the Ca filtergrams\nover these features, 17 mins after they emerge in the photosphere. The\nbrightening is due to emission in the blue wing of the Ca line, close to its\nknee. Non-LTE inversions reveal that the asymmetric emission is caused by a\ntemperature enhancement of about 700 K between -5.0<log tau<-3.0 and a\nblueshift of 3 km/s at log tau=-2.3. The photospheric blueshifts and redshifts\nseem to be caused by the emergence of a small-scale, flat Omega-loop with\nhighly inclined footpoints of opposite polarity. The gas motions detected in\nthe two footpoints are reminiscent of a siphon flow. The rising loop is\nprobably confined to the lower atmosphere by the overlying sunspot magnetic\nfield and the subsequent interaction may be responsible for temperature\nenhancements in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere. This is the first\ntime that magnetic flux is observed to emerge in the strongly magnetised\nenvironment of sunspots, pushed upward by the convective flows of a granular\nlight bridge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 15:29:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 10:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Moreover, for short\nrods, the percolation threshold is almost insensitive to the defect\nconcentration for all values of $s$. For the RSC model, the growth of clusters\nwith ellipse-like shapes is observed for non-zero values of $s$. The density of\nthe clusters $p_s$ at the critical concentration of defects $d_c$ depends in a\ncomplex manner on the values of $s$ and $k$. For disordered systems, the value\nof $p_s$ tends towards zero in the limits of the very long rods and very small\ncritical concentrations $d_c \\to 0$. In this case, the introduction of defects\nresults in a suppression of rods stacking and in the formation of `empty' or\nloose clusters with very low density. On the other hand, denser clusters are\nformed for ordered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 15:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

Rigorously quantifying the effects of assorted\nmechanisms which might lead to such increased variability, and establishing\nthat these beneficial effects outweigh the immediate costs of sexual\nreproduction has, however, proved problematic. Here we introduce an approach\nwhich does not focus on particular mechanisms influencing factors such as the\nfixation of beneficial mutants or the ability of populations to deal with\ndeleterious mutations, but rather tracks the entire distribution of a\npopulation of genotypes as it moves across vast fitness landscapes. In this\nsetting simulations now show sex robustly outperforming asex across a broad\nspectrum of finite or infinite population models. Concentrating on the additive\ninfinite populations model, we are able to give a rigorous mathematical proof\nestablishing that sexual reproduction acts as a more efficient optimiser of\nmean fitness, thereby solving the problem for this model.

The key ingredient allowing the driver to guide\nthe evader is that the driver is able to display a circumvention maneuver\naround the evader, in such a way that the trajectory of the evader is modified\nin the direction of the repulsion that the driver exerts on the evader. The\nevader can thus be driven towards any given target or along a sufficiently\nsmooth path by controlling a single discrete parameter acting on driver's\nbehavior. The control parameter serves both to activate/deactivate the\ncircumvention mode and to select the clockwise/counterclockwise direction of\nthe circumvention maneuver. Assuming that the circumvention mode is more\nexpensive than the pursuit mode, and that the activation of the circumvention\nmode has a high cost, we formulate an optimal control problem for the optimal\nstrategy to drive the evader to a given target. By means of numerical shooting\nmethods, we find the optimal open-loop control which reduces the number of\nactivations of the circumvention mode to one and which minimizes the time spent\nin the active~mode. Our numerical simulations show that the system is highly\nsensitive to small variations of the control function, and that the cost\nfunction has a nonlinear regime which contributes to the complexity of the\nbehavior of the system, so that a general open-loop control would not be of\npractical interest.
