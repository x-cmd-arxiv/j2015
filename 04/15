Choosing them to be in\nthe fundamental representation allows to obtain, without any extra effort, also\nthe situation in which the color is given by any antisymmetric tensor product\nof the fundamental. Here, we describe the novel case of bosonic auxiliary\nvariables. They can be used equivalently for creating the color charges in the\nfundamental representation. In addition one gets, as a byproduct, the cases\nwhere the particle can have the color sitting in any symmetric tensor product\nof the fundamental. This is obtained by tuning to a different value a Chern\nSimons coupling, present in the model, which controls how the projection is\nachieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Bond-directional\ninteractions offer a novel alternative to Heisenberg exchange and provide the\nbuilding blocks of the Kitaev model, which has a quantum spin liquid (QSL) as\nits exact ground state. Honeycomb iridates, A2IrO3 (A=Na,Li), offer potential\nrealizations of the Kitaev model, and their reported magnetic behaviors may be\ninterpreted within the Kitaev framework. However, the extent of their relevance\nto the Kitaev model remains unclear, as evidence for bond-directional\ninteractions remains indirect or conjectural. Here, we present direct evidence\nfor dominant bond-directional interactions in antiferromagnetic Na2IrO3 and\nshow that they lead to strong magnetic frustration. Diffuse magnetic x-ray\nscattering reveals broken spin-rotational symmetry even above Neel temperature,\nwith the three spin components exhibiting nano-scale correlations along\ndistinct crystallographic directions. This spin-space and real-space\nentanglement directly manifests the bond-directional interactions, provides the\nmissing link to Kitaev physics in honeycomb iridates, and establishes a new\ndesign strategy toward frustrated magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

This paper analyzes whether there is a\nfundamental explanation for the $t$ puzzle. To tackle this question, several\napproaches are followed. Mainly, redefinitions of the dynamical fields are\nstudied, showing that other SME coefficients can be moved to nongravitational\nsectors. It is also found that the gravity SME sector can be consistently\ntreated \\textit{\\`a la} Palatini, and that, in the presence of spacetime\nboundaries, it is possible to correct its action to get the desired equations\nof motion. Moreover, through a reformulation as a Lanczos-type tensor, some\nproblematic features of the $t$ term, which should arise at the\nphenomenological level, are revealed. The most important conclusion of the\npaper is that there is no evidence of a fundamental explanation for the $t$\npuzzle, suggesting that it may be linked to the approximations taken at the\nphenomenological level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 17:43:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 23:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The system is\nrepresented by a network whose nodes have internal states labeled 0 or 1, and\nnodes that are connected can influence each other. The network is perturbed by\na set of external nodes whose states are fixed in 0 or 1 and that can influence\nall nodes of the network. The fixed nodes play the role of opinion makers in\nthe voter model, mutation rates in population genetics or temperature in a\nmagnetic material.

The standard\ndiagrammatic approach to the anomalous Hall effect is limited to computation of\nladder diagrams. We demonstrate that this approach is insufficient. An\nimportant additional contribution comes from diagrams with a single pair of\nintersecting disorder lines. This contribution constitutes an inherent part of\nskew scattering on pairs of closely located defects and essentially modifies\npreviously obtained results for anomalous Hall conductivity.

Many\nbranches of science and engineering are concerned with the question of which\ngiven resource objects can be converted into which target resource objects. For\nexample, information theory studies the conversion of a noisy communication\nchannel instance into an exchange of information. Inspired by work in quantum\ninformation theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of\nquestion. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility\nof combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered\ncommutative monoids. As an intuitive example, we consider chemistry, where\nchemical reaction equations such as \\[ \\mathrm{2H_2 + O_2} \\to \\mathrm{2H_2O}\n\\] are concerned both with a convertibility relation \"$\\to$\" and a combination\noperation \"$+$\". We study ordered commutative monoids from an algebraic and\nfunctional-analytic perspective and derive a wealth of results which should\nhave applications to concrete resource theories, such as a formula for rates of\nconversion. As a running example showing that ordered commutative monoids are\nalso of purely mathematical interest, we exemplify our results with the ordered\ncommutative monoid of graphs.\n  While closely related to both Girard's linear logic and to Deutsch's\nconstructor theory, our framework also produces results very reminiscent of the\nutility theorem of von Neumann and Morgenstern in decision theory and of a\ntheorem of Lieb and Yngvason on thermodynamics.\n  Concerning pure algebra, our observation is that some pieces of algebra can\nbe developed in a context in which equality is not necessarily symmetric, i.e.\nin which the equality relation is replaced by an ordering relation.

We find no evidence for active longitudes persisting over multiple\nobserving seasons. The spot activity appears to be concentrated to two latitude\nregions. The high latitude spots are particularly strong when the spot coverage\nis at a maximum. Using the currently accepted rotation period, we find spot\nstructures to show a trend in the phase-time plot, indicative of a need for a\nlonger period.

These electrons collapse onto the\nnucleus resulting in a net charge $Z_n<Z$ while the positrons are emitted. This\neffect is due to the relativistic dispersion law. The same reason leads to the\ncollapse of electrons to the charged impurity with a large charge number $Z$ in\nnarrow-band gap semiconductors and Weyl semimetals as well as graphene. In this\npaper, a similar effect of electron collapse and charge renormalization is\nfound for donor clusters in SrTiO$_3$ (STO), but with a very different origin.\nAt low temperatures, STO has an enormously large dielectric constant. Because\nof this, the nonlinear dielectric response becomes dominant when the electric\nfield is not too small.

Each sensor aims\nto maximize its inference performance by forming a coalition with other sensors\nand sharing information within the coalition. It is proved that the inference\nperformance is a nondecreasing function of the coalition size. However, in an\nenergy constrained network, the energy consumption of inter-sensor\ncommunication also increases with increasing coalition size, which discourages\nthe formation of the grand coalition (the set of all sensors). In this paper,\nthe formation of non-overlapping coalitions with statistically dependent\nsensors is investigated under a specific communication constraint. We apply a\ngame theoretical approach to fully explore and utilize the information\ncontained in the spatial dependence among sensors to maximize individual sensor\nperformance. Before formulating the distributed inference problem as a\ncoalition formation game, we first quantify the gain and loss in forming a\ncoalition by introducing the concepts of diversity gain and redundancy loss for\nboth estimation and detection problems. These definitions, enabled by the\nstatistical theory of copulas, allow us to characterize the influence of\nstatistical dependence among sensor observations on inference performance. An\niterative algorithm based on merge-and-split operations is proposed for the\nsolution and the stability of the proposed algorithm is analyzed.

We compare the local galaxy density and\nstellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-mass\nVirgo ETGs from the SMAKCED survey and 260 massive ($M>10^{10}$\\Msun) ETGs from\nthe A3D sample. The compact low-mass ETGs in our sample are located in high\ndensity regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, older\nand more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. We\nfind that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocity\ndispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trends\nfound for massive ETGs. Our study supports a scenario where low-mass compact\nETGs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, including\nram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsible\nfor their compact nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 20:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

While this channel has attracted a significant\nattention recently and a number of results have been obtained, including the\nproof of the optimality of Gaussian signalling, an optimal transmit covariance\nmatrix is known for some special cases only and the general case remains an\nopen problem. An iterative custom-made algorithm to find a globally-optimal\ntransmit covariance matrix in the general case is developed in this paper, with\nguaranteed convergence to a \\textit{global} optimum. While the original\noptimization problem is not convex and hence difficult to solve, its minimax\nreformulation can be solved via the convex optimization tools, which is\nexploited here. The proposed algorithm is based on the barrier method extended\nto deal with a minimax problem at hand. Its convergence to a global optimum is\nproved for the general case (degraded or not) and a bound for the optimality\ngap is given for each step of the barrier method. The performance of the\nalgorithm is demonstrated via numerical examples. In particular, 20 to 40\nNewton steps are already sufficient to solve the sufficient optimality\nconditions with very high precision (up to the machine precision level), even\nfor large systems. Even fewer steps are required if the secrecy capacity is the\nonly quantity of interest. The algorithm can be significantly simplified for\nthe degraded channel case and can also be adopted to include the per-antenna\npower constraints (instead or in addition to the total power constraint).

The bright outburst of February 2011 thus offers a unique occasion to\nprobe this peculiar behavior at flux levels not yet observed with present-day\ninstruments. Here we report on the spectral and timing analysis of the data\nfrom the spectrometer SPI on-board INTEGRAL collected during the outburst. At\nthe peak of the outburst the estimated luminosity is ~4.9x10^37 erg/s.

The correlation seems to fall\noff at ~10^37 erg/s, suggesting the transition from a Coulomb-stopping regime\nto a gas-mediated shock regime. From the timing analysis we found that the\npulsar was spinning up during most of the outburst, and that the spin-up rate\ncorrelates with the flux of the source, albeit the correlation is steeper than\nthe one expected from the standard disk accretion theory.

The ability of econometric models to predict\nextreme events strongly relies on their flexibility to account for the highly\nnonlinear and asymmetric dependence observed in financial returns. We develop a\nnew class of flexible Copula models where the evolution of the dependence\nparameters follow a Markov-Switching Generalised Autoregressive Score (SGASC)\ndynamics. Maximum Likelihood estimation is consistently performed using the\nInference Functions for Margins (IFM) approach and a version of the\nExpectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm specifically tailored to this class of\nmodels. The SGASC models are then used to estimate the Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CoVaR), which is defined as the VaR of a given asset conditional\non another asset (or portfolio) being in financial distress, and the\nConditional Expected Shortfall (CoES). Our empirical investigation shows that\nthe proposed SGASC models are able to explain and predict the systemic risk\ncontribution of several European countries. Moreover, we also find that the\nSGASC models outperform competitors using several CoVaR backtesting procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 21:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 17:50:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 16:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-22"}

The linearized\nperturbed equations for Darcy's law coupled with a convection-diffusion\nequation is discretized using finite difference method. The resultant initial\nvalue problem is solved by fourth order Runge-Kutta method, followed by a\nsingular value decomposition of the propagator matrix. Particular attention is\ngiven to the transient behavior rather than the long-time behavior of\neigenmodes predicted by the traditional modal analysis. The transient behaviors\nof the response to external excitations and the response to initial conditions\nare studied by examining the $\\epsilon-$pseudospectra structures and the\nlargest energy growth function. With the help of non-modal stability analysis\nwe demonstrate that at early times the displacement flow is dominated by\ndiffusion and the perturbations decay. At later times, when convection\ndominates diffusion, perturbations grow.

These two important features were\npreviously unattainable in the existing linear stability methods for miscible\nviscous fingering.

While the\nbenefits of this transformation can be massive, there are also tremendous risks\nto our society. After the automation of many production processes and the\ncreation of self-driving vehicles, the automation of society is next. This is\nmoving us to a tipping point and to a crossroads: we must decide between a\nsociety in which the actions are determined in a top-down way and then\nimplemented by coercion or manipulative technologies (such as personalized ads\nand nudging) or a society, in which decisions are taken in a free and\nparticipatory way and mutually coordinated. Modern information and\ncommunication systems (ICT) enable both, but the latter has economic and\nstrategic benefits. The fundaments of human dignity, autonomous\ndecision-making, and democracies are shaking, but I believe that they need to\nbe vigorously defended, as they are not only core principles of livable\nsocieties, but also the basis of greater efficiency and success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 00:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

So far, only two AGNs have been unquestionably confirmed in IFRS\nbased on very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations. In this work,\nwe test the hypothesis that IFRS contain AGNs in a large sample of sources\nusing VLBI. We observed 57 IFRS with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) down\nto a detection sensitivity in the sub-mJy regime and detected compact cores in\n35 sources. Our VLBA detections increase the number of VLBI-detected IFRS from\n2 to 37 and provide strong evidence that most - if not all - IFRS contain AGNs.\nWe find that IFRS have a marginally higher VLBI detection fraction than\nrandomly selected sources with mJy flux densities at arcsec-scales. Moreover,\nour data provide a positive correlation between compactness - defined as the\nratio of milliarcsec- to arcsec-scale flux density - and redshift for IFRS, but\nsuggest a decreasing mean compactness with increasing arcsec-scale radio flux\ndensity. Based on these findings, we suggest that IFRS tend to contain young\nAGNs whose jets have not formed yet or have not expanded, equivalent to very\ncompact objects.

Using\nsingle-top-quark productions and W-helicity fraction measurements at the LHC\nand Tevatron, we perform a global fit to impose constraints on top quark\neffective couplings. We introduce a set of parameters $x_0$, $x_m$, $x_p$ and\n$x_5$ to study the correlations among Wtb effective couplings. We show that (i)\nimproving the measurements of $\\sigma_t$ and $\\sigma_{tW}$ is important in\nconstraining the correlation of $(f_1^R,f_2^R)$ and $(f_2^L,f_2^R)$; (ii)\n$f_1^L$ and $f_2^R$ are anti-correlated, which is sensitive to all the\nexperiments; (iii) $f_1^R$ and $f_2^L$ are also anti-correlated, which is\nsensitive to the W-helicity measurements; (iv) the correlation between $f_2^L$\nand $f_2^R$ is sensitive to the precision of $\\sigma_t$, $\\sigma_{tW}$ and\n$F_0$ measurements. The effective Wtb couplings are studied in three kinds of\nnew physics models: $SU(2)_1 \\times SU(2)_2 \\times U(1)_X$ models, vector-like\nquark models and Littlest Higgs model with and without T-parity. The Wtb\ncouplings in the left-right model and the un-unified model are sensitive to the\nratio of gauge couplings when the new heavy gauge boson's mass ($M_{W'}$) is\nless than several hundred GeV, but the constraint is loose if $M_{W'}>1$ TeV.\nThe Wtb couplings in vector-like quark models and the Littlest Higgs models are\nsensitive to the mixing angles of new heavy particles and SM particles. We also\ninclude the constraints of the oblique T-parameter and Zbb couplings which\nimpose much tighter constraints on the mixing angles. We show that the Wtb\ncoupling constraints become relevant if the precision of single top production\ncross section measurements could be reduced to 1\\% relative to the SM\npredictions in future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 05:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 09:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

In the context of the standard cosmological\nperturbation theory, non-linear couplings of first-order scalar perturbations\ncreate second-order vector perturbations, which generate magnetic fields. Here\nwe reinvestigate the generation of magnetic fields at second-order in\ncosmological perturbations on the basis of our previous study, and extend it by\nnewly taking into account the time evolution of purely second-order vector\nperturbations with a newly developed second-order Boltzmann code. We confirm\nthat the amplitude of magnetic fields from the product-terms of the first-order\nscalar modes is consistent with the result in our previous study. However, we\nfind, both numerically and analytically, that the magnetic fields from the\npurely second-order vector perturbations partially cancel out the magnetic\nfields from one of the product-terms of the first-order scalar modes, in the\ntight coupling regime in the radiation dominated era. Therefore, the amplitude\nof the magnetic fields on small scales, $k \\gtrsim 10~h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, is\nsmaller than the previous estimates. The amplitude of the generated magnetic\nfields at cosmological recombination is about $B_{\\rm rec} =5.0\\times\n10^{-24}~{\\rm Gauss}$ on $k = 5.0 \\times 10^{-1}~h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

In this regard,\nproportional fair (PF) scheduling provides a solution for increasing the users'\nquality of experience by finding a balance between system throughput\nmaximization and user fairness. For this purpose, precise instantaneous channel\nstate information (CSI) needs to be available at the transmitter side to\nperform rate adaptation and scheduling. However, in practical setups, CSI is\nimpaired by, e.g., channel estimation errors, quantization and feedback delays.\nEspecially in centralized cloud based communication systems, where main parts\nof the lower layer processing is shifted to a central entity, high backhaul\nlatency can cause substantial CSI imperfections, resulting in significant\nperformance degradations. In this work robust rate adaptation as well as robust\nPF scheduling are presented, which account for CSI impairments.

The key of our idea is that the pairing symmetry of a\nFermi superfluid is fully dominated by the symmetry of the superfluid order\nparameter, which is essentially given by the product of a pair amplitude and a\npairing interaction. Noting this, in our proposal, we first prepare a $p$-wave\npair amplitude by, not using a $p$-wave interaction, but using the phenomenon\nthat a $p$-wave pair amplitude is induced in an $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas\nwith antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction. In this case, although the system is\nstill in the $s$-wave superfluid state with the $s$-wave superfluid order\nparameter, when one suddenly replaces the $s$-wave interaction by an\nappropriate $p$-wave one (which is possible in cold Fermi gases by using a\nFeshbach resonance technique), the product of the $p$-wave interaction and the\n$p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been prepared in the spin-orbit\ncoupled $s$-wave superfluid state immediately gives a finite $p$-wave\nsuperfluid order parameter. Thus, at least just after this manipulation, the\nsystem is in the $p$-wave superfluid state, being characterized by the\nartificially produced $p$-wave superfluid parameter. In this paper, to assess\nour idea, we evaluate the $p$-wave pair amplitude in a spin-orbit coupled\n$s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas at $T=0$. We determine the region where a large\n$p$-wave pair amplitude is obtained in the phase diagram with respect to the\nstrengths of the $s$-wave pairing interaction and the spin-orbit coupling. We\nalso discuss the accessibility of this optimal region on the viewpoint of the\nsuperfluid phase transition temperature. Since the achievement of a $p$-wave\nsuperfluid Fermi gas is one of the most crucial issues in cold atom physics,\nour proposal would be useful for this exciting challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 09:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-05"}

In essence the procedure amounts to merging or splitting particles by\nstatistical means, throughout the entire simulation volume in question, while\nminimizing a 6-dimensional total distance measure to preserve the physics.\nParticle merging is by far the most demanding procedure when considering\nconservation laws of physics; it amounts to lossy compression of particle phase\nspace data.

The\nresulting catalogue of candidate quasars/AGNs consists of ~3.6 million objects,\nof which about half a million are also flagged as robust candidates, and will\nbe made available on CDS VizieR facility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 10:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

To efficiently run through the\nmodified configuration space, we introduce a modification of the widely used\ncontinuous space worm algorithm, which allows for an efficient sampling at\narbitrary system parameters. We demonstrate how the application of determinants\nachieves an effective blocking of permutations with opposite signs, leading to\na significant relieve of the fermion sign problem.

To tackle these issues, we propose a simple and distributed\nonline optimization policy that leads to no regret, i.e. it allows users to\nmatch (and typically outperform) even the best fixed transmit policy in\nhindsight, irrespective of how the system varies with time. Moreover, to\naccount for the scarcity of perfect channel state information (CSI) in massive\nMIMO systems, we also study the algorithm's robustness in the presence of\nmeasurement errors and observation noise.

Understanding the interplay between the ionizing radiation\nand the dense surrounding gas is very important to explain the origin of these\npeculiar structures, and hence to characterize triggered star formation.\nG46.5-0.2 (G46), a poorly studied galactic HII region located at about 4 kpc,\nis an excellent target to perform this kind of studies. Using public molecular\ndata extracted from the Galactic Ring Survey (13CO J=1-0) and from the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope data archive (12CO, 13CO, C18O J=3-2, HCO+ and HCN\nJ=4-3), and infrared data from the GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL surveys, we perform a\ncomplete study of G46, its molecular environment and the young stellar objects\nplaced around it. We found that G46, probably excited by an O7V star, is\nlocated close to the edge of the GRSMC G046.34-00.21 molecular cloud. It\npresents a horse-shoe morphology opening in direction of the cloud. We observed\na filamentary structure in the molecular gas likely related to G46 and not\nconsiderable molecular emission towards its open border. We found that about\n10' towards the southwest of G46 there are some pillar-like features, shining\nat 8 um and pointing towards the HII region open border. We propose that the\npillar-like features were carved and sculpted by the ionizing flux from G46. We\nfound several young stellar objects likely embedded in the molecular cloud\ngrouped in two main concentrations: one, closer to the G46 open border\nconsisting of Class II type sources, and other one mostly composed by Class I\ntype YSOs located just ahead the pillars-like features, strongly suggesting an\nage gradient in the YSOs distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 14:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

We then apply the\nmethod to a spatially developing unstable system and show that it results in\nreduced-order models of similar quality to the ones obtained with existing\nmethods. Due to the unbounded growth of unstable modes, a practical restriction\non the final impulse response simulation time appears, which can be adjusted\ndepending on the desired order of the reduced-order model.

If it exists, this fifth force\nwould influence the hot X-ray emitting gas filling the potential wells of\ngalaxy clusters. However, it would not influence the clusters' weak lensing\nsignal. Therefore, by comparing X-ray and weak lensing profiles, one can place\nupper limits on the strength of a fifth force. This technique has been\nattempted before using a single, nearby cluster (Coma, $z=0.02$).

Due to\nnon-triviality in finding the exact boundary of such overlapping communities,\nthis problem has become challenging, and therefore huge effort has been devoted\nto detect overlapping communities from the network.\n  In this paper, we present PVOC (Permanence based Vertex-replication algorithm\nfor Overlapping Community detection), a two-stage framework to detect\noverlapping community structure. We build on a novel observation that\nnon-overlapping community structure detected by a standard disjoint community\ndetection algorithm from a network has high resemblance with its actual\noverlapping community structure, except the overlapping part. Based on this\nobservation, we posit that there is perhaps no need of building yet another\noverlapping community finding algorithm; but one can efficiently manipulate the\noutput of any existing disjoint community finding algorithm to obtain the\nrequired overlapping structure. We propose a new post-processing technique that\nby combining with any existing disjoint community detection algorithm, can\nsuitably process each vertex using a new vertex-based metric, called\npermanence, and thereby finds out overlapping candidates with their community\nmemberships. Experimental results on both synthetic and large real-world\nnetworks show that PVOC significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art\noverlapping community detection algorithms in terms of high similarity of the\noutput with the ground-truth structure. Thus our framework not only finds\nmeaningful overlapping communities from the network, but also allows us to put\nan end to the constant effort of building yet another overlapping community\ndetection algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 18:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}
