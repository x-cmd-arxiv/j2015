In the present paper, we show how\nphase-mixing of large-scale parallel propagating Alfv\\'en waves is an efficient\nmechanism for the production of KAWs at wavelengths close to $d_p$ and at large\npropagation angle with respect to the magnetic field. Magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD), Hall-Magnetohydrodynamic (HMHD), and hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM)\nsimulations modeling the propagation of Alfv\\'en waves in inhomogeneous plasmas\nare performed. In linear regime, the role of dispersive effects is singled out\nby comparing MHD and HMHD results. Fluctuations produced by phase-mixing are\nidentified as KAWs through a comparison of polarization of magnetic\nfluctuations and wave group velocity with analytical linear predictions. In the\nnonlinear regime, comparison of HMHD and HVM simulations allows to point out\nthe role of kinetic effects in shaping the proton distribution function. We\nobserve generation of temperature anisotropy with respect to the local magnetic\nfield and production of field-aligned beams. The regions where the proton\ndistribution function highly departs from thermal equilibrium are located\ninside the shear layers, where the KAWs are excited, this suggesting that the\ndistortions of the proton distribution are driven by a resonant interaction of\nprotons with KAW fluctuations. Our results are relevant in configurations where\nmagnetic field inhomogeneities are present, as, for example, in the solar\ncorona where the presence of Alfv\\'en waves has been ascertained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 16:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

For a queried pair of nodes $(u,v)$, the length of a shortest\n$u-v$-path passing through a hub node from $S(u)\\cap S(v)$ is then used as an\nupper bound on the distance between $u$ and $v$.\n  We present a hub labeling which allows us to decode exact distances in sparse\ngraphs using labels of size sublinear in the number of nodes.

Most\nexisting methods for computing finite abstractions utilize some global,\nanalytical function to provide bounds on the reachable sets of nonlinear\nsystems, which can be conservative and lead to spurious transitions in the\nabstract systems. This problem is even more pronounced in the presence of\nimperfect measurements and modelling uncertainties, where control synthesis can\neasily become infeasible due to added spurious transitions. To mitigate this\nproblem, we propose to compute finite abstractions with robustness margins by\nover-approximating the local reachable sets of nonlinear systems. We do so by\nlinearizing the nonlinear dynamics into linear affine systems and keeping track\nof the linearization error. It is shown that this approach provides tighter\napproximations and several numerical examples are used to illustrate of\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 16:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

Recall that such a graph is defined by letting $X_{1},\\ldots\nX_{n},Y_{1},\\ldots Y_{n}$ be $2n$ independent random variables, with uniform\ndistribution on $[0,1]$. We then say that the $i$th of the $n$ vertices is the\ninterval $[X_{i},Y_{i}]$ if $X_{i}<Y_{i}$ and the interval $[Y_{i},X_{i}]$ if\n$Y_{i}<X_{i}$. We then say that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the\ncorresponding intervals intersect.\n  We recall from our MA902 essay that fact that in such a graph, each edge\narises with probability $2/3$, and use this fact to obtain estimates of the\nnumber of edges. Next, we turn to how these edges are spread out, seeing that\n(for example) the range of degrees for the vertices is much larger than\nclassically, by use of an interesting geometrical lemma. We further investigate\nthe maximum degree, showing it is always very close to the maximum possible\nvalue $(n-1)$, and the striking result that it is equal to $(n-1)$ with\nprobability exactly $2/3$.

Recently, solid surface\nstress has been shown also to play an important role in opposing deformation of\nsoft materials. This suggests that the contact line in soft adhesion should\nmimic that of a liquid droplet, with a contact angle determined by surface\ntensions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observe a contact angle of a soft\nsilicone substrate on rigid silica spheres that depends on the surface\nfunctionalization but not the sphere size. However, to satisfy this wetting\ncondition without a divergent elastic stress, the gel separates from its\nsolvent near the contact line. This creates a four-phase contact zone with two\nadditional contact lines hidden below the surface of the substrate. While the\ngeometries of these contact lines are independent of the size of the sphere,\nthe volume of the phase-separated region is not, but rather depends on the\nindentation volume. These results indicate that theories of adhesion of soft\ngels need to account for both the compressibility of the gel network and a\nnon-zero surface stress between the gel and its solvent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 20:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In\nthis course we will learn how to use these computer tools to explore new\nphysics models and get robust numerical predictions to probe them in current\nand future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 22:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 18:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 14:44:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 16:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

For\nthe most massive and dense clouds, including those in which super star clusters\n(SSCs) are born, pressure from reprocessed radiation exerted on dust grains may\ndisperse a significant portion of the cloud mass back into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). Using our radiaton hydrodynamics (RHD) code, Hyperion, we conduct\na series of numerical simulations to test this idea.

Speed of spread means the number of readers\nthat the news has reached in a given time, while width of spread means how far\nthe story has travelled from the news originator within the social network.\nAfter analyzing six stories in a 30-hour time span, we found out that the\nlifetime of a story's popularity among the members of the social network has\nthree phases: Expansion, Front-page, and Saturation. Expansion phase starts\nwhen a story is published and the article spreads from a source node to nodes\nwithin a connected component of the social network. Front-page phase happens\nwhen a news aggregator promotes the story in its front page resulting to the\nstory's faster rate of spread among the connected nodes while at the same time\nspreading the article to nodes outside the original connected component of the\nsocial network. Saturation phase is when the story ages and its rate of spread\nwithin the social network slows down, suggesting popularity saturation among\nthe nodes. Within these three phases, we observed minimal changes on the width\nof information spread as suggested by relatively low increase of the width of\nthe spread's diameter within the social network.

By so doing, the quantum wave shares its\nanalyticity with the EM field and removes the later's singularities and\ndivergences. iii) The conventional U(1) symmetry leaves quantum dynamics\ninvariant under a 'general' Lorentz gauge and impose the standard minimal\ncoupling of the quantum wave to the Em 4-vector potential. One, however, has\nthe option to ask for in-variance under the 'restricted' Lorentz gauge. This in\nturn invites in a coupling to derivatives of the vector potential in addition\nto the minimal coupling and, so to say, enlarges the U(1) symmetry.

First, the secondary relays sense the wireless\nchannel, scanning for a primary network activity, and then convey their reports\nto a secondary base station (SBS). Afterwards, the SBS, based on these reports\nand its own estimation, decides cooperatively the presence of primary\ntransmission or not. In the former scenario, all the secondary nodes start to\nharvest energy from the transmission of primary node(s). In the latter\nscenario, the system initiates secondary communication via a best relay\nselection policy. Performance evaluation of this system is thoroughly\ninvestigated, by assuming realistic channel conditions, i.e., non-identical\nlink-distances, Rayleigh fading, and outdated channel estimation. The detection\nand outage probabilities as well as the average harvested energy are derived as\nnew closed-form expressions. In addition, an energy efficiency optimization\nproblem is analytically formulated and solved, while a necessary condition in\nterms of power consumption minimization for each secondary node is presented.\nFrom a green communications standpoint, it turns out that energy harvesting\ngreatly enhances the resources of secondary nodes, especially when primary\nactivity is densely present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 07:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 23:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 09:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

In this work, we propose a third\napproach, derived as an intrinsic geometrical effect of space-time, which\nprovides repulsive regions under certain circumstances. We demonstrate that the\neffects of repulsive gravity naturally emerge in the field of a homogeneous and\nisotropic universe. To this end, we use an invariant definition of repulsive\ngravity based upon the behavior of the curvature eigenvalues. Moreover, we show\nthat repulsive gravity counterbalances the standard gravitational attraction\ninfluencing both late and early times of the universe evolution. This\nphenomenon leads to the present speed up and to the fast expansion due to the\ninflationary epoch. In so doing, we are able to unify both dark energy and\ninflation in a single scheme, showing that the universe changes its dynamics\nwhen ${\\ddot H\\over H}=-2\\dot H$, at the repulsion onset time where this\ncondition is satisfied.

The models we propose have\na bisimilarity relation and a minimal representative for each equivalence\nclass, and they can be fully explained as coalgebras on a presheaf category on\nan index category of partial orders. First, we provide a set-theoretic model in\nthe form of a a causal case graph, that is a labeled transition system where\nstates and transitions represent markings and firings of the net, respectively,\nand are equipped with causal information. Most importantly, each state has a\nposet representing causal dependencies among past events. Our first result\nshows the correspondence with behavior structure semantics as proposed by\nTrakhtenbrot and Rabinovich. Causal case graphs may be infinitely-branching and\nhave infinitely many states, but we show how they can be refined to get an\nequivalent finitely-branching model. In it, states are equipped with\nsymmetries, which are essential for the existence of a minimal, often\nfinite-state, model. The next step is constructing a coalgebraic model. We\nexploit the fact that events can be represented as names, and event generation\nas name generation. Thus we can apply the Fiore-Turi framework: we model causal\nrelations as a suitable category of posets with action labels, and generation\nof new events with causal dependencies as an endofunctor on this category. Then\nwe define a well-behaved category of coalgebras.

In two previous papers, we showed how seismic inversion techniques\ncould offer strong constraints on such processes by pointing out weaknesses in\ntheoretical models. We now apply our technique to the solar analogues 16CygA\nand 16CygB, being amongst the best targets in the Kepler field to test the\ndiagnostic potential of seismic inversions. The combination of various seismic\nindicators helps to provide more constrained and accurate fundamendal\nparameters for these stars.

We use acoustic radius and mean density inversions to\nimprove our reference models then carry out inversions for a core conditions\nindicator.

The negative magnetoresistance is\nbelieved to demonstrate the chiral anomaly, a long-sought high-energy physics\neffect, in solid-state systems. Recent experiments reveal that Cd3As2, a Dirac\ntopological semimetal, has the record-high mobility and exhibits positive\nlinear magnetoresistance in the orthogonal magnetic and electric field\nconfiguration. However, the negative magnetoresistance in the parallel magnetic\nand electric field configuration remains unveiled. Here, we report the\nobservation of the negative magnetoresistance in Cd3As2 microribbons in the\nparallel magnetic and electric field configuration as large as 66% at 50 K and\neven visible at room temperatures. The observed negative magnetoresistance is\nsensitive to the angle between magnetic and electrical field, robust against\ntemperature, and dependent on the carrier density.

However, factors regulating this motion, and the implications of\nthis motion if perturbed remain incompletely understood. In the current study,\nwe address these questions using a cell-center based model in which cells are\npolarized, motile, and interact with the neighboring cells via harmonic forces.\nWe demonstrate that, a simple evolution rule in which the polarization of any\ncell tends to orient with its velocity vector can induce coherent motion in\ngeometrically confined environments. In addition to recapitulating coherent\nrotational motion observed in experiments, our results also show the presence\nof radial movements and tissue behavior that can vary between solid-like and\nfluid-like. We show that the pattern of coherent motion is dictated by the\ncombination of different physical parameters including number density, cell\nmotility, system size, bulk cell stiffness and stiffness of cell-cell\nadhesions. We further observe that, perturbations in the form of cell division\ncan induce a reversal in the direction of motion when cell division occurs\nsynchronously. Moreover, when the confinement is removed, we see that the\nexisting coherent motion leads to cell scattering, with bulk cell stiffness and\nstiffness of cell-cell contacts dictating the invasion pattern. In summary, our\nstudy provides an in-depth understanding of the origin of coherent rotation in\nconfined tissues, and extracts useful insights into the influence of various\nphysical parameters on the pattern of such movements\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 12:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 18:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

This has\nprovided for a practical examination of an assortment of auction mechanisms\nand, amongst these, two simultaneous ascending price auctions have proved to be\nextremely successful. These are the simultaneous multiround ascending auction\n(SMRA) and the combinatorial clock auction (CCA). It has long been known that,\nfor certain classes of valuation functions, the SMRA provides good theoretical\nguarantees on social welfare. However, no such guarantees were known for the\nCCA.\n  In this paper, we show that CCA does provide strong guarantees on social\nwelfare provided the price increment and stopping rule are well-chosen. This is\nvery surprising in that the choice of price increment has been used primarily\nto adjust auction duration and the stopping rule has attracted little\nattention. The main result is a polylogarithmic approximation guarantee for\nsocial welfare when the maximum number of items demanded $\\mathcal{C}$ by a\nbidder is fixed. Specifically, we show that either the revenue of the CCA is at\nleast an $\\Omega\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{C}^{2}\\log n\\log^2m}\\Big)$-fraction of\nthe optimal welfare or the welfare of the CCA is at least an\n$\\Omega\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\log n}\\Big)$-fraction of the optimal welfare, where $n$\nis the number of bidders and $m$ is the number of items. As a corollary, the\nwelfare ratio -- the worst case ratio between the social welfare of the optimum\nallocation and the social welfare of the CCA allocation -- is at most\n$O(\\mathcal{C}^2 \\cdot \\log n \\cdot \\log^2 m)$. We emphasize that this latter\nresult requires no assumption on bidders valuation functions. Finally, we prove\nthat such a dependence on $\\mathcal{C}$ is necessary.

This creates a\nproblem: why is the universe atypical? We suggest that the problem is an\nartefact created by inappropriate transfer of the traditional concept of\nentropy to the whole universe. Use of what we call the relational $N$-body\nproblem as a model indicates the need to employ two distinct entropy-type\nconcepts to describe the universe. One, which we call entaxy, is novel. It is\nscale-invariant and decreases as the observable universe evolves. The other is\nthe algebraic sum of the dimensionful entropies of branch systems (isolated\nsubsystems of the universe). This conventional additive entropy increases. In\nour model, the decrease of entaxy is fundamental and makes possible the\nemergence of branch systems and their increasing entropy. We have previously\nshown that all solutions of our model divide into two halves at a unique `Janus\npoint' of maximum disorder. This constitutes a common past for two futures each\nwith its own gravitational arrow of time. We now show that these arrows are\nexpressed through the formation of branch systems within which conventional\nentropy increases. On either side of the Janus point, this increase is in the\nsame direction in every branch system. We also show that it is only possible to\nspecify unbiased solution-determining data at the Janus point. Special\nproperties of these `mid-point data' make it possible to develop a rational\ntheory of the typicality of universes whose governing law, as in our model,\ndictates the presence of a Janus point in every solution. If our\nself-gravitating universe is governed by such a law, then the second law of\nthermodynamics is a necessary direct consequence of it and does not need any\nspecial initial condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 14:02:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 08:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

In this light, we first define and analytically\ndescribe the secrecy outage region (SOR), indicating all possible locations of\nan eavesdropper that can cause secrecy outage. After that, the secrecy outage\nprobability (SOP) is derived, and a jamming-beneficial range, i.e., the\ndistance range of eavesdroppers which enables uniform jamming to reduce the\nSOP, is determined. Then, the optimal power allocation between messages and\nartificial noise is investigated for different scenarios. Furthermore, to use\nthe jamming power more efficiently and further reduce the SOP, we propose\ndirectional jamming that generates jamming signals at selected beams (mapped to\nphysical angles) only, and power allocation algorithms are proposed for the\ncases with and without the information of the suspicious area, i.e., possible\nlocations of eavesdroppers.

Here we examine this phenomenon from the\nperspective of matrix representations of the commutator $\\mathcal{H}\n=[H,\\bullet]$ ,with the aim of characterising the multi-particle content of the\nmany-body Majorana mode. To do this we show that, for quadratic fermionic\nsystems, $\\mathcal{H}$ can always be decomposed into sub-blocks that act as\nmulti-particle generalisations of the BdG/Majorana forms that encode\nsingle-particle excitations. In this picture, density-density like interactions\nwill break this exact excitation-number symmetry, coupling different sub-blocks\nand lifting degeneracies so that the eigen-operators of the commutator\n$\\mathcal{H}$ take the form of individual eigenstate transitions $|n\\rangle\n\\langle m|$. However, the Majorana mode is special in that zero-energy\ntransitions are not destroyed by local interactions and it becomes possible to\ndefine many-body Majoranas as the odd-parity zero-energy solutions of\n$\\mathcal{H}$ that minimise their excitation number. This idea forms the basis\nfor an algorithm which is used to characterise the multi-particle excitation\ncontent of the Majorana zero modes of the one-dimensional p-wave lattice model.\nWe find that the multi-particle content of the Majorana zero-mode operators is\nsignificant even at modest interaction strengths. This has important\nconsequences for the stability of Majorana based qubits when they are coupled\nto a heat bath. We will also discuss how these findings differ from previous\nwork regarding the structure of the many-body-Majorana operators and point out\nthat this should affect how certain experimental features are interpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 15:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 11:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 10:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

Nonlinearly, the equations of motion can be recast in\nthe form of expansions in powers of curvatures, and exhibit a remarkable amount\nof structure. In this form, the equations are shown to be invariant under\nscalar gauge transformations, at least up to six orders in derivatives, the\nlowest order term being a Weyl scaling of the metrics. The terms at\ntwo-derivative order reproduce the usual PM gauge transformations on de Sitter\nbackgrounds. At the four-derivative order, a potential obstruction that could\ndestroy the symmetry is shown to vanish. This in turn guarantees the gauge\ninvariance to at least six-orders in derivatives. This is equivalent to adding\nup to 10-derivative corrections to conformal gravity. More generally, we\noutline a procedure for constructing the gauge transformations order by order\nas an expansion in derivatives and comment on the validity and limitations of\nthe procedure.

To\ndate, however, the primary mechanism of disseminating CARS spectroscopic\ninformation is through pseudocolor imagery, which explicitly neglects a vast\nmajority of the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, current paradigms in CARS\nspectral processing do not lend themselves to quantitative sample-to-sample\ncomparability. The primary limitation stems from the need to accurately measure\nthe so-called nonresonant background (NRB) that is used to extract the\nchemically-sensitive Raman information from the raw spectra. Measurement of the\nNRB on a pixel-by-pixel basis is a nontrivial task; thus, reference NRB from\nglass or water are typically utilized, resulting in error between the actual\nand estimated amplitude and phase. In this manuscript, we present a new\nmethodology for extracting the Raman spectral features that significantly\nsuppresses these errors through phase detrending and scaling. Classic methods\nof error-correction, such as baseline detrending, are demonstrated to be\ninaccurate and to simply mask the underlying errors. The theoretical\njustification is presented by re-developing the theory of phase retrieval via\nthe Kramers-Kronig relation, and we demonstrate that these results are also\napplicable to maximum entropy method-based phase retrieval. This new\nerror-correction approach is experimentally applied to glycerol spectra and\ntissue images, demonstrating marked consistency between spectra obtained using\ndifferent NRB estimates, and between spectra obtained on different instruments.\nAdditionally, in order to facilitate implementation of these approaches, we\nhave made many of the tools described herein available free for download.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 15:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

Gas-fired generators have the capability to ramp quickly and\nare often utilized by grid operators to balance intermittency caused by wind\ngeneration. The time-varying output of these generators results in time-varying\nnatural gas consumption rates that impact the pressure and line-pack of the gas\nnetwork. As gas system operators assume nearly constant gas consumption when\nestimating pipeline transfer capacity and for planning operations, such\nfluctuations are a source of risk to their system. Here, we develop a new\nmethod to assess this risk. We consider a model of gas networks with\nconsumption modeled through two components: forecasted consumption and small\nspatio-temporarily varying consumption due to the gas-fired generators being\nused to balance wind. While the forecasted consumption is globally balanced\nover longer time scales, the fluctuating consumption causes pressure\nfluctuations in the gas system to grow diffusively in time with a diffusion\nrate sensitive to the steady but spatially-inhomogeneous forecasted\ndistribution of mass flow. To motivate our approach, we analyze the effect of\nfluctuating gas consumption on a model of the Transco gas pipeline that extends\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico to the Northeast of the United States.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 18:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}
