The reaction\nbetween the melt and crucible materials can modify the composition of the melt,\nwhich typically results in growth failure, or contaminates the crystals. Thus\none principle in designing a flux growth is to select suitable flux and\ncrucible materials thus to avoid any reaction between them.

We calculate stellar evolution models with initial masses of\n70-500 Msun and with initial surface rotational velocities of 0-550 km/s,\ncovering the core-hydrogen burning phase of evolution. We find our rapid\nrotators to be strongly influenced by rotationally induced mixing of helium,\nwith quasi-chemically homogeneous evolution occurring for the fastest rotating\nmodels. Above 160 Msun, homogeneous evolution is also established through mass\nloss, producing pure helium stars at core hydrogen exhaustion independent of\nthe initial rotation rate. Surface nitrogen enrichment is also found for slower\nrotators, even for stars that lose only a small fraction of their initial mass.\nFor models above 150 MZAMS, and for models in the whole considered mass range\nlater on, we find a considerable envelope inflation due to the proximity of\nthese models to their Eddington limit. This leads to a maximum zero-age main\nsequence surface temperature of 56000 K, at 180 Msun, and to an evolution of\nstars in the mass range 50-100 Msun to the regime of luminous blue variables in\nthe HR diagram with high internal Eddington factors. Inflation also leads to\ndecreasing surface temperatures during the chemically homogeneous evolution of\nstars above 180 Msun. The cool surface temperatures due to the envelope\ninflation in our models lead to an enhanced mass loss, which prevents stars at\nLMC metallicity from evolving into pair-instability supernovae.

The size of\na planet's feeding zone in our simulations does not correlate with its final\nmass or semi-major axis, suggesting there is no systematic trend between a\nplanet's mass and its volatile inventory. Instead, we find that the feeding\nzone of any planet more massive than 0.1M_Earth is roughly proportional to the\nradial extent of the initial disk from which it formed: Delta\na~0.25(a_max-a_min), where a_min and a_max are the inner and outer edge of the\ninitial planetesimal disk.

Based on the sensitivity estimates of the SKA and the\nnumber counts of the expected HI galaxies, it is shown that the number counts\nare sufficiently high to compensate for the observational uncertainties of the\nmeasurements and hence allow a statistical detection of the frequency shift.\n[abstract abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 21:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}

The aims of this\nwork are to study at mid-infrared (mid-IR) (1) the Compton-thick nature of\nLINERs; and (2) the disappearance of the dusty torus in LINERs predicted from\ntheoretical arguments. We have compiled all the available low spectral\nresolution mid-IR spectra of LINERs from the IRS/Spitzer (40 LINERs). We have\ncomplemented this sample with Spitzer/IRS spectra of PGQSOs, S1s, S2s, and SBs\nnuclei. We have studied the AGN versus the starburst content in our sample\nusing different indicators: the EW(PAH 6.2um), the strength of the silicate\nfeature at 9.7um, and the steepness of the mid-IR spectra. In 25 out of the 40\nLINERs (i.e., 62.5%) the mid-IR spectra are not SB-dominated, similar to the\ncomparison S2 sample (67.7%). The average spectra of both SB-dominated LINERs\nand S2s are very similar to the average spectrum of the SB class. Moreover, the\naverage spectrum of AGN-dominated LINERs with Lx(2-10keV)>10E+41 erg/s is\nsimilar to the average mid-IR spectrum of AGN-dominated S2s.

Our Survival Bump Hunting (SBH) method is\nbased on a recursive peeling procedure that uses a specific survival peeling\ncriterion derived from non/semi-parametric statistics such as the\nhazards-ratio, the log-rank test or the Nelson-Aalen estimator. To optimize the\ntuning parameter of the model and validate it, we introduce an objective\nfunction based on survival or prediction-error statistics, such as the log-rank\ntest and the concordance error rate. We also describe two alternative\ncross-validation techniques adapted to the joint task of decision-rule making\nby recursive peeling and survival estimation. Numerical analyses show the\nimportance of replicated cross-validation and the differences between criteria\nand techniques in both low and high-dimensional settings. Although several\nnon-parametric survival models exist, none addresses the problem of directly\nidentifying local extrema. We show how SBH efficiently estimates extreme\nsurvival/risk subgroups unlike other models. This provides an insight into the\nbehavior of commonly used models and suggests alternatives to be adopted in\npractice. Finally, our SBH framework was applied to a clinical dataset. In it,\nwe identified subsets of patients characterized by clinical and demographic\ncovariates with a distinct extreme survival outcome, for which tailored medical\ninterventions could be made.

This conclusion is supported by a photometric analysis\nshowing an increase in the total brightness of the comet over the 2014\nobserving period, and dust modeling results showing that the dust emission\npersists over at least three months during both active periods, where we find\nstart dates for emission no later than 2003 July 24+/-10 for the 2003 active\nperiod and 2014 July 28+/-10 for the 2014 active period. From serendipitous\nobservations by the Subaru Telescope in 2004 when the object was apparently\ninactive, we estimate that the nucleus has an absolute R-band magnitude of\nH_R=17.1+/-0.3, corresponding to an effective nucleus radius of r_e~1.00+/-0.15\nkm. The object's faintness at that time means we cannot rule out the presence\nof activity, and so this computed radius should be considered an upper limit.\nWe find that 313P's orbit is intrinsically chaotic, having a Lyapunov time of\nT_l=12000 yr and being located near two 3-body mean-motion resonances with\nJupiter and Saturn, 11J-1S-5A and 10J+12S-7A, yet appears stable over >50 Myr\nin an apparent example of stable chaos. We furthermore find that 313P is the\nsecond main-belt comet, after P/2012 T1 (PANSTARRS), to belong to the ~155 Myr\nold Lixiaohua asteroid family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 03:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In addition to detection,\nthe precise photometry provides phase curves of exoplanets, which can be used\nto study the dynamic processes on these planets. However, the interpretation of\nthese observations can be complicated by the fact that visible-wavelength phase\ncurves can represent both thermal emission and scattering from the planets.\nHere we present a semi-analytical model framework that can be applied to study\nKepler and future visible-wavelength phase curve observations of exoplanets.\nThe model efficiently computes reflection and thermal emission components for\nboth rocky and gaseous planets, considering both homogeneous and inhomogeneous\nsurfaces or atmospheres. We analyze the phase curves of the gaseous planet\nKepler-7 b and the rocky planet Kepler-10 b using the model. In general, we\nfind that a hot exoplanet's visible-wavelength phase curve having a significant\nphase offset can usually be explained by two classes of solutions: one class\nrequires a thermal hot spot shifted to one side of the substellar point, and\nthe other class requires reflective clouds concentrated on the same side of the\nsubstellar point. The two solutions would require very different Bond albedos\nto fit the same phase curve; atmospheric circulation models or eclipse\nobservations at longer wavelengths can effectively rule out one class of\nsolutions, and thus pinpoint the albedo of the planet, allowing decomposition\nof the reflection and the thermal emission components in the phase curve.\nParticularly for Kepler-7 b, reflective clouds located on the west side of the\nsubstellar point can best explain its phase curve. We further derive that the\nreflectivity of the clear part of the atmosphere should be less than 7% and\nthat of the cloudy part should be greater than 80% (abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 04:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The key to successful weak lensing\nexperiments is in measuring the shapes of detected sources to high accuracy. In\nthis document we describe a simulation pipeline designed to simulate radio\nimages of the quality required for weak lensing, and will be typical of SKA\nobservations. We provide as input, images with realistic galaxy shapes which\nare then simulated to produce images as they would have been observed with a\ngiven radio interferometer. We exploit this pipeline to investigate various\nstages of a weak lensing experiment in order to better understand the effects\nthat may impact shape measurement. We first show how the proposed SKA1-Mid\narray configurations perform when we compare the (known) input and output\nellipticities. We then investigate how making small changes to these array\nconfigurations impact on this input-outut ellipticity comparison. We also\ndemonstrate how alternative configurations for SKA1-Mid that are smaller in\nextent, and with a faster survey speeds produce similar performance to those\noriginally proposed. We then show how a notional SKA configuration performs in\nthe same shape measurement challenge. Finally, we describe ongoing efforts to\nutilise our simulation pipeline to address questions relating to how applicable\ncurrent (mostly originating from optical data) shape measurement techniques are\nto future radio surveys. As an alternative to such image plane techniques, we\nlastly discuss a shape measurement technique based on the shapelets formalism\nthat reconstructs the source shapes directly from the visibility data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 06:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}

This modularity makes it also possible to easily\nexpand SoFiA in order to include additional methods as they become available.\nThe full SoFiA distribution, including a dedicated graphical user interface, is\npublicly available for download.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this spirit, we modulate a two dimensional reflecting skip-free\nrandom walk in such a way that its state transitions in the boundary faces and\ninterior of a nonnegative integer quadrant are controlled by Markov chains.\nThis Markov modulated model is referred to as a 2d-QBD process according to\nOzaw (2013). We are interested in the tail asymptotics of its stationary\ndistribution, which has been well studied when there is no Markov modulation.\n  Ozawa studied this tail asymptotics problem, but his answer is not\nanalytically tractable. We think this is because Markov modulation is so free\nto change a model even if the state space for Markov modulation is finite.\nThus, some structure, say, extra conditions, would be needed to make the Markov\nmodulation analytically tractable while minimizing its limitation in\napplication.\n  The aim of this paper is to investigate such structure for the tail\nasymptotic problem.

A major objective for such interfaces\nis high fidelity storage and retrieval of a photon in a collective quantum\nstate of many atoms. This requires long-lived collective superposition states,\nwhich is typically achieved with immobilized atoms. Thermal atomic vapors,\nwhich present a simple and scalable resource, have, so far, only been used for\ncontinuous variable processing or for discrete variable processing on short\ntime scales where atomic motion is negligible. We develop a theory based on the\nconcept of motional averaging to enable room temperature discrete variable\nquantum memories and coherent single photon sources. We show that by choosing\nthe interaction time so that atoms kept under spin protecting conditions can\ncross the light beam several times during the interaction combined with\nsuitable spectral filtering, we erase the \"which atom\" information and obtain\nan efficient and homogenous coupling between all atoms and the light. Heralded\nsingle excitations can thus be created and stored as collective spinwaves,\nwhich can later be read out to produce coherent single photons in a scalable\nfashion. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to scalable quantum\nmemories with a proof-of-principle experiment with room temperature atoms\ncontained in microcells with spin protecting coating, placed inside an optical\ncavity. The experiment is performed at conditions corresponding to a few\nphotons per pulse and clearly demonstrates a long coherence time of the forward\nscattered photons, which is the essential feature of the motional averaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 08:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 12:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

This measure of\nthe IMF normalisation is found to vary non-uniformly with age- and\nmetallicity-sensitive absorption line strengths. Applying single stellar\npopulation models, there are weak but measurable trends of the IMF with age and\nabundance ratio. Accounting for the dependence of stellar population parameters\non velocity dispersion effectively removes these trends, but subsequently\nintroduces a trend with metallicity, such that `heavy' IMFs favour lower\nmetallicities. The correlations are weaker than those found from previous\nstudies directly detecting low-mass stars, suggesting some degree of tension\nbetween the different approaches of measuring the IMF. Resolving these\ndiscrepancies will be the focus of future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 09:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We describe the automated radio-frequency\ninterference (RFI) detection strategy implemented for the MWA, which is based\non the AOFlagger platform, and present 72-231-MHz RFI statistics from 10\nobserving nights. RFI detection removes 1.1% of the data. RFI from digital TV\n(DTV) is observed 3% of the time due to occasional ionospheric or atmospheric\npropagation. After RFI detection and excision, almost all data can be\ncalibrated and imaged without further RFI mitigation efforts, including\nobservations within the FM and DTV bands. The results are compared to a\npreviously published Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) RFI survey. The remote\nlocation of the MWA results in a substantially cleaner RFI environment compared\nto LOFAR's radio environment, but adequate detection of RFI is still required\nbefore data can be analysed. We include specific recommendations designed to\nmake the SKA more robust to RFI, including: the availability of sufficient\ncomputing power for RFI detection; accounting for RFI in the receiver design; a\nsmooth band-pass response; and the capability of RFI detection at high time and\nfrequency resolution (second and kHz-scale respectively).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 10:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-12"}

A key challenge is the identification\nand evaluation of structural similarity between proteins; such analysis can aid\nin understanding the role of newly discovered proteins and help elucidate\nevolutionary relationships between organisms. Computational biologists have\ndeveloped many clever algorithmic techniques for comparing protein structures,\nhowever, all are based on heuristic optimization criteria, making statistical\ninterpretation somewhat difficult.

We show that several existing alignment methods arise as maximum a\nposteriori estimates under specific choices of prior distributions and error\nmodels. Our probabilistic framework is also easily extended to incorporate\nadditional information, which we demonstrate by including primary sequence\ninformation to generate simultaneous sequence-structure alignments that can\nresolve ambiguities obtained using structure alone. This combined model also\nprovides a natural approach for the difficult task of estimating evolutionary\ndistance based on structural alignments. The model is illustrated by comparison\nwith well-established methods on several challenging protein alignment\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 13:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}

The bacterial cable is modeled as an electron queue that\ntransfers electrons from the encoder at the electron donor source, which\ncontrols the desired input electron intensity, to the decoder at the electron\nacceptor sink. Clogging due to local ATP saturation along the cable is modeled.\nA discrete-time scheme is investigated, enabling the computation of an\nachievable rate. The regime of asymptotically small time-slot duration is\nanalyzed, and the optimality of binary input distributions is proved, i.e., the\nencoder transmits at either maximum or minimum intensity, as dictated by the\nphysical constraints of the cable. A dynamic programming formulation of the\ncapacity is proposed, and the optimal binary signaling is determined via policy\niteration. It is proved that the optimal signaling has smaller intensity than\nthat given by the myopic policy, which greedily maximizes the instantaneous\ninformation rate but neglects its effect on the steady-state cable\ndistribution. In contrast, the optimal scheme balances the tension between\nachieving high instantaneous information rate, and inducing a favorable\nsteady-state distribution, such that those states characterized by high\ninformation rates are visited more frequently, thus revealing the importance of\nCSI.

In principle,\nisotropic CTRW only requires knowledge of the step-size, $P_l$, and\nwaiting-time, $P_t$, distributions of the random walk in the medium and it then\ngenerates presumably equivalent walks in free space, which are much faster.\nHere we test the usefulness of CTRW to modelling diffusion of finite-size\nparticles in porous medium generated by loose granular packs. This is done by\nfirst simulating the diffusion process in a model porous medium of mean\ncoordination number, which corresponds to marginal rigidity (the loosest\npossible structure), computing the resulting distributions $P_l$ and $P_t$ as\nfunctions of the particle size, and then using these as input for a free space\nCTRW. The CTRW walks are then compared to the ones simulated in the actual\nmedia.\n  In particular, we study the normal-to-anomalous transition of the diffusion\nas a function of increasing particle size. We find that, given the same $P_l$\nand $P_t$ for the simulation and the CTRW, the latter predicts incorrectly the\nsize at which the transition occurs. We show that the discrepancy is related to\nthe dependence of the effective connectivity of the porous media on the\ndiffusing particle size, which is not captured simply by these distributions.\n  We propose a correcting modification to the CTRW model -- adding anisotropy\n-- and show that it yields good agreement with the simulated diffusion process.\nWe also present a method to obtain $P_l$ and $P_t$ directly from the porous\nsample, without having to simulate an actual diffusion process.

Due to the complex soil-structure\neffect, the estimation of earth pressure is not an easy task; even in the\nstatic case. The problem becomes even more complex for the dynamic (i.e.,\nseismic) analysis and design of retaining walls. Several earth pressure models\nhave been developed over the years to integrate the dynamic earth pressure with\nthe static earth pressure and to improve the design of retaining wall in\nseismic regions. Among all the models, MononobeOkabe (M-O) method is commonly\nused to estimate the magnitude of seismic earth pressures in retaining walls\nand is adopted in design practices around the world (e.g., EuroCode and\nAustralian Standards). However, the M-O method has several drawbacks and does\nnot provide reliable estimate of the earth pressure in many instances. This\nstudy investigates the accuracy of the M-O method to predict the dynamic earth\npressure in sheet pile wall. A 2D plane strain finite element model of the\nwall-soil system was developed in DIANA. The backfill soil was modelled with\nMohr-Coulomb failure criterion while the wall was assumed behave elastically.\nThe numerically predicted dynamic earth pressure was compared with the M-O\nmodel prediction. Further, the point of application of total dynamic force was\ndetermined and compared with the static case. Finally, the applicability of M-O\nmethods to compute the seismic earth pressure was discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 15:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}

A full overlap in real space of wave functions of two conduction\nelectrons leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus, the exchange interaction\ncauses a bond between two conduction electrons in real space. The singlet bond\nis possible because the singlet electrons can simultaneously and permanently\noccupy one spatial ground state, so the average energy of paired electrons is\nlower than the energy of unpaired electrons. Thus, the pairing is a result of\nthe Pauli Exclusion Principle. If conduction electrons, before pairing, are put\non the Fermi surface in the momentum space, then every pair may exist\npermanently in time. The motion of conduction electrons in the crystal may\nprevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion\nis usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. Conduction electrons as\nstanding waves are local and have zero momenta, hence their momenta are\nsynchronous; therefore, weak singlet bonds are stable despite the large kinetic\nenergy on the Fermi surface. The local pairing of standing waves explains the\ninverse isotope effect, Tc-dome, insulator-superconductor transitions and many\nother facts about superconductors.
