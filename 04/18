It has been pointed out,\nhowever, that the estimated long lifetimes of neutron star binaries are in\nconflict with the presence of r-process-enhanced halo stars at metallicities as\nlow as [Fe/H] ~ -3. To resolve this problem, we examine the role of NSMs in the\nearly Galactic chemical evolution on the assumption that the Galactic halo was\nformed from merging sub-halos. We present simple models for the chemical\nevolution of sub-halos with total final stellar masses between 10^4 M_solar and\n2 x 10^8 M_solar. Typical lifetimes of compact binaries are assumed to be 100\nMyr (for 95% of their population) and 1 Myr (for 5%), according to recent\nbinary population synthesis studies. The resulting metallcities of sub-halos\nand their ensemble are consistent with the observed mass-metallicity relation\nof dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, and the metallicity distribution of the\nGalactic halo, respectively. We find that the r-process abundance ratios [r/Fe]\nstart increasing at [Fe/H] <= -3 if the star formation efficiencies are smaller\nfor less massive sub-halos. In addition, the sub-solar [r/Fe] values (observed\nas [Ba/Fe] ~ -1.5 for [Fe/H] < -3) are explained by the contribution from the\nshort-lived (~1 Myr) binaries. Our results indicate that NSMs may have a\nsubstantial contribution to the r-process element abundances throughout the\nGalactic history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 16:29:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Consider a field $K =\n\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha)$, a simple extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, where $\\alpha$ is an\nalgebraic number, and let $f \\in \\mathbb{Q}[t]$ be the minimal polynomial of\n$\\alpha$. In this paper we present a new efficient method to compute Gr\\\"obner\nbases in polynomial rings over the algebraic number field $K$. Starting from\nthe ideas of Noro [Noro, 2006], we proceed by joining $f$ to the ideal to be\nconsidered, adding $t$ as an extra variable. But instead of avoiding\nsuperfluous S-pair reductions by inverting algebraic numbers, we achieve the\nsame goal by applying modular methods as in [Arnold, 2003; B\\\"ohm et al., 2015;\nIdrees et al., 2011], that is, by inferring information in characteristic zero\nfrom information in characteristic $p > 0$. For suitable primes $p$, the\nminimal polynomial $f$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This allows us to\napply modular methods once again, on a second level, with respect to the\nfactors of $f$. The algorithm thus resembles a divide and conquer strategy and\nis in particular easily parallelizable. At current state, the algorithm is\nprobabilistic in the sense that, as for other modular Gr\\\"obner basis\ncomputations, an effective final verification test is only known for\nhomogeneous ideals or for local monomial orderings. The presented timings show\nthat for most examples, our algorithm, which has been implemented in SINGULAR,\noutperforms other known methods by far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 16:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 10:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

I describe here a new membrane approach to\ntidal perturbations based on the general theory of viscoelastic-gravitational\ndeformations of spherically symmetric bodies. The massive membrane approach\nleads to explicit formulas for viscoelastic tidal Love numbers which are exact\nin the limit of zero crust thickness. Formulas for load Love numbers come as a\nbonus. The accuracy on $k_2$ and $h_2$ is better than one percent if the crust\nthickness is less than five percents of the surface radius, which is probably\nthe case for Europa and Titan. The new approach allows for density differences\nbetween crust and ocean and correctly includes crust compressibility. This last\nfeature makes it more accurate than the incompressible propagator matrix\nmethod. Membrane formulas factorize shallow and deep interior contributions,\nthe latter affecting Love numbers mainly through density stratification. I show\nthat a screening effect explains why ocean stratification typically increases\nLove numbers instead of reducing them. For Titan, a thin and dense liquid layer\nat the bottom of a light ocean can raise $k_2$ by more than ten percents. The\nmembrane approach can also deal with dynamical tides in a non-rotating body. I\nshow that a dynamical resonance significantly decreases the tilt factor and may\nthus lead to underestimating Europa's crust thickness.

In this paper, we propose a unified learning framework for\nsimultaneously optimizing both relevance and diversity. Specifically, the\nproblem is formalized as a structural learning framework optimizing\nDiversity-Correlated Evaluation Measures (DCEM), such as ERR-IA, a-NDCG and\nNRBP. Within this framework, the discriminant function is defined to be a\nbi-criteria objective maximizing the sum of the relevance scores and\ndissimilarities (or diversity) among the documents. Relevance and diversity\nfeatures are utilized to define the relevance scores and dissimilarities,\nrespectively. Compared with traditional methods, the advantages of our approach\nlie in that: (1) Directly optimizing DCEM as the loss function is more\nfundamental for the task; (2) Our framework does not rely on explicit diversity\ninformation such as subtopics, thus is more adaptive to real application; (3)\nThe representation of diversity as the feature-based scoring function is more\nflexible to incorporate rich diversity-based features into the learning\nframework. Extensive experiments on the public TREC datasets show that our\napproach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art diversification approaches,\nwhich validate the above advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 18:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 09:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

We report on the portion of a multiwavelength campaign using\nKeck, HST, and Chandra concentrating on a small emitting region, the Crab's\ninner knot, located a fraction of an arcsecond from the pulsar.\n  We find that the knot's radial size, tangential size, peak flux, and the\nratio of the flux to that of the pulsar are correlated with the projected\ndistance of the knot from the pulsar. A new approach, using singular value\ndecomposition for analyzing time series of images, was introduced yielding\nresults consistent with the more traditional methods while some uncertainties\nwere substantially reduced.\n  We exploit the characterization of the knot to discuss constraints on\nstandard shock-model parameters that may be inferred from our observations\nassuming the inner knot lies near to the shocked surface. These include\ninferences as to wind magnetization, shock shape parameters such as incident\nangle and poloidal radius of curvature, as well as the IR/optical emitting\nparticle enthalpy fraction. We find that while the standard shock model gives\ngood agreement with observation in many respects, there remain two puzzles: (a)\nThe observed angular size of the knot relative to the pulsar--knot separation\nis much smaller than expected; (b) The variable, yet high degree of\npolarization reported is difficult to reconcile with a highly relativistic\ndownstream flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 19:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

We show that transient sulfate aerosols\ncould be a signature of exoplanet volcanism, and therefore a geologically\nactive world. A detection of transient aerosols, if linked to volcanism, could\nthus aid in habitability evaluations of the exoplanet. On Earth,\nsubduction-induced explosive eruptions inject SO2 directly into the\nstratosphere, leading to the formation of sulfate aerosols with lifetimes of\nmonths to years. We demonstrate that the rapid increase and gradual decrease in\nsulfate aerosol loading associated with these eruptions may be detectable in\ntransit transmission spectra with future large-aperture telescopes, such as the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and European Extremely-Large Telescope\n(E-ELT) for a planetary system at a distance of 10 pc, assuming an Earth-like\natmosphere, bulk composition, and size. Specifically, we find that a S/N of\n12.1 and 7.1 could be achieved with E-ELT (assuming photon-limited noise) for\nan Earth-analog orbiting a Sun-like star and M5V star, respectively, even\nwithout multiple transits binned together. We propose that the detection of\nthis transient signal would strongly suggest an exoplanet volcanic eruption, if\npotential false positives such as dust storms or bolide impacts can be ruled\nout. Furthermore, because scenarios exist in which O2 can form abiotically in\nthe absence of volcanic activity, a detection of transient aerosols that can be\nlinked to volcanism, along with a detection of O2, would be a more robust\nbiosignature than O2 alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 20:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

This grid is conceptually\nsimilar to the Gauss-Legendre (GL) grid, aligning sample points with\niso-latitude rings located on Legendre polynomial zeros. Unlike the GL grid,\nhowever, the number of grid points per ring varies as a function of latitude,\navoiding expensive over-sampling near the poles and ensuring nearly equal sky\narea per grid point. The ratio between the number of grid points in two\nneighbouring rings is required to be a low-order rational number (3, 2, 1, 4/3,\n5/4 or 6/5) to maintain a high degree of symmetries. Our main motivation for\nthis grid is to solve linear systems using multi-grid methods, and to construct\nefficient preconditioners through pixel-space sampling of the linear operator\nin question. The GL grid is not suitable for these purposes due to its massive\nover-sampling near the poles, leading to nearly degenerate linear systems,\nwhile HEALPix, another commonly used spherical grid, exhibits few symmetries,\nand is therefore computationally inefficient for these purposes.

The focus is on high dimensional vectors having a sparse\nprecision matrix. It is now well understood that when the underlying\ndistribution is Gaussian, the columns of the precision matrix can be estimated\nindependently form one another by solving linear regression problems under\nsparsity constraints. This approach leads to a computationally efficient\nstrategy for estimating the precision matrix that starts by estimating the\nregression vectors, then estimates the diagonal entries of the precision matrix\nand, in a final step, combines these estimators for getting estimators of the\noff-diagonal entries. While the step of estimating the regression vector has\nbeen intensively studied over the past decade, the problem of deriving\nstatistically accurate estimators of the diagonal entries has received much\nless attention. The goal of the present paper is to fill this gap by presenting\nfour estimators---that seem the most natural ones---of the diagonal entries of\nthe precision matrix and then performing a comprehensive empirical evaluation\nof these estimators. The estimators under consideration are the residual\nvariance, the relaxed maximum likelihood, the symmetry-enforced maximum\nlikelihood and the penalized maximum likelihood. We show, both theoretically\nand empirically, that when the aforementioned regression vectors are estimated\nwithout error, the symmetry-enforced maximum likelihood estimator has the\nsmallest estimation error. However, in a more realistic setting when the\nregression vector is estimated by a sparsity-favoring computationally efficient\nmethod, the qualities of the estimators become relatively comparable with a\nslight advantage for the residual variance estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2015 08:56:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 10:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 12:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 14:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

For luminous SNe Ic with $-21 \\lesssim M_{\\rm\npeak}\\lesssim -19.5$~mag, however, both contributions from $^{56}$Ni and NSs\ncannot be neglected without serious modeling, since they are not SLSNe and the\n$^{56}$Ni mass could be up to $\\sim 0.5 M_{\\odot}$. In this paper we propose a\nunified model that contain contributions from both $^{56}$Ni and a nascent NS.\nWe select three luminous SNe Ic-BL, SN~2010ay, SN~2006nx, and SN~14475, and\nshow that, if these SNe are powered by $^{56}$Ni, the ratio of $M_{\\rm Ni}$ to\n$M_{\\rm ej}$ are unrealistic. Alternatively, we invoke the magnetar model and\nthe hybrid ($^{56}$Ni + NS) model and find that they can fit the observations,\nindicating that our models are valid and necessary for luminous SNe Ic. Owing\nto the lack of late-time photometric data, we cannot break the parameter\ndegeneracy and thus distinguish among the model parameters, but we can expect\nthat future multi-epoch observations of luminous SNe can provide stringent\nconstraints on $^{56}$Ni yields and the parameters of putative magnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2015 10:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

In the\nPSelInv method, we compute selected elements of the inverse of a sparse matrix\nA that can be decomposed as A = LU, where L is lower triangular and U is upper\ntriangular. Updating these selected elements of A-1 requires restricted\ncollective communications among a subset of processors within each column or\nrow communication group created by a block cyclic distribution of L and U. We\ndescribe how this type of restricted collective communication can be\nimplemented by using asynchronous point-to-point MPI communication functions\ncombined with a binary tree based data propagation scheme. Because multiple\nrestricted collective communications may take place at the same time in the\nparallel selected inversion algorithm, we need to use a heuristic to prevent\nprocessors participating in multiple collective communications from receiving\ntoo many messages. This heuristic allows us to reduce communication load\nimbalance and improve the overall scalability of the selected inversion\nalgorithm.

The mass accretion rate depends\non mass and time, following power-laws indices 1.4 and -1.5, respectively. A\nmass-dependent accretion threshold is defined below which a star is considered\nas diskless, which results in a distribution of disk lifetimes that matches\nobservations. Stars are evolved at constant angular spin rate while accreting\nand at constant angular momentum when they become diskless. We recover the\nbimodal period distribution seen in several young clusters. The short period\npeak consists mostly of diskless stars and the long period one is mainly\npopulated by accreting stars. Both distributions present a long tail towards\nlong periods and a population of slowly rotating diskless stars is observed at\nall ages. We reproduce the observed correlations between disk fraction and spin\nrate, as well as between IR excess and rotational period. The period-mass\nrelation we derive from the simulations exhibits the same global trend as\nobserved in young clusters only if we release the disk locking assumption for\nthe lowest mass stars. We find that the time evolution of median specific\nangular momentum follows a power law index of -0.65 for accreting stars and of\n-0.53 for diskless stars, a shallower slope that results from a wide\ndistribution of disk lifetimes. Using observationally-documented distributions\nof disk lifetimes, mass accretion rates, and initial rotation periods, and\nevolving an initial population from 1 to 12 Myr, we reproduce the main\ncharacteristics of pre-main sequence angular momentum evolution, which supports\nthe disk locking hypothesis.
