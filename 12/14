The Monte Carlo sampling of the polymer\nconformations on a simple cubic lattice is performed using a variant of the\nWang-Landau algorithm. The results of the calculations of the specific energy,\nspecific heat capacity and gyration radius for several knot topologies show a\ngeneral trend in the behavior of short polymer knots with lengths up to seventy\nlattice units. At low tensile force $F$, knots can be found either in a compact\nor an extended phase, depending if the temperature is low or high. At any\ntemperature, with increasing values of the force $F$, a polymer knot undergoes\na phase transition to a stretched state. This transition is characterized by a\nstrong peak in the heat capacity. There is also a minor peak, which corresponds\nto a transition occurring at low temperatures when the conformations of\npolymers in the stretched phase become swollen with increasing temperatures. It\nis also shown that the behavior of short polymer rings is strongly influenced\nby topological effects. The limitations in the number of accessible energy\nstates due to topological constraints is particularly evident in knots of small\nsize and such that their minimum number of crossing according to the Rolfsen\nknot table is high. An example is provided by a cinquefoil knot $5_1$ with a\nlength of only fifty lattice units. The thermal and mechanical properties of\nknots that can be represented with diagrams having the same minimum number of\ncrossings, are very similar. The size effects on the behavior of polymer knots\nhave been analyzed too. Surprisingly, it is found that topological effects fade\nout very fast with increasing polymer length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 16:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

This approach results in the exact linear time-convolution and\ntime-convolutionless homogeneous generalized master equations (TC-HGME and\nTCL-HGME) which take the dynamics of initial correlations into account via\nmodified memory kernels governing the evolution of the relevant part of a\ndistribution function of a many-particle system. However, to derive the desired\nnonlinear equations (the Boltzmann equation in particular) from this actually\nlinear equation, we should make an additional approximation neglecting the\ntime-retardation of a one-particle distribution function which restricts the\ntime scale by times much smaller than the relaxation time for a one-particle\ndistribution function. To obtain the actually nonlinear evolution equations and\navoid any restrictions on the time scales, we develop a new method, based on\nusing a time-dependent operator converting a distribution function of a total\nsystem into the relevant form, that allows deriving the new exact nonlinear\ngeneralized master equations. To include the initial correlations into\nconsideration, we convert the obtained inhomogeneous nonlinear GME into the\nhomogeneous form by the method which we used for conventional linear GMEs. The\nobtained exact homogeneous nonlinear GME describes all evolution stages of the\nsystem of interest and treats initial correlations on an equal footing with\ncollisions by means of the modified memory kernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 17:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

Given a\nsequence of refined discretizations, we prove that these approximations\nconverge to the Reeb space in the interleaving distance; this also helps to\nquantify the approximation quality of the discretization at a fixed resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 19:25:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 17:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

We observed\nOMC1 n with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 1.3mm and report on our analysis\nof the continuum data.

These sources are thus likely in the\nClass 0 evolutionary phase yet it cannot be excluded that some of the sources\nmight still be pre-stellar cores.

Within\nthe protostellar groups, the typical separation is ~6arcsec (~2500\\,au), which\nis a factor 2-3 smaller than the Jeans length of the parental clumps within\nwhich the protostars are embedded.

The phase space\ndimension equals the number of nodes. The associated parameter space consists\nof one parameter for each node (a decay rate), and three parameters for each\nedge (low and high levels of expression, and a threshold at which expression\nlevels change).

Here we demonstrate that the\nexplanation for this arises from subtle end-of-packet and wavetrain gradient\neffects such as microbreaking events and wave-flow decomposition subtleties\nrequired to conserve mass and momentum and avoid fictitious external forces.\nThese losses occur at both ends of packets and can produce a significant\nnonviscous energy loss for translating and spreading surface wave packets and\nwavetrains. In contrast, monochromatic sound wave packets will be shown to\nasymmetrically distort to conserve momentum. This provides an interesting\nanalogy to how such internal forces arise for gradients of electromagnetic\nwavetrains in media. Such examples show that the interactions of waves in media\nare so system dependent as to be completely nonuniversal. These give further\nexamples of how boundary effects must be carefully considered for conservation\nlaws especially when harmonic functions are involved.

The goals are to\nderive the 4D electron density distributions in the corona by applying a newly\ndeveloped time-dependent tomographic reconstruction method and to compare the\nresults between the two solar minima and with two magnetohydrodynamic models.\nFirst, we confirm that the values of the density distribution in thermodynamic\nmodels are more realistic than in polytropic ones. The tomography provides more\naccurate distributions in the polar regions, and we find that the density in\ntomographic and thermodynamic solutions varies with the solar cycle in both\npolar and equatorial regions.

At\nvariance with previous theories, we predict the effect to be of first order in\nthe spin-orbit coupling, just as the conventional anomalous Hall effect -- the\nonly difference being the spatial separation of the spin orbit interaction and\nthe magnetization. For this reason we name this effect \\textit{nonlocal\nanomalous Hall effect} and predict that its sign will be determined by the sign\nof the spin Hall angle in the metal.

The individualistic behavior of the ants returning\nfrom the danger zone results in a depression of the foraging activity due to\nthe systematic sacrifice of non-informed individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 03:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

The merits of this approach are two folds. First, the core function\nis usually separable, which makes the subproblems at each step decomposable and\nparticularly attractive for parallel computing. Second, the choice of the core\nfunction is quite flexible. Consequently, by carefully specifying this\nfunction, APP-AL may reduce to some standard optimization algorithms. In this\npaper, we pursue enhancing such flexibility by allowing the core function to be\nnon-identical at each step of the algorithm, and name it varying auxiliary\nproblem principle (VAPP-AL). Depending on the problem structure, the varying\ncore functions in VAPP-AL can be adapted to design new flexible and suitable\nalgorithm for parallel and distributed computing. The convergence and O(1/t)\nconvergence rate of VAPP-AL for convex problem with coupling objective and\nconstraints is proved. Moreover, if this function is specialized to be\nquadratic, an o(1/t) convergence rate can be established. Interestingly, the\nnew VAPP framework can cover several variants of Jacobian type augmented\nLagrangian decomposition methods as special cases.

The cross-correlation of intensity maps with\ngalaxy surveys is a robust measure of the power spectrum which diminishes\nsystematics caused by instrumental effects and foreground removal.

But many\nattempts in this direction either aim at solving specialized problems, or\nresult in significantly more complicated methods than SGD. This paper proposes\na new method to estimate a preconditioner such that the amplitudes of\nperturbations of preconditioned stochastic gradient match that of the\nperturbations of parameters to be optimized in a way comparable to Newton\nmethod for deterministic optimization. Unlike the preconditioners based on\nsecant equation fitting as done in deterministic quasi-Newton methods, which\nassume positive definite Hessian and approximate its inverse, the new\npreconditioner works equally well for both convex and non-convex optimizations\nwith exact or noisy gradients. When stochastic gradient is used, it can\nnaturally damp the gradient noise to stabilize SGD. Efficient preconditioner\nestimation methods are developed, and with reasonable simplifications, they are\napplicable to large scaled problems. Experimental results demonstrate that\nequipped with the new preconditioner, without any tuning effort, preconditioned\nSGD can efficiently solve many challenging problems like the training of a deep\nneural network or a recurrent neural network requiring extremely long term\nmemories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 07:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 21:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 06:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

Chemical pulses are surrounded by a predictable dynamic\nregion, outside which bacterial cells cannot resolve gradients above noise. The\nouter boundary of this region initially expands in proportion to $\\sqrt{t}$,\nbefore rapidly contracting. Our analysis also reveals how chemokinesis - the\nincrease in swimming speed many bacteria exhibit when absolute chemical\nconcentration exceeds a threshold - may serve to enhance chemotactic accuracy\nand sensitivity when the chemical landscape is dynamic. More generally, our\nframework provides a rigorous method for partitioning bacteria into populations\nthat are \"near\" and \"far\" from chemical hotspots in complex, rapidly evolving\nenvironments such as those that dominate aquatic ecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 08:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

However, its identification in fMRI data of the human brain is\nnotoriously difficult. Here we propose a new method of fMRI data analysis that\ntackles this problem by considering large-scale, task-related synchronisation\nnetworks. Networks consist of nodes and edges connecting them, where nodes\ncorrespond to voxels in fMRI data, and the weight of an edge is determined via\ntask-related changes in dynamic synchronisation between their respective times\nseries. Based on these definitions, we developed a new data analysis algorithm\nthat identifies edges in a brain network that differentially respond in unison\nto a task onset and that occur in dense packs with similar characteristics.\nHence, we call this approach \"Task-related Edge Density\" (TED). TED proved to\nbe a very strong marker for dynamic network formation that easily lends itself\nto statistical analysis using large scale statistical inference. A major\nadvantage of TED compared to other methods is that it does not depend on any\nspecific hemodynamic response model, and it also does not require a\npresegmentation of the data for dimensionality reduction as it can handle large\nnetworks consisting of tens of thousands of voxels. We applied TED to fMRI data\nof a fingertapping task provided by the Human Connectome Project.

Whenever these\ndisturbances are sufficiently small and long data frames are used, high data\nrates can be achieved and the resource overhead due to the pilots vanishes\nasymptotically. On the other, it is expected that for the next generation of\nmobile networks not only data rate is in the main focus but also low latency,\nshort and sporadic messages, massive connectivity, distributed & adhoc\nprocessing and robustness with respect to asynchronism. Therefore a review of\nseveral well-established principles in communication has been started already.\nA particular implication when using complex-valued pilots is that these values\nhave to be known at the receiver and therefore these resources can not be used\nsimultaneously for user data. For an OFDM-like multicarrier scheme this means\nthat pilot tones (usually placed equidistantly according to the Nyquist\ntheorem) are allocated with globally known amplitudes and phases to reconstruct\nthe channel impulse response.

If the\nstar formation efficiency was around 30 per cent and the gas expulsion happened\non the crossing timescale, this process could expel preferentially stars born\nwith the chemical composition of the proto-cluster gas, while stars with\nspecial composition born in the centre would remain bound. Recently, a sample\nof extragalactic, gas-free, young massive clusters has been identified that has\nthe potential to test the conditions for gas expulsion. We compute a large\nnumber of thin shell models, and calculate if the Rayleigh-Taylor instability\nis able to disrupt the shell before it reaches the escape speed. We show that\nthe success of gas expulsion depends on the compactness index of a star cluster\nC5, proportionate to stellar mass over half-mass radius. For given C5, a\ncertain critical, local star formation efficiency is required to remove the\nrest of the gas. Common stellar feedback processes may not lead to gas\nexpulsion with significant loss of stars above C5 = 1. Considering pulsar winds\nand hypernovae, the limit increases to C5 = 30. If successful, gas expulsion\ngenerally takes place on the crossing timescale. Some observed young massive\nclusters have 1 < C5 < 10 and are gas-free at 10 Myr. This suggests that gas\nexpulsion does not affect their stellar mass significantly, unless powerful\npulsar winds and hypernovae are common in such objects. By comparison to\nobservations, we show that C5 is a better predictor for the expression of\nmultiple populations than stellar mass. The best separation between star\nclusters with and without multiple populations is achieved by a stellar\nwinds-based gas expulsion model, where gas expulsion would occur exclusively in\nstar clusters without multiple populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 11:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The model takes into account (and is based\non) non-local energy and momentum transport across the shock front via emission\nand absorption of high-energy photons. This leads to a pre-acceleration of the\nfluid and pre-amplificaiton of the magnetic fields in the upstream region. Both\nhave drastic implications on the shock structure. The model explains the\npersistence of the shock generated magnetic field at large distances from the\nshock front. The dissipation of this magnetic field results in a continuous\nparticle acceleration within the downstream region. The model suggests two\nnon-uniform emission zones (the downstream and the upstream), that give rise to\nthree emission components with different spectral and temporal properties. A\nunique feature of the model is the existence of an \"attractor\", toward which\nany shock will evolve. This enables us to estimate from first principles the\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton spectrum of the downstream emission.

Gas-solid\nfluidization is a typical nonlinear nonequilibrium system with multiscale\nstructure. In particular, the mesoscale structure in terms of bubbles or\nclusters, which can be characterized by nonequilibrium features in terms of\nbimodal velocity distribution, energy non equipartition, and correlated density\nfluctuations, is the critical factor. Traditional two-fluid model (TFM) and\nrelevant closures depend on local equilibrium and homogeneous distribution\nassumptions, and fail to predict the dynamic, nonequilibrium phenomena in\ncirculating fluidized beds even with fine-grid resolution. In contrast, the\nmesoscale modeling, as exemplified by the energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS)\nmodel, is consistent with the nonequilibrium features in multiphase flows.\nThus, the structure-dependent multi-fluid model conservation equations with the\nEMMS-based mesoscale modeling greatly improve the prediction accuracy in terms\nof flow, mass transfer, and reactions as well as the understanding of flow\nregime transitions.

Previous laboratory and theoretical studies show that the D2O/HDO\nice ratio should be lower than the HDO/H2O ice ratio, if HDO and D2O ices are\nformed simultaneously with H2O ice. In this work, we propose that the observed\nfeature, D2O/HDO > HDO/H2O, is a natural consequence of chemical evolution in\nthe early cold stages of low-mass star formation: 1) majority of oxygen is\nlocked up in water ice and other molecules in molecular clouds, where water\ndeuteration is not efficient, and 2) water ice formation continues with much\nreduced efficiency in cold prestellar/protostellar cores, where deuteration\nprocesses are highly enhanced due to the drop of the ortho-para ratio of H2,\nthe weaker UV radiation field, etc. Using a simple analytical model and gas-ice\nastrochemical simulations tracing the evolution from the formation of molecular\nclouds to protostellar cores, we show that the proposed scenario can\nquantitatively explain the observed HDO/H2O and D2O/HDO ratios. We also find\nthat the majority of HDO and D2O ices are likely formed in cold\nprestellar/protostellar cores rather than in molecular clouds, where the\nmajority of H2O ice is formed. This work demonstrates the power of the\ncombination of the HDO/H2O and D2O/HDO ratios as a tool to reveal the past\nhistory of water ice formation in the early cold stages of star formation and\nwhen the enrichment of deuterium in the bulk of water occurred. Further\nobservations are needed to explore if the relation, D2O/HDO > HDO/H2O, is\ncommon in low-mass protostellar sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 12:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

The role of active dendritic conductances in shaping the LFP has\nreceived little attention, even though such ion channels are known to affect\nthe subthreshold neuron dynamics. Here we used a modeling approach to\ninvestigate the effects of subthreshold dendritic conductances on the LFP.\nUsing a biophysically detailed, experimentally constrained model of a cortical\npyramidal neuron, we identified conditions under which subthreshold active\nconductances are a major factor in shaping the LFP. We found that particularly\nthe hyperpolarization-activated inward current, I$_{\\rm h}$, can have a sizable\neffect and cause a resonance in the LFP power spectral density. To get a\ngeneral, qualitative understanding of how any subthreshold active dendritic\nconductance and its cellular distribution can affect the LFP, we next performed\na systematic study with a simplified model. We found that the effect on the LFP\nis most pronounced when (1) the synaptic drive to the cell is asymmetrically\ndistributed (i.e., either basal or apical), (2) the active conductances are\ndistributed non-uniformly with the highest channel densities near the synaptic\ninput, and (3) when the LFP is measured at the opposite pole of the cell\nrelative to the synaptic input. In summary, we show that subthreshold active\nconductances can be strongly reflected in LFP signals, opening up the\npossibility that the LFP can be used to characterize the properties and\ncellular distributions of active conductances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 13:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The X-ray spectrum is best fitted by a\ntwo-temperature model: a non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) plasma and a\ncollisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma. The NEI plasma is spatially\nconfined within the inner radio shell with kT~0.8 keV, while the CIE plasma is\nfound in more spatially extended regions associated with the outer radio shell\nwith kT~0.2 keV and solar abundance. Therefore, the NEI plasma is attributable\nto the SN ejecta and the CIE plasma is forward shocked interstellar medium. In\nthe NEI plasma, we discovered K-shell line of Al, Ar and Ca for the first time.\nThe abundance pattern and estimated mass of the ejecta are consistent with the\ncore-collapse supernova explosion of a ~30-40 solar mass progenitor star. An Fe\nline with center energy of ~6.4 keV is also found in the southeast (SE) portion\nof the SNR, a close peripheral region around dense molecular clouds. One\npossibility is that the line is associated with the ejecta. However, the\ncentroid energy of ~6.4 keV and the spatial distribution of enhancement near\nthe SE peripheral do not favor this scenario. Since the ~6.4 keV emitting\nregion coincides to the molecular clouds, we propose another possibility that\nthe Fe line is due to K-shell ionization of neutral Fe by the interaction of\nlocally accelerated protons (LECRp) with the surrounding molecular cloud. Both\nthese possibilities, heated ejecta or LECRp origin, are discussed based on the\nobservational facts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 13:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

A nanostructured\nthin-film design could surpass this limit by providing broadband increase in\nthe local density of states in a subwavelength volume and maintaining efficient\ncoupling of light. Here we report a broadband metasurface design, enabling\nefficient and broadband absorption enhancement by direct coupling of incoming\nlight to resonant modes of subwavelength-scale Mie nanoresonators defined in\nthe thin-film active layer. Absorption was investigated both theoretically and\nexperimentally in prototypes consisting of lithographically patterned,\ntwo-dimensional periodic arrays of silicon nanoresonators on silica substrates.\nA crossed trapezoid resonator shape of rectangular cross section is used to\nexcite broadband Mie resonances across the visible and near-IR spectra. Our\nnumerical simulations, optical absorption measurements and photocurrent\nspectral response measurements demonstrate that crossed trapezoidal Mie\nresonant structures enable angle-insensitive, broadband absorption. A short\ncircuit current density of 12.0 mA/cm2 is achieved in 210 nm thick patterned Si\nfilms, yielding a 4-fold increase compared to planar films of the same\nthickness. It is suggested that silicon metasurfaces with Mie resonator arrays\ncan provide useful insights to guide future ultrathin-film solar cell designs\nincorporating nanostructured thin active layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 13:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 07:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

To this aim we define a simple model of the Markovian stochastic\ndynamics on a complex network extended by the additional transition, called\nhereafter the gate. The random skips through the gate, driven by the external\nconstant force, violate the detailed balance in the network. We argue, using a\ntheoretical approach and numerical simulations, that the stationary\ndistributions of the probability fluxes emergent under such conditions\nconverge, regardless of the network topology, to the normal distribution. This\nresult, combined with the stationary fluctuation theorem, permits to show that\nits standard deviation depends directly on the square root of the average flux.\nIn turn, the central result of our paper relates this quantity to the external\nconstant force and the two parameters that entirely characterize the normal\ndistribution of the probability fluxes both close to as well as far from the\nequilibrium state. Also, the other effects that modify these parameters, such\nas the addition of shortcuts to the tree-like network, the extension and\nconfiguration of the gate and a change in the network size studied by means of\nthe computer simulations are widely discussed in terms of the rigorous\ntheoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 13:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

Recent studies show that some hot-Jupiter exoplanets have much\nweaker water absorption features in their near-infrared spectra than predicted.\nThe low amplitude of water signatures could be explained by very low water\nabundances, which may be a sign that water was depleted in the protoplanetary\ndisk at the planet's formation location, but it is unclear whether this level\nof depletion can actually occur. Alternatively, these weak signals could be the\nresult of obscuration by clouds or hazes, as found in some optical spectra.\nHere we report results from a comparative study of ten hot Jupiters covering\nthe wavelength range 0.3-5 micrometres, which allows us to resolve both the\noptical scattering and infrared molecular absorption spectroscopically. Our\nresults reveal a diverse group of hot Jupiters that exhibit a continuum from\nclear to cloudy atmospheres. We find that the difference between the planetary\nradius measured at optical and infrared wavelengths is an effective metric for\ndistinguishing different atmosphere types. The difference correlates with the\nspectral strength of water, so that strong water absorption lines are seen in\nclear-atmosphere planets and the weakest features are associated with clouds\nand hazes. This result strongly suggests that primordial water depletion during\nformation is unlikely and that clouds and hazes are the cause of weaker\nspectral signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 14:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

Given its depth and sky coverage, XXL is\nparticularly suited to systematically unveiling the clustering of X-ray\nclusters and to identifying superstructures in a homogeneous X-ray sample down\nto the typical mass scale of a local massive cluster.

Making full use of the ROOT\ngeometry library with additional ROBAST classes, we are able to build the\ncomplex optics geometries typically used in CR experiments and ground-based\ngamma-ray telescopes. We introduce ROBAST and its features developed for CR\nexperiments, and show several successful applications for CTA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 15:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-22"}

The impact of food association learning on diet dynamics, inspired\nby a pilot study conducted among Arizona children in Pre-Kindergarten to 8th\ngrades, is used to build simple population-level learning models.\nQualitatively, mathematical studies are used to highlight the possible\nramifications of instruction, learning in nutrition, and health at the\ncommunity level. Model results suggest that nutrition education programs at the\npopulation-level have minimal impact on improving eating behaviors, findings\nthat agree with prior field studies. Hence, the incorporation of food\nassociation learning may be a better strategy for creating resilient\ncommunities of healthy and non-healthy eaters. A \\textit{Ratatouille} effect\ncan be observed when food association learners become food preference learners,\na potential sustainable behavioral change, which in turn, may impact the\noverall distribution of healthy eaters. In short, this work evaluates the\neffectiveness of population-level intervention strategies and the importance of\ninstitutionalizing nutrition programs that factor in economical, social,\ncultural, and environmental elements that mesh well with the norms and values\nin the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 23:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

A\nthorough computational study has been performed to understand the concentration\nand thermohydraulic maldistribution of nanofluids in parallel microchannel\nsystems using an Eulerian Lagrangian twin phase model. The study reveals that\nnanofluids cannot be treated as homogeneous single phase fluids in such complex\nflow domains and effective property models fail drastically to predict the\nperformance parameters. To comprehend the distribution of the particulate\nphase, a novel concentration maldistribution factor has been proposed. It has\nbeen observed that distribution of particles need not essentially follow the\nflow pattern, leading to higher thermal performance than expected from\nhomogeneous models. Particle maldistribution has been conclusively shown to be\ndue to various migration and diffusive phenomena like Stokesian drag, Brownian\nmotion, thermophoretic drift, etc. The implications of particle distribution on\nthe cooling performance have been illustrated and smart fluid effects (reduced\nmagnitude of maximum temperature) have been observed and a mathematical model\nto predict the enhanced cooling performance in such flow geometries has been\nproposed. The article presents lucidly the effectiveness of discrete phase\napproach in modelling nanofluid thermohydraulics and sheds insight on behavior\nof nanofluids in complex flow domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 14:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

Unfortunately, there has been\nlimited success in understanding MYCN functionality in the landscape of\nneuroblastoma and more importantly, given that MYCN has been deemed\nundruggable, the need to potentially illuminate key opportunities that\nindirectly target MYCN is of great interest. To this end, this work employs an\nemerging quantitative technique from network science, namely network curvature,\nto quantify the biological robustness of MYCN and its surrounding neighborhood.\nIn particular, when amplified in Stage IV cancer, MYCN exhibits higher\ncurvature (more robust) than those samples with under expressed MYCN levels.\nWhen examining the surrounding neighborhood, the above argument still holds for\nnetwork curvature, but is lost when only analyzing differential expression - a\ncommon technique amongst oncologists and computational/molecular biologists.\nThis finding points to the problem (and possible solution) of drug targeting in\nthe context of complexity and indirect cell signaling affects that have often\nbeen obfuscated through traditional techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2015 20:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

In this thesis we have developed a hierarchy of tools that\ncover a wide range of topics with the objective of understanding humans from\nmonocular RGB image: from low level feature point descriptors to high level\nfashion-aware conditional random fields models. In order to build these high\nlevel models it is paramount to have a battery of robust and reliable low and\nmid level cues. Along these lines, we have proposed two low-level keypoint\ndescriptors: one based on the theory of the heat diffusion on images, and the\nother that uses a convolutional neural network to learn discriminative image\npatch representations. We also introduce distinct low-level generative models\nfor representing human pose: in particular we present a discrete model based on\na directed acyclic graph and a continuous model that consists of poses\nclustered on a Riemannian manifold. As mid level cues we propose two 3D human\npose estimation algorithms: one that estimates the 3D pose given a noisy 2D\nestimation, and an approach that simultaneously estimates both the 2D and 3D\npose. Finally, we formulate higher level models built upon low and mid level\ncues for understanding humans from single images. Concretely, we focus on two\ndifferent tasks in the context of fashion: semantic segmentation of clothing,\nand predicting the fashionability from images with metadata to ultimately\nprovide fashion advice to the user. For all presented approaches we present\nextensive results and comparisons against the state-of-the-art and show\nsignificant improvements on the entire variety of tasks we tackle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 03:15:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}
