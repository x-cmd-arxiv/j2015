More specifically, an\noptimization problem is formulated on the STAs transmission probabilities to\nmaximize the overall network throughput, while providing airtime usage\nguarantees for the ISPs. Subsequently, an algorithm to reach the optimal\nsolution is developed by applying monomial approximation and geometric\nprogramming iteratively. Based on the proposed three-dimensional Markov-chain\nmodel of the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) protocol, the detailed\nimplementation of the optimal transmission probability is also discussed.

V. Keldysh,\nfrom whom we have learned so much. In this paper we study the potential and\nelectron density depth profiles in surface accumulation layers in crystals with\na large and nonlinear dielectric response such as SrTiO$_3$ (STO) in the cases\nof planar, spherical and cylindrical geometries. The electron gas can be\ncreated by applying an induction $D_0$ to the STO surface. We describe the\nlattice dielectric response of STO using the Landau-Ginzburg free energy\nexpansion and employ the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation for the electron gas.\nFor the planar geometry we arrive at the electron density profile $n(x) \\propto\n(x+d)^{-12/7}$, where $d \\propto D_0^{-7/5} $. We extend our results to\noverlapping electron gases in GTO/STO/GTO multi-heterojunctions and electron\ngases created by spill-out from NSTO (heavily $n$-type doped STO) layers into\nSTO. Generalization of our approach to a spherical donor cluster creating a big\nTF atom with electrons in STO brings us to the problem of supercharged nuclei.\nIt is known that for an atom with nuclear charge $Ze$, where $Z > 170$,\nelectrons collapse onto the nucleus resulting in a net charge $Z_n < Z$. Here,\ninstead of relativistic physics, the collapse is caused by the nonlinear\ndielectric response. Electrons collapse into the charged spherical donor\ncluster with radius $R$ when its total charge number $Z$ exceeds the critical\nvalue $Z_c \\simeq R/a$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. The net charge\n$eZ_n$ grows with $Z$ until $Z$ exceeds $Z^* \\simeq (R/a)^{9/7}$. After this\npoint, the charge number of the compact core $Z_n$ remains $\\simeq Z^*$, with\nthe rest $Z^*$ electrons forming a sparse Thomas-Fermi electron atmosphere\naround it.

Our analysis considers such lock-free data structures that\ncan be represented as linear combinations of fixed size retry loops. Our main\ncontribution is a new way of modeling and analyzing a general class of\nlock-free algorithms, achieving predictions of throughput that are close to\nwhat we observe in practice.

It is believed that a black hole has a temperature\ninversely proportional to its mass and will thermally emit all species of\nfundamental particles. PBHs with initial masses of 5.0 x 10^14 g should be\nexpiring today with bursts of high-energy gamma radiation in the GeV/TeV energy\nrange. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is sensitive to the\nhigh end of the PBH gamma-ray burst spectrum. Due to its large field of view,\nduty cycle above 90% and sensitivity up to 100 TeV, the HAWC observatory is\nwell suited to perform a search for PBH bursts. We report that if the PBH\nexplodes within 0.25 light years from Earth and within 26 degrees of zenith,\nHAWC will have a 95% probability of detecting the PBH burst at the 5 sigma\nlevel. Conversely, a null detection from a 2 year or longer HAWC search will\nset PBH upper limits which are significantly better than the upper limits set\nby any previous PBH search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 17:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

As a consequence, timed automata are in general\nnon-determinizable. This is unfortunate since deterministic automata play a\nmajor role in model-based testing, observability and implementability. However,\nby bounding the length of the traces in the automaton, effective\ndeterminization becomes possible. We propose a novel procedure for bounded\ndeterminization of timed automata. The procedure unfolds the automata to\nbounded trees, removes all silent transitions and determinizes via disjunction\nof guards. The proposed algorithms are optimized to the bounded setting and\nthus are more efficient and can handle a larger class of timed automata than\nthe general algorithms. The approach is implemented in a prototype tool and\nevaluated on several examples.

Similar to the original\napplication of smoothed analysis, our goal is to study whether known strong\nlower bounds in dynamic network models are robust or fragile: do they withstand\nsmall (random) perturbations, or do such deviations push the graphs far enough\nfrom a precise pathological instance to enable much better performance?

This work helps\nunderstand when and how redundancy gives a cost-efficient reduction in latency.\nFor a general task service time distribution, we compare different redundancy\nstrategies in terms of the number of redundant tasks, and time when they are\nissued and canceled. We get the insight that the log-concavity of the task\nservice time creates a dichotomy of when adding redundancy helps.

This\nstrategy has the beneficial property of reducing the number of telescope\npointings by a factor 10 to 100 compared with tiling the entire error box.\nAdditional galaxy count reduction will come from a GW rapid distance estimate\nwhich will restrict the radial slice in search volume.

The new\nstellar systems are found by three independent automated search techniques and\nare identified as overdensities of stars, consistent with the isochrone and\nluminosity function of an old and metal-poor simple stellar population. The new\nsystems are faint (Mv > -4.7 mag) and span a range of physical sizes (17 pc <\n$r_{1/2}$ < 181 pc) and heliocentric distances (25 kpc < D < 214 kpc).

The processes in the contact zone between two\nhorizontal magnetic fields of opposite polarities are considered. The plasma is\nassumed to be initially motionless and having a temperature of 50,000 K uniform\nthroughout the plasma volume; the characteristic magnetic field corresponds to\na plasma $\\beta\\gtrsim 1$. In a physical-time interval of 17~seconds typically\ncovered by a computational run, the plasma temperature gradually increases by a\nfactor of two to three. Against this background, an impulsive (in 0.1 seconds\nor less) increase in the current-aligned plasma velocity occurs at the site of\nthe current-layer thinning (sausage-type deformation, or $m=0$ pinch\ninstability). Such a \"velocity burst\" can be interpreted physically as an event\nof suprathemal-proton generation. Further development of the sausage\ninstability results in an increase in the kinetic temperature of the protons to\nhigh values, even to those observed in flares. The form of our system of MHD\nequations indicates that such increases are a property of the exact solution of\nthe system at an appropriate choice of the parameters.

As\nmight be expected, the stochastic upper bounds are larger than the\ndeterministic counterpart of \\citet{Doering15}, but their variation with noise\namplitude exhibits interesting behavior. Below the transition to chaotic\ndynamics the upper bounds increase monotonically with noise amplitude. However,\nin the chaotic regime this monotonicity depends on the number of realizations\nin the ensemble; at a particular Rayleigh number the bound may increase or\ndecrease with noise amplitude. The origin of this behavior is the coupling\nbetween the noise and unstable periodic orbits, the degree of which depends on\nthe degree to which the ensemble represents the ergodic set. This is confirmed\nby examining the close returns plots of the full solutions to the stochastic\nequations and the numerical convergence of the noise correlations. The\nnumerical convergence of both the ensemble and time averages of the noise\ncorrelations is sufficiently slow that it is the limiting aspect of the\nrealization of these bounds.

In the\nstrongly driven regime self- and cross-phase modulation, as well as multi-pair\ngeneration, lead to a rich variety of power-dependent effects; the results are\nmarkedly different than in the low power limit. The photon pair generation\nrate, single photon spectrum, and joint spectral intensity (JSI) distribution\nare calculated.

Both the correlated and uncorrelated contributions to the\nJSI are calculated, and for sufficient powers the uncorrelated part of the JSI\nis found to form a quadruplet structure. The pump detuning is found to play a\ncrucial role in all of these phenomena, and a critical detuning is identified\nwhich divides the system behaviour into distinct regimes, as well as an optimal\ndetuning strategy which preserves many of the low-power characteristics of the\ngenerated photons for arbitrary input power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2015 15:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}
