While a\nplanning horizon of zero to about thirty years is occasionally prescribed by\nstakeholders, the challenges to risk assessment at these scales include the\ndifficulty in delineating decadal climate trends from intrinsic natural or\nmultiple model variability.

We start with a\nsmooth Poisson bundle $p: M\\to B$ of a regular (i.e. of constant rank) Poisson\nmanifold $(M,\\omega)$ over a smooth symplectic manifold $(B,\\lambda)$, the\nfoliation into leaves of the bundle coincides with the symplectic foliation\ngenerated by the Poisson structure on $M$. This defines a singular symplectic\nstructure $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}=$ $\\omega + \\varepsilon^{-1}p^*\\lambda$ on $M$\nfor any positive small $\\varepsilon$, where $p^*\\lambda$ is a lift of 2-form\n$\\lambda$ on $M$. Given a smooth Hamiltonian $H$ on $M$ one gets a slow-fast\nHamiltonian system w.r.t. $\\Omega_{\\varepsilon}$. We define a slow manifold\n$SM$ of this system. Assuming $SM$ to be a smooth submanifold, we define a slow\nHamiltonian flow on $SM$. The second part of the paper deals with singularities\nof the restriction of $p$ on $SM$ and their relations with the description of\nthe system near them.

The derivation is done under the assumption that the checkerboard pattern\nground state or unit cell of a two-dimensional Josephson junctions array\n(TDJJA) is preserved under current bias. The RCSJ with a white noise term\nmodels the dynamics for each junction phase in the array. The multidimensional\npotential is the unique expression of the collective effects that emerge from\nthe array in contrast to the single junction. First step in the procedure is to\nwrite the equation for the phases for the unit cell by considering the\nconstraints imposed for the gauge invariant phases due to frustration. Secondly\nand key idea of the procedure, is to perform a variable transformation from the\noriginal systems of stochastic equations to a system of variables where the\ncondition for the equality of mixed second partial is forced via the\nPoincar\\'e's theorem for differentials forms.

Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV\nluminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the\nconversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the\nLyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape\nfraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly\nmeasureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the\nobserved IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the\nimplied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and\ncomparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide\nthe first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency\nxi_{ion} for the z>~4 galaxy population. We find log_{10} xi_{ion}/[Hz/ergs] to\nhave a mean value of 25.27_{-0.03}^{+0.03} and 25.34_{-0.02}^{+0.02} for sub-L*\nz=4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly,\nboth values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization\nmodels, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by ~0.1 dex) adopting\nthe SMC dust law. A modest ~0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result\nif the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate\nthe ionizing emissivity at z~4.4.

Handling a huge amount of knowledge, and selectively retrieve it\nac- cording to the needs emerging in different situational scenarios, is an\nimportant aspect of human intelligence. For this task, in fact, humans adopt a\nwide range of heuristics (Gigerenzer and Todd) due to their bounded rationality\n(Simon, 1957).

This demands a\ndetailed low-level analysis of the video content, specially the actions and\ninteractions among subjects. We address this by limiting our domain to the game\nof lawn tennis. Rich descriptions are generated by leveraging a large corpus of\nhuman created descriptions harvested from Internet. We evaluate our method on a\nnewly created tennis video data set. Extensive analysis demonstrate that our\napproach addresses both semantic correctness as well as readability aspects\ninvolved in the task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 22:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

Recent technological\nadvances have opened up possibilities to deploy spatially distributed systems\nfor signal sampling and reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce a graph\nstructure for a distributed sampling and reconstruction system by coupling\nagents in a spatially distributed system with innovative positions of signals.\nA fundamental problem in sampling theory is the robustness of signal\nreconstruction in the presence of sampling noises. For a distributed sampling\nand reconstruction system, the robustness could be reduced to the stability of\nits sensing matrix. In a traditional centralized sampling and reconstruction\nsystem, the stability of the sensing matrix could be verified by its central\nprocessor, but the above procedure is infeasible in a distributed sampling and\nreconstruction system as it is decentralized. In this paper, we split a\ndistributed sampling and reconstruction system into a family of overlapping\nsmaller subsystems, and we show that the stability of the sensing matrix holds\nif and only if its quasi-restrictions to those subsystems have uniform\nstability. This new stability criterion could be pivotal for the design of a\nrobust distributed sampling and reconstruction system against supplement,\nreplacement and impairment of agents, as we only need to check the uniform\nstability of affected subsystems.

Method: We use the Hartree-Fock quark-meson\ncoupling model and the proper time regularised three flavour NJL model to\ndescribe hadronic and quark matter, respectively.

However, the physical origin of these\nrelations is still a debatable issue. In the present paper, we focus on the\nI-Love relation for self-bound stars (SBSs) such as incompressible stars and\nquark stars. We formulate perturbative expansions for the moment of inertia,\nthe tidal Love number (deformability) and the I-Love relation of SBSs. By\ncomparing the respective I-Love relations of incompressible stars and a\nspecific kind of SBSs, we show analytically that the I-Love relation is, to\nrelevant leading orders in stellar compactness, stationary with respect to\nchanges in the EOS about the incompressible limit. Hence, the universality of\nthe I-Love relation is indeed attributable to the proximity of compact stars to\nincompressible stars, and the stationarity of the relation as unveiled here. We\nalso discover that the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability of a SBS\nwith finite compressibility are, to leading order in compactness, equal to\ntheir counterparts of an incompressible star with an adjusted compactness, thus\nleading to a novel explanation for the I-Love universal relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 06:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Therefore, the outflow feedback is likely to maintain\nsupersonic turbulence in the clumps. For less massive clumps such as B59,\nL1551, and L1641N, the outflow kinetic energy is comparable to the clump\ngravitational energy. In such clumps, the outflow feedback probably affects\nsignificantly the clump dynamics.

Convergence of the algorithm, however,\nrequires ensuring passage of true candidates through the two stages of\npreselection and mOLS based selection successively. This paper presents\nconvergence conditions for both noisy and noise free signal models. The\nproposed algorithm enjoys faster convergence properties similar to mOLS, at a\nmuch reduced computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 07:39:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 13:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 14:16:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 07:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-02"}

In\norder to demonstrate the role of the rotor as a probe for a non-equilibrium\nbath, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the rotor is performed under\nviscous or dry friction surrounded by a steady granular gas under gravity. A\none- to-one map between the velocity distribution function (VDF) of the\ngranular gas and the angular distribution function for the rotor is\ntheoretically derived.

This\nissue is mostly attacked from an hardware perspective, by devising\narchitectures that put energy efficiency as a primary target, often at the cost\nof processing power. Lately, computing platforms have become more and more\nheterogeneous, but the exploitation of these additional capabilities is so\ncomplex from the application developer's perspective that they are left unused\nmost of the time, resulting therefore in a supplemental waste of energy rather\nthan in faster processing times.\n  In this paper we present a transparent, on-the-fly optimization scheme that\nallows a generic application to automatically exploit the available computing\nunits to partition its computational load. We have called our approach\nHeterogeneous Platform Accelerator (HPA). The idea is to use profiling to\nautomatically select a computing-intensive candidate for acceleration, and then\ndistribute the computations to the different units by off-loading blocks of\ncode to them.\n  Using an NVIDIA Jetson TK1 board, we demonstrate that not only HPA results in\nfaster processing speed, but also in a considerable reduction in the total\nenergy absorbed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 11:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

Further, we expect that the angular momentum $J$ will decrease due to\nthe emission of gravitational energy triggered by the scalar perturbations.\nWhen a complete loop is taken around the string, the interior time jumps by a\nfactor $2\\pi J$. The proper time it takes to make a complete loop becomes\ninfinite and will be equal to the period that $g_{\\varphi\\varphi}$ remains\npositive. In this time interval the angular momentum will be reduced to zero by\nemission of wave energy. The physical situation of an observer who experience\n$r_{\\mu}\\rightarrow r_{CS}$ is very unpleasant: the energy-momentum tensor\ncomponents diverge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 13:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

In order to do so, we borrow a\nrecently reported information distance based on Kolmogorov algorithmic\ncomplexity. The normalized information distance has been used previously to\nfind a hierarchical clustering of CA rules.

The reduction of entropy\ndensity during time evolution can be related to energy dissipation through\nLandauer principle.

In symbolic model checking event\nlocality plays a major role in time and memory usage. For example, in Petri\nnets event locality can be captured by dependency matrices, where nonzero\nentries indicate whether a transition modifies a place. The quality of event\nlocality has been expressed as a metric called (weighted) event span. The\nbandwidth of a matrix is a metric indicating the distance of nonzero elements\nto the diagonal. Wavefront is a metric indicating the degree of nonzeros on one\nend of the diagonal of the matrix. Bandwidth and wavefront are well studied\nmetrics used in sparse matrix solvers.\n  In this work we prove that span is limited by twice the bandwidth of a\nmatrix. This observation makes bandwidth reduction algorithms useful for\nobtaining good variable orders. One major issue we address is that the\nreduction algorithms can only be applied on symmetric matrices, while the\ndependency matrices are asymmetric. We show that the Sloan algorithm executed\non the total graph of the adjacency graph gives the best variable orders.\nPractically, we demonstrate that our work allows to call standard sparse matrix\noperations in Boost and ViennaCL, computing very good static variable orders in\nmilliseconds. Future work is promising, because a whole new spectrum of more\noff-the-shelf algorithms, including metaheuristic ones, become available for\nvariable ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 14:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

Multiple opportunities and challenges arise in such a 5G\narchitecture because these technologies benefit mutually from each other and\ntheir coexistence introduces several new constraints on the design of\nenergy-efficient systems. Despite clear evidence that hybrid MM systems can\nachieve significantly higher EE gains than conventional MM systems, several\nopen research problems continue to roadblock system designers from fully\nharnessing the EE gains offered by hybrid MM systems. Our discussions lead to\nthe conclusion that hybrid MM systems offer a sustainable evolution towards 5G\nnetworks and are therefore an important research topic for future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 14:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

Since a few\nspecific cases have only been treated theoretically in the literature, it was\ndecided to carry out a modeling of the $GMR(H)$ curves of\nferromagnetic/non-magnetic (FM/NM) multilayers with various interlayer\ncouplings. For simplicity, we focused on a trilayer structure (FM1/NM/FM2)\ncorresponding fairly well to the case of a large number of FM/NM bilayers. To\ncarry out the calculations, some fundamental assumptions were made: (i) single\ndomain FM layer, in plane magnetization; (ii) the magnetization of each layer\nis the same; (iii) the magnetization vectors rotate in the plane of the layers\nin an external magnetic field. In order to calculate the $GMR(H)$ function, we\nneed to know the magnetization process in the trilayer, i.e., the $M(H)$\nfunction. Therefore, first we calculate the equilibrium angle $\\phi(H)$ between\nthe two magnetization vectors as a function of the field by minimizing the\ntotal energy of the trilayer. According to most previous theoretical and\nexperimental works, the angular dependence of the GMR is fairly well described\nby the relation $GMR(\\phi)\\propto (1-\\cos\\phi)$ and we used this relation to\nderive the $GMR(H)$ function. Along this line, the $M(H)$ and $GMR(H)$ curves\nwere calculated for the following cases: (i) pure AF coupling; (ii) pure\northogonal coupling; (iii) AF coupling and orthogonal coupling simultaneously\npresent. As to the calculation of the $GMR(H)$ curves, some of these\nconfigurations have not yet been treated formerly or for some specific\nparameter values only. For those cases for which calculations were reported in\nthe literature for $M(H)$ and $GMR(H)$, our results agree with previous\nreports.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 14:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

The performance of quantum repeaters\ncan be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private\ncapacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way\ncommunication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the\nsearch for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these\ncapacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels\nallow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding\ncapacities. Here, we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any\nphase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channel. This bound allows one to benchmark\nthe implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to\nmodel communication across fibers. In particular, our bound is applicable to\nthe realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on\nthe input. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is\nconvex in the set of channels, and we use a connection between the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical\ncapacity. Building on this connection, we obtain the exact squashed\nentanglement and two-way assisted capacities of the $d$-dimensional erasure\nchannel and bounds on the amplitude-damping channel and all qubit Pauli\nchannels. In particular, our bound improves on the previous best known squashed\nentanglement upper bound of the depolarizing channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 15:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 14:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

By\ncontrast, inspired by the compelling benefits of large-scale MIMO (LS- MIMO)\nsystems, here we propose a LS-SM-MIMO scheme for the uplink (UL), where each\nuser having multiple AEs but only a single radio frequency (RF) chain invokes\nSM for increasing the UL-throughput. At the same time, by relying on hundreds\nof AEs but a small number of RF chains, the base station (BS) can\nsimultaneously serve multiple users whilst reducing the power consumption. Due\nto the large number of AEs of the UL-users and the comparably small number of\nRF chains at the BS, the UL multi-user signal detection becomes a challenging\nlarge-scale under-determined problem. To solve this problem, we propose a joint\nSM transmission scheme and a carefully designed structured compressive sensing\n(SCS)-based multi-user detector (MUD) to be used at the users and BS,\nrespectively. Additionally, the cyclic- prefix single-carrier (CPSC) is used to\ncombat the multipath channels, and a simple receive AE selection is used for\nthe improved performance over correlated Rayleigh-fading MIMO channels. We\ndemonstrate that the aggregate SM signal consisting of SM signals of multiple\nUL-users in one CPSC block appears the distributed sparsity. Moreover, due to\nthe joint SM transmission scheme, aggregate SM signals in the same transmission\ngroup exhibit the group sparsity. By exploiting these intrinsically sparse\nfeatures, the proposed SCS-based MUD can reliably detect the resultant SM\nsignals with low complexity.

Without it the intellectual property theft would be obvious and the\nproducts would be confiscated and destroyed. Authentication solutions, to\nprevent identity theft, were then developed for the two categories of\nmanufactured goods i.e. goods which can be subjected to destructive screening\nstrategies and goods which cannot e.g. pharmaceutical drugs and currencies,\nrespectively. The solutions developed were found to be analogous to digital\nsignatures.

In present work, transition from\ninsulator to superconductor and significant enhancement of superconductivity\nwere achieved in the high quality (00l) oriented FeSe films via controlling the\nthickness as well as the Fe/Se ratio. The highest Tc up to 15.2 K (almost 2\ntimes higher than those of bulk crystals) and Hc2 up to 35.5 T are obtained in\nour atmosphere-stable FeSe thin film with practical thickness (240 nm),\nimplying their great potential application in the electronic devices at high\nmagnetic fields. More importantly, it was found that the Fe-vacancy disorder in\nFeSe films is the intrinsic factor determining the evolution of the\nsuperconductivity, rather than thickness effect. In our non-superconducting\nFeSe film with Fe/Se ratio of 1.00:1.09, insulating \\b{eta}-Fe1-xSe phase with\niron-vacancy disorders is the main phase and more likely to be the parent phase\nof FeSe superconducting system. Tuning the Fe-vacancy disorders via changing\nthe Fe/Se ratio can dramatically vary the concentration of charge carrier and\nintroduce proper electron doping, which finally leads to the transition from\ninsulator to superconductor and further enhancement in the superconductivity.\nIntriguingly, our results also indicate that when the Fe/Se ratio of film is\nbeyond a critical value, superconducting FeSe films will become instable, and\nphase separation occurs with new non-superconducting phase precipitating in the\nsuperconducting matrix, causing the degradation in the superconductivity. The\nresults in present work help us to well understand the intrinsic mechanism of\nsuperconductivity among Fe-Se superconducting system and provide a new strategy\nto further pursue higher Tc in these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 13:29:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 10:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

The effective coupling constant\n$g_{U}$ of U bosons and nucleons is selected from 0GeV$^{-2}$ to 70GeV$^{-2}$.\nThe results point that U bosons will stiffen the equation of state (EOS). The\ninfluence of U bosons on the pressure is more obvious at low density than high\ndensity, while, the influence of U bosons on the energy density is more obvious\nat high density than low density. The U bosons play a significant role in\nincreasing the maximum mass and radius of PNS. When the value of $g_{U}$\nchanges from 0GeV$^{-2}$ to 70GeV$^{-2}$, the maximum mass of massive PNS\nincreases from 2.11 $M_{\\odot}$ to 2.58 $M_{\\odot}$, and the radius of PNS\ncorresponding PSR J0348+0432 increases from 13.71 km to 24.35 km.
