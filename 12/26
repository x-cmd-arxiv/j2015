The idea is to partition\nthe entire network area into two regions, namely far and vicinity, in order to\naddress the hotspot problem in WSNs, wherein nodes close to the base station\n(BS) tend to deplete their energy faster due to relaying the traffic load\nreceived from farther nodes. Then, coalitional games are utilized to group\nnodes as coalitions. The main factor in choosing coalition heads is the energy\nlevel of nodes so that the most powerful nodes play the role of heads.

Today at the\nbeginning of the 21st century, classical physicists must choose the homogeneous\nboundary conditions for Maxell's equations to correspond to the full radiation\nspectrum revealed by the recent Casimir force measurements which detect all the\nradiation surrounding conducting parallel plates, including the radiation\nabsorbed and emitted by the plates themselves. The random classical radiation\nspectrum revealed by the Casimir force measurements includes electromagnetic\nzero-point radiation, which is missing from the spectrum measured by Lummer and\nPringsheim, and which cannot be eliminated by going to zero temperature. This\nzero-point radiation will lead to zero-point energy for all systems which have\nelectromagnetic interactions. Thus the choice of the boundary conditions on the\nhomogeneous Maxwell equations is intimately related to the ideas of zero-point\nenergy and non-radiating ground states which are introduced in classes of\nmodern physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2015 20:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-05"}

These cells often show strong interactions through exchanging\nchemicals, as in quorum sensing, to achieve mutualism. Here, to achieve stable\ndivision of labor, three properties are required. First, isogenous cells\ndifferentiate into several types. Second, this aggregate of distinct cell types\nshows better growth than that of isolated cells, by achieving division of\nlabor. Third, this cell aggregate is robust in the number distribution of\ndifferentiated cell types. We here address how cells acquire the ability of\ncell differentiation and division of labor simultaneously, which is also\nconnected with the robustness of a cell society. For this purpose, we developed\na dynamical-systems model of cells consisting of chemical components with\nintracellular catalytic reaction dynamics. The reactions convert external\nnutrients into internal components for cellular growth, and the divided cells\ninteract via chemical diffusion. We found that cells sharing an identical\ncatalytic network spontaneously differentiate via induction from cell-cell\ninteractions, and then achieve division of labor, enabling a higher growth rate\nthan that in the unicellular case. This symbiotic differentiation emerged for a\nclass of reaction networks with limited resources and strong cell-cell\ninteractions. Then, robustness in the cell type distribution was achieved,\nwhile instability of collective growth could emerge even among the cooperative\ncells when the internal reserves of products were dominant.

As a greedy iterative\nalgorithm, the RSP can uniquely decompose any signal into a sum of exactly\nperiodic components, by selecting and removing the most dominant periodic\ncomponent from the residual signal in each iteration. In the RSP, a novel\nperiodicity metric is derived based on the energy of the exactly periodic\ncomponent obtained by orthogonally projecting the residual signal into the\nRamanujan subspace, and is then used to select the most dominant periodic\ncomponent in each iteration. To reduce the computational cost of the RSP, we\nalso propose the fast RSP (FRSP) based on the relationship between the periodic\nsubspace and the Ramanujan subspace, and based on the maximum likelihood\nestimation of the energy of the periodic component in the periodic subspace.\nThe fast RSP has a lower computational cost and can decompose a signal of\nlength $N$ into the sum of $K$ exactly periodic components in $ \\mathcal{O}(K\nN\\log N)$.

The considered forcing is based on the\nstreamwise-travelling waves of spanwise wall velocity (Quadrio {\\em et al. J.\nFluid Mech.}, vol. 627, 2009, pp. 161--178). The study builds upon an extensive\ndrag-reduction database created with Direct Numerical Simulation of a turbulent\nchannel flow for two, 5-fold separated values of $Re$, namely $Re_\\tau=200$ and\n$Re_\\tau=1000$. The sheer size of the database, which for the first time\nsystematically addresses the amplitude of the forcing, allows a comprehensive\nview of the drag-reducing characteristics of the travelling waves, and enables\na detailed description of the changes occurring when $Re$ increases. The effect\nof using a viscous scaling based on the friction velocity of either the\nnon-controlled flow or the drag-reduced flow is described. In analogy with\nother wall-based drag reduction techniques, like for example riblets, the\nperformance of the travelling waves is well described by a vertical shift of\nthe logarithmic portion of the mean streamwise velocity profile. Except when\n$Re$ is very low, this shift remains constant with $Re$, at odds with the\npercentage reduction of the friction coefficient, which is known to present a\nmild, logarithmic decline. Our new data agree with the available literature,\nwhich is however mostly based on low-$Re$ information and hence predicts a\nquick drop of maximum drag reduction with $Re$.

Thus absorbed spectrum is\nshifted until an absorbed line overlaps with Lyman alpha line of gas: redshift\nonly occurs if an alpha absorption pumps atoms to 2P state. Thus, space is\ndivided into spherical shells centered on the quasar, containing or not 2P\natoms. Neglecting collisional de-excitations in absorbing shells, more and more\natoms are excited until amplification of a beam having a long path in a shell,\nthus perpendicular to the observed ray, is large enough for a superradiant\nflash at alpha frequency. Energy is provided by atoms and observed ray,\nabsorbing a line at local Lyman alpha frequency. Redshifts of quasars spectra\nare due to parametric interactions composed of Impulsive Stimulated Raman\nScatterings (ISRS) : Excited hydrogen atoms catalyze energy exchanges between\nobserved light rays and background cold rays, in agreement with thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 10:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

The\ncurl quantum flux plays the key role in determining transport properties and\nthe system reaches equilibrium when flux vanishes. The novel curl quantum flux\nreflects the degree of non-equilibriumness and the time-irreversibility. We\nfound an analytical expression for the quantum flux and its relationship to the\nenvironmental pumping (non-equilibriumness quantified by the voltage away from\nthe equilibrium) and the quantum tunneling. Furthermore, we investigated\nanother quantum signature, the coherence, quantitatively measured by the\nnon-zero off diagonal element of the density matrix. Besides the\nenvironment-assistance which can give dramatic enhancement of coherence and\nquantum flux with high voltage at a fixed tunneling strength, the quantum flux\nis promoted by the coherence in the regime of small tunneling while reduced by\nthe coherence in the regime of large tunneling, due to the non-monotonic\nrelationship between the coherence and tunneling. In view of the system as a\nquantum heat engine, we studied the non-equilibrium thermodynamics and\nestablished the analytical connections of curl quantum flux to the transport\nquantities such as energy (charge) transfer efficiency, chemical reaction\nefficiency, energy dissipation, heat and electric currents observed in the\nexperiments.
