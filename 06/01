To explain these observations a model is\ndeveloped involving stimulated radiative molecular association (SRMA) reactions\namong the photons and atoms in the protosatellite disks of the planets. In this\nmodel thermal energy is extracted from each disk due to a resonance at radii\nwhere there is a match between the temperature in the disk and a photon energy.\nMatter accumulates at these radii, and satellites and rings are ultimately\nformed. Orbital radii of satellites of Uranus, Jupiter, and Neptune are related\nto photon energies ($E_{PM}$ values) in the spectrum of molecular hydrogen.\nOrbital radii of satellites of Saturn are related to photon energies ($E_{PA}$\nvalues) in the spectrum of atomic hydrogen. The first hint that such\nrelationships exist is found in the linearity of the graphs of orbital radii of\nuranian satellites vs. orbital radii of jovian satellites, as well as in the\ngraphs of orbital radii of uranian satellites vs. orbital radii of neptunian\nsatellites. An expression is determined which gives the temperature in\nprotosatellite disks where the evolution of each satellite begins. This\nexpression is used to find temperature distributions in the disks, which are\nfound to be similar to distributions calculated by other investigators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2015 18:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

However, the environment typically\ncontains many ligands, which can bind to the same receptors with different\naffinities, resulting in cross-talk. In traditional rate models, such\ncross-talk prevents accurate inference of individual ligand concentrations. In\ncontrast, here we show that knowing the precise timing sequence of stochastic\nbinding and unbinding events allows one receptor to provide information about\nmultiple ligands simultaneously and with a high accuracy.

These\nsimulators enable modelers to capture effects that are difficult to\ncharacterize analytically or summarize statistically. However, in many\nreal-world applications, these simulations need to be inverted to match the\nobserved data. This typically requires the custom design, derivation and\nimplementation of sophisticated inversion algorithms. Here we give a framework\nfor inverting a broad class of complex software simulators via probabilistic\nprogramming and automatic inference, using under 20 lines of probabilistic\ncode. Our approach is based on a formulation of inversion as approximate\ninference in a simple sequential probabilistic model. We implement four\ninference strategies, including Metropolis-Hastings, a sequentialized\nMetropolis-Hastings scheme, and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme,\nrequiring 4 or fewer lines of probabilistic code each. We demonstrate our\nframework by applying it to invert a real geological software simulator from\nthe oil and gas industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2015 23:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

This impairs the effective range of laser weapons as well as the\nperformance of free space optical (FSO) communication systems. Adaptive optics\n(AO) can be applied to effectively correct wavefront distortions in weak\nturbulence situations. However, in strong or deep turbulence, where\nscintillation and beam breakup are common phenomena, traditional wavefront\nsensing techniques such as the use of Shack-Hartmann sensors lead to incorrect\nresults. Consequently, the performance of AO systems will be greatly\ncompromised. We propose a new approach that can determine the major phase\ndistortions in a beam instantaneously and guide an AO device to compensate for\nthe phase distortion in a few iterations. In our approach, we use a plenoptic\nwavefront sensor to image the distorted beam into its 4D phase space. A fast\nreconstruction algorithm based on graph theory is applied to recognize the\nphase distortion of a laser beam and command the AO device to perform phase\ncompensation. As a result, we show in our experiments that an arbitrary phase\ndistortion with peak to peak value up to 22{\\pi} can be corrected within a few\niteration steps. Scintillation and branch point problems are smartly avoided by\nthe plenoptic sensor and its fast reconstruction algorithm. In this article, we\nwill demonstrate the function of the plenoptic sensor, the fast reconstruction\nalgorithm as well as the beam correction improvements when our approach is\napplied to an AO system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 00:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

We focus on the\ncontribution of the velocity vortices and the fast shock reflection and\nrefraction in the solar corona to the formation of the EUV waves. Following the\nloss of equilibrium in the coronal magnetic structure, the flux rope exhibits\nrapid motions and invokes the fast-mode shock forward of the rope, which then\nproduces the type II radio burst. The expansion of the fast shock, which is\nassociated with outward motion, takes place in various directions, and the\ndownward expansion shows the reflection and the refraction as a result of the\nnon-uniform background plasma. The reflected component of the fast shock\npropagates upward and the refracted component propagates downward. As the\nrefracted component reaches the boundary surface, a weak echo is excited. The\nMoreton wave is invoked as the fast shock touches the bottom boundary, so the\nMoreton wave lags the type II burst. A secondary echo occurs in the area where\nreflection of the fast shock encounters the slow-mode shock, and the nearby\nmagnetic field lines are further distorted because of the interaction between\nthe secondary echo and the velocity vortices.

Our principal results address\nreconciliation of the natural extension with the Bohr compactification or its\nzero-dimensional variant. In certain cases the natural extension functor and a\nBohr compactification functor are the same, in others the functors have\ndifferent codomains but may agree on all objects.

The\ntraditional Gravity Model (GM) successfully reproduces the volume of trade\nbetween connected countries, using macroeconomic properties such as GDP,\ngeographic distance, and possibly other factors. However, it predicts a network\nwith complete or homogeneous topology, thus failing to reproduce the highly\nheterogeneous structure of the ITN. On the other hand, recent maximum-entropy\nnetwork models successfully reproduce the complex topology of the ITN, but\nprovide no information about trade volumes. Here we integrate these two\ncurrently incompatible approaches via the introduction of an Enhanced Gravity\nModel (EGM) of trade. The EGM is the simplest model combining the GM with the\nnetwork approach within a maximum-entropy framework. Via a unified and\nprincipled mechanism that is transparent enough to be generalized to any\neconomic network, the EGM provides a new econometric framework wherein trade\nprobabilities and trade volumes can be separately controlled by any combination\nof dyadic and country-specific macroeconomic variables. The model successfully\nreproduces both the global topology and the local link weights of the ITN,\nparsimoniously reconciling the conflicting approaches.

A natural question then arises: can we\nreconstruct these notions from purely operational axioms? We address this\nquestion in the framework of general probabilistic theories, presenting a set\nof axioms that guarantee that every state can be diagonalized. The first axiom\nis Causality, which ensures that the marginal of a bipartite state is well\ndefined. Then, Purity Preservation states that the set of pure transformations\nis closed under composition. The third axiom is Purification, which allows to\nassign a pure state to the composition of a system with its environment.\nFinally, we introduce the axiom of Pure Sharpness, stating that for every\nsystem there exists at least one pure effect occurring with unit probability on\nsome state. For theories satisfying our four axioms, we show a constructive\nalgorithm for diagonalizing every given state.

Current estimates based on the mid-plane dynamic density use a\nlocal baryonic correction that ignores the non-local effects of spiral\nstructure and significantly underestimates the amount of dynamically relevant\ngas; the additional gas plus the remaining uncertainties make it practically\nimpossible to measure $\\rho_{DM}$ from mid-plane kinematics alone. The sampling\nof inhomogeneous tracer populations with different scale-heights and\nscale-lengths results in a systematic increase in the observed dispersion\ngradients and changes in the nominal density distributions that, if not\nproperly considered, can be misinterpreted as a sign of more dark matter. If\nthe disc gravity is modelled using an infinite disc, the local variation in the\nvertical gravity due to the globally exponential disc components results in an\nunderestimation of the baryonic contribution by as much as ~40% Given only the\nassumptions of stationarity, an axially and vertically symmetric disc, doubly\nexponential tracer and mass-component density profiles, a phenomenologically\njustified model for the cross-dispersion component $\\sigma_{Rz}$, and a\nrealistic model for $g_z$, it is possible to solve the full vertical Jeans\nequation analytically for the vertical dispersion $\\sigma_{z}(z)$ and hence\ntest the robustness of previous attempts at measuring $\\rho_{DM}$.

This question is inevitable if we postulate\nthat low-energy supersymmetry is indeed realized in nature, despite the null\nobservation of superparticles below a TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. As we\nargue in this paper, superparticles masses in the multi-TeV range can, in fact,\nbe reconciled with the concept of naturalness by means of a cosmological\nselection effect--a selection effect based on the assumption of an exact\ndiscrete R-symmetry that is spontaneously broken by gaugino condensation in a\npure supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In such theories, the dynamical scale of\nthe Yang-Mills gauge interactions is required to be higher than the\ninflationary Hubble scale, in order to avoid the formation of domain walls.\nThis results in a lower limit on the superparticle masses and leads us to\nconclude that, according to the idea of naturalness, the most probable range of\nsuperparticle masses is potentially located at the multi-TeV, if the\ninflationary Hubble rate is of O(10^{14}) GeV.

Sequencing errors will also result in OTUs that are not\naccurate reconstructions of the original biological sequences. Herein we\npresent a novel and sensitive sequence filtering algorithm that minimizes both\nproblems by calculating the exact error-probability distribution of a sequence\nfrom its quality scores. In order to validate our method, we quality-filtered\nthirty-seven publicly available datasets obtained by sequencing mock and\nenvironmental microbial communities with the Roche 454, Illumina MiSeq and\nIonTorrent PGM platforms, and compared our results to those obtained with\nprevious approaches such as the ones included in mothur, QIIME and UPARSE. Our\nalgorithm retained substantially more reads than its predecessors, while\nresulting in fewer and more accurate OTUs. This improved sensitiveness produced\nmore faithful representations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the\ntrue microbial diversity present in the studied samples.

It is termed as\nstructural binary gradient patterns (SBGP). To discover underlying local\nstructures in the gradient domain, we compute image gradients from multiple\ndirections and simplify them into a set of binary strings. The SBGP is derived\nfrom certain types of these binary strings that have meaningful local\nstructures and are capable of resembling fundamental textural information. They\ndetect micro orientational edges and possess strong orientation and locality\ncapabilities, thus enabling great discrimination. The SBGP also benefits from\nthe advantages of the gradient domain and exhibits profound robustness against\nillumination variations. The binary strategy realized by pixel correlations in\na small neighborhood substantially simplifies the computational complexity and\nachieves extremely efficient processing with only 0.0032s in Matlab for a\ntypical face image. Furthermore, the discrimination power of the SBGP can be\nenhanced on a set of defined orientational image gradient magnitudes, further\nenforcing locality and orientation. Results of extensive experiments on various\nbenchmark databases illustrate significant improvements of the SBGP based\nrepresentations over the existing state-of-the-art local descriptors in the\nterms of discrimination, robustness and complexity.

The receiver, which acts as both a decoder and\nestimator, observes the noisy measurement of the channel output and makes an\noptimal estimate of the state of the dynamical system in the minimum mean\nsquare sense. Noisy feedback from the receiver to the transmitter is present.\nThe transmitter observes the noise-corrupted feedback message from the receiver\ntogether with a possibly noisy measurement of the state the dynamical system.\nThese measurements are then used to encode the message to be transmitted over a\nnoisy Gaussian channel, where a per symbol power constraint is imposed on the\ntransmitted message. Thus, we get a mixed problem of Shannon's source-channel\ncoding problem and a sort of Kalman filtering problem. In particular, we\nconsider two feedback instances, one being feedback of receiver measurements\nand the second being the receiver's state estimates. We show that optimal\nencoders and decoders are linear filters with a finite memory and we give\nexplicitly the state space realizations of the optimal filters. For the case\nwhere the transmitter has access to noisy measurements of the state, we derive\na separation principle for the optimal communication scheme.

To this end, several fraud detection algorithms\nhave been proposed and some deployed by Facebook that use graph co-clustering\nto distinguish between genuine likes and those generated by farm-controlled\nprofiles.

We present an empirical analysis of the\ngraph-based detection tools used by Facebook and highlight their shortcomings\nagainst more sophisticated farms. Next, we focus on characterizing content\ngenerated by social networks accounts on their timelines, as an indicator of\ngenuine versus fake social activity. We analyze a wide range of features\nextracted from timeline posts, which we group into two main classes: lexical\nand non-lexical.

To this end, we design an\nexperimental framework for the identification of the criteria that need to be\ntaken into account to generate a pleasing photo collage. Five different\nthematic photo datasets are used to create collages using state-of-the-art\ncriteria.

To validate our framework, we performed several psycho-visual\nexperiments involving different users.

The equivalence\nallows us to revisit incomplete preferences from the viewpoint of desirability\nand through the derived notion of coherent lower previsions. On this basis, we\nobtain new results and insights: in particular, we show that the theory of\nincomplete preferences can be developed assuming only the existence of a worst\nact---no best act is needed---, and that a weakened Archimedean axiom suffices\ntoo; this axiom allows us also to address some controversy about the regularity\nassumption (that probabilities should be positive---they need not), which\nenables us also to deal with uncountable possibility spaces; we show that it is\nalways possible to extend in a minimal way a preference relation to one with a\nworst act, and yet the resulting relation is never Archimedean, except in a\ntrivial case; we show that the traditional notion of state independence\ncoincides with the notion called strong independence in imprecise\nprobability---this leads us to give much a weaker definition of state\nindependence than the traditional one; we rework and uniform the notions of\ncomplete preferences, beliefs, values; we argue that Archimedeanity does not\ncapture all the problems that can be modelled with sets of expected utilities\nand we provide a new notion that does precisely that. Perhaps most importantly,\nwe argue throughout that desirability is a powerful and natural setting to\nmodel, and work with, incomplete preferences, even in case of non-Archimedean\nproblems.

Hence they may serve as a\ntheoretical (as well as an experimental) tool to detect the spatial properties\nof the entanglement entropy of a subsystem. In the ground state of quantum\nmany-body systems, its scaling is typically linear in the boundary of the\nsubsystem (area law). Here we propose a microscopic insight into the spatial\nstructure of entanglement and fluctuations using the concept of \\emph{contour},\nrecently introduced to decompose the bipartite entanglement entropy of lattice\nfree fermions between two extended regions $A$ and $B$ into contributions from\nsingle sites in $A$. We generalize the notion of contour to the entanglement of\nany quadratic (bosonic or fermionic) lattice Hamiltonian, as well as to\nparticle-number fluctuations. The entanglement and fluctuations contours are\nfound to generally decay when moving away from the boundary between $A$ and\n$B$. We show that in the case of free fermions the decay of the entanglement\ncontour follows closely that of the fluctuation contour. In the case of\nBose-condensed interacting bosons, treated via the Bogoliubov and spin-wave\napproximations, such a link cannot be established -- fluctuation and\nentanglement contours are found to be radically different, as they lead to a\nlogarithmically violated area law for fluctuations, and to a strict area law of\nentanglement. Analyzing in depth the role of the zero-energy Goldstone mode of\nspin-wave theory, and of the corresponding lowest-energy mode in the\nentanglement spectrum, we unveil a subtle interplay between the special contour\nand energy scaling of the latter, and universal additive logarithmic\ncorrections to entanglement area law discussed extensively in the recent\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 15:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 10:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 06:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 06:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

In this work, we demonstrate that the\nstrange correlator is a sensitive diagnosis to detect SPT states in interacting\nsystems. Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we\ninvestigate the interaction-driven quantum phase transition in the\nKane-Mele-Hubbard model. The transition from the quantum spin Hall insulator at\nweak interaction to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at strong interaction\ncan be readily detected by the momentum space behavior of the strange\ncorrelator in single-particle, spin, and pairing sectors. The interaction\neffects on the symmetry-protected edge states in various sectors, i.e., the\nhelical Luttinger liquid behavior, are well captured in the QMC measurements of\nstrange correlators. Moreover, we demonstrate that the strange correlator is\ntechnically easier to implement in QMC and more robust in performance than\nother proposed numerical diagnoses for interacting topological states, as only\nstatic correlations are needed. The attempt in this work paves the way for\nusing the strange correlator to study interaction-driven topological phase\ntransitions in fermionic as well as bosonic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 15:52:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 14:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 12:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

Concerning the electronic-vibrational quantum mixtures, the impact of\nprotein-induced fluctuations was examined by calculating the 2D electronic\nspectra of a weakly coupled dimer with vibrational modes in the resonant\ncondition [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 212403 (2015)]. This analysis demonstrated that\nquantum mixtures of the vibronic resonance are rather robust under the\ninfluence of the fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures, whereas the mixtures\nare eradicated by the fluctuations at physiological temperatures. However, this\nconclusion cannot be generalized because the magnitude of the coupling inducing\nthe quantum mixtures is proportional to the inter-pigment coupling. In this\nstudy, we explore the impact of the fluctuations on electronic-vibrational\nquantum mixtures in a strongly coupled dimer. with an off-resonant vibrational\nmode. Toward this end, we calculate electronic energy transfer (EET) dynamics\nand 2D electronic spectra of a dimer that corresponds to the most strongly\ncoupled bacteriochlorophyll molecules in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex in a\nnumerically accurate manner. The quantum mixtures are found to be robust under\nthe exposure of protein-induced fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures,\nirrespective of the resonance. At 300 K, however, the quantum mixing is\ndisturbed more strongly by the fluctuations, and therefore, the beats in the 2D\nspectra become obscure even in a strongly coupled dimer with a resonant\nvibrational mode. Further, the overall behaviors of the EET dynamics are\ndemonstrated to be dominated by the environment and coupling between the 0-0\nvibronic transitions as long as the Huang-Rhys factor of the vibrational mode\nis small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 05:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 11:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

The goal is to build a location-specific TVWS database, which\nprovides a look-up table service for any D2D link to determine its maximum\npermitted emission power (MPEP) in an unlicensed digital TV (DTV) band. To\nachieve this goal, the idea of mobile crowd sensing is firstly introduced to\ncollect active spectrum measurements from massive personal mobile devices.\nConsidering the incompleteness of crowd measurements, we formulate the problem\nof unknown measurements recovery as a matrix completion problem and apply a\npowerful fixed point continuation algorithm to reconstruct the unknown elements\nfrom the known elements. By joint exploitation of the big spectrum data in its\nvicinity, each cellular base station further implements a nonlinear support\nvector machine algorithm to perform irregular coverage boundary detection of a\nlicensed DTV transmitter. With the knowledge of the detected coverage boundary,\nan opportunistic spatial reuse algorithm is developed for each D2D link to\ndetermine its MPEP. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can\nsuccessfully enable D2D communications in TVWS while satisfying the\ninterference constraint from the licensed DTV services. In addition, to our\nbest knowledge, this is the first try to explore and exploit TVWS inside the\nDTV protection region resulted from the shadowing effect. Potential application\nscenarios include communications between internet of vehicles in the\nunderground parking, D2D communications in hotspots such as subway, game\nstadiums, and airports, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 02:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
