We find that the $\\gamma$-ray outburst is coincident with\nflares at all the other frequencies and is related to the passage of a new\nsuperluminal knot through the radio core. The powerful $\\gamma$-ray emission is\nassociated with a change in direction of the jet, which became oriented more\nclosely to our line of sight ($\\theta\\sim$1.2$^{\\circ}$) during the ejection of\nthe knot and the $\\gamma$-ray outburst. During the flare, the optical polarized\nemission displays intra-day variability and a clear clockwise rotation of\nEVPAs, which we associate with the path followed by the knot as it moves along\nhelical magnetic field lines, although a random walk of the EVPA caused by a\nturbulent magnetic field cannot be ruled out. We locate the $\\gamma$-ray\noutburst a short distance downstream of the radio core, parsecs from the black\nhole. This suggests that synchrotron self-Compton scattering of near-infrared\nto ultraviolet photons is the probable mechanism for the $\\gamma$-ray\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 16:00:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 15:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

A\ntime-reversal procedure, involving the inversion of the signs of every energy\nand interaction, should produce the excitation revival. This idea,\nexperimentally coined in NMR, embodies the concept of the Loschmidt echo (LE).\nWhile such an implementation involves a single spin autocorrelation $M_{1,1}$,\ni.e. a local LE, theoretical efforts have focused on the study of the recovery\nprobability of a complete many-body state, referred here as global or many-body\nLE $M_{MB}$. Here, we analyze the relation between these magnitudes, in what\nconcerns to their characteristic time scales and their dependence on the number\nof spins $N$.

This extensive hypothesis is exact for very\nshort times and confirmed numerically beyond such a regime. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss a general picture of the decay of $M_{1,1}$ as a consequence of the\ninterplay between the time scale that characterizes the reversible interactions\n($T_{2}$) and that of the perturbation ($\\tau _{\\Sigma }$). Our analysis\nsuggests that the short time decay, characterized by the time scale $\\tau\n_{\\Sigma }$, is greatly enhanced by the complex processes that occur beyond\n$T_{2}$ .

We show that gravitons as\nwell as classical gravitational waves of super-horizon wavelengths are able to\nform the de Sitter state of the empty homogeneous isotropic Universe. This\nstate is the exact solution to the self-consistent equations of one-loop\nquantum gravity for gravitons in the empty FLRW space. It also is the exact\nsolution to the self-consistent equations of back reaction for classical\ngravitational waves. Technically, to get this de Sitter solution in both\nquantum and classical cases, it is necessary to make the transition to\nimaginary time and then come back to real time which is possible because this\nde Sitter state is invariant with respect to Wick rotation. Such a procedure\nmeans that the time was used as a complex variable, and this fact has a deep\nbut still not understood meaning. De Sitter accelerated expansion of the empty\nUniverse naturally explains the origin of dark energy and inflation because the\nUniverse is empty at the start and by the end of its evolution.

The\nmost elegant mechanism to explain such tiny neutrino masses is the seesaw\nmechanism with right handed neutrinos. However, the required seesaw scale is so\nhigh, $\\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, it will not have any collider implications. Recently,\nan explicit model has been constructed to realize the seesaw mechanism with the\nright handed neutrinos at the electroweak scale. The model has a mirror\nsymmetry having both the left and right lepton and quark doublets and singlets\nfor the same $SU(2)_W $ gauge symmetry. Additional Higgs multiplets have been\nintroduced to realize this scenario. It turns out that these extra Higgs fields\nalso help to satisfy the precision electroweak tests, and other observables.\nBecause the scale of the symmetry breaking is electroweak, both the mirror\nquark and mirror leptons have masses in the electroweak scale in the range $\n\\sim 150 - 800 $ GeV. The mirror quarks / leptons decay to ordinary quarks\n/leptons plus very light neutral scalars.

We find that these signals are well observable over\nthe Standard Model background for $13$ TeV LHC.

ErisBH shares the same initial\nconditions, resolution, recipes of gas cooling, star formation and feedback, as\nthe close Milky Way-analog \"Eris\", but it also includes prescriptions for the\nformation, growth and feedback of supermassive black holes. We find that the\ngalaxy's central black hole grows mainly through mergers with other black holes\ncoming from infalling satellite galaxies. The growth by gas accretion is\nminimal because very little gas reaches the sub-kiloparsec scales. The final\nblack hole is, at z=0, about 2.6 million solar masses and it sits closely to\nthe position of SgrA* on the MBH-MBulge and MBH-sigma planes, in a location\nconsistent with what observed for pseudobulges. Given the limited growth due to\ngas accretion, we argue that the mass of the central black hole should be above\n10^5 solar masses already at z~8. The effect of AGN feedback on the host galaxy\nis limited to the very central few hundreds of parsecs. Despite being weak, AGN\nfeedback seems to be responsible for the limited growth of the central bulge\nwith respect to the original Eris, which results in a significantly flatter\nrotation curve in the inner few kiloparsecs. Moreover, the disk of ErisBH is\nmore prone to instabilities, as its bulge is smaller and its disk larger then\nEris. As a result, the disk of ErisBH undergoes a stronger dynamical evolution\nrelative to Eris and around z=0.3 a weak bar grows into a strong bar of a few\ndisk scale lengths in size. The bar triggers a burst of star formation in the\ninner few hundred parsecs, provides a modest amount of new fuel to the central\nblack hole, and causes the bulge of ErisBH to have, by z=0, a box/peanut\nmorphology.(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 20:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The rates are adjusted by factors\nconsistent with uncertainties indicated by comparing theoretical rates to those\ndeduced from charge-exchange and $\\beta$-decay measurements. To ensure a model\nindependent assessment, sensitivity studies across a comprehensive set of\nprogenitors and equations of state are performed.

The development of these tools\npromotes a focused effort for state-of-the-art measurements, motivates\nconstruction of new facilities and will ultimately move the community towards\naddressing the grand challenge of `How were the elements from iron to uranium\nmade?'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 21:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The cluster gas\nfraction, believed to be a fair sample of the average baryon fraction in the\nUniverse, is a well-understood observable, which has previously mainly been\nused to constrain background cosmology. In some modified gravity models, such\nas $f(R)$ gravity, gas temperature in a massive cluster is determined by the\neffective mass of that cluster, which can be larger than its true mass. On the\nother hand, X-ray luminosity is determined by the true gas density, which in\nboth modified gravity and $\\Lambda$CDM models depends mainly on $\\Omega_{\\rm\nb}/\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and hence the true total cluster mass. As a result, the\nstandard practice of combining gas temperatures and X-ray surface brightnesses\nof clusters to infer their gas fractions can, in modified gravity models, lead\nto a larger - in $f(R)$ gravity this can be $1/3$ larger - value of\n$\\Omega_{\\rm b}/\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ than that inferred from other observations such\nas the CMB.

An important question is how much the equilibria degrade in\nthe face of strategic behavior, i.e. what is the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the\nmarket viewed as a mechanism?\n  Often, PoA bounds are modest constants such as 4/3 or 2. Nonetheless, in\npractice a guarantee that no more than 25% or 50% of the economic value is lost\nmay be unappealing. This paper asks whether significantly better bounds are\npossible under plausible assumptions. In particular, we look at how these worst\ncase guarantees improve in the following large settings.\n  Large Walrasian auctions: These are auctions with many copies of each item\nand many agents. We show that the PoA tends to 1 as the market size increases,\nunder suitable conditions, mainly that there is some uncertainty about the\nnumbers of copies of each good and demands obey the gross substitutes\ncondition. We also note that some such assumption is unavoidable.\n  Large Fisher markets: Fisher markets are a class of economies that has\nreceived considerable attention in the computer science literature. A large\nmarket is one in which at equilibrium, each buyer makes only a small fraction\nof the total purchases; the smaller the fraction, the larger the market.

Detailed radiative transfer models show that the observed equinox\ntemperatures of Saturn's A ring are much higher than model predictions as long\nas only the flux from Saturn is taken into account. This indicates that the A\nring was not completely cooled down at the equinox. We develop a simple\nseasonal model for ring temperatures and first assume that the internal density\nand the thermal inertia of a ring particle are uniform with depth. The particle\nsize is estimated to be 1-2 m. The seasonal thermal inertia is found to be\n30-50 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ in the middle A ring whereas it is $\\sim$ 10\nJm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ or as low as the diurnal thermal inertia in the\ninner and outermost regions of the A ring. An additional internal structure\nmodel, in which a particle has a high density core surrounded by a fluffy\nregolith mantle, shows that the core radius relative to the particle radius is\nabout 0.9 for the middle A ring and is much less for the inner and outer\nregions of the A ring. This means that the radial variation of the internal\ndensity of ring particles exists across the A ring. Some mechanisms may be\nconfining dense particles in the middle A ring against viscous diffusion.\nAlternatively, the (middle) A ring might have recently formed ($<$ 10$^{8}$ yr)\nby destruction of an icy satellite, so that dense particles have not yet\ndiffused over the A ring and regolith mantles of particles have not grown\nthick.

To date, however, ordered\narrays of such domain structures have not been reported. Here, we report the\nobservation of 180 stripe nanodomains in (110)-oriented BiFeO3 thin films grown\non orthorhombic GdScO3 (010)O substrates, and their impact on exchange coupling\nto metallic ferromagnets. Nanoscale ferroelectric 180 stripe domains with {112\n} domain walls were observed in films < 32 nm thick to compensate for large\ndepolarization fields. With increasing film thickness, we observe a domain\nstructure crossover from the depolarization field-driven 180 stripe nanodomains\nto 71 domains determined by the elastic energy. Interestingly, these 180 domain\nwalls (which are typically cylindrical or meandering in nature due to a lack of\nstrong anisotropy associated with the energy of such walls) are found to be\nhighly-ordered. Additional studies of Co0.9Fe0.1/BiFeO3 heterostructures reveal\nexchange bias and exchange enhancement in heterostructures based-on BiFeO3 with\n180 domain walls and an absence of exchange bias in heterostructures based-on\nBiFeO3 with 71 domain walls; suggesting that the 180 domain walls could be the\npossible source for pinned uncompensated spins that give rise to exchange bias.\nThis is further confirmed by X-ray circular magnetic dichroism studies, which\ndemonstrate that films with predominantly 180 domain walls have larger\nmagnetization than those with primarily 71 domain walls.

These\nideas make contrasting predictions about the relationship between speciation\nprocesses and latitude, which I elaborate and evaluate. Available data suggest\nthat per capita speciation rates are currently highest in the temperate zone,\nand that diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) are similar\nbetween latitudes. In contrast, clades whose oldest analyzed dates precede the\nEocene thermal maximum, when the extent of the tropics was much greater than\ntoday, tend to show highest speciation and diversification rates in the\ntropics. These findings are consistent with age and area, which is alone among\nhypotheses in predicting a time trend. Higher recent speciation rates in the\ntemperate zone than the tropics suggest an additional response to high\necological opportunity associated with low species diversity. These broad\npatterns are compelling but provide limited insights into underlying\nmechanisms, arguing that studies of speciation processes along the latitudinal\ngradient will be vital. Using threespine stickleback in depauperate northern\nlakes as an example, I show how high ecological opportunity can lead to rapid\nspeciation. The results support a role for ecological opportunity in\nspeciation, but its importance in the evolution of the latitudinal gradient\nremains uncertain. I conclude that per-capita evolutionary rates are no longer\nhigher in the tropics than the temperate zone. Nevertheless, the vast numbers\nof species that have already accumulated in the tropics ensure that total rate\nof species production remains highest there.

Methods such as adopting some specific\noptics systems, using pilot symbols or line codes to estimate the background\ninformation and cancel it accordingly, and pulse-position modulation (PPM), can\nbe adopted to mitigate the impact of background radiation. However, purely\ndepending on the optics system, the background radiation can only be reduced,\nbut not completely cancelled; and the use of any of pilot symbols, line codes\nand PPM reduces the system spectral efficiency drastically. In this paper,\nbased on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) principle, we develop a\nViterbi-type trellis-search sequence receiver (the GLRT sequence receiver) that\ncan estimate the unknown channel gain and the background radiation\nsimultaneously, and detect the data sequence accordingly. This receiver\nrequires very few pilot symbols, and therefore, does not significantly reduce\nthe bandwidth efficiency. Its error performance can approach that of detection\nwith perfect information of the channel state and the background radiation, as\nthe observation window length used for forming the decision metric increases.\nSince a Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm is adopted, the search complexity\nis very low and is independent of the observation window size. However, the\nsearch complexity of the GLRT sequence receiver grows exponentially with the\nmodulation order. To further simplify the implementation, we derive a more\nefficient decision-feedback symbol-by-symbol receiver which retains the same\nerror performance as that of the GLRT sequence receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 03:22:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 10:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The\nsurvey data underlying these models often include information on several\npredictors that could potentially characterize habitat suitability and species\ndetectability. Because these variables might not all be relevant, model\nselection techniques are necessary in this context. In practice, model\nselection is performed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), as few\nother alternatives are available. This paper builds an objective Bayesian\nvariable selection framework for occupancy models through the intrinsic prior\nmethodology. The procedure incorporates priors on the model space that account\nfor test multiplicity and respect the polynomial hierarchy of the predictors\nwhen higher-order terms are considered. The methodology is implemented using a\nstochastic search algorithm that is able to thoroughly explore large spaces of\noccupancy models. The proposed strategy is entirely automatic and provides\ncontrol of false positives without sacrificing the discovery of truly\nmeaningful covariates. The performance of the method is evaluated and compared\nto AIC through a simulation study.

An\nenergetic \"thermal model\" of a telecommunication station is proposed and\nstudied. The results have been validated with a BTS in central Italy, showing\ngood agreement. Findings show a substantial high internal-external temperature\ndifference in the containing shelter, particularly during daytime and warm\nmonths, due to sources of heat (equipment, external temperature and sun\nradiation) and to the difficulty in spread the warmth out. The necessity to\nkeep the operating temperatures within a given range for the correct\nfunctioning of the electronic equipment requires the use of conditioning\nsetups, and this significantly increases the energetic demand of the whole\nsystem. The analysis of thermal flows across the shelter can help to gather\nfurther data on its temperature behavior and to devise practical measures to\nlower the power demand, while keeping the operating parameters in the suggested\nranges. The investigation of some operating parameters of the equipment and of\nthe shelter, such as threshold set-points, air vent area, external wall\ntransmittance and reflectivity, suggests annual energy savings between 10% and\n30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 10:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}
