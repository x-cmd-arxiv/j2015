Both, light\nscattering and neutron imaging indicate a pronounced roughening of the\nimbibition fronts. Their overall shape and width can be resolved by neutron\nimaging. The fronts can be described by a superposition of independent wetting\nfronts moving with pore size-dependent square-root-of-time laws and weighted\naccording to the pore size distributions obtained from nitrogen gas sorption\nisotherms. This finding indicates that the shape of the imbibition front in a\nporous medium, such as Vycor glass, with interconnected, elongated pores, is\nsolely determined by independent movements of liquid menisci.

Put simply, the TBTF problem consists of the fact that it is\ndifficult to explain both the measured kinematics of dwarfs and their observed\nnumber density within the LCDM framework. The most popular proposed solutions\nto the problem involve baryonic feedback processes. For example, reionization\nand baryon depletion can decrease the abundance of halos that are expected to\nhost dwarf galaxies. Moreover, feedback related to star formation can alter the\ndark matter density profile in the central regions of low-mass halos. In this\narticle we assess the TBTF problem for field dwarfs, taking explicitly into\naccount the baryonic effects mentioned above. We find that 1) reionization\nfeedback cannot resolve the TBTF problem on its own, because the halos in\nquestion are too massive to be affected by it, and that 2) the degree to which\nprofile modification can be invoked as a solution to the TBTF problem depends\non the radius at which galactic kinematics are measured. Based on a literature\nsample of about 90 dwarfs with interferometric observations in the 21cm line of\natomic hydrogen (HI), we conclude that the TBTF problem persists despite\nbaryonic effects. However, the preceding statement assumes that the sample\nunder consideration is representative of the general population of field\ndwarfs. In addition, the unexplained excess of dwarf galaxies in LCDM could be\nas small as a factor of ~ 1.8, given the current uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of the galactic velocity function. Both of these caveats highlight\nthe importance of upcoming uniform surveys with HI interferometers for\nadvancing our understanding of the issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 16:57:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 14:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

Thus, preventing information leakage between\ntenants is crucial. While the hypervisor enforces software isolation, shared\nhardware, such as the CPU cache or memory bus, can leak sensitive information.\nFor security reasons, shared memory between tenants is typically disabled.\nFurthermore, tenants often do not share a physical CPU. In this setting, cache\nattacks do not work and only a slow cross-CPU covert channel over the memory\nbus is known. In contrast, we demonstrate a high-speed covert channel as well\nas the first side-channel attack working across processors and without any\nshared memory. To build these attacks, we use the undocumented DRAM address\nmappings.\n  We present two methods to reverse engineer the mapping of memory addresses to\nDRAM channels, ranks, and banks. One uses physical probing of the memory bus,\nthe other runs entirely in software and is fully automated. Using this mapping,\nwe introduce DRAMA attacks, a novel class of attacks that exploit the DRAM row\nbuffer that is shared, even in multi-processor systems.

Here, we discuss the importance of\nadjusting the prior distributions for the auxiliary parameters of a\nreparameterized model.

A prominent implication of this mapping is that at finite temperature,\nfluctuations split the buckling instability into two thermal transitions,\naccompanied by the appearance of an intermediate critical phase. This phase is\ncharacterized by quasi-long-range order in the spatial tripartite pattern. It\nis manifested by broadened Bragg peaks at new wave vectors, whose line-shape\nprovides a direct measurement of the temperature dependent exponent $\\eta(T)$\ncharacteristic of the power-law correlations in the critical phase. A quantum\nphase transition is found at the largest value of the critical transverse\nfrequency: here the critical intermediate phase shrinks to zero. Moreover,\nwithin the ordered phase, we predict a crossover from classical to quantum\nbehavior, signifying the emergence of an additional characteristic scale for\nclock order. We discuss experimental realizations with trapped ions and\npolarized dipolar gases, and propose that within accessible technology, such\nexperiments can provide a direct probe of the rich phase diagram of the quantum\nclock model, not easily observable in condensed matter analogues. Therefore,\nthis works highlights the potential for ionic and dipolar systems to serve as\nsimulators for complex models in statistical mechanics and condensed matter\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 21:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 09:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

In addition to their deficiency of hydrogen and helium,\nmost of these stars are highly magnetic, and a large fraction vary in\nluminosity. This variability has been ascribed to nonradial pulsations, but\nincreasing data call this explanation into question. We present studies of\nshort-term variability in seven hot DQ white dwarfs. Three (SDSS J1426+5752,\nSDSS J2200-0741, and SDSS J2348-0942) were known to be variable. Their\nphotometric modulations are coherent over at least two years, and we find no\nevidence for variability at frequencies that are not harmonics. We present the\nfirst time-series photometry for three additional hot DQs (SDSS J0236-0734,\nSDSS J1402+3818, and SDSS J1615+4543); none are observed to vary, but the\nsignal-to-noise is low. Finally, we present high speed photometry for SDSS\nJ0005-1002, known to exhibit a 2.1 d photometric variation; we do not observe\nany short-term variability. Monoperiodicity is rare among pulsating white\ndwarfs, so we contemplate whether the photometric variability is due to\nrotation rather than pulsations; similar hypotheses have been raised by other\nresearchers. If the variability is due to rotation, then hot DQ white dwarfs as\na class contain many rapid rotators. Given the lack of companions to these\nstars, the origin of any fast rotation is unclear -- both massive progenitor\nstars and double degenerate merger remnants are possibilities. We end with\nsuggestions on future work that would best clarify the nature of these rare,\nintriguing objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 21:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

No\ncomputer system has been able to reach human levels of performance so far. The\nonly known computational system capable of proper language processing is the\nhuman brain. While we gather more and more data about the brain, its\nfundamental computational processes still remain obscure. The lack of a sound\ncomputational brain theory also prevents the fundamental understanding of\nNatural Language Processing. As always when science lacks a theoretical\nfoundation, statistical modeling is applied to accommodate as many sampled\nreal-world data as possible. An unsolved fundamental issue is the actual\nrepresentation of language (data) within the brain, denoted as the\nRepresentational Problem. Starting with Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal\nMemory (HTM) theory, a consistent computational theory of the human cortex, we\nhave developed a corresponding theory of language data representation: The\nSemantic Folding Theory. The process of encoding words, by using a topographic\nsemantic space as distributional reference frame into a sparse binary\nrepresentational vector is called Semantic Folding and is the central topic of\nthis document. Semantic Folding describes a method of converting language from\nits symbolic representation (text) into an explicit, semantically grounded\nrepresentation that can be generically processed by Hawkins' HTM networks. As\nit turned out, this change in representation, by itself, can solve many complex\nNLP problems by applying Boolean operators and a generic similarity function\nlike the Euclidian Distance. Many practical problems of statistical NLP\nsystems, like the high cost of computation, the fundamental incongruity of\nprecision and recall , the complex tuning procedures etc., can be elegantly\novercome by applying Semantic Folding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 00:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 22:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

Researchers have presented various schemes in WSN,\naddressing the problems of processing, bandwidth, load balancing, and efficient\nrouting. However, little work has been done on security aspects of WSN. In a\ntypical WSN network, the tiny nodes installed on different locations sense the\nsurrounding environment, send the collected data to their neighbors, which in\nturn is forwarded to a sink node. The sink node aggregate the data received\nfrom different sensors and send it to the base station for further processing\nand necessary actions. In highly critical sensor networks such as military and\nlaw enforcement agencies networks, the transmission of such aggregated data via\nthe public network Internet is very sensitive and vulnerable to various attacks\nand risks. Therefore, this paper provides a solution for addressing these\nsecurity issues based on steganography, where the aggregated data can be\nembedded as a secret message inside an innocent-looking cover image. The stego\nimage containing the embedded data can be then sent to fusion center using\nInternet.

One model, referred to as Associative\nPlasticity-based Rate-Independent Model (APRIM), works for purely elastic\nbodies and involves, in addition to an interface damage variable, an auxiliary\nvariable (representing interfacial plastic slip) to provide a fracture-mode\nsensitivity. It relies on a particular concept of force-driven local solutions\n(given by either vanishing-viscosity concept or maximum-dissipation principle).\nThe other model, referred to as Linear Elastic - (perfectly) Brittle Interface\nModel (LEBIM), works visco-elastic bodies and rely on a conventional concept of\nweak solution and needs no auxiliary interfacial variable.

Quantum systems scan all possible available states and switch randomly\nand very rapidly among them. The longer they remain in a given state, the\nlarger the probability of the system to be found in that state during a\nmeasurement. A crucial property that we postulate is quantum inertia, that\nincreases whenever a constituent is added, or the system is perturbed with all\nkinds of interactions. Once the quantum inertia $I_q$ reaches a critical value\n$I_{cr}$ for an observable, the switching among the different eigenvalues of\nthat observable stops and the corresponding superposition comes to an end.\nConsequently, increasing the mass, temperature, gravitational force, etc. of a\nquantum system increases its quantum inertia until the superposition of states\ndisappears for all the observables and the system transmutes into a classical\none. The process could be reversible: decreasing the size, temperature,\ngravitational force, etc. of a classical system one could revert the situation.\nEntanglement can only occur between quantum systems, not between a quantum\nsystem and a classical one, because an exact synchronization between the\nswitchings of the systems involved must be established in the first place and\nclassical systems do not have any switchings to start with. Future experiments\nmight determine the critical inertia $I_{cr}$ corresponding to different\nobservables. In addition, our proposal implies a new radiation mechanism in\nstrong gravitational fields, giving rise to non-thermal synchrotron emission,\nthat could contribute to neutron star formation. Superconductivity,\nsuperfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensates, and any other physical phenomena at\nvery low temperatures must be reanalyzed in the light of this interpretation,\nas well as mesoscopic systems in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 18:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 14:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 16:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

These summarized data\ncomprise the coefficients and standard errors from univariate regression models\nof the risk factor on each genetic variant, and of the outcome on each genetic\nvariant.
