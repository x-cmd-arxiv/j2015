In this contribution, an\nextension of such an on-the-fly strategy to multivariate data is investigated.\nThe proposed algorithm relies on the local validation of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\nconditions on the dual problem. Showing that the non-local nature of the\nmultivariate setting precludes to obtain an exact on-the-fly solution, we\ndevise an on-the-fly algorithm delivering an approximate solution, whose\nquality is controlled by a practitioner-tunable parameter, acting as a\ntrade-off between quality and computational cost. Performance assessment shows\nthat high quality solutions are obtained on-the-fly while benefiting of\ncomputational costs several orders of magnitude lower than standard iterative\nprocedures. The proposed algorithm thus provides practitioners with an\nefficient multivariate change-point detection on-the-fly procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 17:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In addition to\nhaving good practical performances, these methods are supported by a\nwell-developed theory. Kernel methods use an implicit mapping of the input data\ninto a high dimensional feature space defined by a kernel function, i.e., a\nfunction returning the inner product between the images of two data points in\nthe feature space. Central to any kernel method is the kernel matrix, which is\nbuilt by evaluating the kernel function on a given sample dataset.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of non-asymptotic spectral theory of\nrandom kernel matrices. These are n x n random matrices whose (i,j)th entry is\nobtained by evaluating the kernel function on $x_i$ and $x_j$, where\n$x_1,...,x_n$ are a set of n independent random high-dimensional vectors. Our\nmain contribution is to obtain tight upper bounds on the spectral norm (largest\neigenvalue) of random kernel matrices constructed by commonly used kernel\nfunctions based on polynomials and Gaussian radial basis.\n  As an application of these results, we provide lower bounds on the distortion\nneeded for releasing the coefficients of kernel ridge regression under\nattribute privacy, a general privacy notion which captures a large class of\nprivacy definitions. Kernel ridge regression is standard method for performing\nnon-parametric regression that regularly outperforms traditional regression\napproaches in various domains. Our privacy distortion lower bounds are the\nfirst for any kernel technique, and our analysis assumes realistic scenarios\nfor the input, unlike all previous lower bounds for other release problems\nwhich only hold under very restrictive input settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-23"}

By adjusting the maximum time offset between a pair of\ndata segments to be coherently combined, one can tune the method to trade off\nsensitivity and computing costs. In particular, the detectable signal amplitude\nscales as the inverse fourth root of this coherence time. The improvement in\namplitude sensitivity for a search with a coherence time of 1hr, compared with\na directed stochastic background search with 0.25Hz wide bins is about a factor\nof 5.4.

This results in large fractions of the stellar\npopulations in the feedback simulation becoming dissociated from dense gas.\nHowever, where star formation \\emph{does} occur in both control and feedback\nsimulations, it does so in dense gas, so the correlation between star formation\nactivity and dense gas is preserved.

While it is universally understood that\nsingle-field inflation predicts negligible scale-dependent bias compared to\ncurrent observational uncertainties, there is still disagreement on the exact\nlevel of scale-dependent bias at a level that could strongly impact inferences\nmade from future surveys. In this paper, we clarify this confusion and derive\nin various ways that there is exactly zero scale-dependent bias in single-field\ninflation. Much of the current confusion follows from the fact that\nsingle-field inflation does predict a mode coupling of matter perturbations at\nthe level of $f_{NL}^{loc} \\approx -5/3$, which naively would lead to\nscale-dependent bias. However, we show explicitly that this mode coupling\ncancels out when perturbations are evaluated at a fixed physical scale rather\nthan fixed coordinate scale. Furthermore, we show how the absence of\nscale-dependent bias can be derived easily in any gauge. This result can then\nbe incorporated into a complete description of the observed galaxy clustering,\nincluding the previously studied general relativistic terms, which are\nimportant at the same level as scale-dependent bias of order $f_{NL}^{loc} \\sim\n1$.

We explore the role of two-body relaxation, mass segregation, stellar\nevolution and binary heating in affecting the disk evolution, and consider the\nimpact of the nuclear cluster structure and the stellar-disk mass-function. We\nuse analytic arguments and numerical calculations, and apply them to study the\nevolution of a stellar disk (similar to that observed in the Galactic center;\nGC), both on the short (few Myr) and longer (100 Myr) evolutionary timescales.\nWe find the dominant processes affecting the disk evolution are two-body\nrelaxation and mass segregation where as binary heating have only a little\ncontribution. Massive stars play a dominant role in kinematically heating low\nmass stars, and driving them to high eccentricities/inclinations. Multi-mass\nmodels with realistic mass-functions for the disk stars show the disk structure\nto be mass stratified, with the most massive stars residing in thinner\nstructures. Stellar evolution plays an important role in decreasing the number\nof massive stars with time, thereby leading to slower relaxation, where the\nremnant compact objects of these stars are excited to higher\neccentricities/inclinations. At these later evolutionary stages dynamical\nheating by the nuclear cluster plays a progressively more important role. We\nconclude that the high eccentricities of the disk-stars in the Galactic Center\nsuggest that the disk formed with initially high eccentricities, or that\ncollective or secular processes dominate the disk evolution. Finally, we find\nthat the disk structure is expected to keep a thin structure even after 100\nMyrs.

We apply a variant of\nthe cross-correlation technique to HARPS observations of 51 Peg to detect the\nreflected signal from planet 51 Peg b. Our method makes use of the\ncross-correlation function of a binary mask with high-resolution spectra to\namplify the minute planetary signal that is present in the spectra by a factor\nproportional to the number of spectral lines when performing the cross\ncorrelation. The resulting cross-correlation functions are then normalized by a\nstellar template to remove the stellar signal. Carefully selected sections of\nthe resulting normalized CCFs are stacked to increase the planetary signal\nfurther. The recovered signal allows probing several of the planetary\nproperties, including its real mass and albedo.

The survey covers over 3000\nsquare degrees in the sky and monitors regularly over a billion sources.\n  The main targets include the inner Galactic Bulge and the Magellanic System.\nTheir photometry spans the range of $12<I<21$ mag and $13<I<21.7$ mag,\nrespectively. Supplementary shallower Galaxy Variability Survey covers the\nextended Galactic bulge and 2/3 of the whole Galactic disk within the magnitude\nrange of $10<I<19$ mag. All OGLE-IV surveys provide photometry with\nmilli-magnitude accuracy at the bright end. The cadence of observations varies\nfrom 19-60 minutes in the inner Galactic bulge to 1-3 days in the remaining\nGalactic bulge fields, Magellanic System and the Galactic disk.\n  OGLE-IV provides the astronomical community with a number of real time\nservices. The Early Warning System (EWS) contains information on two thousand\ngravitational microlensing events being discovered in real time annually, the\nOGLE Transient Detection System (OTDS) delivers over 200 supernovae a year. We\nalso provide the real time photometry of unpredictable variables such as\noptical counterparts to the X-ray sources and R CrB stars.\n  Hundreds of thousands new variable stars have already been discovered and\nclassified by the OGLE survey. The number of new detections will be at least\ndoubled during the current OGLE-IV phase. The survey was designed and optimized\nprimarily to conduct the second generation microlensing survey for exoplanets.\nIt has already contributed significantly to the increase of the discovery rate\nof microlensing exoplanets and free-floating planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 20:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

After a short description of the numerous recent\nprogresses in this field, and a brief overview of the theory, we focus on the\nissue of phonon wavevector sampling convergence, until now poorly understood.\nIndeed, the renormalization is obtained numerically through a q-point sampling\ninside the BZ. For q-points close to G, we show that a divergence due to\nnon-zero Born effective charge appears in the electron-phonon matrix elements,\nleading to a divergence of the integral over the BZ for band extrema. Although\nit should vanish for non-polar materials, unphysical residual Born effective\ncharges are usually present in ab-initio calculations. Here, we propose a\nsolution that improves the coupled q-point convergence dramatically. For polar\nmaterials, the problem is more severe: the divergence of the integral does not\ndisappear in the adiabatic harmonic approximation, but only in the\nnon-adiabatic harmonic approximation. In all cases, we study in detail the\nconvergence behavior of the renormalization as the q-point sampling goes to\ninfinity and the imaginary broadening parameter goes to zero. This allows\nextrapolation, thus enabling a systematic way to converge the renormalization\nfor both polar and non-polar materials.

Quasi-single-field (QsF) inflation is a relatively simple family of\nphenomenological models that serve as a proxy for theories with additional\nfields with masses $m\\sim H$. Since QsF inflation involves fields in addition\nto the inflaton, the consistency conditions (ccs) between correlations that\narise in single-clock inflation are not necessarily satisfied. As a result,\ncorrelation functions in the squeezed limit may be larger than in single-field\ninflation. Scalar non-Gaussianities mediated by the massive isocurvature field\nin QsF have been shown to be potentially observable. These are especially\ninteresting since they would convey information about the mass of the\nisocurvature field. Here we consider non-Gaussian correlators involving tensor\nmodes and their observational signatures. A physical correlation between a\n(long-wavelength) tensor mode and two scalar modes (tss), for instance, may\ngive rise to local departures from statistical isotropy or, in other words, a\nnon-trivial four-point function. The presence of the tensor mode may moreover\nbe inferred geometrically from the shape dependence of the four-point function.\nWe compute tss and stt (one soft curvature mode and two hard tensors) bispectra\nin QsF inflation, identifying the conditions necessary for these to \"violate\"\nthe ccs. We find that while ccs are violated by stt correlations, they are\npreserved by the tss in the minimal QsF model.

Several the state-of-the-art methods\nfollow the structure of existing classification algorithms and are all\niterative, which is suboptimal due to the locally optimal choices and the\nover-divided privacy budget among many sequentially composed steps. Instead, we\npropose a new approach, PrivPfC, a new differentially private method for\nreleasing data for classification. The key idea is to privately select an\noptimal partition of the underlying dataset using the given privacy budget in\none step. Given one dataset and the privacy budget, PrivPfC constructs a pool\nof candidate grids where the number of cells of each grid is under a data-aware\nand privacy-budget-aware threshold. After that, PrivPfC selects an optimal grid\nvia the exponential mechanism by using a novel quality function which minimizes\nthe expected number of misclassified records on which a histogram classifier is\nconstructed using the published grid. Finally, PrivPfC injects noise into each\ncell of the selected grid and releases the noisy grid as the private synopsis\nof the data.

The use of\ndistributed gradient methods is a common approach to solve this problem.

Each\nuser has partial knowledge of each message as side information. However, unlike\nclassic index coding, in BIC, the sender is uncertain of what side information\nis available to each user. In particular, the sender only knows the amount of\nbits in each user's side information but not its content. This problem can\narise naturally in caching and wireless networks. In order to blindly exploit\nside information in the BIC problem, we develop a hybrid coding scheme that\nXORs uncoded bits of a subset of messages with random combinations of bits from\nother messages. This scheme allows us to strike the right balance between\nmaximizing the transmission rate to each user and minimizing the interference\nleakage to others.

An outstanding problem with the\nexisting formation models is that the distribution of orbital inclinations they\npredicted is narrower than the one inferred from observations. Here we perform\nnumerical simulations of Kuiper belt formation starting from an initial state\nwith Neptune at 20 < a_{N,0} < 30 AU and a dynamically cold outer disk\nextending from beyond a_{N,0} to 30 AU. Neptune's orbit is migrated into the\ndisk on an e-folding timescale 1 <= tau <= 100 Myr. A small fraction (~10^{-3})\nof the disk planetesimals become implanted into the Kuiper belt in the\nsimulations. By analyzing the orbital distribution of the implanted bodies in\ndifferent cases we find that the inclination constraint implies that tau >= 10\nMyr and a_{N,0} <= 25 AU. The models with tau < 10 Myr do not satisfy the\ninclination constraint, because there is not enough time for various dynamical\nprocesses to raise inclinations. The slow migration of Neptune is consistent\nwith other Kuiper belt constraints, and with recently developed models of\nplanetary instability/migration.

Companion galaxies in groups tend to have\nlower stellar masses, smaller linear diameters and fainter mean surface\nbrightnesses as the distance to their host decreases. The hydrogen-to-stellar\nmass ratio of the companions increases with their linear projected separation\nfrom the dominant luminous galaxy. This tendency is more expressed around the\nbulge-dominated hosts. While linear separation of the companions decreases,\ntheir mean sSFR becomes lower, accompanied with the increasing sSFR scatter.\nTypical linear projected separation of dSphs around the bulge-dominated hosts,\n350 kpc, is substantially larger than that around the disk-dominated ones, 130\nkpc.

To address this issue, we propose a framework by breaking\na tracker down into five constituent parts, namely, motion model, feature\nextractor, observation model, model updater, and ensemble post-processor. We\nthen conduct ablative experiments on each component to study how it affects the\noverall result. Surprisingly, our findings are discrepant with some common\nbeliefs in the visual tracking research community. We find that the feature\nextractor plays the most important role in a tracker. On the other hand,\nalthough the observation model is the focus of many studies, we find that it\noften brings no significant improvement. Moreover, the motion model and model\nupdater contain many details that could affect the result. Also, the ensemble\npost-processor can improve the result substantially when the constituent\ntrackers have high diversity. Based on our findings, we put together some very\nelementary building blocks to give a basic tracker which is competitive in\nperformance to the state-of-the-art trackers. We believe our framework can\nprovide a solid baseline when conducting controlled experiments for visual\ntracking research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 06:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

The ice chemistry of oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and complex\norganic molecules (COMs) was analyzed. We found that an ice-depth dimension,\nmeasured, e.g., in monolayers, is essential for modeling of chemistry in\ninterstellar ices. Particularly, the H2O:CO:CO2:N2:NH3 ice abundance ratio\nregulates the production and destruction of minor species. It is suggested that\nphotodesorption during core collapse period is responsible for high abundance\nof interstellar H2O2 and O2H, and other species synthesized on the surface.

However, in many neurotoxic and neurodegenerative disorders,\nmicrotubules and neurofilaments segregate apart from each other, with\nmicrotubules and membranous organelles clustered centrally and neurofilaments\ndisplaced to the periphery. This striking segregation precedes abnormal and\nexcessive neurofilament accumulation in these diseases, which in turn leads to\nfocal axonal swellings. While neurofilament accumulation suggests the\nimpairment of neurofilament transport along axons, the underlying mechanism of\ntheir segregation from microtubules remains poorly understood for over 30\nyears. To address this question, we developed a stochastic multiscale model for\nthe cross-sectional distribution of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons.\nThe model describes microtubules, neurofilaments and organelles as interacting\nparticles in a 2D cross-section, and incorporates the stochastic interactions\nthese particles through molecular motors. Simulations of the model demonstrate\nthat organelles can pull nearby microtubules together, and in the absence of\nneurofilament transport, this mechanism gradually segregates microtubules from\nneurofilaments on a time scale of hours, similar to that observed in toxic\nneuropathies. This suggests that the microtubule-neurofilament segregation is\nsimply a consequence of the selective impairment of neurofilament transport.\nThe model generates the experimentally testable prediction that the rate and\nextent of segregation will be dependent on the sizes of the moving organelles\nas well as the density of their traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 09:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

After 5 Myr, the fraction of discs smaller\nthan 1000 AU in ONC-like clusters with an average number density of 60pc$^3$,\nthe fraction of discs smaller than 1000 AU is 65%, while discs smaller than 100\nAU make up 15%. These fractions increase to 84% and 39% for discs in denser\nclusters like IC 348 (500pc$^3$). Even in clusters with a density four times\nlower than in the ONC (15pc$^3$), about 43% of all discs are reduced to sizes\nbelow 1 000 AU and roughly 9% to sizes below 100 AU. Conclusions. For any disc\nin the ONC that initially was larger than 1 000 AU, the probability to be\ntruncated to smaller disc sizes as a result of stellar encounters is quite\nhigh. Thus, among other effects, encounters are important in shaping discs and\npotentially forming planetary systems in stellar clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 09:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 13:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

A map of this\nemission may become useful for various studies by identifying regions where\ndust affects observations by either scattering light or absorbing radiation.\nMETHODS: We construct mosaics of the FUV and near ultraviolet diffuse emission\nover a large sky region (RA 12 to 13 hours, DEC 0 to 20 degrees) surrounding\nthe Virgo cluster, using all the GALEX available data in the area. We test for\nthe first time the utilisation of the FUV diffuse light as a Galactic\nextinction E(B-V) tracer. RESULTS: The FUV diffuse light scattered on cirrus\nreveals details in their geometry. Despite a large dispersion, the FUV diffuse\nlight correlates roughly with other Galactic dust tracers (coming from IRAS,\nHerschel, Planck), offering an opportunity to use the FUV emission to locate\nthem in future studies with a better resolution (about 5 arcsec native\nresolution, 20 arcsec pixels maps presented in this paper) than several usual\ntracers. Estimating the Galactic dust extinction on the basis of this emission\nallows us to find a smaller dispersion in the NUV-i colour of background\ngalaxies at a given E(B-V)than with other tracers. The diffuse light mosaics\nobtained in this work are made publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 09:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

While weighted automata over\nfinite and infinite words provide a natural and flexible framework to express\nquantitative properties, perhaps surprisingly, some basic system properties\nsuch as average response time cannot be expressed using weighted automata, nor\nin any other know decidable formalism. In this work, we introduce nested\nweighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes it\npossible to express important quantitative properties such as average response\ntime. In nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collects\nresults from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along a\nfinite portion of an infinite word. Nested weighted automata can be viewed as\nthe quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-time\nverification. We establish an almost complete decidability picture for the\nbasic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate their\napplicability in several domains.

Its eigenvalues\nfollow a probability distribution, determined by the thermal equilibrium state.\nWhile in non-interacting systems the distribution is normal with variance $\\sim\nN$, interaction couples the single-particle momenta, so that the distribution\nof their sum is unpredictable, except for some implications of Galilean\ninvariance. First, we present these implications which are strong in 1D,\nmoderately strong in 2D, and weak in 3D. Then, we speculate about the possible\nform of the distribution in fluids, crystals, and superfluids. The existence of\nphonons suggests that the total momentum can remain finite when $N\\to\\infty$.\nWe argue that in fluids the finite momenta distribute continuously, but their\nintegrated probability is smaller than 1, because the momentum can also tend to\ninfinity with $N$. In the fluid-crystal transition we expect that the total\nmomentum becomes finite with full probability and distributed over a lattice,\nand that in the fluid-superfluid transition a delta peak appears only at zero\ntotal momentum. Based on this picture, we discuss the superfluid flow in both\nthe frictionless and the dissipative cases, and derive a temperature-dependent\ncritical velocity. Finally, we show that Landau's criterion for excitations in\nmoving superfluids is an in some cases correct result of an erroneous\nderivation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 12:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 10:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 22:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

This work addresses this general question\nthrough the specific use of a quantized and dithered random linear mapping\nwhich combines, in the following order, a sub-Gaussian random projection in\n$\\mathbb R^M$ of vectors in $\\mathbb R^N$, a random translation, or \"dither\",\nof the projected vectors and a uniform scalar quantizer of resolution\n$\\delta>0$ applied componentwise.

In this case, we show that the embedding is actually\n\"quasi-isometric\" and only suffers of both multiplicative and additive\ndistortions whose magnitudes decrease as $M^{-1/5}$ for general sets, and as\n$M^{-1/2}$ for structured set, when $M$ increases. Second, when one is only\ninterested in characterizing the maximal distance separating two elements of\n$\\mathcal K$ mapped to the same quantized vector, i.e., the \"consistency width\"\nof the mapping, we show that for a similar number of measurements and with high\nprobability this width decays as $M^{-1/4}$ for general sets and as $1/M$ for\nstructured ones when $M$ increases.

The boundary layer flow over a smooth forward-facing stepped\nplate is studied with particular emphasis on stabilisation and destabilisation\nof the Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves and subsequently on transition. The\ninteraction between TS waves at a range of frequencies and a base flow over a\nsingle/two forward facing smooth steps is conducted by linear analysis. The\nresults indicate that for a high frequency TS wave, the amplitude of the TS\nwave is attenuated in the unstable regime of the neutral stability curve\ncorresponding to a flat plate boundary layer. Furthermore, it is observed that\ntwo smooth forward facing steps lead to a more acute reduction of the amplitude\nof the TS wave.

The low-order model preserves the\nmain structural aspects of the full-order one, and its parameters can be\nstraightforwardly used in arc simulation tools based on computational fluid\ndynamics.

It is\nespecially important for the small intestine, where traditional invasive\nendoscopies cannot reach. Although WCE represents an extremely important\nadvance in medical imaging, a major drawback that remains unsolved is the WCE\nprecise location in the human body during its operating time. This is mainly\ndue to the complex physiological environment and the inherent capsule effects\nduring its movement. When an abnormality is detected, in the WCE images,\nmedical doctors do not know precisely where this abnormality is located\nrelative to the intestine and therefore they can not proceed efficiently with\nthe appropriate therapy. The primary objective of the present paper is to give\na contribution to WCE localization, using image-based methods. The main focus\nof this work is on the description of a multiscale elastic image registration\napproach, its experimental application on WCE videos, and comparison with a\nmultiscale affine registration. The proposed approach includes registrations\nthat capture both rigid-like and non-rigid deformations, due respectively to\nthe rigid-like WCE movement and the elastic deformation of the small intestine\noriginated by the GI peristaltic movement. Under this approach a qualitative\ninformation about the WCE speed can be obtained, as well as the WCE location\nand orientation via projective geometry. The results of the experimental tests\nwith real WCE video frames show the good performance of the proposed approach,\nwhen elastic deformations of the small intestine are involved in successive\nframes, and its superiority with respect to a multiscale affine image\nregistration, which accounts for rigid-like deformations only and discards\nelastic deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 14:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

In this context, we have studied the physical properties of\ndisc galaxies without classical bulges in comparison to those with classical\nbulges since z~0.9. Using images from the Hubble Space Telescope and Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, we have computed both parametric and non-parametric\nmeasures, and examined the evolution in size, concentration, stellar mass,\neffective stellar mass density and asymmetry. We find that both disc galaxies\nwith and without classical bulges have gained more than 50% of their present\nstellar mass over the last ~8 Gyrs. Also, the increase in disc size is found to\nbe peripheral. While the average total (Petrosian) radius almost doubles from\nz~0.9 to z~0, the average effective radius undergoes a marginal increase in\ncomparison. Additionally, increase in the density of the inner region is\nevident through the evolution of both concentration and effective stellar mass\ndensity. We find that the asymmetry index falls from higher to lower redshifts,\nbut this is more pronounced for the bulgeless disc sample. Also, asymmetry\ncorrelates with the global effective radius, and concentration correlates with\nthe global Sersic index, but better so for higher redshifts only. The\nsubstantial increase in mass and size indicates that accretion of external\nmaterial has been a dominant mode of galaxy growth, where the circumgalactic\nenvironment plays a significant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 15:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

This term originates from a quantum-theoretical\ntreatment of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT). Is the zero-point term\nreally there, or is it only an experimental artefact, due to the uncertainty\nprinciple, for phase-sensitive amplifiers? Could it be removed by\nrenormalization of theories? We discuss some historical measurement schemes\nthat do not lead to the effect predicted by the FDT, and we analyse new\nfeatures that emerge when the consequences of the zero-point term are measured\nvia the mean energy and force in a capacitor shunting the resistor. If these\nmeasurements verify the existence of a zero-point term in the noise, then two\ntypes of perpetual motion machines can be constructed. Further investigation\nwith the same approach shows that, in the quantum limit, the Johnson-Nyquist\nformula is also invalid under general conditions even though it is valid for a\nresistor-antenna system. Therefore we conclude that and a satisfactory quantum\ntheory of the Johnson noise, the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, must, as a\nminimum, include also the measurement system used to evaluate the observed\nquantities. Issues concerning the zero-point term may also have implications\nfor phenomena in advanced nanotechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 16:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 18:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 15:59:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 22:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}
