In two dimensions, when\nsignificant care is taken, they are competitive practical rootfinders. However,\nin higher dimensions they are known to miss zeros, calculate roots to low\nprecision, and introduce spurious solutions. We show that the hidden variable\nresultant method based on the Cayley (Dixon or B\\'ezout) matrix is inherently\nand spectacularly numerically unstable by a factor that grows exponentially\nwith the dimension. We also show that the Sylvester matrix for solving\nbivariate polynomial systems can square the condition number of the problem. In\nother words, two popular hidden variable resultant methods are numerically\nunstable, and this mathematically explains the difficulties that are frequently\nreported by practitioners. Regardless of how the constructed polynomial\neigenvalue problem is solved, severe numerical difficulties will be present.\nAlong the way, we prove that the Cayley resultant is a generalization of\nCramer's rule for solving linear systems and generalize Clenshaw's algorithm to\nan evaluation scheme for polynomials expressed in a degree-graded polynomial\nbasis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 16:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 20:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 16:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

The goal is to understand how and\nwhere energy is dissipated in such a flow and to reconstruct the energy cycle\nin an experimental device where local as well as global quantities can be\nmeasured. We use PIV measurements and we model the Reynolds stress tensor to\ntake subgrid scales into account. This procedure involves a free parameter that\nis calibrated using angular momentum balance. We then estimate the local and\nglobal mean injected and dissipated power for several types of impellers, for\nvarious Reynolds numbers and for various flow topologies. These PIV estimates\nare then compared with direct injected power estimates provided by torque\nmeasurements at the impellers. The agreement between PIV estimates and direct\nmeasurements depends on the flow topology. In symmetric situations, we are able\nto capture up to 90% of the actual global energy dissipation rate. However, our\nresults become increasingly inaccurate as the shear layer responsible for most\nof the dissipation approaches one of the impellers, and cannot be resolved by\nour PIV set-up. Finally, we show that a very good agreement between PIV\nestimates and direct measurements is obtained using a new method based on the\nwork of Duchon and Robert which generalizes the K\\'arm\\'an-Howarth equation to\nnonisotropic, nonhomogeneous flows. This method provides parameter-free\nestimates of the energy dissipation rate as long as the smallest resolved scale\nlies in the inertial range.

Just\nrecently, it was shown by Klyachko that this antisymmetry of fermionic wave\nfunctions leads to further restrictions on natural occupation numbers. These\nso-called generalized Pauli constraints (GPC) significantly strengthen Pauli's\nexclusion principle. Our first goal is to develop an understanding of the\nmathematical concepts behind Klyachko's work, in the context of quantum\nmarginal problems. Afterwards, we explore the physical relevance of GPC and\nstudy concrete physical systems from that new viewpoint.\n  In the first part of this thesis we review Klyachko's solution of the\nunivariate quantum marginal problem. In particular we break his abstract\nderivation based on algebraic topology down to a more elementary level and\nreveal the geometrical picture behind it.\n  The second part explores the possible physical relevance of GPC. We review\nthe effect of pinning, i.e. the saturation of some GPC by given natural\noccupation numbers and explain its consequences. Although this effect would be\nquite spectacular we argue that pinning is unnatural. Instead, we conjecture\nthe effect of quasipinning, defined by occupation numbers close to (but not\nexactly on) the boundary of the allowed region.\n  In the third part we study concrete fermionic quantum systems from the new\nviewpoint of GPC. In particular, we compute the natural occupation numbers for\nthe ground state of a family of interacting fermions in a harmonic potential.\nIntriguingly, we find that the occupation numbers are strongly quasipinned,\neven up to medium interaction strengths.

In the present work, it is shown that even much\nhigher enhancement of EM fields is obtained by exciting the LSPs through\nextended surface plasmons (ESPs) generated at the metallic film surface using\nthe Kretschmann-Raether configuration. We show that the largest EM field\nenhancement and the highest surface-enhanced fluorescence intensity are\nobtained when the incidence angle is the ESP resonance angle of the underlying\nmetal film. The finite-difference time-domain simulations indicate that\nexcitation of LSPs using ESPs can generate 1-3 orders higher EM field intensity\nthan direct excitation of the LSPs using incidence from free space. The\nultrahigh enhancement is attributed to the strong confinement of the ESP waves\nin the vertical direction. The drastically intensified EM fields are\nsignificant for highly-sensitive refractive index sensing, surface-enhanced\nspectroscopies, and enhancing the efficiency of optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 18:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

A grid-based modelling method is used, in which no assumptions are\nmade about the RLF shape and high-redshift behaviour. The inputs to the model\nare the same as in Rigby et al. (2011): redshift distributions from radio\nsource samples, together with source counts and determinations of the local\nluminosity function.

This allows us to draw out the\nmost helpful historical data, and exploit spatio-temporal patterns in the data\nfor accurate and fast predictions. We further provide efficient estimation and\ncustomizable prediction procedures. stKDE is easy to use and interpret by\nnon-specialized personnel from the emergency medical service industry.

The minimal-basis\napproximation causes molecular polarization to be underestimated, and hence\nintermolecular interaction energies are also underestimated, especially for\nintermolecular interactions involving charged species. In this work, the\nthird-order self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding method\n(DFTB3) is augmented with an auxiliary response density using the\nchemical-potential equalization (CPE) method and an empirical dispersion\ncorrection (D3). The parameters in the CPE and D3 models are fitted to\nhigh-level CCSD(T) reference interaction energies for a broad range of chemical\nspecies, as well as dipole moments calculated at the DFT level; the impact of\nincluding polarizabilities of molecules in the parameterization is also\nconsidered. Parameters for the elements H, C, N, O and S are presented. The\nRMSD interaction energy is improved from 6.07 kcal/mol to 1.49 kcal/mol for\ninteractions with one charged specie, whereas the RMSD is improved from 5.60\nkcal/mol to 1.73 for a set of 9 salt bridges, compared to uncorrected DFTB3.\nFor large water clusters and complexes that are dominated by dispersion\ninteractions, the already satisfactory performance of the DFTB3-D3 model is\nretained; polarizabilities of neutral molecules are also notably improved.\nOverall, the CPE extension of DFTB3-D3 provides a more balanced description of\ndifferent types of non-covalent interactions than NDDO type of semi-empirical\nmethods (e.g., PM6-D3H4) and PBE-D3 with modest basis sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 20:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

By focusing on a simple, yet widely\nstudied, set-up in which a Fusion Center (FC) is asked to make a binary\ndecision about a sequence of system states by relying on the possibly corrupted\ndecisions provided by local nodes, we propose a game-theoretic framework which\npermits to exploit the superior performance provided by optimum decision\nfusion, while limiting the amount of a-priori knowledge required. We first\nderive the optimum decision strategy by assuming that the statistical behavior\nof the Byzantines is known.

We use numerical simulations to\nderive the equilibrium of the game, thus identifying the optimum behavior for\nboth the FC and the Byzantines, and to evaluate the achievable performance at\nthe equilibrium. We analyze several different setups, showing that in all cases\nthe proposed solution permits to improve the accuracy of data fusion.

We recover a low-rank\nmatrix $X$ by maximizing the likelihood ratio with a constraint on the nuclear\nnorm of $X$, and the observations are mapped from entries of $X$ through\nmultiple link functions. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds on the\nrecovery error, which meet up to a constant factor $\\mathcal{O}(K^{3/2})$ where\n$K$ is the fixed number of categories. The upper bound in our case depends on\nthe number of categories implicitly through a maximization of terms that\ninvolve the smoothness of the link functions. In contrast to one-bit matrix\ncompletion, our bounds for categorical matrix completion are optimal up to a\nfactor on the order of the square root of the number of categories, which is\nconsistent with an intuition that the problem becomes harder when the number of\ncategories increases. By comparing the performance of our method with the\nconventional matrix completion method on the MovieLens dataset, we demonstrate\nthe advantage of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 03:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}

For any decision problem, there\nexists a span program that leads to an algorithm with optimal quantum query\ncomplexity, but finding such an algorithm is generally challenging.\n  We consider new ways of designing quantum algorithms using span programs. We\nshow how any span program that decides a problem $f$ can also be used to decide\n\"property testing\" versions of $f$, or more generally, approximate the span\nprogram witness size, a property of the input related to $f$. For example,\nusing our techniques, the span program for OR, which can be used to design an\noptimal algorithm for the OR function, can also be used to design optimal\nalgorithms for: threshold functions, in which we want to decide if the Hamming\nweight of a string is above a threshold or far below, given the promise that\none of these is true; and approximate counting, in which we want to estimate\nthe Hamming weight of the input. We achieve these results by relaxing the\nrequirement that 1-inputs hit some target exactly in the span program, which\ncould make design of span programs easier.\n  We also give an exposition of span program structure, which increases the\nunderstanding of this important model. One implication is alternative\nalgorithms for estimating the witness size when the phase gap of a certain\nunitary can be lower bounded.

We derive that, in the limit $L \\rightarrow \\infty$, the critical\nvalues of the wrapping probability are different from those of the\nunconstrained model, i.e. the model in the grand-canonical ensemble, but still\nuniversal, for systems with $2y_t - d > 0$ where $y_t = 1/\\nu$ is the thermal\nrenormalization exponent and $d$ is the spatial dimension. Similar\nmodifications apply to other dimensionless quantities, such as Binder ratios.\nFor systems with $2y_t-d \\le 0$, these quantities share same critical universal\nvalues in the two ensembles. It is also derived that new finite-size\ncorrections are induced.

The term classical tomography is used, when the\nimaging beam travels in straight lines through the object. This assumption is\nvalid for light with short wavelengths, for example in x-ray tomography. For\nclassical tomography, a commonly used reconstruction method is the filtered\nback-projection algorithm which yields fast and stable object reconstructions.\nIn the context of single-cell imaging, the back-projection algorithm has been\nused to investigate the cell structure or to quantify the refractive index\ndistribution within single cells using light from the visible spectrum.\nNevertheless, these approaches, commonly summarized as optical projection\ntomography, do not take into account diffraction. Diffraction tomography with\nthe Rytov approximation resolves this issue. The explicit incorporation of the\nwave nature of light results in an enhanced reconstruction of the object's\nrefractive index distribution. Here, we present a full literature review of\ndiffraction tomography. We derive the theory starting from the wave equation\nand discuss its validity with the focus on applications for refractive index\ntomography.

Finally, we showcase the application of\nthe back-propagation algorithm to computer-generated scattering data.

This is a hard problem in the sense that it\ncannot be solved in asynchronous systems as soon as $k$ or more processes may\ncrash. One way to circumvent this impossibility consists in weakening its\ntermination property, requiring that a process terminates (decides) only if it\nexecutes alone during a long enough period. This is the well-known\nobstruction-freedom progress condition. Considering a system of $n$ {\\it\nanonymous asynchronous} processes, which communicate through atomic {\\it\nread/write registers only}, and where {\\it any number of processes may crash},\nthis paper addresses and solves the challenging open problem of designing an\nobstruction-free $k$-set agreement algorithm with $(n-k+1)$ atomic registers\nonly. From a shared memory cost point of view, this algorithm is the best\nalgorithm known so far, thereby establishing a new upper bound on the number of\nregisters needed to solve the problem (its gain is $(n-k)$ with respect to the\nprevious upper bound). The algorithm is then extended to address the repeated\nversion of $(n,k)$-set agreement. As it is optimal in the number of atomic\nread/write registers, this algorithm closes the gap on previously established\nlower/upper bounds for both the anonymous and non-anonymous versions of the\nrepeated $(n,k)$-set agreement problem. Finally, for $1 \\leq x\\leq k\n\\textless{} n$, a generalization suited to $x$-obstruction-freedom is also\ndescribed, which requires $(n-k+x)$ atomic registers only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 08:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}

It is shown that radiative\npreheating of unreacted mixture ahead of the flame results in a modest increase\nof the advancing flame velocity for a highly reactive gaseous fuel, or to\nconsiderable increase of the flame velocity in the case of a slow reactive\nmixture. The effects of radiation preheating as stronger as smaller the normal\nflame velocity.

However, it also increases the risk of co-channel interference and\nintroduces the possibility of correlation in the aggregated interference that\nnot only impacts the communication performance, but also makes the associated\nmathematical analysis much more complex. To address this problem and evaluate\nthe communication performance of cooperative relay networks, we adopt a\nstochastic geometry based approach by assuming that the interfering nodes are\nrandomly distributed according to a Poisson point process (PPP).

Whereas in ABA-stacked TLG, we observe magnetophonon\noscillations consistent with single-bilayer chiral band doublets, the features\nare flat for ABC-stacked TLG up to magnetic fields of 9 T. This suppression can\nbe attributed to the enhancement of band chirality that compactifies the\nspectrum of Landau levels and modifies the magnetophonon resonance properties.\nThe drastically different coupling behaviour between the electronic excitations\nand the E2g phonons in ABA- and ABC-stacked TLG reflects their different\nelectronic band structures and the electronic Landau level transitions and thus\ncan be another way to determine the stacking orders and to probe the\nstacking-order-dependent electronic structures. In addition, the sensitivity of\nthe magneto-Raman scattering to the particular stacking order in few layers\ngraphene highlights the important role of interlayer coupling in modifying the\noptical response properties in van der Waals layered materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 11:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

Bogoliubov for free energy in the context of its\napplications to various problems of statistical mechanics and condensed matter\nphysics. The review presents a terse discussion of selected works carried out\nover the past few decades on the theory of many-particle interacting systems in\nterms of the variational inequalities. It is the purpose of this paper to\ndiscuss some of the general principles which form the mathematical background\nto this approach, and to establish a connection of the variational technique\nwith other methods, such as the method of the mean (or self-consistent) field\nin the many-body problem, in which the effect of all the other particles on any\ngiven particle is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a\nmany-body problem to a single-body problem. The method is illustrated by\napplying it to various systems of many-particle interacting systems, such as\nIsing and Heisenberg models, superconducting and superfluid systems, strongly\ncorrelated systems, etc. It seems likely that these technical advances in the\nmany-body problem will be useful in suggesting new methods for treating and\nunderstanding many-particle interacting systems.

In this paper, a comparative study of estimators based on these\ndifferent types of regularizers is reported.

Existing cloud controllers often resort to scaling\nstrategies that are codified as a set of adaptation rules. However, for a cloud\nprovider, applications running on top of the cloud infrastructure are more or\nless black-boxes, making it difficult at design time to define optimal or\npre-emptive adaptation rules. Thus, the burden of taking adaptation decisions\noften is delegated to the cloud application. Yet, in most cases, application\ndevelopers in turn have limited knowledge of the cloud infrastructure. In this\npaper, we propose learning adaptation rules during runtime. To this end, we\nintroduce FQL4KE, a self-learning fuzzy cloud controller. In particular, FQL4KE\nlearns and modifies fuzzy rules at runtime. The benefit is that for designing\ncloud controllers, we do not have to rely solely on precise design-time\nknowledge, which may be difficult to acquire. FQL4KE empowers users to specify\ncloud controllers by simply adjusting weights representing priorities in system\ngoals instead of specifying complex adaptation rules. The applicability of\nFQL4KE has been experimentally assessed as part of the cloud application\nframework ElasticBench. The experimental results indicate that FQL4KE\noutperforms our previously developed fuzzy controller without learning\nmechanisms and the native Azure auto-scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 13:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}

In particular, recent\nadvances in adversary technology pose Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) which\nmay stealthily and completely compromise a cyber system. In this paper, we\ndesign a framework for the security of cloud-based systems that specifies when\na device should trust commands from the cloud which may be compromised. This\ninteraction can be considered as a game between three players: a cloud\ndefender/administrator, an attacker, and a device. We use traditional signaling\ngames to model the interaction between the cloud and the device, and we use the\nrecently proposed FlipIt game to model the struggle between the defender and\nattacker for control of the cloud. Because attacks upon the cloud can occur\nwithout knowledge of the defender, we assume that strategies in both games are\npicked according to prior commitment. This framework requires a new equilibrium\nconcept, which we call Gestalt Equilibrium, a fixed-point that expresses the\ninterdependence of the signaling and FlipIt games. We present the solution to\nthis fixed-point problem under certain parameter cases, and illustrate an\nexample application of cloud control of an unmanned vehicle.

The main feature of this black hole is that it has 4\nhorizons like event horizon, Cauchy horizon and two accelerating horizons. In\nthe non-extremal case, the surface area, entropy, surface gravity, temperature,\nangular velocity, Komar energy and irreducible mass on the event horizon and\nCauchy horizon are presented for PD black hole. The entropy product,\ntemperature product, Komar energy product and irreducible mass product are\nfound for event horizon and Cauchy horizon. Also their sums are also found for\nboth horizons. All these relations are found to be depend on mass of the PD\nblack hole and other parameters. So all the products are not universal for PD\nblack hole. The entropy and area bounds for two horizons are investigated. Also\nwe found the Christodoulou-Ruffini mass for extremal PD black hole. Finally,\nusing first law of thermodynamics, we also found the Smarr relation for PD\nblack hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 13:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

While the functional often\nfollows immediately from physical considerations (e.g., the thermodynamic\nentropy), the operator $K$ and the associated geometry does not necessarily so\n(e.g., Wasserstein geometry for diffusion). In this paper, we present a\nvariational statement in the sense of maximum entropy production that directly\ndelivers a relationship between the operator $K$ and the constraints of the\nsystem. In particular, the Wasserstein metric naturally arises here from the\nconservation of mass or energy, and depends on the Onsager resistivity tensor,\nwhich, itself, may be understood as another metric, as in the Steepest Entropy\nAscent formalism. This new variational principle is exemplified here for the\nsimultaneous evolution of conserved and non-conserved quantities in open\nsystems. It thus extends the classical Onsager flux-force relationships and the\nassociated variational statement to variables that do not have a flux\nassociated to them. We further show that the metric structure $K$ is intimately\nlinked to the celebrated Freidlin-Wentzell theory of stochastically perturbed\ngradient flows, and that the proposed variational principle encloses an\ninfinite-dimensional fluctuation-dissipation statement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 22:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 21:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 02:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

In this article we develop a general framework for\nderiving pressure-explicit EoS for impure CO2. This flexible framework\nfacilitates ongoing development of custom EoS in response to new data and\ncomputational applications. We use our method to generalise a recent EoS for\npure CO2 [Demetriades et al. Proc IMechE Part E, 227 (2013) pp. 117] to binary\nmixtures with N2, O2 and H2, obtaining model parameters by fitting to\nexperiments made under conditions relevant to CCS-pipeline transport. Our model\npertains to pressures up to 16MPa and temperatures between 273K and the\ncritical temperature of pure CO2. In this region, we achieve close agreement\nwith experimental data. When compared to the GERG EoS, our EoS has a comparable\nlevel of agreement with CO2 -N2 VLE experiments and demonstrably superior\nagreement with the O2 and H2 VLE data. Finally, we discuss future options to\nimprove the calibration of EoS and to deal with the sparsity of data for some\nimpurities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 10:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}
