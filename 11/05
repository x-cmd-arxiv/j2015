Therefore, our main goal is to construct algorithms with\nrunning time of the form $\\textrm{poly}(k)\\cdot n$ or $\\textrm{poly}(k)\\cdot\nn\\log n$, where $k$ is the width of the tree decomposition given on the input.\nSuch procedures would outperform the best known algorithms for the considered\nproblems already for moderate values of the treewidth, like $O(n^{1/c})$ for\nsome small constant $c$.\n  Our results include:\n  -- an algorithm for computing the determinant and the rank of an $n\\times n$\nmatrix using $O(k^3\\cdot n)$ time and arithmetic operations;\n  -- an algorithm for solving a system of linear equations using $O(k^3\\cdot\nn)$ time and arithmetic operations;\n  -- an $O(k^3\\cdot n\\log n)$-time randomized algorithm for finding the\ncardinality of a maximum matching in a graph;\n  -- an $O(k^4\\cdot n\\log^2 n)$-time randomized algorithm for constructing a\nmaximum matching in a graph;\n  -- an $O(k^2\\cdot n\\log n)$-time algorithm for finding a maximum vertex flow\nin a directed graph.\n  Moreover, we give an approximation algorithm for treewidth with time\ncomplexity suited to the running times as above.

The thermal structure of the lower mantle determines how much\nheat is allowed to escape the core. Hot lower mantle features, such as the\nthermal footprint of a giant impact or hot mantle plumes, will locally reduce\nthe heat flux through the core mantle boundary (CMB), thereby weakening core\nconvection and affecting the magnetic field generation process. In this study,\nwe numerically investigate how parametrised hot spots at the CMB with arbitrary\nsizes, amplitudes, and positions affect core convection and hence the dynamo.\nThe effect of the heat flux anomaly is quantified by changes in global flow\nsymmetry properties, such as the emergence of equatorial antisymmetric,\naxisymmetric (EAA) zonal flows. For purely hydrodynamic models, the EAA\nsymmetry scales almost linearly with the CMB amplitude and size, whereas\nself-consistent dynamo simulations typically reveal either suppressed or\ndrastically enhanced EAA symmetry depending mainly on the horizontal extent of\nthe heat flux anomaly. Our results suggest that the length scale of the anomaly\nshould be on the same order as the outer core radius to significantly affect\nflow and field symmetries. As an implication to Mars and in the range of our\nmodel, the study concludes that an ancient core field modified by a CMB heat\nflux anomaly is not able to heterogeneously magnetise the crust to the\npresent-day level of north--south asymmetry on Mars. The resulting magnetic\nfields obtained using our model either are not asymmetric enough or, when they\nare asymmetric enough, show rapid polarity inversions, which are incompatible\nwith thick unidirectional magnetisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 16:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

These\noperations are used to lift the static discipline to the gradual setting. The\nruntime semantics of the gradual language then arises as reductions on gradual\ntyping derivations.\n  To demonstrate the flexibility of AGT, we gradualize $\\lambda_\\text{SEC}$,\nthe prototypical security-typed language, with respect to only security labels\nrather than entire types, yielding a type system that ranges gradually from\nsimply-typed to securely-typed. We establish noninterference for the gradual\nlanguage, called $\\lambda_{\\widetilde{\\text{SEC}}}$, using Zdancewic's logical\nrelation proof method. Whereas prior work presents gradual security cast\nlanguages, which require explicit security casts, this work yields the first\ngradual security source language, which requires no explicit casts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 17:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 01:40:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2015 15:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

All our computations are exact and only the final step is numerical.\nThese numerical solutions give us fascinating results for the concurrence, such\nas quasi-random fluctuations, with a resemblance of periodicity. Another\ninteresting result we found is when the system is initially maximally entangled\n(disentangled), after the time t = 2R, the system becomes again strongly\nentangled (disentangled) particularly during the first oscillations, later this\nphenomenon could be wrecked depending on the initial condition. We also show\nthe concurrence after a too long time elapsed with a good precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 17:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 21:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

Yet, the bipolar radio jets of 1E 1740.7-2942 are\nvery reminiscent of a radio galaxy. The true nature of the object has thus\nremained an open question for nearly a quarter of a century. Aims. Our main\ngoal here is to confirm the Galactic membership of 1E 1740.7-2942 by searching\nfor morphological changes of its extended radio jets in human timescales. This\nwork was triggered as a result of recent positive detection of fast structural\nchanges in the large-scale jets of its 'twin' GRS 1758-258. Methods. We carried\nout an in-depth exploration of the VLA public archives and fully recalibrated\nall 1E 1740.7-2942 extended data sets in the C configuration of the array. We\nobtained and analyzed matching beam radio maps for five epochs, covering years\n1992, 1993, 1994, 1997 and 2000, with an angular resolution of a few\narcseconds. Results. We clearly detected structural changes in the arcminute\njets of 1E 1740.7-2942 on timescales of roughly a year, which set a firm\ndistance upper limit of 12 kpc. Moreover, a simple precessing model was\nsimultaneously fitted to the five observing epochs available. The observed\nchanges in the jet flow are strongly suggestive of a precession period of ~1.3\nyears. Conclusions. The fitting of the precession model to the data yields a\ndistance of ~5 kpc. This value, and the observed changes, rule out any\nremaining doubts about the 1E 1740.7-2942 Galactic nature. To our knowledge,\nthis microquasar is the second whose jet precession ephemeris become available\nafter SS433.

The observed bending of the A2\njet is consistent with the change of propagation direction observed at large\nscale and suggests jet precession on very short timescales (~200-600 yr). In\naddition, a chemically rich spectrum with emission from several COMs (e.g.\nHCOOH, CH3OCHO, CH3OCH3) is only detected towards A2.

The results demonstrate that reconnection\nquickly establishes power-law energy distributions for both electrons and ions\nwithin several ($2-3$) light-crossing times.

In this paper, we examine a fluid\nextraction model in which fluid flowing through a leaky channel is exchanged\nwith fluid in a reservoir. The channel walls are allowed to contract and expand\nuniformly, simulating a pumping mechanism. In order to efficiently determine\nsolutions of the model, we derive a formal power series solution for the Stokes\nequations in a finite channel with uniformly contracting/expanding permeable\nwalls. This flow has been well studied in the case of weakly permeable channel\nwalls in which the normal velocity at the channel walls is proportional to the\nwall velocity. In contrast we do not assume weakly driven flow, but flow driven\nby hydrostatic pressure, and we use Dacry's law to close our system for normal\nwall velocity. We use our flow solution to examine flux across the\nchannel-reservoir barrier and demonstrate that pumping can either enhance or\nimpede fluid extraction across channel walls.

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the\nprincipal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN\nexplosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the\njet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse\ncore mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular\nmomentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback\nmechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the\nexplosion.

Our study is focused on the amplitude of modulation of\nturbulence. In order to guide the numerical study of the flow, we first perform\nan analytical and numerical analysis of a Stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation\nfor a complex order parameter. The modulus of this order parameter models the\namplitude of modulation of turbulence. Firstly, we compute the autocorrelation\nfunction of said modulus once the band is established. Secondly, we perform a\ncalculation of average and fluctuations around the exponential growth of the\norder parameter. This type of analysis is similar to the Stochastic Structural\nStability Theory. We then perform numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes\nequations in order to confront these predictions with the actual behaviour of\nthe bands. Computation of the autocorrelation function of the modulation of\nturbulence shows quantitative agreement with the model: in the established band\nregime, the amplitude of modulation follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In\norder to test the S3T predictions, we perform quench experiments, sudden\ndecreases of the Reynolds number from uniform turbulence, in which modulation\nappears. We compute the average evolution of the amplitude of modulation and\nthe fluctuations around it. We find good agreement between numerics and\nmodeling. The average trajectory grows exponentially, at a rate clearly smaller\nthan that of the formation of laminar holes. The actual time evolution remains\nin a flaring envelope, centred on the average, and expanding at the same rate.\nThese results provide further validation of the stochastic modeling for the\ntime evolution of the bands for further studies. They stress on the difference\nbetween the oblique band formation and the formation of laminar holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 20:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

Close\nanalysis of reflected light from warm (~400-800 K) planets can distinguish\ncloudy spectra, which have moderate albedos (0.05-0.20), from hazy models,\nwhich are very dark (0.0-0.03). Reflected light spectra of cold planets (~200\nK) accessible to a space-based visible light coronagraph will have high albedos\nand large molecular features that will allow them to be more easily\ncharacterized than the warmer transiting planets. We suggest a number of\ncomplementary observations to characterize this population of planets,\nincluding transmission spectra of hot (>1000 K) targets, thermal emission\nspectra of warm targets using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), high\nspectral resolution (R~10^5) observations of cloudy targets, and reflected\nlight spectral observations of directly-imaged cold targets.

This requires the use of standard\nstar measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughput\nversus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopy\ntechniques due to various practical limitations.

This inherent\ncomputational expense associated with umbrella sampling makes it challenging to\ninvestigate the role of polarizability or electronic structure effects in\ninfluencing interfacial fluctuations.

It is generally assumed that high-resolution data\nare needed to extract meaningful behavioural patterns, which potentially limits\nthe application of this approach. Obtaining high-resolution movement data\ncontinues to be an economic and technical challenge, particularly for animals\nthat live in social groups. Here, we test whether accurate movement behaviour\ncan be extracted from data that possesses increasingly lower temporal\nresolution. To do so, we use a modified version of force matching, in which\nsimulated forces acting on a focal animal are compared to observed movement\ndata. We show that useful information can be extracted from sparse data. We\napply this approach to a sparse movement dataset collected on the adult members\nof a troop of baboons in the DeHoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. We use these\ndata to test the hypothesis that individuals are sensitive to isolation from\nthe group as a whole or, alternatively, whether they are sensitive to the\nlocation of specific individuals within the group. Using data from a focal\nanimal, our data provide support for both hypothesis, with stronger support for\nthe latter. Although the focal animal was found to be sensitive to the group,\nthis occurred only on a small number of occasions when the group as a whole was\nhighly clustered as a single entity away from the focal animal. We suggest that\nspecific social interactions may thus drive overall group cohesion. Given that\nsparse movement data is informative about individual movement behaviour, we\nsuggest that both high (~seconds) and relatively low (~minutes) resolution\ndatasets are valuable for the study of how individuals react to and manipulate\ntheir local social and ecological environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 22:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

NUMA solves the fully\ncompressible Navier-Stokes equations by means of high-order Galerkin methods\n(both spectral element as well as discontinuous Galerkin methods can be used).\nMesh generation is done using the p4est library. NUMA is capable of running\nmiddle and upper atmosphere simulations since it does not make use of the\nshallow-atmosphere approximation.\n  This paper presents the performance analysis and optimization of the spectral\nelement version of NUMA. The performance at different optimization stages is\nanalyzed using a theoretical performance model as well as measurements via\nhardware counters. Machine independent optimization is compared to machine\nspecific optimization using BG/Q vector intrinsics. By using vector intrinsics\nthe main computations reach 1.2 PFlops on the entire machine Mira (12% of the\ntheoretical peak performance). The paper also presents scalability studies for\ntwo idealized test cases that are relevant for NWP applications. The\natmospheric model NUMA delivers an excellent strong scaling efficiency of 99%\non the entire supercomputer Mira using a mesh with 1.8 billion grid points.\nThis allows to run a global forecast of a baroclinic wave test case at 3km\nuniform horizontal resolution and double precision within the time frame\nrequired for operational weather prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 00:31:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 10:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 11:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

The Norton-Ladyman controversy can therefore be\nresolved in a rigorous fashion, and moreover the formalism we introduce gives a\nset of reasoning tools for further analysis of Landauer erasure, which are\nprovably consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 01:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

We first study the\ndynamics of a reverse shock and a forward shock that are generated during the\ninteraction of a relativistic jet and its ambient medium. The jet is likely\nmagnetized with a globally large-scale magnetic field from the central engine.\nThe existence of the reverse shock requires that the magnetization degree of\nthe jet should not be high ($\\sigma\\leq 1$), so that the jet is mainly composed\nof baryons and leptons.

Here we present the results from two\nstudies of HI (in absorption) and molecular gas illustrating what can be\nlearned from these phases of the gas. We first describe a statistical study\nwith the WSRT. The study shows that the young radio sources not only have an\nhigher detection rate of HI, but also systematically broader and more\nasymmetric HI profiles, most of them blueshifted. This supports the idea that\nwe are looking at young radio jets making their way through the surrounding\nISM, which also appears to be, on average, richer in gas than in evolved radio\nsources. Signatures of the impact of the jet are seen in the kinematics of the\ngas. However, even among the young sources, we identify a population that\nremains undetected in HI even after stacking their profiles. Orientation\neffects can only partly explain the result.

The pixels that were not\nwell-described by the background model were assumed to be moving objects. Many\nsystems today maintain models for the foreground as well as the background, and\nthese models compete to explain the pixels in a video. In this paper, we argue\nthat the logical endpoint of this evolution is to simply use Bayes' rule to\nclassify pixels. In particular, it is essential to have a background\nlikelihood, a foreground likelihood, and a prior at each pixel. A simple\napplication of Bayes' rule then gives a posterior probability over the label.\nThe only remaining question is the quality of the component models: the\nbackground likelihood, the foreground likelihood, and the prior. We describe a\nmodel for the likelihoods that is built by using not only the past observations\nat a given pixel location, but by also including observations in a spatial\nneighborhood around the location. This enables us to model the influence\nbetween neighboring pixels and is an improvement over earlier pixelwise models\nthat do not allow for such influence. Although similar in spirit to the joint\ndomain-range model, we show that our model overcomes certain deficiencies in\nthat model. We use a spatially dependent prior for the background and\nforeground. The background and foreground labels from the previous frame, after\nspatial smoothing to account for movement of objects,are used to build the\nprior for the current frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 06:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

On the one hand, word equations (string logic with\nconcatenations) cannot precisely capture sanitisation functions (e.g.\nhtmlescape) and implicit browser transductions (e.g. innerHTML mutations). On\nthe other hand, transducers suffer from the reverse problem of being able to\nmodel sanitisation functions and browser transductions, but not string\nconcatenations. Naively combining word equations and transducers easily leads\nto an undecidable logic. Our main contribution is to show that the\n\"straight-line fragment\" of the logic is decidable (complexity ranges from\nPSPACE to EXPSPACE). The fragment can express the program logics of\nstraight-line string-manipulating programs with concatenations and\ntransductions as atomic operations, which arise when performing bounded model\nchecking or dynamic symbolic executions.

Due to the large path-loss exponent in the mm-Wave range\nof the spectrum, directional beamforming with a large antenna gain is necessary\nat the transmitter, the receiver or both for capturing sufficient signal power.\nThis in turn implies that fast and robust channel estimation plays a central\nrole in systems performance since without a reliable estimate of the channel\nstate the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) would be much lower than the\nminimum necessary for a reliable communication.\n  In this paper, we mainly focus on single-antenna users and a multi-antenna\nbase-station.

The aim of this study is a confirmation of\nthe spectral type for the candidates. <Method.> We have carried out NIR\nspectroscopic observations of the candidates using Subaru/IRCS/AO188/LGS.\nK-band spectra for 20 out of the 31 candidates were obtained. By determining an\nequivalent width, EW(CO), of the 12CO absorption feature at 2.294 um, we have\nderived an effective temperature and a bolometric magnitude for each candidate,\nand then constructed an HR diagram. <Results.> No young (~ Myr), massive stars\nare included in the 20 candidates we observed; however, 13 candidates are most\nlikely intermediate-age giants (50 - 500 Myr). Two other sources have ages of\n~1 Gyr, and the remaining five sources are old (> 1 Gyr), late-type giants.\n<Conclusions.> Although none of the early-type star candidates from our\nprevious narrow-band imaging observations can be confirmed as a young star, we\nfind that the photometric technique is sensitive to distinguish old, late-type\ngiants from young and intermediate-age populations.

Finding no young (~ a few Myr) stars at R = 0.5 - 3 pc favors the in-situ\nformation scenario for the presence of the young stars at R < 0.5 pc.\nFurthermore, the different spatial distributions of the young and the\nintermediate-age stars imply that the Galactic NSC is an aggregate of stars\nborn in different places and under different physical conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 08:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

In this phase, it represents a metastable state\nwhich is not the true equilibrium solution.

As it was firstly reported by the WMAP data, there may be some\nindications of statistical anisotropy on the CMB map, although the statistical\nsignificance of these findings are under debate. Motivated by these\nobservations, people begun considering new inflationary models which may lead\nto statistical anisotropy. The simplest possible way to construct anisotropic\ninflation is to introduce vector fields. During the course of this thesis, we\nstudy models of anisotropic inflation and their observational implications such\nas power spectrum, bispectrum etc. Firstly we build a new model, which contains\nthe gauge field which breaks the conformal invariance while preserving the\ngauge invariance. We show that in these kind of models, there can be an\nattractor phase in the evolution of the system when the back-reaction of the\ngauge field becomes important in the evolution of the inflaton field. We then\nstudy the cosmological perturbation theory in these kind of models. More\nspecifically, we calculate the anisotropic corrections due to the presence of\nthe vector field. We then generalize the separate universe formalism to our\nanisotropic set up and use it in some specific examples of anisotropic\ninflation. Finally, we connect the primordial anisotropies to the specific\nexamples and to CMB observations. We calculate the TT, TE, TB, EB and BB\ncorrelation in the model of charged scalar field model and look for the unique\nsignatures that the anisotropic inflation can have on the CMB map. Any future\ndetection of these statistical anisotropies would rule out the isotropic FRW\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 10:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

The properties of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) dust evolve\nin response to the local radiation field in the interstellar medium and the\nevolution of these properties is particularly dependent upon the particle size.\nAims. A model for finite-sized, low-temperature amorphous hydrocarbon\nparticles, based on the microphysical properties of random and defected\nnetworks of carbon and hydrogen atoms, with surfaces passivated by hydrogen\natoms, has been developed. Methods. The eRCN/DG and the optEC(s) models have\nbeen combined, adapted and extended into a new optEC(s)(a) model that is used\nto calculate the optical properties of hydrocarbon grain materials down into\nthe sub-nanometre size regime, where the particles contain only a few tens of\ncarbon atoms. Results. The optEC(s)(a) model predicts a continuity in\nproperties from large to small (sub-nm) carbonaceous grains. Tabulated data of\nthe size-dependent optical constants (from EUV to cm wavelengths) for a-C:H\n(nano-)particles as a function of the bulk material band gap [Eg(bulk)], or\nequivalently the hydrogen content, are provided. The effective band gap\n[Eg(eff.)] is found to be significantly larger than Eg(bulk) for hydrogen-poor\na-C(:H) nano-particles and their predicted long-wavelength ({\\lambda} >\n30{\\mu}m) optical properties differ from those derived for interstellar\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Conclusions. The optEC(s)(a) model is\nused to investigate the size-dependent structural and spectral evolution of\na-C(:H) materials under ISM conditions, including: the IR-FUV extinction, the\n217 nm bump and the infrared emission bands.

This has either\nbeen in the form of travelling waves that are propagated, or standing waves\nthat are trapped, in both cases within a segment of the accelerator chamber.\nThe variation in the wave dispersion relation caused by the periodic creation\nand decay of the electron cloud leads to a phase modulation in the former case,\nand a frequency modulation in the latter. In general, these methods enable the\nmeasurement of a time averaged electron cloud density. In this paper we propose\na time resolved measurement by using pulses propagated over a finite length of\nthe accelerator chamber. The pulses are launched periodically, once after a\nbunch train has passed and then again half a revolution period later. This\nresults in pulses alternating between a dispersion that is either affected by a\ncloud or not. The resulting spectrum of the signal can be related to the\nelectron density sampled by the pulse that propagates through the cloud. By\nvarying the delay of the launch of the pulse with respect to the train passage,\none can map the cloud density at different points behind the train.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 10:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

Given\na data matrix, low rank approximation helps to find factors, patterns and\nprovides concise representations for the data. Research on low rank\napproximation usually focus on real matrices. However, in many applications\ndata are binary (categorical) rather than continuous. This leads to the problem\nof low rank approximation of binary matrix. Here we are given a $d \\times n$\nbinary matrix $A$ and a small integer $k$. The goal is to find two binary\nmatrices $U$ and $V$ of sizes $d \\times k$ and $k \\times n$ respectively, so\nthat the Frobenius norm of $A - U V$ is minimized.

Unlike radial velocity surveys, photometric surveys do not tend to\ntarget slow rotators, inactive or metal-rich stars. Nevertheless, we suspect\nthat observational biases could also impact transiting-planet hosts. This paper\naims to evaluate how selection effects reflect on the evolutionary stage of\nboth a limited sample of transiting-planet host stars (TPH) and a wider sample\nof planet-hosting stars detected through radial velocity analysis. Then, thanks\nto uniform derivation of stellar ages, a homogeneous comparison between\nexoplanet hosts and field star age distributions is developed. Stellar\nparameters have been computed through our custom-developed isochrone placement\nalgorithm, according to PARSEC models. The notable aspects of our algorithm\ninclude the treatment of element diffusion, activity checks in terms of\n$\\log{R'_{HK}}$ and $v\\sin{i}$, and the evaluation of the stellar evolutionary\nspeed in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram in order to better constrain age.\nWorking with TPH, the observational stellar mean density $\\rho_{\\star}$ allows\nus to compute stellar luminosity even if the distance is not available, by\ncombining $\\rho_{\\star}$ with the spectroscopic $\\log{g}$. The median value of\nthe TPH ages is $\\sim5$ Gyr. Even if this sample is not very large, however,\nthe result is very similar to what we found for the sample of spectroscopic\nhosts, whose modal and median values are [3, 3.5) Gyr and $\\sim4.8$ Gyr,\nrespectively. Thus, these stellar samples suffer almost the same selection\neffects. We also conclude that the age of our Sun is consistent with the age\ndistribution of solar neighbourhood MS stars with spectral types from late F to\nearly K, regardless of whether they harbour planets or not. We considered the\npossibility that our selected samples are older than the average disc\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 13:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 12:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

To this aim, in the last\ndecade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have\nbeen proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a\nfunction of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is\npossible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up\nto now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon\ntracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion\nplanes. Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique,\nwe propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting the\nCherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after\ncrossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is\nimaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to\nreconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the\nadvantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution. To\ntest the feasibility of our new method, we have carried out simulations with a\ntoy-model based on the geometrical parameters of ASTRI SST-2M, i.e. the imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescope currently under installation onto the Etna\nvolcano. Comparing the results of our simulations with previous experiments\nbased on particle detectors, we gain at least a factor of 10 in sensitivity.\nThe result of this study shows that we resolve an empty cylinder with a radius\nof about 100 m located inside a volcano in less than 4 days, which implies a\nlimit on the magma velocity of 5 m/h.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 14:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

When the probability\ndistribution $\\mathbb{P}(X,Y)$ is known, the optimal classifier, leading to the\nminimum misclassification rate, is given by the Maximum A-posteriori\nProbability decision rule. However, estimating the complete joint distribution\n$\\mathbb{P}(X,Y)$ is computationally and statistically impossible for large\nvalues of $d$. An alternative approach is to first estimate some low order\nmarginals of $\\mathbb{P}(X,Y)$ and then design the classifier based on the\nestimated low order marginals. This approach is also helpful when the complete\ntraining data instances are not available due to privacy concerns. In this\nwork, we consider the problem of finding the optimum classifier based on some\nestimated low order marginals of $(X,Y)$. We prove that for a given set of\nmarginals, the minimum Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi (HGR) correlation principle\nintroduced in [1] leads to a randomized classification rule which is shown to\nhave a misclassification rate no larger than twice the misclassification rate\nof the optimal classifier.

Our theoretical upper-bound is\nsimilar to the recent Discrete Chebyshev Classifier (DCC) approach [2], while\nthe proposed algorithm has significant computational advantages since it only\nrequires solving a least square optimization problem.

Program-specific\n\\emph{fine-grained} locking or \\emph{non-blocking} (\\emph{i.e.}, not using\nlocks) synchronization, on the other hand, is a dark art to most programmers\nand trusted to the wisdom of a few computing experts. Thus, it is appealing to\nseek a middle ground between these two extremes: a synchronization mechanism\nthat relieves the programmer of the overhead of reasoning about data conflicts\nthat may arise from concurrent operations without severely limiting the\nprogram's performance. The \\emph{Transactional Memory (TM)} abstraction is\nproposed as such a mechanism: it intends to combine an easy-to-use programming\ninterface with an efficient utilization of the concurrent-computing abilities\nprovided by multicore architectures. TM allows the programmer to\n\\emph{speculatively} execute sequences of shared-memory operations as\n\\emph{atomic transactions} with \\emph{all-or-nothing} semantics: the\ntransaction can either \\emph{commit}, in which case it appears as executed\nsequentially, or \\emph{abort}, in which case its update operations do not take\neffect. Thus, the programmer can design software having only sequential\nsemantics in mind and let TM take care, at run-time, of resolving the conflicts\nin concurrent executions.\n  Intuitively, we want TMs to allow for as much \\emph{concurrency} as possible:\nin the absence of severe data conflicts, transactions should be able to\nprogress in parallel. But what are the inherent costs associated with providing\nhigh degrees of concurrency in TMs?

These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres. For the Milky Way, this interquartile range begins as a narrow band\nat large radii, expanding to encompass much of the galaxy at intermediate times\nbefore settling at a range of 2-13kpc. In the case of M33, the opposite\nbehaviour occurs - the initial and final interquartile ranges are quite\nsimilar, showing gradual evolution. This suggests that galaxy assembly history\nstrongly influences the time evolution of the GHZ, which will affect the\nrelative time lag between biospheres in different galactic locations.

A light-cone structure is assigned by choosing a\nset of geodesics representing light rays.
