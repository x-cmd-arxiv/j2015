Factorization of such great\nnumbers is a problematic process. There are many algorithms has been\nimplemented in the past years. The offered KNJ -Factorization algorithm\ncontributes a deterministic way to factorize RSA. The algorithm limits the\nsearch by only considering the prime values. Subsequently prime numbers are odd\nnumbers accordingly it also requires smaller number steps to factorize RSA. In\nthis paper, the anticipated algorithm is very simple besides it is very easy to\nunderstand and implement. The main concept of this KNJ factorization algorithm\nis, to check only those factors which are odd and prime. The proposed KNJ-\nFactorization algorithm works very efficiently on those factors; which are\nadjoining and close to N. The proposed factorization method can speed up if we\ncan reduce the time for primality testing. It fundamentally decreases the time\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

A mental\narchitecture is a hypothetical network of processes aimed at performing a task,\nof which we only observe the overall time it takes under variable parameters of\nthe task. It is usually assumed that the network contains several processes\nselectively influenced by different experimental factors, and then the question\nis asked as to how these processes are arranged within the network, e.g.,\nwhether they are concurrent or sequential. One way of doing this is to consider\nthe distribution functions for the overall processing time and compute certain\nlinear combinations thereof (interaction contrasts). The theory of selective\ninfluences in psychology can be viewed as a special application of the\ninterdisciplinary theory of (non)contextuality having its origins and main\napplications in quantum theory. In particular, lack of contextuality is\nequivalent to the existence of a \"hidden\" random entity of which all the random\nvariables in play are functions. Consequently, for any given value of this\ncommon random entity, the processing times and their compositions (minima,\nmaxima, or sums) become deterministic quantities. These quantities, in turn,\ncan be treated as random variables with (shifted) Heaviside distribution\nfunctions, for which one can easily compute various linear combinations across\ndifferent treatments, including interaction contrasts. This mathematical fact\nleads to a simple method, more general than the previously used ones, to\ninvestigate and characterize the interaction contrast for different types of\nseries-parallel architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 16:23:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 12:45:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 17:54:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 02:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our approach\nis based on a parametrical modeling of geometrically transformed textural image\nfragments and maximum likelihood estimation of transformation vector between\nthem. Due to the parametrical approach based on the fractional Brownian motion\nmodeling of the local fragments texture, the proposed estimator MLfBm (ML\nstands for \"Maximum Likelihood\" and fBm for \"Fractal Brownian motion\") has the\nability to better adapt to real image texture content compared to other methods\nrelying on universal similarity measures like mutual information or normalized\ncorrelation. The main benefits are observed when assumptions underlying the fBm\nmodel are fully satisfied, e.g. for isotropic normally distributed textures\nwith stationary increments. Experiments on both simulated and real images and\nfor high and weak correlation between registered images show that the MLfBm\nestimator offers significant improvement compared to other state-of-the-art\nmethods. It reduces translation vector, rotation angle and scaling factor\nestimation errors by a factor of about 1.75...2 and it decreases probability of\nfalse match by up to 5 times.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), among the best candidates\nfor dark matter, can be their own antimatter and can annihilate inside the\nstar, thereby providing a heat source. Although dark matter constitutes only\n$\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ of the stellar mass, this amount is sufficient to power the\nstar for millions to billions of years.

We review\nhow dark stars come into existence, how they grow as long as dark matter fuel\npersists, and their stellar structure and evolution. The studies were done in\ntwo different ways, first assuming polytropic interiors and more recently using\nthe MESA stellar evolution code; the basic results are the same.

Methods: In\nthis cross-sectional, retrospective study, data from 9,948 US patients between\n2009 and 2012 were used to develop a pre-screening tool to predict current type\n2 diabetes, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared (1) a full EHR\nmodel containing prescribed medications, diagnoses, and traditional predictive\ninformation, (2) a restricted EHR model where medication information was\nremoved, and (3) a conventional model containing only traditional predictive\ninformation (BMI, age, gender, hypertensive and smoking status).

One\nunique feature of the studied model is that it jointly accounts for both\nwireless channel characteristics and economic factors during resource\nallocation.

In this review, we attempt to summarize the basic idea of the\nkinetic-energy driven SC mechanism in the description of superconductivity in\ncuprate superconductors. The mechanism of the kinetic-energy driven\nsuperconductivity is purely electronic without phonons, where the\ncharge-carrier pairing interaction arises directly from the kinetic energy by\nthe exchange of spin excitations in the higher powers of the doping\nconcentration. This kinetic-energy driven d-wave SC-state is controlled by both\nthe SC gap and quasiparticle coherence, which leads to that the maximal SC\ntransition temperature occurs around the optimal doping, and then decreases in\nboth the underdoped and overdoped regimes. In particular, the same\ncharge-carrier interaction mediated by spin excitations that induces the\nSC-state in the particle-particle channel also generates the normal-state\npseudogap state in the particle-hole channel. The normal-state pseudogap\ncrossover temperature is much larger than the SC transition temperature in the\nunderdoped and optimally doped regimes, and then monotonically decreases upon\nthe increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with superconductivity\nat the end of the SC dome. This kinetic-energy driven SC mechanism also\nindicates that the strong electron correlation favors superconductivity, since\nthe main ingredient is identified into a charge-carrier pairing mechanism not\nfrom the external degree of freedom such as the phonon but rather solely from\nthe internal spin degree of freedom of the electron. The typical properties of\ncuprate superconductors discussed within the framework of the kinetic-energy\ndriven SC mechanism are also reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 06:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 10:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We show that GaN-Al2O3-MoS2 and GaN-Al2O3-MoS2-Al2O3-graphene\nvertical heterojunctions can be created with excellent rectification behaviour.\nElectroluminescence studies demonstrate prominent direct bandgap excitonic\nemission in multi-layer MoS2 over the entire vertical junction area.\nImportantly, the electroluminescence efficiency observed in multi-layer MoS2 is\ncomparable to or even higher than that in monolayers, corresponding to a\nrelative electroluminescence enhancement factor of >1000 in multi-layer MoS2\nwhen compared to its photoluminescence. This striking enhancement of\nelectroluminescence can be attributed to the high electric field induced\ncarrier redistribution from low energy points (indirect bandgap) to high energy\npoints (direct bandgap) of k-space, arising from the unique band structure of\nMoS2 with a much higher density of states at high energy points.

Compared to traditional wireless information\ntransmission, WIPT faces numerous challenges. First, it is more susceptible to\nchannel fading and path loss, resulting in a much shorter power transfer\ndistance. Second, it gives rise to the issue on how to balance spectral\nefficiency for information transmission and energy efficiency for power\ntransfer in order to obtain an optimal tradeoff. Third, there exists a security\nissue for information transmission in order to improve power transfer\nefficiency. In this context, multi-antenna techniques, e.g., energy\nbeamforming, are introduced to solve these problems by exploiting spatial\ndegree of freedom. This article provides a tutorial on various aspects of\nmulti-antenna based WIPT techniques, with a focus on tackling the challenges by\nparameter optimization and protocol design. In particular, we investigate the\nWIPT tradeoffs based on two typical multi-antenna techniques, namely limited\nfeedback multi-antenna technique for short-distance transfer and large-scale\nmultiple-input multiple-output (LS-MIMO, also known as massive MIMO) technique\nfor long-distance transfer.

The method combines\nKohn-Sham Density Functional Theory for treating the weakly interacting\nelectrons on a static mean-field level with non-perturbative many-body methods\nfor the strongly interacting electrons in the open $d$- and $f$-shells. An\neffective description of the strongly interacting electrons in terms of a\nmulti-orbital Anderson impurity model is obtained by projection onto the\nstrongly correlated subspace properly taking into account the non-orthogonality\nof the atomic basis set. A special focus lies on the ab initio calculation of\nthe effective screened interaction matrix U for the Anderson model.

The exact shape of the Fano-Kondo feature as well as\nits width depend quite strongly on the filling of the Co $3d$-shell.

The observed spectral feature of HMCs such as total number of\nemission lines and associated line intensities are also found to vary with\nevolutionary stages. We developed various 3D models for HMCs guided by the\nevolutionary scenarios proposed by recent empirical and modeling studies. We\nthen investigated the spatio-temporal variation of temperature and molecular\nabundances in HMCs by consistently coupling gas-grain chemical evolution with\nradiative transfer calculations. We explored the effects of varying physical\nconditions on molecular abundances including density distribution and\nluminosity evolution of the central protostar(s). The time-dependent\ntemperature structure of the hot core models provides a realistic framework for\ninvestigating the spatial variation of ice mantle evaporation as a function of\nevolutionary timescales. With increasing protostellar luminosity, the water ice\nevaporation font ($\\sim$100K) expands and the spatial distribution of gas phase\nabundances of these COMs also spreads out. We simulated the synthetic spectra\nfor these models at different evolutionary timescales to compare with\nobservations. A qualitative comparison of the simulated and observed spectra\nsuggests that these self-consistent hot core models can reproduce the notable\ntrends in hot core spectral variation within the typical hot core timescales of\n10$^{5}$ year. These models predict that the spatial distribution of various\nemission line maps will also expand with evolutionary time. The model\npredictions can be compared with high resolution observation that can probe\nscales of a few thousand AU in high-mass star forming regions such as from\nALMA.[Abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 14:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}
