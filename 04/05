Since\n1950s, these schemes have been widely used to solve problems in PDE and\ncontrol.

Although operator splitting techniques\nwere introduced over 60 years ago, their importance has significantly increased\nin the past decade.\n  This paper introduces a new operator-splitting scheme for solving a variety\nof problems that are reduced to a monotone inclusion of three operators, one of\nwhich is cocoercive. Our scheme is very simple, and it does not reduce to any\nexisting splitting schemes. Our scheme recovers the existing forward-backward,\nDouglas-Rachford, and forward-Douglas-Rachford splitting schemes as special\ncases.\n  Our new splitting scheme leads to a set of new and simple algorithms for a\nvariety of other problems, including the 3-set split feasibility problems,\n3-objective minimization problems, and doubly and multiple regularization\nproblems, as well as the simplest extension of the classic ADMM from 2 to 3\nblocks of variables.

In this paper we present an approach to solving for\nthe leader's optimal strategy in certain Stackelberg games where the follower's\nutility function (and thus the subsequent best response of the follower) is\nunknown.\n  Stackelberg games capture, for example, the following interaction between a\nproducer and a consumer. The producer chooses the prices of the goods he\nproduces, and then a consumer chooses to buy a utility maximizing bundle of\ngoods. The goal of the seller here is to set prices to maximize his\nprofit---his revenue, minus the production cost of the purchased bundle. It is\nquite natural that the seller in this example should not know the buyer's\nutility function. However, he does have access to revealed preference\nfeedback---he can set prices, and then observe the purchased bundle and his own\nprofit.

This problem has been a subject of extensive\nstudy in the past decade, and the resulting dynamic and opportunistic channel\naccess schemes can bring potentially significant improvement over traditional\nschemes. However, a common and severe limitation of these dynamic schemes is\nthat they almost always require some form of a priori knowledge of the channel\nstatistics. A natural remedy is a learning framework, which has also been\nextensively studied in the same context, but a typical learning algorithm in\nthis literature seeks only the best static policy, with performance measured by\nweak regret, rather than learning a good dynamic channel access policy. There\nis thus a clear disconnect between what an optimal channel access policy can\nachieve with known channel statistics that actively exploits temporal, spatial\nand spectral diversity, and what a typical existing learning algorithm aims\nfor, which is the static use of a single channel devoid of diversity gain. In\nthis paper we bridge this gap by designing learning algorithms that track known\noptimal or sub-optimal dynamic channel access and transmission scheduling\npolicies, thereby yielding performance measured by a form of strong regret, the\naccumulated difference between the reward returned by an optimal solution when\na priori information is available and that by our online algorithm. We do so in\nthe context of two specific algorithms that appeared in [1] and [2],\nrespectively, the former for a multiuser single-channel setting and the latter\nfor a single-user multichannel setting. In both cases we show that our\nalgorithms achieve sub-linear regret uniform in time and outperforms the\nstandard weak-regret learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2015 20:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

Subject to\nstandard material loss and detection efficiencies, we find that the device\nholds promises for generating substantial quantum noise squeezing over a\nbandwidth exceeding 1 GHz. In the low-propagation loss regime, approximately -7\ndB squeezing is predicted for a pump power of only 50 mW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2015 20:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

The\nobservations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Global Oscillation\nNetwork Group (GONG) are carried out to analyze the two filaments on 2013\nAugust 17-20 and September 29. The first event showed that the main body of the\nfilament was separated into two parts when an active region (AR) emerged with a\nmaximum magnetic flux of about 6.4*10^21 Mx underlying the filament. The close\nneighborhood and common direction of the bright threads in the filament and the\nopen AR fan loops suggest similar magnetic connectivity of these two flux\nsystems. The equilibrium of the filament was not destroyed within 3 days after\nthe start of the emergence of the AR. To our knowledge, similar observations\nhave never been reported before. In the second event, the emerging flux\noccurred nearby a barb of the filament with a maximum magnetic flux of\n4.2*10^20 Mx, about one order of magnitude less than that of the first event.\nThe emerging flux drove the convergence of two patches of parasitic polarity in\nthe vicinity of the barb, and resulted in cancellation between the parasitic\npolarity and nearby network fields. About 20 hours after the onset of the\nemergence, the filament was entirely erupted. Our findings imply that the\nlocation of emerging flux within the filament channel is probably crucial to\nfilament evolution. If the flux emergence appears nearby the barbs, flux\ncancellation of emerging flux with the filament magnetic fields is prone to\noccur, which probably causes the filament eruption. The comparison of the two\nevents shows that the emergence of an entire AR may still not be enough to\ndisrupt the stability of a filament system and the actual eruption does occur\nonly after the flux cancellation sets in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2015 10:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We also show that (i) it is entirely possible that these scalars are\nhidden, apart from this LFV signal; (ii) the signal strengths of $b\\bar{b}$,\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ around 125 GeV put severe constraints on the\nparameter space of such models; (iii) the constraint is further enhanced by the\nnon-observation of processes like $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$, and we predict that the\nbranching ratio of $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ cannot be even an order below the present\nexperimental limit, highlighting the role it plays in forcing $H$ and $A$ to be\nnear-degenerate; (iv) an enhancement in the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ production\ncross-section at around 125 GeV is expected in the gluon fusion channel, and\nshould be observed during the next run of the LHC; (v) the branching ratio in\nthe $e\\tau$ channel is enhanced and is expected to be at least about $2\\%$. The\nconstrained parameter space and minimum number of free parameters, along with\nsuch strong predictions, make this model easily testable and falsifiable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2015 14:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 08:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

We show that the BL Lac objects occupy\nin the MIRDD the same region as the LINERs, whereas the QSOs and Sy1s occupy an\nintermediate region, between the LINERs and the Sy2s.In the MIRDD these\ngalaxies trace a sequence that can be reproduced by a power law, $F_\\nu =\n\\nu^{\\alpha}$, where the spectral index, $\\alpha$, varies from 0 to $-2$, which\nis similar to what is observed in the optical-ultraviolet part of the spectra\nof AGNs with different luminosities.\n  For the NELGs, we perform a stellar population synthesis analysis,\ndemonstrating that the ${\\rm W}2-{\\rm W}3$ color is tightly correlated with the\nlevel of star formation in their host galaxies. A comparison of their MIR\ncolors with the colors yielded by energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies with\ndifferent activity types, shows that the SED of the LINERs is similar to the\nSEDs of the QSOs and Sy1s, consistent with AGN galaxies with mild star\nformation, whereas the SEDs of the Sy2s and TOs are consistent with AGN\ngalaxies with strong star formation components. For the BL Lac objects, we can\nonly fit a SED that has no star formation component, consistent with AGNs in\nelliptical-type galaxies.\n  From their similarities in MIR colors and SEDs, we infer that, in the nearby\nuniverse, the level of star formation activity most probably increases in the\nhost galaxies of emission-line galaxies with different activity types along the\nsequence BL\nLac$\\rightarrow$LINER$\\rightarrow$QSO/Sy1$\\rightarrow$Sy2$\\rightarrow$TO$\\rightarrow$SFG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2015 15:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Fully-compressible MHD simulations of rotating penetrative\nconvection are performed in a full-spherical shell geometry. Critical\nconditions for the transition of the differential rotation between faster\nequator (solar-type) and slower equator (anti-solar type) are explored with\nfocusing on the \"Rossby number (${\\rm Ro}$)\" and the \"convective Rossby number\n(${\\rm Ro}_{\\rm conv}$)\". It is confirmed that the transition is more gradual\nand the critical value for it is higher in the MHD model than the HD model in\nthe view of the ${\\rm Ro}_{\\rm conv}$-dependence. The rotation profile shows,\nas observed in earlier studies, the bistability near the transition in the HD\nmodel, while it disappears when allowing the growth of magnetic fields except\nfor the model with taking anti-solar type solution as the initial condition. We\nfind that the transition occurs at ${\\rm Ro} \\simeq 1$ both in the MHD and HD\nmodels independently of the hysteresis. Not only the critical value, the\nsharpness of the transition is also similar between the two models in the view\nof the ${\\rm Ro}$-dependence. The influences of the dynamo-generated magnetic\nfield and/or the hysteresis on convective motion are reflected in the ${\\rm\nRo}$. This would be the reason why the transition is unified in the view of the\n${\\rm Ro}$-dependence. We finally discuss the ${\\rm Ro}$-dependence of magnetic\ndynamo activities with emphasis on its possible relation to the kinetic\nhelicity profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2015 15:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For two twins in a closed space, a real paradox seems\nto emerge when the traveling twin is moving uniformly along a geodesic and\nreturns to the starting point without turning back. Accordingly, the reference\nframes (RF) of both twins seem to be equivalent, which makes the twin paradox\nirresolvable: each twin can claim to be at rest and therefore to have aged more\nthan the partner upon their reunion. In reality, the paradox has the resolution\nin this case as well. Apart from distinction between the two RF with respect to\nactual forces in play, they can be distinguished by clock synchronization. A\nclosed space singles out a truly stationary RF with single-valued global time;\nin all other frames, time is not a single-valued parameter. This implies that\neven uniform motion along a spatial geodesic in a compact space is not truly\ninertial, and there is an effective force on an object in such motion.\nTherefore, the traveling twin will age less upon circumnavigation than the\nstationary one, just as in flat space-time. Ironically, Relativity in this case\nemerges free of paradoxes at the price of bringing back the pre-Galilean\nconcept of absolute rest.\n  An example showing the absence of paradoxes is also considered for a more\nrealistic case of a time-evolving closed space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2015 15:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}
