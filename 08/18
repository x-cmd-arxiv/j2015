Of particular note, we expect a photon\npopulation to accompany the TeV-PeV astrophysical neutrino detection seen in\nthe IceCube instrument. Observations or limits of a photon population above\nthis energy can point to the origin of these neutrinos, indicating whether they\nare within the gamma-ray horizon or not. HAWC, with superior sensitivity to\ngamma rays between 100 GeV and 100 TeV, continuously observes the overhead sky\nand will measure or constrain isotropic emission above 1 TeV. We present a\nlimit above 10 TeV based on the background rejection achieved in a 105-day\nobservation of the Crab Nebula with HAWC. The limit will improve substantially\nwith additional data and study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 17:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

It has\nturned out that the contribution to thermoelectromotive force due to electron\ndrag by phonons is determined by the Fermi energy in the sample and phonon\nrelaxation time. The explicit temperature dependence of the contribution to\nthermoelectromotive force deriving from by phonons is weak in contrast to that\ndue to diffusion, which is directly proportional to temperature. The dependence\nobtained suggests that at the temperatures considered, a high carrier\nconcentration and for samples with a high thermal conductivity, the phonon drag\ncontribution can become dominant. Thus a theoretical limit has been established\nfor a possible increase of the thermoelectromotive force through electron drag\nby the intrinsic phonons of graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 17:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

The origin of this concept lies in attempts to fill\nthe blanks in the Everett's relative-state interpretation, and to make it a\nfully valid description of physical reality. To achieve this, it was necessary\nto consider not only the main system interacting with the measurement apparatus\n(like von Neumann and Everett did) but also the role of the environment in\neliminating correlations between different possible measurements when\ninteracting with the measurement apparatus. The interaction of the environment\nwith the main system (and the measurement apparatus) is the core of the\ndecoherence theory, which followed Everett's thesis. In this article, we review\nthe measurement process according to von Neumann, Everett's relative state\ninterpretation, the purpose of decoherence and some of its follow-up until\nWojciech Zurek's primordial paper that consolidated the concept of pointer\nstate, previously presented by Heinz Dieter Zeh. Employing a simple physical\nmodel consisting of a pair of two-level systems -- one representing the main\nsystem, the other the measurement apparatus -- and a thermal bath --\nrepresenting the environment -- we show how pointer states emerge, explaining\nits contributions to the question of measurement in quantum mechanics, as well\nas its limitations. Finally, we briefly show some of its consequences. This\npaper is accessible to readers with elementary knowledge about quantum\nmechanics, on the level of graduate courses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 18:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

In this paper we use infinite cylinder\nDMRG to provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of a Fermi sea\nof composite fermions for realistic interactions between electrons at $\\nu =\n1/2$. Moreover, we show that the state is particle-hole symmetric, in contrast\nto the construction of HLR. Instead, our findings are consistent if the\ncomposite fermions are massless Dirac particles, at finite density, similar to\nthe surface state of a 3D topological insulator. Exploiting this analogy we\ndevise a numerical test and successfully observe the suppression of $2k_F$\nbackscattering characteristic of Dirac particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 20:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-14"}

In some of these studies, the multiple testing\nprocedure can be severely biased by latent confounding factors such as batch\neffects and unmeasured covariates that correlate with both primary variable(s)\nof interest (e.g. treatment variable, phenotype) and the outcome. Over the past\ndecade, many statistical methods have been proposed to adjust for the\nconfounders in hypothesis testing. We unify these methods in the same\nframework, generalize them to include multiple primary variables and multiple\nnuisance variables, and analyze their statistical properties. In particular, we\nprovide theoretical guarantees for RUV-4 and LEAPP, which correspond to two\ndifferent identification conditions in the framework: the first requires a set\nof \"negative controls\" that are known a priori to follow the null distribution;\nthe second requires the true non-nulls to be sparse. Two different estimators\nwhich are based on RUV-4 and LEAPP are then applied to these two scenarios. We\nshow that if the confounding factors are strong, the resulting estimators can\nbe asymptotically as powerful as the oracle estimator which observes the latent\nconfounding factors. For hypothesis testing, we show the asymptotic z-tests\nbased on the estimators can control the type I error. Numerical experiments\nshow that the false discovery rate is also controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg\nprocedure when the sample size is reasonably large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 23:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 03:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 03:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

CVD is based on centroid\nvelocities of dense gas clumps, thus is less prone to density fluctuation and\nreflects more directly the cloud velocity field. Prior work demonstrated that\nthe Taurus molecular cloud CVD resembles the well-known Larson's linewidth-size\nrelation of molecular clouds. In this work, we studied the dependence of the\nCVD on the line-of-sight thickness of molecular clouds, a quantity which cannot\nbe measured by direct means. We produced a simple statistical model of cores\nwithin clouds and analyzed the CVD of a variety of hydrodynamical simulations.\nWe show that the relation between the CVD and the 2D projected separation of\ncores ($L_{2D}$) is sensitive to the cloud thickness.

We study\nthese signatures, as they appear inside and around a vortex core in the local\ndensity of states (LDOS), a property accessible experimentally by scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy. Our model retains the whole nonlocal structure of the\nself-energy in space and time and is therefore not amenable to a Hamiltonian\ntreatment using Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The interaction with the spin\nresonance does not suppress the zero-bias peak at the vortex center, although\nit reduces its spectral weight; neither does it smear out the vortex LDOS, but\nrather it adds structure to it. Some of the signatures we find may have been\nalready measured in FeSe, but remained unnoticed. We compare the LDOS as a\nfunction of both energy and position with and without coupling to the spin\nresonance and observe, in particular, that the quasiparticle interference\npatterns around the vortex are strongly damped by the coupling. We study in\ndetail the transfer of spectral weight induced both locally and globally by the\ninteraction and also by the formation of the vortex.

The goal is to infer\nthe underlying distribution of neural response probabilities across the\npopulation of MTL cells. The response probability, or neuronal sparsity, is\ndefined as the total probability that the neuron produces an above-threshold\nfiring rate during the presentation of a randomly selected stimulus. Applying\nthe method, it is shown that a beta-distributed neuronal sparsity across the\ncells of the MTL is consistent with the data. The resulting fits reveal a\nsparse and highly skewed code, with a huge majority of neurons exhibiting\nextremely low response probabilities, and a smaller minority possessing\nconsiderably higher response probabilities. The distributions are closely\napproximated by a power law at low sparsity values.

The\nalgorithm assumes minimal initial information, i.e., a set of catalog\nattributes, and defines decisional features as logic formulae combining Boolean\nand algebraic constraints over the attributes. The (unknown) utility of the\ndecision maker (DM) is modelled as a weighted combination of features. CLEO\niteratively alternates a preference elicitation step, where pairs of candidate\nsolutions are selected based on the current utility model, and a refinement\nstep where the utility is refined by incorporating the feedback received. The\nelicitation step leverages a Max-SMT solver to return optimal hybrid solutions\naccording to the current utility model. The refinement step is implemented as\nlearning to rank, and a sparsifying norm is used to favour the selection of few\ninformative features in the combinatorial space of candidate decisional\nfeatures.\n  CLEO is the first preference elicitation algorithm capable of dealing with\nhybrid domains, thanks to the use of Max-SMT technology, while retaining\nuncertainty in the DM utility and noisy feedback. Experimental results on\ncomplex recommendation tasks show the ability of CLEO to quickly focus towards\noptimal solutions, as well as its capacity to recover from suboptimal initial\nchoices.

The response of the radio stations in the 30\nto 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of\nthe incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is\ndetermined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated\nusing a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due\nto interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.\nThe spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of\nthe energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the\nAERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air\nshower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy\n-- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energy\nestimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against the\nsurface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimator\nscales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherent\nemission.

This allows us to provide a complete analytical description of\nthe dynamics driving the asymmetric regime, in which both nearby and faraway\ntargets are available to the searcher. For this regime, we prove that the\ncombination of only two movement scales can be enough to outperform both\nbalistic and L\\'evy strategies. This two-scale strategy involves an optimal\ndiscrimination between the nearby and faraway targets, which is only possible\nby adjusting the range of values of the two movement scales to the typical\ndistances between encounters. So, this optimization necessarily requires some\nprior information (albeit crude) about targets distances or distributions.\nFurthermore, we found that the incorporation of additional (three, four, ...)\nmovement scales and its adjustment to target distances does not improve further\nthe search efficiency. This allows us to claim that optimal random search\nstrategies in the asymmetric regime actually arise through the informed\ncombination of only two walk scales (related to the exploitative and the\nexplorative scale, respectively), expanding on the well-known result that\noptimal strategies in strictly uninformed scenarios are achieved through L\\'evy\npaths (or, equivalently, through a hierarchical combination of multiple\nscales).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 10:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

A true phase-coherent SC condensate,\nhowever, can exist only on larger scales and requires a finite phase stiffness\n$J$. In the case of coupled aluminium (Al) nanograins, $T_c$ can exceed that of\nbulk Al by a factor of three, but despite several proposals the relevant\nmechanism at play is not yet understood.

Such models play an important role in\nnatural language processing tasks such as translation or speech recognition,\nbut often rely on the simplistic assumption that words are opaque symbols. This\nassumption does not fit morphologically complex language well, where words can\nhave rich internal structure and sub-word elements are shared across distinct\nword forms.\n  Our approach is to encode basic notions of morphology into the assumptions of\nthree different types of language models, with the intention that leveraging\nshared sub-word structure can improve model performance and help overcome data\nsparsity that arises from morphological processes.\n  In the context of n-gram language modelling, we formulate a new Bayesian\nmodel that relies on the decomposition of compound words to attain better\nsmoothing, and we develop a new distributed language model that learns vector\nrepresentations of morphemes and leverages them to link together\nmorphologically related words. In both cases, we show that accounting for word\nsub-structure improves the models' intrinsic performance and provides benefits\nwhen applied to other tasks, including machine translation.\n  We then shift the focus beyond the modelling of word sequences and consider\nmodels that automatically learn what the sub-word elements of a given language\nare, given an unannotated list of words. We formulate a novel model that can\nlearn discontiguous morphemes in addition to the more conventional contiguous\nmorphemes that most previous models are limited to. This approach is\ndemonstrated on Semitic languages, and we find that modelling discontiguous\nsub-word structures leads to improvements in the task of segmenting words into\ntheir contiguous morphemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 10:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Our main contribution is the design of a coordinated transmission scheme,\ninspired by the underlay Cognitive Radio (CR) approach, with the aim of\nmaximizing the average rate of the licensee, subject to an average rate\nconstraint for the incumbent. In contrast to most prior works on underlay CR,\nthe coordination of the two TXs takes place under a realistic Channel State\nInformation (CSI) scenario, where each TX has sole access to the instantaneous\ndirect channel of its served terminal. Such a CSI knowledge setting brings\nabout a formulation based on the theory of Team Decisions, whereby the TXs aim\nat optimizing a common objective given the same constraint set, on the basis of\nindividual channel information. Consequently, a novel set of applicable\nprecoding schemes is proposed. Relying on statistical coordination criteria,\nthe two TXs cooperate in the lack of any instantaneous CSI exchange.

Previous\ndeep network approaches provide great advantages in terms of learning power and\nspeed, but previously it has been unclear how to use them to separate signals\nin a class-independent way. In contrast, spectral clustering approaches are\nflexible with respect to the classes and number of items to be segmented, but\nit has been unclear how to leverage the learning power and speed of deep\nnetworks. To obtain the best of both worlds, we use an objective function that\nto train embeddings that yield a low-rank approximation to an ideal pairwise\naffinity matrix, in a class-independent way. This avoids the high cost of\nspectral factorization and instead produces compact clusters that are amenable\nto simple clustering methods. The segmentations are therefore implicitly\nencoded in the embeddings, and can be \"decoded\" by clustering. Preliminary\nexperiments show that the proposed method can separate speech: when trained on\nspectrogram features containing mixtures of two speakers, and tested on\nmixtures of a held-out set of speakers, it can infer masking functions that\nimprove signal quality by around 6dB. We show that the model can generalize to\nthree-speaker mixtures despite training only on two-speaker mixtures. The\nframework can be used without class labels, and therefore has the potential to\nbe trained on a diverse set of sound types, and to generalize to novel sources.\nWe hope that future work will lead to segmentation of arbitrary sounds, with\nextensions to microphone array methods as well as image segmentation and other\ndomains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 13:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

The dust-photon interaction is treated in a fully\nself-consistent three dimensional radiative transfer code. We provide an AGN\nlibrary of spectral energy distributions (SEDs).

These objects are\nremarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the size of the BLR can, in some cases,\nrival those seen in the most luminous quasars. Secondly, the size of the BLR is\nnot correlated with the central continuum luminosity, an observation that\ndistinguishes them from their reverberating counterparts. Collectively, these\nearly results suggest that non-reverberating dwarf Seyferts are a heterogeneous\ngroup and not simply scaled versions of each other. Careful inspection reveals\nbroad H Balmer emission lines with single peaks, double peaks, and a\ncombination of the two, suggesting that the broad emission lines are produced\nin kinematically distinct regions centered on the black hole (BH). Because the\ngravitational field strength is already known for these objects, by virtue of\nknowing their BH mass, the relationship between velocity and radius may be\nestablished, given a kinematic model for the BLR gas. In this way, one can\ndetermine the inner and outer radii of the BLRs by modeling the shape of their\nbroad emission line profiles. In the present contribution, high quality spectra\nobtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) are used to\nconstrain the size of the BLR in the dwarf Seyfert nuclei of M81, NGC 3998, NGC\n4203, NGC 3227, NGC 4051, and NGC 3516.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

To make 3D non-LTE radiative\ntransfer computationally feasible it is crucial to have a model atom with as\nfew levels as possible while retaining the main physical processes. We here\ndevelop such a model atom and we study the general formation properties of the\nC II lines. We find that a nine-level model atom of C I-C III with the\ntransitions treated assuming complete frequency redistribution (CRD) suffices\nto describe the 133.5 nm lines. 3D scattering effects are important for the\nintensity in the core of the line. The lines are formed in the optically thick\nregime. The core intensity is formed in layers where the temperature is about\n10kK at the base of the transition region. The lines are 1.2-4 times wider than\nthe atomic absorption profile due to the formation in the optically thick\nregime. The smaller opacity broadening happens for single peak intensity\nprofiles where the chromospheric temperature is low with a steep source\nfunction increase into the transition region, the larger broadening happens\nwhen there is a temperature increase from the photosphere to the low\nchromosphere leading to a local source function maximum and a double peak\nintensity profile with a central reversal. Assuming optically thin formation\nwith the standard coronal approximation leads to several errors: Neglecting\nphotoionization severly underestimates the amount of C II at temperatures below\n16kK, erroneously shifts the formation from 10kK to 25kK and leads to too low\nintensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 15:56:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 09:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Activities during development are typically\nsummarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas\nactivities during operations are called Application Performance Management\n(APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but\nthe newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration\nbetween both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to\nsupport this integration as well as open research challenges in this area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 12:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

Non-parametric empirical estimates of drift and volatility\nshow that the predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics are\nincorrect. The clue is to realise that the random walk nature of financial\nprices results from the continuous anticipations of traders about future\nopportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an approximate efficient\nmarket with almost no arbitrage opportunities. With the Swiss National Bank\nstated commitment to enforce the barrier, traders's anticipation of this action\nleads to a vanishing drift together with a volatility of the exchange rate that\ndepends on the distance to the barrier. We give direct quantitative empirical\nevidence that this effect is well described by Krugman's target zone model\n[P.R. Krugman. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 106(3):669-682, 1991].\nMotivated by the insights from this economical model, we revise the initial\neconomics-physics analogy and show that, within the context of hindered\ndiffusion, the two systems can be described with the same mathematics after\nall. Using a recently proposed extended analogy in terms of a colloidal\nBrownian particle embedded in a fluid of molecules associated with the\nunderlying order book, we derive that, close to the restricting boundary, the\ndynamics of both systems is described by a stochastic differential equation\nwith a very small constant drift and a linear diffusion coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 08:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 09:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The inhomogeneous\nphotometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest\nsystematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place\nthese different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations\nof a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $HST$ system. We propose\na complementary method, called `Supercal', in which we use measurements of\nsecondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the same\nstars in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) system, and determine offsets for each system\nrelative to PS1, placing all SN observations on a single, consistent\nphotometric system. PS1 has observed $3\\pi$ of the sky and has a relative\ncalibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\\sim15<griz<21$ mag), making it an\nideal reference system. We use this process to recalibrate optical observations\ntaken by the following SN samples: PS1, SNLS, SDSS, CSP, and CfA1-4. We measure\ndiscrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various optical\npassbands. We find that correcting for these differences changes recovered\nvalues for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average\n$2.6\\%$. This change is roughly half the size of current statistical\nconstraints on $w$. The size of this effect strongly depends on the error in\nthe $B-V$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. The Supercal method will allow\nfuture analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 20:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 17:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

From that we extract\na vector whose components return information about the movements of the voices\nin the piece and hence about the complexity of the voice leading. We provide\nsome examples by analysing three compositions, also visualising complexity as a\npoint cloud for each piece. Finally, we interpret the sequence of complexity\nvectors associated with each composition, thus considering the position of each\nobservation with respect to time. The Dynamic Time Warping allows us to compute\nthe distance between two pieces and to show that our approach distinguishes\nwell the examples that we took into account, exhibiting a strong indication\nthat the notion of complexity we propose is a good tool to identify and\nclassify musical pieces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 07:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-25"}

It handles simultaneously collisionless and gas dynamics,\nas well as radiative transfer physics using a moment-based description with the\nM1 approximation. Field quantities are stored and computed on an adaptive 3D\nmesh and the spatial resolution can be dynamically modified based on\nphysically-motivated criteria. Physical processes can be coupled at all spatial\nand temporal scales. We also introduce a new and optional approximation to\nhandle radiation : the light is transported at the resolution of the\nnon-refined grid and only once the dynamics have been fully updated, whereas\nthermo-chemical processes are still tracked on the refined elements. Such an\napproximation reduces the overheads induced by the treatment of radiation\nphysics. A suite of standard tests are presented and passed by EMMA, providing\na validation for its future use in studies of the reionization epoch. The code\nis parallel and is able to use graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate\nhydrodynamics and radiative transfer calculations. Depending on the\noptimizations and the compilers used to generate the CPU reference, global GPU\nacceleration factors between x3.9 and x16.9 can be obtained.
