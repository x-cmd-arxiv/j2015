We introduce a linear transfer operator-based Lyapunov\nmeasure as a new tool for stability verification of stochastic systems. Weaker\nset-theoretic notion of almost everywhere stochastic stability is introduced\nand verified, using Lyapunov measure-based stochastic stability theorems.\nFurthermore, connection between Lyapunov functions, a popular tool for\nstochastic stability verification, and Lyapunov measures is established. Using\nthe duality property between the linear transfer Perron-Frobenius and Koopman\noperators, we show the Lyapunov measure and Lyapunov function used for the\nverification of stochastic stability are dual to each other. Set-oriented\nnumerical methods are proposed for the finite dimensional approximation of the\nPerron-Frobenius operator; hence, Lyapunov measure is proposed. Stability\nresults in finite dimensional approximation space are also presented. Finite\ndimensional approximation is shown to introduce further weaker notion of\nstability referred to as coarse stochastic stability.

Here we present the first systematic study\nof the evolution of the X-ray lags of the broad-band variability component\n(0.008-5 Hz) in GX 339-4 as a function of the position of the source in the\nhardness-intensity diagram. The hard photons always lag the soft ones,\nconsistent with previous results. In the low-hard state the lags correlate with\nX-ray intensity, and as the source starts the transition to the\nintermediate/soft states, the lags first increase faster, and then appear to\nreach a maximum, although the exact evolution depends on the outburst and the\nenergy band used to calculate the lags. The time of the maximum of the lags\nappears to coincide with a sudden drop of the Optical/NIR flux, the fractional\nRMS amplitude of the broadband component in the power spectrum, and the\nappearance of a thermal component in the X-ray spectra, strongly suggesting\nthat the lags can be very useful to understand the physical changes that GX\n339-4 undergoes during an outburst. We find strong evidence for a connection\nbetween the evolution of the cut-off energy of the hard component in the energy\nspectrum and the phase lags, suggesting that the average magnitude of the lags\nis correlated with the properties of the corona/jet rather than those of the\ndisc. Finally, we show that the lags in GX 339-4 evolve in a similar manner to\nthose of the black-hole candidate Cygnus X-1, suggesting similar phenomena\ncould be observable in other black-hole systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 18:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We show how\nthe electrical conductance depends on changes in the drift velocity and the\nlength of the electric field lines, in addition to the porosity and the\nconductance of the electrolyte. We characterized the length of the electric\nfield lines by a tortuosity and the changes in drift velocity by a constriction\nfactor. Both the tortuosity and the constriction factor are descriptors of the\npore microstructure. We define a conductance reduction factor to measure the\nlocal contributions of the pore microstructure to the global conductance. It is\nshown that the global conductance reduction factor is the product of the\ntortuosity squared divided by the constriction factor, thereby proving that the\ncombined effect of tortuosity and constriction, in addition to the porosity and\nconductance of the electrolyte, fully describes the effective electrical\nconductance of a porous medium.

We present useful heuristics for computing structural cohesion that\nallow a speed-up of one order of magnitude over the algorithms currently\navailable. We analyze three large collaboration networks (co-maintenance of\nDebian packages, co-authorship in Nuclear Theory and High-Energy Theory) and\nshow how our approach can help researchers measure structural cohesion in\nrelatively large networks. We also introduce a novel graphical representation\nof the structural cohesion analysis to quickly spot differences across\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 21:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It has previously\nbeen shown that systems with lower temperatures cannot simulate arbitrary\nsystems with higher temperatures, and also that systems at some higher\ntemperatures can simulate those at particular lower temperatures, creating an\ninfinite set of infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing\nsimulation power within each hierarchy. These previous results relied on two\ndifferent definitions of simulation, one (strong simulation) seemingly more\nrestrictive than the other (standard simulation), but which have previously not\nbeen proven to be distinct. Here we prove distinctions between them by first\nfully characterizing the set of pairs of temperatures such that the high\ntemperature systems are intrinsically universal for the lower temperature\nsystems (i.e. one tile set at the higher temperature can simulate any at the\nlower) using strong simulation. This includes the first impossibility result\nfor simulation downward in temperature. We then show that lower temperature\nsystems which cannot be simulated by higher temperature systems using the\nstrong definition, can in fact be simulated using the standard definition,\nproving the distinction between the types of simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 02:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The destruction of the fan-spine topology\nowing to the interaction between its magnetic fields and an nearby emerging\nflux region (EFR) is firstly observed. The line-of-sight magnetograms from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the SDO reveal that the dome is\nlocated on the mixed magnetic fields, with its rim rooted in the redundant\npositive polarity surrounding the minority parasitic negative fields. The fan\nsurface of the dome consists of a filament system and recurring jets are\nobserved along its spine. The jet occurring around 13:54 UT is accompanied with\na quasi-circular ribbon that brightens in the clockwise direction along the\nbottom rim of the dome, which may indicate an occurrence of slipping\nreconnection in the fan-spine topology. The EFR emerges continuously and meets\nwith the magnetic fields of the dome. Magnetic cancellations take place between\nthe emerging negative polarity and the outer positive polarity of the dome's\nfields, which lead to the rise of the loop connecting the EFR and brightenings\nrelated to the dome. A single Gaussian fit to the profiles of the IRIS SI IV\n1394 \\AA\\ line is used in the analysis.

These systems combine linear types with a\nlanguage of type-level indices, allowing more fine-grained analyses. Such\nsystems have been fruitfully applied in diverse domains, including implicit\ncomplexity and differential privacy. A natural way to enhance the\nexpressiveness of this approach is by allowing the indices to depend on runtime\ninformation, in the spirit of dependent types. This approach is used in DFuzz,\na language for differential privacy. The DFuzz type system relies on an index\nlanguage supporting real and natural number arithmetic over constants and\nvariables. Moreover, DFuzz uses a subtyping mechanism to make types more\nflexible. By themselves, linearity, dependency, and subtyping each require\ndelicate handling when performing type checking or type inference; their\ncombination increases this challenge substantially, as the features can\ninteract in non-trivial ways. In this paper, we study the type-checking problem\nfor DFuzz.

Recently, this exotic effect\nhas been discovered experimentally in an ultrathin film of the Bi2Te3 family TI\nwith spontaneous ferromagnetic (FM) order. An important question concerning the\nQAH state is whether it is simply a zero-magnetic-field version of the quantum\nHall (QH) effect, or if there is new physics beyond the conventional paradigm.\nHere we report experimental investigations on the quantum phase transition\nbetween the two opposite Hall plateaus of a QAH insulator caused by\nmagnetization reversal. We observe a well-defined plateau with zero Hall\nconductivity over a range of magnetic field around coercivity, consistent with\na recent theoretical prediction. The features of the zero Hall plateau are\nshown to be closely related to that of the QAH effect, but its temperature\nevolution exhibits quantitative differences from the network model for\nconventional QH plateau transition. We propose that the chiral edge states\nresiding at the magnetic domain boundaries, which are unique to a QAH\ninsulator, are responsible for the zero Hall plateau. The rich magnetic domain\ndynamics makes the QAH effect a distinctive class of quantum phenomenon that\nmay find novel applications in spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 08:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

The effect of a helium enhancement as large as Delta\nY/Delta Z = 5 is quite modest, resulting in a mean age increase of metal rich\nstars of 0.6 Gyr.

The combined effect is\nknown as inclusive fitness. Here it is argued that a further elaboration of\nfitness has evolved, particularly in humans. It is called extensive fitness and\nit incorporates producing organisms that are merely similar in phenotype. The\nevolvability of this mechanism is illustrated by computations on a simple model\ncombining heredity and behaviour. Phenotypes are driven into the direction of\nhigh fitness through a mechanism that involves an internal estimate of fitness,\nimplicitly made within the organism itself. This mechanism has recently been\nconjectured to be responsible for producing agency and goals. In the model,\ninclusive and extensive fitness are both implemented by letting fitness\nincrease nonlinearly with the size of subpopulations of similar heredity (for\nthe indirect part of inclusive fitness) and of similar phenotype (for the\nphenotypic part of extensive fitness). Populations implementing extensive\nfitness outcompete populations implementing mere inclusive fitness. This occurs\nbecause groups with similar phenotype tend to be larger than groups with\nsimilar heredity, and fitness increases more when groups are larger. Extensive\nfitness has two components, a direct component where individuals compete in\ninducing others to become like them and an indirect component where individuals\ncooperate and help others who are already similar to them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 06:29:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 13:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 12:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

Further classifying the long GRBs might give tighter\nconstraints on their progenitor and on the emission mechanism(s).

Despite the routine prescription of rate control therapy for\natrial fibrillation (AF), clinical evidence demonstrating a heart rate target\nis lacking.

The lumped model, representing the pumping heart together with\nsystemic and pulmonary circuits, was run to simulate AF with HR of 50, 70, 90,\n110 and 130 bpm, respectively.\n  Results. Left ventricular pressure increased by 56.7%, from 33.92+-37.56 mmHg\nto 53.15+-47.56 mmHg, and mean systemic arterial pressure increased by 27.4%,\nfrom 82.66+-14.04 mmHg to 105.29+-7.63 mmHg, at the 50 and 130 bpm simulations,\nrespectively.

This novel approach is not limited\nto searching for the largest GM of two single spots as in previous methods.\nInstead, the pre-flare conditions of the evolution of spot groups is captured\nby the introduction of the weighted horizontal magnetic gradient, or W_GM. This\nnew proxy enables the potential of forecasting flares stronger than M5. The\nimproved capability includes (i) the prediction of flare onset time and (ii) an\nassessment whether a flare is followed by another event within about 18 hours.\nThe prediction of onset time is found to be more accurate here. A linear\nrelationship is established between the duration of converging motion and the\ntime elapsed from the moment of closest position to that of the flare onset of\nopposite polarity spot groups. The other promising relationship is between the\nmaximum of the W_GM prior to flaring and the value of W_GM at the moment of the\ninitial flare onset in the case of multiple flaring. We found that when the\nW_GM decreases by about 54%, then there is no second flare. If, however, when\nthe W_GM decreases less than 42%, then there will be likely a follow-up flare\nstronger than M5. This new capability may be useful for an automated flare\nprediction tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 13:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

Robustness of systems composed of interdependent\nnetwork layers has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the\ntheoretical frameworks developed so far apply only to special models in the\nlimit of infinite sizes. These methods are therefore of little help in\npractical contexts, given that real interconnected networks have finite size\nand their structures are generally not compatible with those of graph toy\nmodels. Here, we introduce a theoretical method that takes as inputs the\nadjacency matrices of the layers to draw the entire phase diagram for the\ninterconnected network, without the need of actually simulating any percolation\nprocess. We demonstrate that percolation transitions in arbitrary\ninterdependent networks can be understood by decomposing these system into\nuncoupled graphs: the intersection among the layers, and the remainders of the\nlayers. When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected\nnetwork undergoes a continuous percolation transition. Conversely, if the\nintersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition\nbecomes abrupt even in systems of finite size. We provide examples of real\nsystems that have developed interdependent networks sharing a core of \"high\nquality\" edges to prevent catastrophic failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 14:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

For such a multiple user (MU) secure network,\nthe number of accessing SUs, namely transmission mode, has a great impact on\nthe secrecy performance. Specifically, on the one hand, a large number of\naccessing SUs will arise high inter-user interference at SUs, resulting in a\nreduction of the capacity of the legitimate channel.

Preliminary\nresults show that not only our extension improves the detection capability of\nclassic label propagation algorithm when communities are not clearly\ndetectable, but also improves the overall quality of the identified clusters in\ncomplex networks with a clear community structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

It is shown\nthat the growth rate in such a system is much smaller than that of an infinite\nplasma or a finite size plasma with periodic boundary conditions. Even if the\nwidth of the plasma matches the resonance condition for a standing wave, a\nspatially growing wave is excited instead with the growth rate small compared\nto that of the standing wave in a periodic system. The approximate expression\nfor this growth rate is $\\gamma \\approx\n(1/13)\\omega_{pe}(n_{b}/n_{p})(L\\omega_{pe}/v_{b})\\ln (L\\omega_{pe}/v_{b})[\n1-0.18\\cos ( L\\omega_{pe}/v_{b}+{\\pi }/{2}) ]$, where $\\omega_{pe}$ is the\nelectron plasma frequency, $n_{b}$ and $n_{p}$ are the beam and the plasma\ndensities, respectively, $v_{b}$ is the beam velocity, and $L$ is the plasma\nwidth. The frequency, wave number and the spatial and temporal growth rates as\nfunctions of the plasma size exhibit band structure. The amplitude of\nsaturation of the instability depends on the system length, not on the beam\ncurrent. For short systems, the amplitude may exceed values predicted for\ninfinite plasmas by more than an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 15:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Each RLP is obtained by means of the Liouville\ntransformation (LT) of the appropriate rational canonical Sturm-Liouville\nequation (RCSLE) with second-order poles. The presented analysis takes\nadvantage of the generic factorization of canonical Sturm-Liouville equations\n(CSLEs) in terms of intertwining \"generalized\" Darboux operators. We refer to\nthe latter operators as the canonical Liouville-Darboux transformations (CLDTs)\nto stress that they are equivalent to three-step operations: i) the LT from the\nCSLE to the Schrodinger equation; ii) the Darboux transformation (DT) of the\nappropriate LP; and iii) the inverse LT from the Schrodinger equation to the\nnew CSLE. It is proven that the CLDT preserves the rational form of the RCSLE\nif its factorization function (FF) is an almost-everywhere holomorphic (AEH)\nsolution of the RCSLE (or, in other words, a solution with a rational\nlogarithmic derivative). As explained in the paper there are up to four gauge\ntransformations which convert each RCSLE of our interest into the second-order\ndifferential equations with energy-dependent polynomial coefficients. The most\nimportant result of the paper is that polynomial solutions of these equations\nbelong to sequences of Heine polynomials obtained by varying free terms at\nfixed values of singular points and the appropriate characteristic exponents.\nThis allows us to construct networks of polynomial solutions -- the so-called\n\"r-, c-, or i-Gauss-seed\" (r-, c-, or i-GS) Heine polynomials -- starting from\nJacobi, (generalized) Laguerre or Routh polynomials, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 18:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 17:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}
