Naturally derived antibacterial agents, such as Manuka\nhoney, consist of a mixture of compounds, more than one of which can influence\nantimicrobial potency. The non-peroxide bacteriostatic properties of Manuka\nhoney have been previously linked to the presence of methylglyoxal (MGO). The\nincorporation of MGO as a functional antibacterial additive during fibre\nproduction was explored as a potential route for manufacturing wound dressing\ncomponents. Synthetic MGO and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were fabricated into webs\nof sub-micron fibres by means of electrostatic spinning of an aqueous spinning\nsolution. Composite fabrics were also produced by direct deposition of the\nPVA-MGO fibres onto a preformed spunbonded nonwoven substrate.

To exploit the semantic\nrepresentation behind the ADP structure, we develop dependency-based neural\nnetworks (DepNN): a recursive neural network designed to model the subtrees,\nand a convolutional neural network to capture the most important features on\nthe shortest path. Experiments on the SemEval-2010 dataset show that our\nproposed method achieves state-of-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 16:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

The origin of the chemical abundances of these\nCEMP-$s$ stars is believed to be accretion in the past of enriched material\nfrom a primary star in the AGB phase. We investigate the mechanism of mass\ntransfer and the process of nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity AGB stars by\nmodelling the binary systems in which the observed CEMP-$s$ stars were formed.\nFor this purpose we compare a sample of $67$ CEMP-$s$ stars with a grid of\nbinary stars generated by our binary evolution and nucleosynthesis model. We\nclassify our sample CEMP-$s$ stars in three groups based on the observed\nabundance of europium. In CEMP$-s/r$ stars the europium-to-iron ratio is more\nthan ten times higher than in the Sun, whereas it is lower than this threshold\nin CEMP$-s/nr$ stars. No measurement of europium is currently available for\nCEMP-$s/ur$ stars. On average our models reproduce well the abundances observed\nin CEMP-$s/nr$ stars, whereas in CEMP-$s/r$ stars and CEMP-$s/ur$ stars the\nabundances of the light-$s$ elements are systematically overpredicted by our\nmodels and in CEMP-$s/r$ stars the abundances of the heavy-$s$ elements are\nunderestimated. In all stars our modelled abundances of sodium overestimate the\nobservations. This discrepancy is reduced only in models that underestimate the\nabundances of most of the $s$-elements. Furthermore, the abundance of lead is\nunderpredicted in most of our model stars. These results point to the\nlimitations of our AGB nucleosynthesis model, particularly in the predictions\nof the element-to-element ratios. Finally, in our models CEMP-$s$ stars are\ntypically formed in wide systems with periods above 10000 days, while most of\nthe observed CEMP-$s$ stars are found in relatively close orbits with periods\nbelow 5000 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 17:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Gaia14aae was identified independently\nby the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN; Shappee et al. 2014)\nand by the Gaia Science Alerts project, during two separate outbursts. A third\noutburst is seen in archival Pan-STARRS-1 (PS1; Schlafly et al. 2012; Tonry et\nal. 2012; Magnier et al. 2013) and ASAS-SN data. Spectroscopy reveals a hot,\nhydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistent\nwith an accreting double degenerate classification. We use follow-up photometry\nto constrain the orbital parameters of the system. We find an orbital period of\n49.71 min, which places Gaia14aae at the long period extremum of the\noutbursting AM CVn period distribution. Gaia14aae is dominated by the light\nfrom its accreting white dwarf. Assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degrees\nfor the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lower\nlimits of 0.78 M solar and 0.015 M solar on the masses of the accretor and\ndonor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. Gaia14aae is\nonly the third eclipsing AM CVn star known, and the first in which the WD is\ntotally eclipsed. Using a helium WD model, we estimate the accretor's effective\ntemperature to be 12900+-200 K. The three out-burst events occurred within 4\nmonths of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous\n8 years of Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS; Drake et al. 2009),\nPan-STARRS-1 and ASAS-SN data. This suggests that these events might be\nrebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 17:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We address\nthis two-level cooperation over a finite horizon with the finite battery\nconstraint at the secondary transmitter. While promising the rate-guaranteed\nservice to both primary and secondary users, we aim to maximize the primary\nrate. We develop an iterative algorithm that obtains the optimal offline power\npolicies for primary and secondary users. To acquire insights about the\nstructure of the optimal solution, we examine specific scenarios. Furthermore,\nwe investigate the effects of the secondary rate constraint and finite battery\non the primary rate and the probability of cooperation. We show that the joint\ninformation and energy cooperation increases the chances of cooperation and\nachieves significant rate gains over only information cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 18:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

Here we employ classical variants of these concepts,\nin particular R\\'enyi entropies and their associated mutual information, to\nidentify topological order in classical systems. Like for their quantum\ncounterparts, the presence of topological order can be identified in such\nclassical systems via a universal, subleading contribution to the prevalent\nvolume and boundary laws of the classical R\\'enyi entropies. We demonstrate\nthat an additional subleading $O(1)$ contribution generically arises for all\nR\\'enyi entropies $S^{(n)}$ with $n \\geq 2$ when driving the system towards a\nphase transition, e.g. into a conventionally ordered phase. This additional\nsubleading term, which we dub connectivity contribution, tracks back to partial\nsubsystem ordering and is proportional to the number of connected parts in a\ngiven bipartition. Notably, the Levin-Wen summation scheme -- typically used to\nextract the topological contribution to the R\\'enyi entropies -- does not fully\neliminate this additional connectivity contribution in this classical context.\nThis indicates that the distillation of topological order from R\\'enyi\nentropies requires an additional level of scrutiny to distinguish topological\nfrom non-topological $O(1)$ contributions. This is also the case for quantum\nsystems, for which we discuss which entropies are sensitive to these\nconnectivity contributions. We showcase these findings by extensive numerical\nsimulations of a classical variant of the toric code model, for which we study\nthe stability of topological order in the presence of a magnetic field and at\nfinite temperatures from a R\\'enyi entropy perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 18:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

The\nmethod is applied to investigate the charge neutral and non-neutral excitation\nspectra of a homogeneous, two-site, two-electron Holstein model. This is an\nextension of a previous study of the ground state properties in the Hartree\n(H), partially self-consistent Born (Gd) and fully self-consistent Born (GD)\napproximations published in Ref.

We show that choosing a\nhomogeneous ground state solution leads to unstable dynamics for a sufficiently\nstrong interaction, and that allowing a symmetry-broken state prevents this.\nThe instability is caused by the bifurcation of the ground state and understood\nphysically to be connected with the bipolaronic crossover of the exact system.\nThis mean-field instability persists in the partially self-consistent Born\napproximation but is not found for the fully self-consistent Born\napproximation. By understanding the stability properties, we are able to study\nthe linear response regime by calculating the density-density response function\nby time-propagation. This functions amounts to a solution of the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation with a sophisticated kernel. The results indicate that none of the\napproximations is able to describe the response function during or beyond the\nbipolaronic crossover for the parameters investigated.

MPE measurements have been found for\nstates that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a\ntransitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed\ngeometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good\nmeasurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability\nof error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set\ninvolves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general.

Using the solution of an HJB\nequation, a feedback optimal control law can be implemented in real-time with\nminimum computational load. However, except for systems with two or three state\nvariables, using traditional techniques for numerically finding a semi-global\nsolution to an HJB equation for general nonlinear systems is infeasible due to\nthe curse of dimensionality. Here we present a new computational method for\nfinding feedback optimal control and solving HJB equations which is able to\nmitigate the curse of dimensionality. We do not discretize the HJB equation\ndirectly, instead we introduce a sparse grid in the state space and use the\nPontryagin's maximum principle to derive a set of necessary conditions in the\nform of a boundary value problem, also known as the characteristic equations,\nfor each grid point. Using this approach, the method is spatially causality\nfree, which enjoys the advantage of perfect parallelism on a sparse grid.\nCompared with dense grids, a sparse grid has a significantly reduced size which\nis feasible for systems with relatively high dimensions, such as the $6$-D\nsystem shown in the examples. Once the solution obtained at each grid point,\nhigh-order accurate polynomial interpolation is used to approximate the\nfeedback control at arbitrary points.

In the usual\napproach, the quantum degrees of freedom are described by a wave function which\nevolves according to some Schr\\\"odinger equation with a Hamiltonian that\ndepends on the classical degrees of freedom. The classical degrees of freedom\nsatisfy classical equations that depend on the expectation values of quantum\noperators. In this paper, we study an alternative approach based on Bohmian\nmechanics. In Bohmian mechanics the quantum system is not only described by the\nwave function, but also with additional variables such as particle positions or\nfields. By letting the classical equations of motion depend on these variables,\nrather than the quantum expectation values, a semi-classical approximation is\nobtained that is closer to the exact quantum results than the usual approach.\nWe discuss the Bohmian semi-classical approximation in various contexts, such\nas non-relativistic quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics and quantum\ngravity. The main motivation comes from quantum gravity. The quest for a\nquantum theory for gravity is still going on. Therefore a semi-classical\napproach where gravity is treated classically may be an approximation that\nalready captures some quantum gravitational aspects. The Bohmian semi-classical\ntheories will be derived from the full Bohmian theories. In the case there are\ngauge symmetries, like in quantum electrodynamics or quantum gravity, special\ncare is required.

When\nused for feature selection, they allow to find a sparse set of genetic traits\nthat best predict a continuous phenotype of interest, while simultaneously\ncorrecting for various confounding factors such as age, ethnicity and\npopulation structure. Formulated as models for linear regression, LMMs have\nbeen restricted to continuous phenotypes. We introduce the Sparse Probit Linear\nMixed Model (Probit-LMM), where we generalize the LMM modeling paradigm to\nbinary phenotypes. As a technical challenge, the model no longer possesses a\nclosed-form likelihood function. In this paper, we present a scalable\napproximate inference algorithm that lets us fit the model to high-dimensional\ndata sets. We show on three real-world examples from different domains that in\nthe setup of binary labels, our algorithm leads to better prediction accuracies\nand also selects features which show less correlation with the confounding\nfactors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 21:33:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 16:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 23:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 21:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

In the proximity graph, the neighbor\nrelationship is defined according to the relative distance between each pair of\nagents. Each follower is able to obtain information from only the neighbors in\nits proximity, involving only local interaction. We consider two cases: i) the\nleader moves with a constant velocity, and ii) the leader moves with a varying\nvelocity. In the first case, a distributed continuous adaptive control\nalgorithm accounting for unknown parameters is proposed in combination with a\ndistributed continuous estimator for each follower. In the second case, a\ndistributed discontinuous adaptive control algorithm and estimator are\nproposed.

In all proposed algorithms, only one-hop\nneighbors' information (e.g., the relative position and velocity measurements\nbetween the neighbors and the absolute position and velocity measurements) is\nrequired, and flocking is achieved as long as the connectivity and collision\navoidance are ensured at the initial time and the control gains are designed\nproperly.

Therefore, it can form the basis of automated\nverification and bug-finding tools for higher-order programs.\n  To validate our approach, we use it to develop and evaluate a system for\nverifying and refuting behavioral software contracts of components in a\nfunctional language, which we call soft contract verification. In doing so, we\ndiscover a mutually beneficial relation between behavioral contracts and\nhigher-order symbolic execution.\n  Our system uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging contracts as a\nsource of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values, and employs an\nupdatable heap of contract invariants to reason about flow-sensitive facts.\nWhenever a contract is refuted, it reports a concrete counterexample\nreproducing the error, which may involve solving for an unknown function. The\napproach is able to analyze first-class contracts, recursive data structures,\nunknown functions, and control-flow-sensitive refinements of values, which are\nall idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of an off-the-shelf\nsolver to decide problems without heavy encodings.

PKS B0008-421\nis characterized by the steepest known spectral slope below the turnover, close\nto the theoretical limit of synchrotron self-absorption, and the smallest known\nspectral width of any GPS source. Spectral coverage of the source spans from\n0.118 to 22 GHz, which includes data from the Murchison Widefield Array and the\nwide bandpass receivers on the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We have\nimplemented a Bayesian inference model fitting routine to fit the data with\nvarious absorption models. We find that without the inclusion of a\nhigh-frequency exponential break the absorption models can not accurately fit\nthe data, with significant deviations above and below the peak in the radio\nspectrum. The addition of a high-frequency break provides acceptable spectral\nfits for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption and double-component\nsynchrotron self-absorption models, with the inhomogeneous free-free absorption\nmodel statistically favored. The requirement of a high-frequency spectral break\nimplies that the source has ceased injecting fresh particles. Additional\nsupport for the inhomogeneous free-free absorption model as being responsible\nfor the turnover in the spectrum is given by the consistency between the\nphysical parameters derived from the model fit and the implications of the\nexponential spectral break, such as the necessity of the source being\nsurrounded by a dense ambient medium to maintain the peak frequency near the\ngigahertz region. The discovery of PKS B0008-421 suggests that the next\ngeneration of low radio frequency surveys could reveal a large population of\nGPS sources that have ceased activity, and that a portion of the ultra-steep\nspectrum source population could be composed of these GPS sources in a relic\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 02:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

In order to stabilize the separation of the D3-branes at\nnonzero distance, we consider revolution of the D3-branes around the fixed\npoint. Then the gauge symmetry on D3-branes is spontaneously broken, and the\nrank of the gauge group is reduced. The distance can be set at our will by\nappropriately choosing the angular momentum of the revolving D3-branes, which\nshould be determined by the initial condition of the cosmological evolution of\nD-brane configurations. The distance corresponds to the vacuum expectation\nvalues of brane moduli fields in the world-volume theory and, if it is written\nas M/Ms^2 in terms of the string scale Ms, the scale of gauge symmetry breaking\nis given by M. Angular momentum conservation of revolving D3-branes assures the\nstability of the scale M against Ms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 05:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 03:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

We\nsurvey here adiabatic mass loss from Population I stars of mass 0.10 Msun to\n100 Msun from the zero age main sequence to the base of the giant branch, or to\ncentral hydrogen exhaustion for lower main sequence stars. For intermediate-\nand high-mass stars, dynamical mass transfer is preceded by an extended phase\nof thermal time scale mass transfer as the star is stripped of most of its\nenvelope mass. The critical mass ratio qad above which this delayed dynamical\ninstability occurs increases with advancing evolutionary age of the donor star,\nby ever-increasing factors for more massive donors. Most intermediate- or\nhigh-mass binaries with nondegenerate accretors probably evolve into contact\nbefore manifesting this instability.

The young stars ($\\sim30-160$\nMyr old) closely follow the neutral hydrogen distribution and can be found in a\nstellar stream between M81 and NGC\\,3077 and in numerous outlying stellar\nassociations, including the known concentrations of Arp's Loop, Holmberg\\,IX,\nan arc in the halo of M82, BK3N, and the Garland. Many of these groupings do\nnot have counterparts in the RGB maps, suggesting they may be genuinely young\nsystems. Our survey also reveals for the first time the very extended ($\\geq\n2\\times \\rm{R_{25}}$) halos of RGB stars around M81, M82 and NGC\\,3077, as well\nas faint tidal streams that link these systems. The halos of M82 and NGC\\,3077\nexhibit highly disturbed morphologies, presumably a consequence of the recent\ngravitational encounter and their ongoing disruption. While the halos of M81,\nNGC\\,3077 and the inner halo of M82 have the similar $(g-i)_{0}$ colors, the\nouter halo of M82 is significantly bluer indicating it is more metal-poor.\nRemarkably, our deep panoramic view of the M81 group demonstrates that the\ncomplexity long-known to be present in HI is equally matched in the low surface\nbrightness stellar component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 09:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited\ndetection efficiency, e.g. in each run of the experiment the overall detection\nefficiency is lower bounded by $\\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an adversarial\nscenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control over the\ninefficiencies. We analyze the set of possible correlations that fulfil Limited\nDetection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy some linear\nBell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts violation of one\nof these inequalities for all $\\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, nonlocality can be\ndemonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection efficiencies.

This prescription leads to several remarkable\nconsequences. In particular, the Euclidean volume $V_D(\\ell,\\ell_{0})$ in a\n$D$-dimensional spacetime of a region of size $\\ell $ scales as $V_D(\\ell, \\ell\n_{0}) \\propto \\ell_{0}^{D-2} \\ell^2$ when $\\ell \\sim \\ell_{0}$, while it\nreduces to the standard result $V_D(\\ell,\\ell_{0}) \\propto \\ell^D$ at large\nscales ($\\ell \\gg \\ell_{0}$). The appropriately defined effective dimension,\n$D_{\\rm eff} $, decreases continuously from $D_{\\rm eff}=D$ (at $\\ell \\gg\n\\ell_{0}$) to $D_{\\rm eff}=2$ (at $\\ell \\sim \\ell_{0}$). This suggests that the\nphysical spacetime becomes essentially 2-dimensional near Planck scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 20:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 06:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 04:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

In this work we present a non-trivial generalization of Gabor\nframes to the quaternionic case and give new density results. The key tool is\nthe two-sided windowed quaternionic Fourier transform (WQFT). As in the complex\ncase, we want to write the WQFT as an inner product between a quaternion-valued\nsignal and shifts and modulates of a real-valued window function. We\ndemonstrate a Heisenberg uncertainty principle and for the results regarding\nthe density, we employ the quaternionic Zak transform to obtain necessary and\nsufficient conditions to ensure that a quaternionic Gabor system is a\nquaternionic Gabor frame. We conclude with a proof that the Gabor conjecture do\nnot hold true in the quaternionic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 13:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}
