In\nthis work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with\nnonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from\nmeasurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that\nthere are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the\nequations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds\nfor many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine\nthe fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately\nrepresent the data.

We demonstrate\nthe algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems,\nincluding linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to\nthe fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle.

Herein its secrecy-capacity is\nderived and shown to be equal to its semantic-security (SS) capacity. In this\nsetting, the legitimate users communicate via a discrete-memoryless (DM)\nchannel in the presence of an eavesdropper that has perfect access to a subset\nof its choosing of the transmitted symbols, constrained to a fixed fraction of\nthe blocklength. The secrecy criterion is achieved simultaneously for all\npossible eavesdropper subset choices. The SS criterion demands negligible\nmutual information between the message and the eavesdropper's observations even\nwhen maximized over all message distributions.\n  A key tool for the achievability proof is a novel and stronger version of\nWyner's soft covering lemma. Specifically, a random codebook is shown to\nachieve the soft-covering phenomenon with high probability. The probability of\nfailure is doubly-exponentially small in the blocklength. Since the combined\nnumber of messages and subsets grows only exponentially with the blocklength,\nSS for the WTC II is established by using the union bound and invoking the\nstronger soft-covering lemma. The direct proof shows that rates up to the\nweak-secrecy capacity of the classic WTC with a DM erasure channel (EC) to the\neavesdropper are achievable. The converse follows by establishing the capacity\nof this DM wiretap EC as an upper bound for the WTC II.

We point out that the system supports $m$-dimensional\nexcitations ($m<d$), which we shall call fluctuating charges, that are\nsuperpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional\nbosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges\nor magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when\naccompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$\nfluctuating charges exhibit non-trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics,\ninvolving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by\ntaking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find\nthat excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized\nby trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the\nLagrangian subgroup. As an application, we construct fault-tolerantly\nimplementable logical gates for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by\nusing $d$-cocycle functions. Namely, corresponding logical gates belong to the\n$d$th level of the Clifford hierarchy, but are outside of the $(d-1)$th level,\nif cocycle functions have non-trivial sequences of slant products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 19:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

To date, most Kelvin-Helmholtz problems discussed in the\nliterature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with\nincreasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and\nseverely limits the utility of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as a test\nproblem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the\naccuracy of their simulations based on ad-hoc proxies, e.g., the existence of\nsmall-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed Kelvin-Helmholtz\nproblems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion. We show that in\nmany cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in\nKelvin-Helmholtz problems. We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution\nusing both Athena, a Godunov code, and Dedalus, a pseudo-spectral code.\nProblems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively\nstraightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump\n(which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behavior and are\nmore computationally challenging. In the latter case, Athena simulations are\nprone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is\nseeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as\nresolution increases. Both Athena and Dedalus exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid\nsimulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which\ninduce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion.

The width of the\nbroad H-alpha line increases in the dim state such that the black hole mass\nderived from the appropriate single-epoch scaling relation agrees between the\ntwo epochs within a factor of 3. The fluxes of the narrow emission lines do not\nappear to change between epochs. The light curve obtained by the Catalina Sky\nSurvey suggests that the transition occurs within a rest-frame time interval of\napproximately 500 days. We examine three possible mechanisms for this\ntransition suggested in the recent literature. An abrupt change in the\nreddening towards the central engine is disfavored by the substantial\ndifference between the timescale to obscure the central engine and the observed\ntimescale of the transition. A decaying tidal disruption flare is consistent\nwith the decay rate of the light curve but not with the prolonged bright state\npreceding the decay, nor can this scenario provide the power required by the\nluminosities of the emission lines. An abrupt drop in the accretion rate onto\nthe supermassive black hole appears to be the most plausible explanation for\nthe rapid dimming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 20:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

The\ncomputation of the effective area of a Wolter-I mirror, with either a single\nlayer or multilayer coating, is a very simple task for a source on-axis at\nastronomical distance. Indeed, when the source moves off-axis the calculation\nis more complicated, in particular for new hard X-ray imaging telescopes\n(NuSTAR, ASTRO-H, NHXM, IXO) beyond 10 keV, that will make use of multilayer\ncoatings to extend the reflectivity band in grazing incidence. Unlike\ntraditional single-layer coatings (in Ir or Au), graded multilayer coatings\nexhibit an oscillating reflectivity as a function of the incidence angle, which\nmakes the effective area not immediately predictable for a source placed\noff-axis within the field of view. For this reason, the computation of the\noff-axis effective area has been so far demanded to ray- tracing codes, able to\nsample the incidence of photons onto the mirror assembly. Even if this approach\nshould not be disdained, it would be interesting to approach the same problem\nfrom an analytical viewpoint. This would speed up and simplify the computation\nof the effective area as a function of the off-axis angle, a considerable\nadvantage especially whenever the mirror parameters are still to be optimized.\nIn this work we present the application of a novel, analytical formalism to the\ncomputation of the off-axis effective area and the grasp of the NHXM optical\nmodules, requiring only the standard routines for the multilayer reflectivity\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 21:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

Novel surfactant architectures with multi-cephalic and multi-tailed\nmolecules have reportedly enhanced their anti-bacterial activity in connection\nwith tail length and the nature of the head group, but their ability to produce\nand stabilize foam is mostly unknown. Here we report on experiments with\ntris-cationic, triple-headed, double- and single-tailed amphiphiles and their\nfoamability and foam stability with respect to head group, tail number and tail\nlength. The amphiphiles are composed of an aromatic mesitylene core and three\nbenzylic amonium bromide groups, with alkyl chains attached to one or two of\nthe head groups. Whereas shorter (14 carbons in length) double-tailed molecules\nare found to produce very stable foams, foams made with single tail molecules\nof the same length show poor foamability and stability, and foams with longer\n(16 carbons in length) double-tail molecules do not foam with the methods used.\nBy contrast, the structure of the non-tail-bearing head group\n(trimethylammonium vs. pyridinium) has no impact on foamability. Furthermore,\nobservations of the coarsening rate at nearly constant liquid content indicate\nthat the enhanced foam stability is a result of lower gas permeability through\nthe surfactant monolayer. Finally, the critical aggregation concentration (CAC)\nof the surfactants demonstrates to be a good predictor of foamability and foam\nstability for these small molecule surfactants. This results inform how\nsurfactant architecture can be tailored to produce stable foams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 21:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

These methods naturally\nfacilitate tractable uncertainty quantification and incorporation of prior\ninformation. This benefit has led to extensive use of the Bayesian shrinkage\nmethods across diverse applications. A common feature of these models is that\nthe corresponding priors on the regression coefficients can be expressed as\nscale mixture of normals. While the three-step Gibbs sampler used to sample\nfrom the often intractable associated posterior density has been shown to be\ngeometrically ergodic for several of these models, it has been demonstrated\nrecently that convergence of this sampler can still be quite slow in modern\nhigh-dimensional settings despite this apparent theoretical safeguard.

Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour\nmaps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be\nperceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor\nin designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental\nchange in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific\nrequirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are\ndeveloped in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour\nmaps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading\nis considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt\nrelief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the\nconstruction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these\nbasis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent\nirrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 03:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

This\ndynamic nature of memory access pattern and the fixed behavior of address\nmapping process in DRAM controllers, implied by using a fixed address mapping\nscheme, means that DRAM performance cannot be exploited efficiently. DReAM is a\nnovel hardware technique that can detect a workload-specific address mapping at\nrun-time based on the application access pattern which improves the performance\nof DRAMs. The experimental results show that DReAM outperforms the best\nevaluated address mapping on average by 9%, for mapping-sensitive workloads, by\n2% for mapping-insensitive workloads, and up to 28% across all the workloads.\nDReAM can be seen as an insurance policy capable of detecting which scenarios\nare not well served by the predefined address mapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 08:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

In this paper we combine ecological modelling with economic\nanalysis of a single farm output under the as- sumption that both pollination\nand pest control are essential inputs. We show that the drive to increase farm\noutput can lead to a local decline in the wild bee population. Commercial bees\nare often considered an alternative to wild pollinators, but we show that their\nintro- duction can lead to further decline and finally local extinction of wild\nbees. The transitions between different outcomes are characterised by threshold\nbehaviour and are potentially difficult to predict and detect in advance. Small\nchanges in economic parameters (input prices) and ecological parameters (wild\nbees carrying capacity and effect of pesticides on bees) can move the\neconomic-ecological system beyond the extinction threshold. We also show that\nincreasing the pesticide price or decreasing the commercial bee price might\nlead to re-establishment of wild bees following their local extinction.

The appropriate choice for a\nparticular access can reduce the average memory latency. However, since\napplication access patterns change at run time, static page policies cannot\nguarantee to deliver optimum execution time. Hybrid page policies have been\ninvestigated as a means of covering these dynamic scenarios and are now\nimplemented in state-of-the-art processors. Hybrid page policies switch between\nopen-page and close-page policies while the application is running, by\nmonitoring the access pattern of row hits/conflicts and predicting future\nbehavior. Unfortunately, as the size of DRAM memory increases, fine-grain\ntracking and analysis of memory access patterns does not remain practical.

Hamilton then proposed a mathematical unification of space and time\nwithin the framework of the quaternions that ultimately lead to the famous\nMinkowski formulation in 1908 using four-vectors. The Minkowski framework is\nfound to provide a versatile formalism for describing the relationship between\nspace and time in accordance with relativistic principles, but nevertheless\nfails to provide deeper insights into the physical origin of time and its\nproperties. In this paper we begin with a recognition of the fundamental role\nplayed by three-dimensional space in physics that we model using the Clifford\nalgebra multivector. From this geometrical foundation we are then able to\nidentify a plausible origin for our concept of time. This geometrical\nperspective also allows us to make a key topological distinction between time\nand space, with time being a point-like quantity. The multivector then allows a\ngeneralized unification of time and space within a Minkowski-like description.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 07:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 06:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 09:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

We also take into account the radiation content of the Universe.\nIn this context, the late stage of the evolution of the universe refers to the\nepoch where CDM is already clustered into inhomogeneously distributed discrete\nstructures (galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies). Under these conditions,\nthe mechanical approach is an adequate tool to study the Universe deep inside\nthe cell of uniformity. To be more accurate, we study scalar perturbations of\nthe Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric due to inhomogeneities of CDM\nas well as fluctuations of radiation and mGCG, the later driving the late-time\nacceleration of the universe. Our analysis applies as well to the case where\nmGCG plays the role of DM and DE. We select the sets of parameters of the mGCG\nthat are compatible with the mechanical approach. These sets define prospective\nmGCG models. By comparing the selected sets of models with some of the latest\nobservational data results, we conclude that the mGCG is in tight agreement\nwith those observations particularly for a mGCG playing the role of DE and DM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 10:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 15:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

This result is difficult to\ncheck because in most cases one does not know what both the Euler-Lagrange\nequations and the equivalent Hamiltonian are at the infinite order. However, no\ndifficulty exists for a special 1PN Lagrangian formulation of relativistic\ncircular restricted three-body problem, where both the Euler-Lagrange equations\nand the equivalent Hamiltonian not only are expanded to all PN orders but also\nhave converged functions. Consequently, the analytical evidence supports this\nclaim. As far as numerical evidences are concerned, the Hamiltonian equivalent\nto the Euler-Lagrange equations for the lower order Lagrangian requires that\nthey both be only at higher enough finite orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 05:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

In this paper, we investigate structural and\nelectronic properties of SW defects in bulk silicene and its nanoribbons as a\nfunction of their concentration using the methods of periodic boundary\nconditions with first-principles calculations. We first calculate the formation\nenergy, structural properties, and electronic band structures of SW defects in\nbulk silicene, with dependence on the concentration of SW defects. Our results\nshow a good agreement with available values from the previous first-principles\ncalculations. The energetics, structural aspects, and electronic properties of\nSW defects with dependence on defect concentration and location in\nedge-hydrogenated zigzag silicene nanoribbons are obtained. For all calculated\nconcentrations, the SW defects prefer to locate at the edge due to the lower\nformation energy. The SW defects at the center of silicene nanoribbons slightly\ninfluence on the electronic properties, whereas the SW defects at the edge of\nsilicene nanoribbons split the degenerate edge states and induce a sizable gap,\nwhich depends on the concentration of defects. It is worth to find that the SW\ndefects produce a perturbation repulsive potential, which leads the decomposed\ncharge of edge states at the side with defect to transfer to the other side\nwithout defect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 11:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}
