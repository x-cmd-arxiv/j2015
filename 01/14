Three program stars are regarded as carbon-enhanced metal-poor\n(CEMP) stars, including two stars with no enhancement in their neutron-capture\nelements, which thus possibly belong to the class of CEMP-no stars; one of\nthese objects also exhibits significant enhancement in nitrogen, and is thus a\npotential carbon and nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor star. The [X/Fe] ratios of\nthe sample stars generally agree with those reported in the literature for\nother metal-poor stars in the same [Fe/H] range. We also compared the abundance\npatterns of individual program stars with the average abundance pattern of\nmetal-poor stars, and find only one chemically peculiar object with abundances\nof at least two elements (other than C and N) showing deviations larger than\n0.5dex. The distribution of [Sr/Ba] versus [Ba/H] agrees that an additional\nnucleosynthesis mechanism is needed aside from a single r-process. Two program\nstars with extremely low abundances of Sr and Ba support the prospect that both\nmain and weak r-process may have operated during the early phase of Galactic\nchemical evolution. The distribution of [C/N] shows that there are two groups\nof carbon-normal giants with different degrees of mixing. However, it is\ndifficult to explain the observed behavior of the [C/N] of the\nnitrogen-enhanced unevolved stars based on current data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 16:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Surprisingly, the collapsed tetragonal phase hosts a\nsuperconducting state with $T_c \\sim 12~\\mathrm{K}$, while the tetragonal phase\nis a $T_c \\leq 3.4~\\mathrm{K}$ superconductor. We show that the key difference\nbetween the previously known non-superconducting collapsed tetragonal phase in\nAFe$_2$As$_2$ (A= Ba, Ca, Eu, Sr) and the superconducting collapsed tetragonal\nphase in KFe$_2$As$_2$ is the qualitatively distinct electronic structure.\nWhile the collapsed phase in the former compounds features only electron\npockets at the Brillouin zone boundary and no hole pockets are present in the\nBrillouin zone center, the collapsed phase in KFe$_2$As$_2$ has almost nested\nelectron and hole pockets. Within a random phase approximation spin fluctuation\napproach we calculate the superconducting order parameter in the collapsed\ntetragonal phase. We propose that a Lifshitz transition associated with the\nstructural collapse changes the pairing symmetry from $d$-wave (tetragonal) to\n$s_\\pm$ (collapsed tetragonal).

Relying solely on visual\ncues for public surveillance video understanding is unreliable, since visual\nobservations obtained from public space CCTV video data are often not\nsufficiently trustworthy and events of interest can be subtle. On the other\nhand, non-visual data sources such as weather reports and traffic sensory\nsignals are readily accessible but are not explored jointly to complement\nvisual data for video content analysis and summarisation. In this paper, we\npresent a novel unsupervised framework to learn jointly from both visual and\nindependently-drawn non-visual data sources for discovering meaningful latent\nstructure of surveillance video data.

Galaxy clusters can be used as cosmological probes, but to this end,\nthey need to be thoroughly understood. Combining all cluster observables in a\nconsistent way will help us to understand their global properties and their\ninternal structure. Aims. We provide proof of the concept that the projected\ngravitational potential of galaxy clusters can directly be reconstructed from\nX-ray observations. We also show that this joint analysis can be used to\nlocally test the validity of the equilibrium assumptions in galaxy clusters.\nMethods. We used a newly developed reconstruction method, based on\nRichardson-Lucy deprojection, that allows reconstructing projected\ngravitational potentials of galaxy clusters directly from X-ray observations.\nWe applied this algorithm to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689 and compared\nthe gravitational potential reconstructed from X-ray observables to the\npotential obtained from gravitational lensing measurements. [...] Results.\nAssuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the potentials\nrecovered from gravitational lensing and from X-ray emission agree very well\nbeyond 500 kpc. Owing to the fact that the Richardson-Lucy deprojection\nalgorithm allows deprojecting each line of sight independently, this result may\nindicate that non-gravitational effects and/or asphericity are strong in the\ncentral regions of the clusters. Conclusions. We demonstrate the robustness of\nthe potential reconstruction method based on the Richardson-Lucy deprojection\nalgorithm and show that gravitational lensing and X-ray emission lead to\nconsistent gravitational potentials. Our results illustrate the power of\ncombining galaxy-cluster observables in a single, non-parametric, joint\nreconstruction of consistent cluster potentials that can be used to locally\nconstrain the physical state of the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 17:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

Experiments find rupture fronts ranging from quasi-static fronts\nwith speeds proportional to external loading rates, via fronts much slower than\nthe Rayleigh wave speed, and fronts that propagate near the Rayleigh wave\nspeed, to fronts that travel faster than the shear wave speed. The mechanisms\nbehind and selection between these fronts are still imperfectly understood.\nHere we perform simulations in an elastic 2D spring--block model where the\nfrictional interaction between each interfacial block and the substrate arises\nfrom a set of junctions modeled explicitly. We find that a proportionality\nbetween material slip speed and rupture front speed, previously reported for\nslow fronts, actually holds across the full range of front speeds we observe.\nWe revisit a mechanism for slow slip in the model and demonstrate that fast\nslip and fast fronts have a different, inertial origin. We highlight the long\ntransients in front speed even in homogeneous interfaces, and we study how both\nthe local shear to normal stress ratio and the local strength are involved in\nthe selection of front type and front speed. Lastly, we introduce an\nexperimentally accessible integrated measure of block slip history, the Gini\ncoefficient, and demonstrate that in the model it is a good predictor of the\nhistory-dependent local static friction coefficient of the interface. These\nresults will contribute both to building a physically-based classification of\nthe various types of fronts and to identifying the important mechanisms\ninvolved in the selection of their propagation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 19:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

In this work, we consider\nscenarios where thermal dark matter annihilates via scalar mediators that are\ncolored and/or electrically charged. We show how partial wave unitarity places\nupper bounds on the masses and couplings on both the dark matter and mediators.\nTo do this, we employ effective field theories with dark matter as well as\nthree flavors of sleptons or squarks with minimum flavor violation. For Dirac\n(Majorana) dark matter that annihilates via mediators charged as left-handed\nsleptons, we find an upper bound around 45 TeV (7 TeV) for both the mediator\nand dark matter masses, respectively. These bounds vary as the square root of\nthe number of colors times the number of flavors involved. Therefore the bounds\ndiminish by root two for right handed selectrons. The bounds increase by root\nthree and root six for right and left handed squarks, respectively. Finally,\nbecause of the interest in natural models, we also focus on an effective field\ntheory with only stops. We find an upper bound around 32 TeV (5 TeV) for both\nthe Dirac (Majorana) dark matter and stop masses. In comparison to traditional\nnaturalness arguments, the stop bound gives a firmer, alternative expectation\non when new physics will appear. Similar to naturalness, all of the bounds\nquoted above are valid outside of a defined fine-tuned regions where the dark\nmatter can co-annihilate. The bounds in this region of parameter space can\nexceed the well-known bounds from Griest and Kamionkowski.

To\nprovide a concrete example we detail the goals and expectations for the\nEvryscope, an under-construction 780 MPix telescope which covers 8,660 square\ndegrees in each two-minute exposure; each night, 18,400 square degrees will be\ncontinuously observed for an average of approximately 6 hours. Despite its\nsmall 61mm aperture, the system's large field of view provides an etendue which\nis ~10% of LSST. The Evryscope, which places 27 separate individual telescopes\ninto a common mount which tracks the entire accessible sky with only one moving\npart, will return 1%-precision, many-year-length, high-cadence light curves for\nevery accessible star brighter than mV=16.5, with brighter stars having\nfew-millimagnitude photometric precision in long-term light curves. It will be\ncapable of searching for transiting giant planets around the brightest and most\nnearby stars, where the planets are much easier to characterize; it will also\nsearch for small planets nearby M-dwarfs, for planetary occultations of white\ndwarfs, and will perform comprehensive nearby microlensing and eclipse-timing\nsearches for exoplanets inaccessible to other planet-finding methods. The\nEvryscope will also monitor outbursting young stars, white dwarf activity, and\nstellar activity of all types, along with finding a large sample of\nvery-long-period M-dwarf eclipsing binaries. When relatively rare transients\nevents occur, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), nearby supernovae, or even\ngravitational wave detections, the array will return minute-by-minute light\ncurves without needing pointing towards the event as it occurs.

We present the dynamical properties of 97\nspectroscopically confirmed UCDs (rh >~10 pc) and 911 GCs associated with\ncentral cD galaxy of the Virgo cluster, M87. Our UCDs, of which 89% have M_star\n> ~2X10^6 M_sun and 92% are as blue as the classic blue GCs, nearly triple the\nsample of previous confirmed Virgo UCDs, providing by far the best opportunity\nfor studying the global dynamics of a UCD system. We found that (1) UCDs have a\nsurface number density profile that is shallower than that of the blue GCs in\nthe inner ~ 70 kpc and as steep as that of the red GCs at larger radii; (2)\nUCDs exhibit a significantly stronger rotation than the GCs, and the blue GCs\nseem to have a velocity field that is more consistent with that of the\nsurrounding dwarf ellipticals than with that of UCDs; (3) UCDs have a radially\nincreasing orbital anisotropy profile, and are tangentially-biased at radii < ~\n40 kpc and radially-biased further out. In contrast, the blue GCs become more\ntangentially-biased at larger radii beyond ~ 40 kpc; (4) GCs with M_star >\n2X10^6 M_sun have rotational properties indistinguishable from the less massive\nones, suggesting that it is the size, instead of mass, that differentiates UCDs\nfrom GCs as kinematically distinct populations. We conclude that most UCDs in\nM87 are not consistent with being merely the most luminous and extended\nexamples of otherwise normal GCs. The radially-biased orbital structure of UCDs\nat large radii is in general agreement with the \"tidally threshed dwarf galaxy\"\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 21:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Recent 3D simulations suggest that\nturbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,\nhowever the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is\nunclear. Especially considering that the accuracy of ILES for the regime of\ninterest in CCSN, weakly compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been\nsystematically assessed before. In this paper we assess the accuracy of ILES\nusing numerical methods most commonly employed in computational astrophysics by\nmeans of a number of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,\nanisotropic turbulence. We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the\nturbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that\nanisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is\nobtained in the inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic\nenergy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly captured even at\nrelatively low resolutions, suggesting that very high effective Reynolds number\ncan be achieved at the largest scales of the simulation. On the other hand, the\ndynamics at intermediate scales appears to be completely dominated by the\nso-called bottleneck effect, \\ie the pile up of kinetic energy close to the\ndissipation range due to the partial suppression of the energy cascade by\nnumerical viscosity.

In this paper, we suggest that intensity\nmapping may be a promising method to study Pop III stars. Intensity mapping is\na technique proposed to measure large-scale fluctuations of galaxy line\nemission in three dimensions without resolving individual sources. This\ntechnique is well suited for observing many faint galaxies because it can\nmeasure their cumulative emission even if they cannot be directly detected. We\nfocus on intensity mapping of He II recombination lines. These lines are much\nstronger in Pop III stars than Pop II stars because the harder spectra of Pop\nIII stars are expected to produce many He II ionizing photons. Measuring the He\nII 1640 \\AA{} intensity mapping signal, along with the signals from other lines\nsuch as Ly$\\alpha$, H$\\alpha$, and metal lines, could give constraints on the\ninitial mass function (IMF) and star formation rate density (SFRD) of Pop III\nstars as a function of redshift. To demonstrate the feasibility of these\nobservations, we estimate the strength of the Pop III He II 1640 \\AA{}\nintensity mapping signal from $z=10-20$. We show that at $z\\approx10$, the\nsignal could be measured accurately by two different hypothetical future\ninstruments, one which cross-correlates He II 1640 \\AA{} with CO(1-0) line\nemission from galaxies and the other with 21 cm emission from the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 21:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 19:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

This issue is especially challenging\nfor CFD applications. A particular obstacle for uncertainty quantifications in\nCFD problems is the large model discrepancies associated with the CFD models\nused for uncertainty propagation. Neglecting or improperly representing the\nmodel discrepancies leads to inaccurate and distorted uncertainty distribution\nfor the Quantities of Interest. High-fidelity models, being accurate yet\nexpensive, can accommodate only a small ensemble of simulations and thus lead\nto large interpolation errors and/or sampling errors; low-fidelity models can\npropagate a large ensemble, but can introduce large modeling errors. In this\nwork, we propose a multi-model strategy to account for the influences of model\ndiscrepancies in uncertainty propagation and to reduce their impact on the\npredictions. Specifically, we take advantage of CFD models of multiple\nfidelities to estimate the model discrepancies associated with the\nlower-fidelity model in the parameter space. A Gaussian process is adopted to\nconstruct the model discrepancy function, and a Bayesian approach is used to\ninfer the discrepancies and corresponding uncertainties in the regions of the\nparameter space where the high-fidelity simulations are not performed. The\nproposed multi-model strategy combines information from models with different\nfidelities and computational costs, and is of particular relevance for CFD\napplications, where a hierarchy of models with a wide range of complexities\nexists. Several examples of relevance to CFD applications are performed to\ndemonstrate the merits of the proposed strategy.

In\nparticular, penalized regression with singular penalty functions is important\nfor sparse reconstruction algorithms. For large-scale problems, these\nalgorithms exhibit sharp phase transition boundaries where sparse retrieval\nbreaks down. Large optimization problems associated with sparse reconstruction\nhave been analyzed in the literature by setting up corresponding statistical\nmechanical models at a finite temperature. Using replica method for mean field\napproximation, and subsequently taking a zero temperature limit, this approach\nreproduces the algorithmic phase transition boundaries. Unfortunately, the\nreplica trick and the non-trivial zero temperature limit obscure the underlying\nreasons for the failure of a sparse reconstruction algorithm, and of penalized\nregression methods, in general. In this paper, we employ the ``cavity method''\nto give an alternative derivation of the mean field equations, working directly\nin the zero-temperature limit. This derivation provides insight into the origin\nof the different terms in the self-consistency conditions. The cavity method\nnaturally involves a quantity, the average local susceptibility, whose behavior\ndistinguishes different phases in this system. This susceptibility can be\ngeneralized for analysis of a broader class of sparse reconstruction\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 22:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 20:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

However, as a reliable protocol, MPTCP still needs to deliver data packets\n(to the upper application) at the receiver in the same order they are\ntransmitted at the sender. The out-of-order packet problem becomes more severe\nfor MPTCP due to the heterogeneous nature of delay and bandwidth of each path.\nIn this paper, we propose the forward-delay-based packet scheduling (FDPS)\nalgorithm for MPTCP to address that problem. The main idea is that the sender\ndispatches packets via concurrent paths according to their estimated forward\ndelay and throughput differences.

This lack\nof determinism implies that information cannot be instantiated in a\nreproducible form in isolated microsystems (as illustrated by the No-cloning\ntheorem). By stipulating that information is a reproducible and referential\nproperty of physical systems, one can formulate the no-signaling principle in\nstrictly physical terms as a prohibition of the acquisition of information\nabout spacelike-separated occurrences. This formulation provides a new\nperspective on the relationship between relativity and spacetime structure, and\nit imposes tight constraints on the way in which collapse effects are induced.\nThese constraints indicate that wave function collapse results from (presumably\nsmall) nondeterministic deviations from linear evolution associated with\nnonlocally entangling interactions.

We now\nhave a range of precise statements showing that whatever the ultimate laws of\nNature are, they cannot be classical. In this article, we review results on the\nfundamental phenomena of quantum theory that cannot be understood in classical\nterms. We proceed by first granting quite a broad notion of classicality,\ndescribe a range of quantum phenomena (such as randomness, discreteness, the\nindistinguishability of states, measurement-uncertainty,\nmeasurement-disturbance, complementarity, noncommutativity, interference, the\nno-cloning theorem, and the collapse of the wave-packet) that do fall under its\nliberal scope, and then finally describe some aspects of quantum physics that\ncan never admit a classical understanding -- the intrinsically quantum\nmechanical aspects of Nature. The most famous of these is Bell's theorem, but\nwe also review two more recent results in this area. Firstly, Hardy's theorem\nshows that even a finite dimensional quantum system must contain an infinite\namount of information, and secondly, the Pusey--Barrett--Rudolph theorem shows\nthat the wave-function must be an objective property of an individual quantum\nsystem.

Anxiety disorders are prevalent at\nhigh frequency in contemporary human societies, yet impose substantial\ndisability upon their sufferers. This raises a puzzle: why has evolution left\nus vulnerable to anxiety disorders? We develop a signal detection model in\nwhich individuals must learn how to calibrate their anxiety responses: they\nneed to learn which cues indicate danger in the environment. We derive the\noptimal strategy for doing so, and find that individuals face an inevitable\nexploration-exploitation tradeoff between obtaining a better estimate of the\nlevel of risk on one hand, and maximizing current payoffs on the other. Because\nof this tradeoff, a subset of the population can become trapped in a state of\nself-perpetuating over-sensitivity to threatening stimuli, even when\nindividuals learn optimally. This phenomenon arises because when individuals\nbecome too cautious, they stop sampling the environment and fail to correct\ntheir misperceptions, whereas when individuals become too careless they\ncontinue to sample the environment and soon discover their mistakes. Thus,\nover-sensitivity to threats becomes common whereas under-sensitivity becomes\nrare.

In 1994, Bronniman and Goodrich\nmade an important connection of this problem to the size of fundamental\ncombinatorial structures called $\\epsilon$-nets, showing that small-sized\n$\\epsilon$-nets imply approximation algorithms with correspondingly small\napproximation ratios. Very recently, Agarwal and Pan showed that their scheme\ncan be implemented in near-linear time for disks in the plane.

Thus the approximation\nfactor of the Agarwal and Pan algorithm ends up being more than $40$. The best\nlower-bound is $2/\\epsilon$, which follows from the Pach-Woeginger construction\nfor halfspaces in two dimensions. Thus there is a large gap between the\nbest-known upper and lower bounds. Besides being of independent interest,\nfinding precise bounds is important since this immediately implies an improved\nlinear-time algorithm for the hitting-set problem.\n  The main goal of this paper is to improve the upper-bound to $13.4/\\epsilon$\nfor disks in the plane.

In this work we therefore study numerically the\nformation of a dense filament using a relatively simple set-up of a\nuniform-density cylinder in pressure equilibrium with its confining medium.

Our aim is to\nquantify the feedback, mechanical and radiative, for a large sample of low-mass\nsources. The outflow activity is compared to radiative feedback in the form of\nUV heating by the accreting protostar to search for correlations and\nevolutionary trends. Large-scale maps of 26 young stellar objects, which are\npart of the Herschel WISH key program are obtained using the CHAMP+ instrument\non the APEX (12CO and 13CO 6-5), and the HARP-B instrument on the JCMT (12CO\nand 13CO 3-2). Maps are used to determine outflow parameters and envelope\nmodels are used to quantify the amount of UV-heated gas and its temperature\nfrom 13CO 6-5 observations. All sources in our sample show outflow activity and\nthe outflow force, F_CO, is larger for Class 0 sources than for Class I\nsources, even if their luminosities are comparable. The outflowing gas\ntypically extends to much greater distances than the power-law envelope and\ntherefore influences the surrounding cloud material directly. Comparison of the\nCO 6-5 results with Herschel-HIFI H2O and PACS high-J CO lines, both tracing\ncurrently shocked gas, shows that the two components are linked, even though\nthe transitions do not probe the same gas. The link does not extend down to CO\n3-2. The conclusion is that CO 6-5 depends on the shock characteristics\n(density and velocity), whereas CO 3-2 is more sensitive to conditions in the\nsurrounding environment (density). The radiative feedback is responsible for\nincreasing the gas temperature by a factor of two, up to 30-50 K, on scales of\na few thousand AU, particularly along the direction of the outflow. The mass of\nthe UV heated gas exceeds the mass contained in the entrained outflow in the\ninner ~3000 AU and is therefore at least as important on small scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 06:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The analysis of a single dipole source at different positions on\nthe surface or inside a microsphere, serves to assess the relative efficiency\nof nearby radiating TE and TM modes, characterizing the profile of the\nspectrum. By varying the number, positions and alignments of the dipole\nsources, different excitation scenarios can be compared to analytic models, and\nto experimental results. The energy flux is collected via a nearby disk-shaped\nregion. The resultant spectral profile shows a dependence on the configuration\nof the dipole sources. The power outcoupling can then be optimized for specific\nmodes and wavelength regions.

This weak\nassumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical\ninference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the\nlikelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been\nproposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding\nvalues for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small.\nA major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost\nis largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of\nknowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy.

Based on the observed profiles, we perform an\ninitial investigation of expected observational effects resulting from the\npropagation of polarised emission in the pulsar magnetosphere and the\ninterstellar medium.\n  The predictions of magnetospheric birefringence in pulsars have been tested\nusing spectra of the pulse width and fractional polarisation from\nmultifrequency data. The derived spectra offer only partial support for the\nexpected effects of birefringence on the polarisation properties, with only\nabout half of our sample being consistent with the model's predictions. It is\nnoted that for some pulsars these measurements are contaminated by the effects\nof interstellar scattering. For a number of pulsars in our sample, we have\nobserved significant variations in the amount of Faraday rotation as a function\nof pulse phase, which is possibly an artefact of scattering. These variations\nare typically two orders of magnitude smaller than that observed at 1400 MHz by\nNoutsos et al. (2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. In this\npaper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of this\neffect between the two frequencies, based on scattering.

These estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for PSR\nB1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based on\nradius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recent\nupper limit based on pulsar timing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 11:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

The posterior distribution of the Karhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve coordinates is\nthen inferred using available observations. The resulting inferred field is\ntherefore dependent on the assumed hyper-parameters. Here, we seek to\nefficiently estimate both the field and covariance hyper-parameters using\nBayesian inference.

The algorithm and strategy are named,\nrespectively, the penetrating gradient algorithm and the deepest descent\nstrategy. The most prominent feature of penetrating gradient algorithm, after\nwhich it was named, is its ability to see and penetrate through the obstacles\nin error space along the line of search direction and to jump to the global\nminimizer in a single step. The ability to find the deepest point in an\narbitrary direction, no matter how distant the point is and regardless of the\nrelief of error space between the current and the best point, motivates\nmovements in directions in which cost function can be maximally reduced, rather\nthan in directions that seem to be the best locally (like, for instance, the\nsteepest descent, i.e., negative gradient direction). Therefore, the strategy\nis named the deepest descent, in contrast but alluding to the steepest descent.\nPenetrating gradient algorithm is derived and its properties are proven\nmathematically, while features of the deepest descent strategy are shown by\ncomparative simulations. Extensive benchmark tests confirm that the proposed\nalgorithm and strategy jointly form an effective solver of polynomial systems.\nIn addition, further theoretical considerations in Section 5 about solving\nlinear systems by the proposed method reveal a surprising and interesting\nrelation of proposed and Gauss-Seidel method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 13:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

The equations of motion for the canonical variables and in turn the\nLangevin equation are obtained. It is shown that the dynamics of the\ndissipative Higgs model is not only determined by a projected susceptibility\ntensor that obeys the Kramers-Kronig relations and a noise operator but also\nthe curvature of the spherical space. Due to the gnomonic projection from the\nspherical space to the tangent plane, the projected susceptibility displays\nanisotropic character in the tangent plane. To illuminate the effect of\ndissipation on the Higgs model, the transition rate between energy levels of\nthe particle on the sphere is calculated.

Furthermore, we show that with an\nadequate self-healing network maintenance scheme, that is simple to implement,\nOnionBots achieve a low diameter and a low degree and are robust to\npartitioning under node deletions. We developed a mitigation technique, called\nSOAP, that neutralizes the nodes of the basic OnionBots.

We formulate a family of these fields accounting for the\ncurvilinear nature of cracks that, in conjunction with a discrete formulation\nof the interaction integral, yield optimally convergent stress intensity\nfactors. We formulate three pairs of auxiliary and material variation fields\nchosen to yield a simple expression of the interaction integral for different\nclasses of problems. The formulation accounts for crack face tractions and body\nforces. Distinct features of the fields are their ease of construction and\nimplementation. The resulting stress intensity factors are observed converging\nat a rate that doubles the one of the stress field. We provide a sketch of the\ntheoretical justification for the observed convergence rates, and discuss\nissues such as quadratures and domain approximations needed to attain such\nconvergent behavior. Through two representative examples, a circular arc crack\nand a loaded power function crack, we illustrate the convergence rates of the\ncomputed stress intensity factors.

As an opposite approach to the\nconventional subtractive manufacturing process, 3D objects are created by\nadding thin material layers over layers. Until recently, they have been used,\nmainly, for plastic models. However, the technology has evolved making it\npossible to use high-quality printing with metal alloys. Agencies and companies\nlike NASA, ESA, Boeing, Airbus, etc. are investigating various ALM technology\napplication areas. Recently, SpaceX used additive manufacturing to produce\nengine chambers for the newest Dragon spacecraft. BAE System plans to print\non-demand a complete Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), depending on the\noperational requirements. Companies expect the implementation of ALM technology\nwill bring a broad variety of technological and economic benefits. This\nincludes, but not limited to, the reduction of the time needed to produce\ncomplex parts, reduction of wasted material and thus control of production\ncosts along with minimization of part storage space as companies implement\njust-in-time and on-demand production solutions. The broad variety of\napplication areas and a high grade of computerization of the manufacturing\nprocess will inevitably make ALM an attractive target for various attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 17:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}
