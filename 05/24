To date, most research on hierarchy in networks\nhas been limited to quantifying this property. However, an open, important\nquestion in evolutionary biology is why hierarchical organization evolves in\nthe first place. It has recently been shown that modularity evolves because of\nthe presence of a cost for network connections. Here we investigate whether\nsuch connection costs also tend to cause a hierarchical organization of such\nmodules. In computational simulations, we find that networks without a\nconnection cost do not evolve to be hierarchical, even when the task has a\nhierarchical structure. However, with a connection cost, networks evolve to be\nboth modular and hierarchical, and these networks exhibit higher overall\nperformance and evolvability (i.e. faster adaptation to new environments).\nAdditional analyses confirm that hierarchy independently improves adaptability\nafter controlling for modularity. Overall, our results suggest that the same\nforce--the cost of connections--promotes the evolution of both hierarchy and\nmodularity, and that these properties are important drivers of network\nperformance and adaptability. In addition to shedding light on the emergence of\nhierarchy across the many domains in which it appears, these findings will also\naccelerate future research into evolving more complex, intelligent\ncomputational brains in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2015 17:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

While \"narrow\" artificial\nintelligence which focuses on solving specific problems such as speech\nrecognition, text comprehension, visual pattern recognition, robotic motion,\netc. has shown quite a few impressive breakthroughs lately, understanding\ngeneral intelligence remains elusive. In the paper we offer a novel theoretical\napproach to understanding general intelligence. We start with a brief\nintroduction of the current conceptual approach. Our critique exposes a number\nof serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the\nconcept of intelligence. We then propose a paradigm shift from intelligence\nperceived as a competence of individual agents defined in relation to an a\npriori given problem domain or a goal, to intelligence perceived as a formative\nprocess of self-organization by which intelligent agents are individuated. We\ncall this process open-ended intelligence. Open-ended intelligence is developed\nas an abstraction of the process of cognitive development so its application\ncan be extended to general agents and systems. We introduce and discuss three\nfacets of the idea: the philosophical concept of individuation, sense-making\nand the individuation of general cognitive agents.

The studied SVE model consists of two rightward convecting\ntransport Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and one leftward convecting\ntransport PDE. A single boundary input control (with actuation located only at\ndownstream) strategy is adopted. A full state feedback controller is firstly\ndesigned, which guarantees the exponential stability of the closed-loop control\nsystem. Then, an output feedback controller is designed based on the\nreconstruction of the distributed state with a backstepping observer. It also\nguarantees the exponential stability of the closed-loop control system.

The presented application has a great potential to move beyond the\nmost commonly used processes such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and\nSyringe Based Extrusion (SBE), improving the build speed. A geometrical\ndecomposition of the screw extruder in a partially and a fully filled regions\n(PFZ and FFZ) allows to describe the material convection in the extruder\nchamber by a 1D hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) coupled with an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE). After solving the hyperbolic PDE by the\nMethod of Characteristics (MC), the coupled PDE-ODE's system is transformed\ninto a nonlinear state-dependent input delay system. The aforementioned delay\nsystem is extended to the nonisothermal case with the consideration of periodic\nfluctuations acting on the material's convection speed, which represent the\neffect of viscosity variations due to temperature changes in the extruder\nchamber, resulting to a nonlinear system with an input delay that\nsimultaneously depends on the state and the time variable.

Also, although\nthe divergence between the local and global ranks has been measured, the\npossibility of estimating such divergence using only local knowledge has been\nmainly overlooked.

It\nhas the remarkable property that the Weyl group $W$ of $G$ admits a\nrepresentation on the cohomology of $\\mathcal{B}_x$ even though $W$ rarely acts\non $\\mathcal{B}_x$ itself. Well-known constructions of this action due to\nSpringer et al use technical machinery from algebraic geometry. The purpose of\nthis note is to describe an elementary approach that gives this action when $x$\nis what we call parabolic-surjective. The idea is to use localization to\nconstruct an action of $W$ on the equivariant cohomology algebra\n$H_S^*(\\mathcal{B}_x)$, where $S$ is a certain algebraic subtorus of $G$. This\naction descends to $H^*(\\mathcal{B}_x)$ via the forgetful map and gives the\ndesired representation. The parabolic-surjective case includes all nilpotents\nof type $A$ and, more generally, all nilpotents for which it is known that $W$\nacts on $H_S^*(\\mathcal{B}_x)$ for some torus $S$. Our result is deduced from a\ngeneral theorem describing when a group action on the cohomology of the fixed\npoint set of a torus action on a space lifts to the full cohomology algebra of\nthe space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2015 04:30:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 17:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 23:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and\ncostly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples\nrecalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be\nefficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and\nregression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised\nand unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To\nour best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been\nstudied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain\nAdaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier\nby leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift\ncompensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of\nthe computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the\nunified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for\nthe purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences\namong ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the\npopular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected by E-nose system\nclearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing\ndrift compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new\nperspectives for ELM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2015 04:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

We adopted\nthe SCEPtER grid, which includes stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6] Msun\nand evolutionary stages from the ZAMS to the central hydrogen depletion. Age\nestimates have been obtained by a generalisation of the technique described in\nour previous work. We showed that the typical 1 sigma random error in age\nestimates - due to the uncertainty on the observational constraints - is about\n+- 7%, which is nearly independent of the masses of the two stars. However,\nsuch an error strongly depends on the evolutionary phase and becomes larger and\nasymmetric for stars near the ZAMS where it ranges from about +90% to -25%. The\nsystematic bias due to the including mild and strong convective core\novershooting is about 50% and 120% of the error due to observational\nuncertainties. A variation of +- 1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio\naccounts for about +- 150% of the random error. The neglect of microscopic\ndiffusion accounts for a bias of about 60% of the random error. We also\nintroduced a statistical test of the expected difference in the recovered age\nof two coeval stars in a binary system.

Continuum\nsolvent models based on macroscopic dielectric theory (e.g. the Poisson\nequation) are popular alternatives, but their simplicity fails to capture\nwell-known phenomena of functional significance.
