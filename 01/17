When the potential\nreaches a threshold value $\\theta$, $V(t) = \\theta$, the LIF neuron fires and\nthe membrane potential is reset to a resting value, $V_0 < \\theta$, and clamped\nto this value for a specified (non-stochastic) absolute refractory period $T_r\n\\ge 0$, after which the cycle is repeated.

The only constraints one has to\nrespect are the exception of the zero eigenvalue (due to the Atiyah-Singer\nindex theorem) and in certain dimensions, the quaternionic structure of the\neigenspaces and also the symmetry of the spectrum.

Atomistic Green's function (AGF) method with\ninteratomic force constants from the first-principles (FP) calculations has\nevolved to be a promising approach to study phonon transmission in many not\nwell-studied material systems. However, the direct FP calculation for\ninteratomic force constants becomes infeasible when the system involves atomic\ndisorder. Mass approximation is usually used, but its validity has not been\ntested. In this paper, we employ the higher-order force constant model to\nextract harmonic force constants from the FP calculations, which originates\nfrom the virtual crystal approximation but considers the local force-field\ndifference. As a feasibility demonstration of the proposed method that\nintegrates higher-order force constant model from the FP calculations with the\nAGF, we study the phonon transmission in the Mg2Si/Mg2Si1-xSnx systems. When\nintegrated with the AGF, the widely-used mass approximation is found to\noverpredict phonon transmission across Mg2Si/Mg2Sn interface. The difference\ncan be attributed to the absence of local strain field-induced scattering in\nthe mass approximation, which makes the high-frequency phonons less scattered.\nThe frequency-dependent phonon transmission across an interface between a\ncrystal and an alloy, which often appears in high efficiency \"nanoparticle in\nalloy\" thermoelectric materials, is studied. The interfacial thermal resistance\nacross Mg2Si/Mg2Si1-xSnx interface is found to be weakly dependent on the\ncomposition of Sn when the composition x is less than 40%, but increases\nrapidly when it is larger than 40% due to the transition of high-frequency\nphonon DOS in Mg2Si1-xSnx alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 19:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-25"}

Because the ionization\ndegree in star forming clouds is extremely low, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation work strongly\nduring protostellar collapse. These effects have significant impacts in the\nearly phase of star formation as they redistribute magnetic flux and suppress\nangular momentum transport by magnetic fields. We perform three-dimensional\nnested-grid radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations including Ohmic\ndissipation and ambipolar diffusion. Without these effects, magnetic fields\ntransport angular momentum so efficiently that no rotationally supported disk\nis formed even after the second collapse. Ohmic dissipation works only in a\nrelatively high density region within the first core and suppresses angular\nmomentum transport, enabling formation of a very small rotationally supported\ndisk after the second collapse. With both Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar\ndiffusion, these effects work effectively in almost the entire region within\nthe first core and significant magnetic flux loss occurs. As a result, a\nrotationally supported disk is formed even before a protostellar core forms.\nThe size of the disk is still small, about 5 AU at the end of the first core\nphase, but this disk will grow later as gas accretion continues. Thus the\nnon-ideal MHD effects can resolve the so-called magnetic braking catastrophe\nwhile maintaining the disk size small in the early phase, which is implied from\nrecent interferometric observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Calibration relations for the stellar parameters\n(Teff, log g, [M/H], [alpha/M]) and abundances (C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K,\nCa, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni) are presented and discussed. The internal scatter of the\nabundances within clusters indicates that abundance precision is generally\nbetween 0.05 and 0.09 dex across a broad temperature range; within more limited\nranges and at high S/N, it is smaller for some elemental abundances. We assess\nthe accuracy of the abundances using comparison of mean cluster metallicities\nwith literature values, APOGEE observations of the solar spectrum and of\nArcturus, comparison of individual star abundances with other measurements, and\nconsideration of the locus of derived parameters and abundances of the entire\nsample, and find that it is challenging to determine the absolute abundance\nscale; external accuracy may be good to 0.1-0.2 dex. Uncertainties may be\nlarger at cooler temperatures (Teff<4000K).

In the\noverdamped limit, the skyrmion depins into a sliding state with a Hall angle of\nzero. When a Magnus term is included, the Hall angle is nonzero in the absence\nof a substrate. On a periodic substrate, the Hall angle varies with the drive\namplitude. Due to the substrate symmetry the Hall angle does not change\ncontinuously with drive, but forms a series of discrete steps at rational\nratios of the skyrmion velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the\ndrive direction, when the skyrmion motion locks to symmetry directions of the\nsubstrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude. On each step, the Hall\nangle is constant and the skyrmion motion is orderly. Transitions between\nlocked phases generate pronounced cusps in the velocity-force curves, as well\nas regions of negative differential mobility. The number of observable locking\nsteps increases when the relative strength of the Magnus term increases. We\nfind an overshoot phenomena where the Hall angle exceeds the clean limit value,\nas well as an acceleration effect where the skyrmion moves faster over a\nsubstrate than through a clean sample. These effects are robust for different\ntypes of periodic substrates. With a simple model for a skyrmion interacting\nwith a single pin, we can capture the behavior of the Hall angle. The Magnus\nterm induces a curvature in the skrymion orbit as it moves through the pin,\nresulting in a side step phenomenon that decreases with increasing drive. When\nthe Magnus term is large, the range of impact parameters that permit the\nskyrmion to be trapped by the pin is small, which is a reasons that strong\nMagnus force effects reduce the pinning in skyrmion systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 22:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

Mappings under context schemes can also be made stable, so\nthat extension of the query string (e.g. by increasing read length) will not\nalter the mapping of previously mapped positions. Context schemes are general\nin several senses. They natively support the detection of arbitrary complex,\nnovel rearrangements relative to the reference. They can scale over orders of\nmagnitude in query sequence length. Finally, they are trivially extensible to\nmore complex reference structures, such as graphs, that incorporate additional\nvariation. We demonstrate empirically the existence of high performance context\nschemes, and present efficient context scheme mapping algorithms.\n  Availability and Implementation: The software test framework created for this\nwork is available from\nhttps://registry.hub.docker.com/u/adamnovak/sequence-graphs/.\n  Contact: benedict@soe.ucsc.edu\n  Supplementary Information: Six supplementary figures and one supplementary\nsection are available with the online version of this article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 23:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 10:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

This study introduces a novel use of concepts from group testing\nand Kalman filtering in detecting these rare faulty sensors with significantly\nfewer number of tests. By assigning sensors to groups and performing Kalman\nfilter-based fault detection over these groups, we obtain binary detection\noutcomes, which can then be used to recover the fault state of all sensors. We\nfirst present this method using combinatorial group testing. We then present a\nnovel adaptive group testing method based on Bayesian inference.

This situation was changed in 1995, when a new superfluid was\nborn with the realization of the Bose-Einstein condensation in ultracold atomic\ngases. The liquid helium 4 is strongly interacting and has no spin; there is\nalmost no way to change its parameters, such as interaction strength and\ndensity. The new superfluid, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), offers various\naspects of advantages over liquid helium. On the one hand, BEC is weakly\ninteracting and has spin degrees of freedom. On the other hand, it is\nconvenient to tune almost all the parameters of a BEC, for example, the kinetic\nenergy by spin-orbit coupling, the density by the external potential, and the\ninteraction by Feshbach resonance. Great efforts have been devoted to studying\nthese new aspects of superfluidity, and the results have greatly enriched our\nunderstanding of superfluidity. Here we review these developments by focusing\non the stability and critical velocity of various superfluids. The BEC systems\nconsidered include a uniform superfluid in free space, a superfluid with its\ndensity periodically modulated, a superfluid with artificially engineered\nspin-orbit coupling, and a superfluid of pure spin current. Due to the weak\ninteraction, these BEC systems can be well described by the mean field\nGross-Pitaevskii theory and their superfluidity, in particular critical\nvelocities, can be examined with Landau's theory of superfluid.

However, since the discovery of the high temperature\nsuperconductors (HTSC) in 1986, the central role attributed to the pseudogap in\nthese systems has meant that by many researchers now associate the term\npseudogap exclusively with the HTSC phenomenon. Recently, the problem has got a\nlot of new attention with the rediscovery of two distinct energy scales\n(`two-gap scenario') and charge density waves patterns in the cuprates. Despite\nmany excellent reviews on the pseudogap phenomenon in HTSC, published from its\nvery discovery up to now, the mechanism of the pseudogap and its relation to\nsuperconductivity are still open questions. The present review represents a\ncontribution dealing with the pseudogap, focusing on results from angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ends up with the conclusion\nthat the pseudogap in cuprates is a complex phenomenon which includes at least\nthree different `intertwined' orders: spin and charge density waves and\npreformed pairs, which appears in different parts of the phase diagram. The\ndensity waves in cuprates are competing to superconductivity for the electronic\nstates but, on the other hand, should drive the electronic structure to\nvicinity of Lifshitz transition, that could be a key similarity between the\nsuperconducting cuprates and iron based superconductors. One may also note that\nsince the pseudogap in cuprates has multiple origins there is no need to recoin\nthe term suggested by Mott.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 04:35:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2015 01:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

First, the input image is decomposed into an elemental\nimage array (EIA) by utilizing a pinhole array. Then, the obtained image are\nencrypted by combining the use of cellular automata and chaotic logistic maps.\nIn the image reconstruction process, the conventional computational integral\nimaging reconstruction (CIIR) technique is a pixel-superposition technique; the\nresolution of the reconstructed image is dramatically degraded due to the large\nmagnification in the superposition process as the pickup distance increases.\nThe smart mapping technique is introduced to improve the problem of CIIR. A\nnovel property of the proposed scheme is its depth-conversion ability, which\nconverts original elemental images recorded at long distance to ones recorded\nnear the pinhole array and consequently reduce the magnification factor. The\nresults of numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and security of\nthis proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 06:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

To get formal privacy guarantees, the second approach must be\nfollowed, but then data releases with no utility guarantees are obtained. Also,\nin general it is unclear how verifiable is anonymization by the data subject\n(how safely released is the record she has contributed?), what type of intruder\nis being considered (what does he know and want?) and how transparent is\nanonymization towards the data user (what is the user told about methods and\nparameters used?).\n  We show that, using a generally applicable reverse mapping transformation,\nany anonymization for microdata can be viewed as a permutation plus (perhaps) a\nsmall amount of noise; permutation is thus shown to be the essential principle\nunderlying any anonymization of microdata, which allows giving simple utility\nand privacy metrics.

A significant challenge\nis performing the analysis required by envisaged applications --- like for\ninstance process mapping for environmental risk management --- in reasonable\ntime. In this work, we address the problem of content-based image retrieval via\nexample-based queries from EO data archives. In particular, we focus on the\nanalysis of polarimetric SAR data, for which target decomposition theorems have\nproved fundamental in discovering patterns in data and characterize the ground\nscattering properties. To this end, we propose an interactive region-oriented\ncontent-based image mining system in which 1) unsupervised ingestion processes\nare distributed onto virtual machines in elastic, on-demand computing\ninfrastructures 2) archive-scale content hierarchical indexing is implemented\nin terms of a \"big data\" analytics cluster-computing framework 3) query\nprocessing amounts to traversing the generated binary tree index, computing\ndistances that correspond to descriptor-based similarity measures between image\ngroups and a query image tile. We describe in depth both the strategies and the\nactual implementations for the ingestion and indexing components, and verify\nthe approach by experiments carried out on the NASA/JPL UAVSAR full\npolarimetric data archive. We report the results of the tests performed on\ncomputer clusters by using a public Infrastructure-as-a-Service and evaluating\nthe impact of cluster configuration on system performance.
