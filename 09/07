Developing from the traditional Hamming distance\nbetween subsets or cardinality of their symmetric difference, this work\nconsiders alternative metric distances between partitions. With one exception,\nall of them obtain as minimum-weight paths in the undirected graph\ncorresponding to the Hasse diagram of the partition lattice. Firstly, by\nfocusing on the atoms of the lattice, one well-known partition distance is\nrecognized to be in fact the analog of the Hamming distance between subsets,\nwith weights on edges of the Hasse diagram determined through the number of\natoms in the unique maximal join-decomposition of partitions. Secondly, another\npartition distance known as \"variation of information\" is seen to correspond to\na minimum-weight path with edge weights determined by the entropy of\npartitions. These two distances are next compared in terms of their upper and\nlower bounds over all pairs of partitions that are complements of one another.\nWhat emerges is that the two distances share the same minimizers and\nmaximizers, while a much rawer behavior is observed for the partition distance\nwhich does not correspond to a minimum-weight path. The idea of measuring the\ndistance between partitions by means of minimum-weight paths in the Hasse\ndiagram is further explored by considering alternative symmetric and\norder-preserving/inverting partition functions (such as the the rank, in the\nsimplest case) for assigning weights to edges. What matters most, in such a\ngeneral setting, turns out to be whether the weighting function is supermodular\nor else submodular, as this makes any minimum-weight path visit the meet or\nelse the join of the two partitions, depending on order preserving/inverting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 20:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 16:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

However, with intermittent and random energy arrivals, it is\nchallenging to provide satisfactory quality of service (QoS) in EH networks. To\nenjoy the greenness brought by EH while overcoming the instability of the\nrenewable energy sources, hybrid energy supply (HES) networks that are powered\nby both EH and the electric grid have emerged as a new paradigm for green\ncommunications. In this paper, we will propose new design methodologies for HES\ngreen cellular networks with the help of Lyapunov optimization techniques.

The confidence measure of each term occurrence is then\nre-estimated through linear interpolation with the calculated document ranking\nweight to improve its reliability by integrating document-level information.\nExperiments are conducted on three standard STD tasks for Tamil, Vietnamese and\nEnglish respectively. The experimental results all demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art\nmethod for confidence measure calculation. Furthermore, this algorithm is still\neffective even if a high accuracy speech recognizer is not available, which\nmakes it applicable for the languages with limited speech resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 04:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 09:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

It has been previously shown that, on the western side of the\ncluster, the radio brightness shows a much steeper gradient compared to other\nazimuths. XMM-Newton and Planck revealed a shock front along the southern half\nof the region associated with this steep radio gradient, suggesting that the\nradio emission is enhanced by particle acceleration associated with the shock\npassage. Suzaku demonstrates for the first time that this shock front extends\nnorthwards, tracing the entire length of the western edge of the Coma radio\nhalo. The shock is detected both in the temperature and X-ray surface\nbrightness distributions and has a Mach number of around $\\mathcal{M}\\sim1.5$.\nThe locations of the surface brightness edges align well with the edge of the\nradio emission, while the obtained temperature profiles seem to suggest shocks\nlocated 125-185 kpc further out in radius. In addition, the shock strengths\nderived from the temperature and density jumps are in agreement when using\nextraction regions parallel to the radio halo edge, but become inconsistent\nwith each other when derived from radial profiles centred on the Coma Cluster\ncore. It is likely that, beyond mere projection effects, the geometry of the\nshock is more complex than a front with a single, uniform Mach number and an\napproximately spherically symmetric shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 05:02:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 08:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Here we reconcile\nthese two descriptions of the intermediate state by considering the underlying\nbosonic representation of the composite fermion paired state in the long\ndistance limit, and by performing extensive exact diagonalizations on the\ntorus. We argue that the spiraling states belong to the manifold of degenerate\nground state(s), and are a consequence of Bose condensation of the\nquasiparticles (with critical algebraic correlations) at non-zero momenta in\nthe two pseudospin states. The spiraling states, generated in this way as\nspin-textures, can be identified with meron-antimeron constructions. Thus,\nmerons -- the fractionally charged vortex excitations of the XY magnetically\nordered state -- constitute some of the topological sectors. It follows that\nmerons are deconfined in the intermediate state, and allow for a smooth\ntransition between the magnetically ordered and Fermi-liquid-like phases, in\nwhich they are bound in pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 06:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 09:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

Their masses are all positive\nbut, nevertheless, the electroweak symmetry breaking is realized by the bosonic\nseesaw mechanism. We analyze the renormalization group evolutions for all model\ncouplings, and find that a large hierarchy among the quartic Higgs couplings,\nwhich is crucial for the bosonic seesaw mechanism to work, is dramatically\nreduced toward high energies. Therefore, the bosonic seesaw is naturally\nrealized with only a mild hierarchy, if some fundamental theory, which provides\nthe origin of the classically conformal invariance, completes our model at some\nhigh energy, for example, the Planck scale.

Among the CTA design key requirements to the RTA system, the most\nchallenging is the generation of alerts within 30 seconds from the last\nacquired event, while obtaining a flux sensitivity not worse than the one of\nthe final analysis by more than a factor of 3. A dedicated software and\nhardware architecture for the RTA pipeline must be designed and tested. We\npresent comparison of OpenCL solutions using different kind of devices like\nCPUs, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and Field Programmable Array (FPGA) cards\nfor the Real-Time data reduction of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)\ntriggered data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 09:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Basic statistical considerations state\nthat the reliability of the stimulus information, i.e., the amount of noise in\nthe samples, should be taken into account when the decision is made. However,\nfor perceptual decision making experiments it has been questioned whether the\nbrain indeed uses the reliability for making decisions when confronted with\nunpredictable changes in stimulus reliability. We here show that even the basic\ndrift diffusion model, which has frequently been used to explain experimental\nfindings in perceptual decision making, implicitly relies on estimates of\nstimulus reliability. We then show that only those variants of the drift\ndiffusion model which allow stimulus-specific reliabilities are consistent with\nneurophysiological findings. Our analysis suggests that the brain estimates the\nreliability of the stimulus on a short time scale of at most a few hundred\nmilliseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 10:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

With two\nplanned arrays, one for each hemisphere, it will guarantee a good sky coverage\nin the energy range from a few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV, with improved\nangular resolution and a sensitivity in the TeV energy region better by one\norder of magnitude than the currently operating arrays. In order to cover this\nwide energy range, three different telescope types are envisaged, with\ndifferent mirror sizes and focal plane features. In particular, for the highest\nenergies a possible design is a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder optical\nscheme, with a compact focal plane. A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) based\ncamera is being proposed as a solution to match the dimensions of the pixel\n(angular size of ~ 0.17 degrees).

This matches up to a logarithmic factor the cost induced by\nquadtree-based algorithms for deterministic queries and is asymptotically\nfaster than the straightforward approach whenever $|N(q,f)| \\in o(n / \\log n)$.\n  As practical proofs of concept we use two applications, one in the Euclidean\nand one in the hyperbolic plane. In particular, our results yield the first\ngenerator for random hyperbolic graphs with arbitrary temperatures in\nsubquadratic time. Moreover, our experimental data show the usefulness of our\nalgorithm even if the point distribution is unknown or not uniform: The running\ntime savings over the pairwise probing approach constitute at least one order\nof magnitude already for a modest number of points and queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 11:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 14:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The block circulant\nmatricization of the twist tensor can be transformed into a circulant block\nrepresentation with nuclear norm invariance. This representation, after\ntransformation, exploits the horizontal translation relationship between the\nframes in a video, and endows the t-TNN model with a more powerful ability to\nreconstruct panning videos than the existing state-of-the-art low-rank models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 13:19:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

The theoretical basis for\nmultivariate functional principal component analysis is given in terms of a\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve Theorem. For the practically relevant case of a finite\nKarhunen-Lo\\`eve representation, a relationship between univariate and\nmultivariate functional principal component analysis is established. This\noffers an estimation strategy to calculate multivariate functional principal\ncomponents and scores based on their univariate counterparts. For the resulting\nestimators, asymptotic results are derived. The approach can be extended to\nfinite univariate expansions in general, not necessarily orthonormal bases. It\nis also applicable for sparse functional data or data with measurement error. A\nflexible R-implementation is available on CRAN.

The goal of this work is to estimate\nthe efficiency of the regulation to limit the fluctuations of the number of\ncopies of a given protein. The autoregulation considered in this paper relies\nmainly on a negative feedback: the proteins are repressors of their own gene\nexpression. The efficiency of a production process without feedback control is\ncompared to a production process with an autoregulation of the gene expression\nassuming that both of them produce the same average number of proteins. The\nmain characteristic used for the comparison is the standard deviation of the\nnumber of proteins at equilibrium.

Calibration is an important step for any practical\nmagnetometer use. The most popular three-axis magnetometer calibration methods\nare attitude-independent and have been founded on an approximate maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimation with a quartic subjective function, derived from the\nfact that the magnitude of the calibrated measurements should be constant in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field. This paper highlights the shortcomings of those\npopular methods and proposes to use the quadratic optimal ML estimation instead\nfor magnetometer calibration. Simulation and test results show that the optimal\nML calibration is superior to the approximate ML methods for magnetometer\ncalibration in both accuracy and stability, especially for those situations\nwithout sufficient attitude excitation. The significant benefits deserve the\nmoderately increased computation burden. The main conclusion obtained in the\ncontext of magnetometer in this paper is potentially applicable to various\nkinds of three-axis sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 13:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

The individual grains are modelled as two exchange coupled\nStoner-Wohlfarth particles from which the minimum energy paths connecting the\nminimum energy states are calculated using a variant of the string method and\nthe energy barriers and attempt frequencies calculated as a function of the\napplied field. The resultant rate equations describing the evolution of an\nensemble of non-interacting ECC grains are then integrated numerically in an\napplied field with constant sweep rate and the magnetization calculated as a\nfunction of the applied field H. MH hysteresis loops are presented for a range\nof values I and a figure of merit (FOM) that quantifies the advantages of ECC\nmedia is proposed.

Of\nparticular interest is the clustering of minimum energy states that are\nseparated by relatively low energy barriers into \"metastates.\" It is shown that\nwhile approximating the reversal process in terms of \"metastates\" results in\nlittle loss of accuracy, it can reduce the run time of a Kinetic Monte Carlo\n(KMC) simulation of the magnetic decay of an ensemble of dual layer ECC media\nby 2~3 orders of magnitude.

In general, we observe\nthat the backreaction of fermions on the electromagnetic field prevents the\nsystem from acquiring chirality imbalance. In the case of chirality pumping in\nparallel electric and magnetic fields, electric field is screened by the\nproduced on-shell fermions and the accumulation of chirality is hence stopped.\nIn the case of evolution with initially present chirality imbalance, axial\ncharge tends to transform to helicity of electromagnetic field. By performing\nsimulations on large lattices we show that in most cases this decay process is\naccompanied by the inverse cascade phenomenon which transfers energy from\nshort-wavelength to long-wavelength electromagnetic fields.

We also show\nthat the Majorana fermions at the end points of one-dimensional wires are\nspin-polarized, which can be directly related to the spin-polarization of the\nedge currents of two-dimensional blocks.

Several years back one of us had conjectured that\nthe black hole horizon is defined by equipartition of gravitational and\nnon-gravitational energy. By employing the above definition of quasilocal\nBrown-York energy, we have verified the equipartition conjecture for static\ncharged and charged axi-symmetric blck holes in general relativity. We have\nfurther generalized the Brown-York formalism to all orders in Lanczos-Lovelock\ntheories of gravity and have verified the conjecture for pure Lovelock charged\nblack hole in all even d=2m+2 dimensions, where m is the degree of Lovelock\naction. It turns out that the equipartition conjecture works only for pure\nLovelock, and not for Einstein-Lovelock, black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 08:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 10:11:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 03:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

A problem arises when infinitely many parameter\nvalues can yield the same result; such a model is called unidentifiable. In\nthis case, one can search for an identifiable reparametrization of the model: a\nmap which reduces the number of parameters, such that the reduced model is\nidentifiable. We study a specific class of models which are known to be\nunidentifiable. Using algebraic geometry and graph theory, we translate a\ncriterion given by Meshkat and Sullivant for the existence of an identifiable\nscaling reparametrization to a new criterion based on the rank of a weighted\nadjacency matrix of a certain bipartite graph. This allows us to derive several\nnew constructions to obtain graphs with an identifiable scaling\nreparametrization. Using these constructions, a large subclass of such graphs\nis obtained. Finally, we present a procedure of subdividing or deleting edges\nto ensure that a model has an identifiable scaling reparametrization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 09:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 20:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}
