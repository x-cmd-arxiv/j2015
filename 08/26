Players' types evolve as conditionally independent\nMarkov processes, conditioned on their current actions. Their actions and types\njointly determine their instantaneous rewards. In dynamic games with asymmetric\ninformation, a widely used concept of equilibrium is perfect Bayesian\nequilibrium (PBE), which consists of a strategy and belief pair that\nsimultaneously satisfy sequential rationality and belief consistency. In\ngeneral, there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the\ninterdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE. In this\npaper, for the finite-horizon game with independent types we develop a two-step\nbackward-forward recursive algorithm that sequentially decomposes the problem\n(w.r.t. time) to obtain a subset of PBEs, which we refer to as structured\nBayesian perfect equilibria (SPBE). In such equilibria, a player's strategy\ndepends on its history only through a common public belief and its current\nprivate type. The backward recursive part of this algorithm defines an\nequilibrium generating function. Each period in the backward recursion involves\nsolving a fixed-point equation on the space of probability simplexes for every\npossible belief on types. Using this function, equilibrium strategies and\nbeliefs are generated through a forward recursion. We then extend this\nmethodology to the infinite-horizon model, where we propose a time-invariant\nsingle-shot fixed-point equation, which in conjunction with a forward recursive\nstep, generates the SPBE. Sufficient conditions for the existence of SPBE are\nprovided. With our proposed method, we find equilibria that exhibit signaling\nbehavior.

Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers\nwith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may\nthus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 20:08:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 13:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

For many practical flows, the turbulence models are by\nfar the largest source of uncertainty. In this work we develop an open-box,\nphysics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in\nRANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds\nstresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for\nempirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability,\nsmoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to\nassimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework,\nand to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other\nQuantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over\nperiodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed framework. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse\nobservations, the posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly\nbetter agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At\nmost locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model\nerror within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a\nmajor improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for\nmodel-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the\nmodels are not exploited.

We offer a mathematical development, estimates\nof the errors of the approximation, and a demonstration using a sample of 197\nasteroids observed for two nights with a small, 0.9-meter telescope. This\ndemonstration used digital tracking to enhance detection sensitivity for faint\nasteroids, but our distance determination works with any detection method.\nForty-eight asteroids in our sample had known orbits prior to our observations,\nand for these we demonstrate a mean fractional error of only 1.6% between the\ndistances we calculate and those given in ephemerides from the Minor Planet\nCenter.

It is through\nthe sensitivity to this effect that the recent CMB data has provided a robust\ndetection of free-streaming neutrinos. In this paper, we revisit the phase\nshift of the CMB anisotropy spectrum as a probe of new physics. The phase shift\nis particularly interesting because its physical origin is strongly constrained\nby the analytic properties of the Green's function of the gravitational\npotential. For adiabatic fluctuations, a phase shift requires modes that\npropagate faster than the speed of fluctuations in the photon-baryon plasma.\nThis possibility is realized by free-streaming relativistic particles, such as\nneutrinos or other forms of dark radiation.

One of the challenging scheduling\nproblems in Cloud data centers is to take the allocation and migration of\nreconfigurable virtual machines (VMs) as well as the integrated features of\nhosting physical machines (PMs) into consideration. In the reservation model,\nthe workload of data centers has fixed process interval characteristics. In\ngeneral, load-balance scheduling is NP-hard problem as proved in many open\nliteratures. Traditionally, for offline load balance without migration, one of\nthe best approaches is LPT (Longest Process Time first), which is well known to\nhave approximation ratio 4/3. With virtualization, reactive (post) migration of\nVMs after allocation is one popular way for load balance and traffic\nconsolidation. However, reactive migration has difficulty to reach predefined\nload balance objectives, and may cause interruption and instability of service\nand other associated costs. In view of this, we propose a new paradigm, called\nPrepartition, it proactively sets process-time bound for each request on each\nPM and prepares in advance to migrate VMs to achieve the predefined balance\ngoal. Prepartition can reduce process time by preparing VM migration in advance\nand therefore reduce instability and achieve better load balance as desired. We\nalso apply the Prepartition to online (PrepartitionOn) load balance and compare\nit with existing online scheduling algorithms.

The\nstandard algorithms for generation of the nonce as specified by NIST, as well\nas the widely implemented random number generators, fail to serve as true\nrandom sources, thus leaving the DSA algorithm open to attack, resulting in\npossible signature forgery in electronic transactions, by potential attackers.\nFurthermore, the user can select the nonce arbitrarily, which leads to a\nsubliminal channel being present to exchange messages through each signature,\nwhich may be intolerable for security reasons. In this paper, we have improved\nthe security of the DSA algorithm by proposing an efficient nonce-generation\nprocess, which ensures that the generated nonce is sufficiently random as well\nas unique for each generated signature, thereby securing the signing process.\nFurthermore, our algorithm also ensures that there are no subliminal channels\npresent in DSA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 05:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

We have also studied and analyzed the\ncommunity structure of the network therein. The results obtained with our\napproach are very competitive with most of the well-known algorithms in the\nliterature, and this is justified over the large collection of datasets. On the\nother hand, it can be observed that time taken by our algorithm is quite less\ncompared to other methods and justifies the theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 06:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging\nrequires advanced data processing methods to disentangle potential planetary\nsignals from bright quasi-static speckles. Among them, angular differential\nimaging (ADI) permits potential planetary signals with a known rotation rate to\nbe separated from instrumental speckles that are either statics or slowly\nvariable. The method presented in this paper, called ANDROMEDA for ANgular\nDifferential OptiMal Exoplanet Detection Algorithm is based on a maximum\nlikelihood approach to ADI and is used to estimate the position and the flux of\nany point source present in the field of view. Aims. In order to optimize and\nexperimentally validate this previously proposed method, we applied ANDROMEDA\nto real VLT/NaCo data. In addition to its pure detection capability, we\ninvestigated the possibility of defining simple and efficient criteria for\nautomatic point source extraction able to support the processing of large\nsurveys. Methods. To assess the performance of the method, we applied ANDROMEDA\non VLT/NaCo data of TYC-8979-1683-1 which is surrounded by numerous bright\nstars and on which we added synthetic planets of known position and flux in the\nfield.

We end up with a robust method\nbringing consistent results with a sensitivity similar to the recently\npublished algorithms, with only two parameters to be fine tuned. Moreover, the\ncompanion flux estimates are not biased by the algorithm parameters and do not\nrequire a posteriori corrections. Conclusions.

In particular, it is not yet clear how much of the difference\nbetween low-mass and high-mass star formation occurs during the earliest star\nformation phases. The chemical characteristics of massive cold clumps, and the\ncomparison with those of their low-mass counterparts, could provide crucial\nclues about the exact role that chemistry plays in differentiating the early\nphases of low-mass and high-mass star formation. Water, in particular, is a\nunique probe of physical and chemical conditions in star-forming regions. Using\nthe HIFI instrument of Herschel we have observed the ortho-NH3 (1_0-0_0)\n(572GHz), ortho-H2O (1_10-1_01) (557GHz) and N2H+ (6-5) (559GHz) lines toward a\nsample of high-mass starless and proto-stellar clumps selected from the\n\"Herschel} Infrared Galactic Plane Survey\" (Hi-GAL).

The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), is an extension of DP for\ngrouped data, often used for non-parametric topic modeling, where each group is\na mixture over shared mixture densities. The Nested Dirichlet Process (nDP), on\nthe other hand, is an extension of the DP for learning group level\ndistributions from data, simultaneously clustering the groups.

We developed a tracking\nsoftware suite which we call SPF-CellTracker. Incorporating dependency on\ncells' moves into prediction model is the key to reduce the tracking errors:\ncell-switching and coalescence of tracked positions. We model target cells'\ncorrelated moves as a Markov random field and we also derive a fast computation\nalgorithm, which we call spatial particle filter. With the live-imaging data of\nnuclei of C. elegans neurons in which approximately 120 nuclei of neurons are\nimaged, we demonstrate an advantage of the proposed method over the standard\nparticle filter and a method developed by Tokunaga et al. (2014).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 12:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 00:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 19:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

The model consists of three steps: (i)\nintermittent impact of meteoroids, (ii) impact-induced global vibration\n(seismic shaking), and (iii) vibration-induced regolith convection. In order to\nassess the feasibility of the resurfacing process driven by regolith\nconvection, we estimate the resurfacing timescale as a function of the size of\na target asteroid. In the estimate, a set of parameter values is assumed on the\nbasis of previous works.

To clarify the\nparameter dependences, we develop an approximated scaling form for the\nresurfacing timescale. According to the estimated result, we find that the\nregolith-convection-based resurfacing timescale is shorter than the mean\ncollisional lifetime in most of the parameter uncertainty ranges.

Indeed, simplified rate-based large neuronal networks with\nrandom synaptic connections are known to exhibit sharp transition from fixed\npoint to chaotic dynamics when the synaptic gain is increased. However, the\nexistence of a similar transition in neuronal circuit models with more\nrealistic architectures and firing dynamics has not been established.\n  In this work we investigate rate based dynamics of neuronal circuits composed\nof several subpopulations and random connectivity. Nonzero connections are\neither positive-for excitatory neurons, or negative for inhibitory ones, while\nsingle neuron output is strictly positive; in line with known constraints in\nmany biological systems. Using Dynamic Mean Field Theory, we find the phase\ndiagram depicting the regimes of stable fixed point, unstable dynamic and\nchaotic rate fluctuations. We characterize the properties of systems near the\nchaotic transition and show that dilute excitatory-inhibitory architectures\nexhibit the same onset to chaos as a network with Gaussian connectivity.\nInterestingly, the critical properties near transition depend on the shape of\nthe single- neuron input-output transfer function near firing threshold.\nFinally, we investigate network models with spiking dynamics. When synaptic\ntime constants are slow relative to the mean inverse firing rates, the network\nundergoes a sharp transition from fast spiking fluctuations and static firing\nrates to a state with slow chaotic rate fluctuations. When the synaptic time\nconstants are finite, the transition becomes smooth and obeys scaling\nproperties, similar to crossover phenomena in statistical mechanics\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 13:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

The smooth frequency\nspectrum expected for the foregrounds would nominally contaminate only very\nsmall $k_\\parallel$ modes; however the chromatic response of the telescope\nantenna pattern at this wavelength to the foreground introduces non-smooth\nstructure, pervasively contaminating the cosmic signal over the physical scales\nof our interest.

It is found that the LD-like regions\nfully account for the orthorhombicity of the system, and are thus the origin of\nany static iron magnetism. Orthorhombicity and static magnetism are not\nhindered by superconductivity but limited by dilution effects, in agreement\nwith 2D (respectively 3D) nearest-neighbor square lattice site percolation when\nthe rare earth is nonmagnetic (respectively magnetic). The LD-like regions are\nnot intrinsically supportive of superconductivity, on the contrary of the\nHD-like regions, as evidenced by the well-defined Uemura relation between the\nsuperconducting transition temperature and the superfluid density when\naccounting for the proximity effect. This leads us to propose a complete\ndescription of the interplay of ground states in 1111 pnictides, where\nnanoscopic regions compete to establish the ground state through suppression of\nsuperconductivity by static magnetism, and extension of superconductivity by\nproximity effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 15:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

One promising avenue is to modify general\nrelativity and obtain a new description of the gravitational force.

In this thesis,\nwe describe two complementary approaches to the problem of testing gravity\nusing cosmology.\n  In the first part, we discuss the cosmological solutions of massive gravity\nand its generalisation to a bimetric theory. These theories describe a graviton\nwith a small mass, and can potentially explain the late-time acceleration in a\ntechnically-natural way. We describe these self-accelerating solutions and\ninvestigate the cosmological perturbations in depth, beginning with an\ninvestigation of their linear stability, followed by the construction of a\nmethod for solving these perturbations in the quasistatic limit. This allows\nthe predictions of stable bimetric models to be compared to observations of\nstructure formation. Next, we discuss prospects for theories in which matter\n\"doubly couples\" to both metrics, and examine the cosmological expansion\nhistory in both massive gravity and bigravity with a specific double coupling\nwhich is ghost-free at low energies.\n  In the second and final part, we study the consequences of Lorentz violation\nduring inflation.

The magnetic field, which is\ncharacterized by extremely low frequencies up to 300 Hz is measured due to its\nhazardous effects to the laptop user's health. The experiment consists of\ntesting 13 different laptop computers in normal operation conditions. The\nmeasuring of the magnetic field is performed in the adjacent neighborhood of\nthe laptop computers. The measured data are presented and then classified. The\nclassification is performed by the K-Medians method in order to determine the\ncritical positions of the laptop. At the end, the measured magnetic field\nvalues are compared with the critical values suggested by different safety\nstandards. It is shown that some of the laptop computers emit a very strong\nmagnetic field. Hence, they must be used with extreme caution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 14:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

Existing\napproaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First,\nthey exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely\nk effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect\ncyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to\nexclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the\nomission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these\nlimitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a run-time causal\ninference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order\nabsorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between\ntwo events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is\na necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference\nmechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This\nis done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not\nexhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence\nmodel. This paper presents two query processing algorithms -- one performs\nexhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced\nsearch with early termination. Experiments using two real datasets (cascading\nblackouts in power systems and web page views) verify the effectiveness of the\nprobabilistic top-k prediction queries and the efficiency of the algorithms.\nSpecifically, the reduced search algorithm reduced runtime, relative to\nexhaustive search, by 25-80% (depending on the application) with only a small\nreduction in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 15:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

With the advent of the Automated\nFare Collection system (AFC), probing the travel patterns of commuters has\nbecome less invasive and more accessible. Consequently, numerous transport\nstudies related to human mobility have shown that these observed patterns allow\none to pair individuals with locations and/or activities at certain times of\nthe day. However, classifying commuters using their travel signatures is yet to\nbe thoroughly examined.\n  Here, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating a procedure to\ncharacterize passenger types (Adult, Child/Student, and Senior Citizen) based\non their three-month travel patterns taken from a smart fare card system. We\nfirst establish a method to construct distinct commuter matrices, which we\nrefer to as eigentravel matrices, that capture the characteristic travel\nroutines of individuals. From the eigentravel matrices, we build classification\nmodels that predict the type of passengers traveling. Among the models\nexplored, the gradient boosting method (GBM) gives the best prediction accuracy\nat 76%, which is 84% better than the minimum model accuracy (41%) required\nvis-\\`a-vis the proportional chance criterion. In addition, we find that travel\nfeatures generated during weekdays have greater predictive power than those on\nweekends. This work should not only be useful for transport planners, but for\nmarket researchers as well. With the awareness of which commuter types are\ntraveling, ads, service announcements, and surveys, among others, can be made\nmore targeted spatiotemporally. Finally, our framework should be effective in\ncreating synthetic populations for use in real-world simulations that involve a\nmetropolitan's public transport system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 16:10:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}
