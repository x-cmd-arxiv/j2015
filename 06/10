First, by combining Richardson extrapolation and\ntri-quadratic Serendipity interpolation techniques, we introduce a new\nextrapolation formula to provide a good initial guess for the iterative\nsolution on the next finer grid, which is a third order approximation to the\nfinite element (FE) solution. And the resulting large sparse linear system from\nthe FE discretization is then solved by the Jacobi-preconditioned Conjugate\nGradient (JCG) method. Additionally, instead of performing a fixed number of\niterations as cascadic multigrid (CMG) methods, a relative residual stopping\ncriterion is used in iterative solvers, which enables us to obtain conveniently\nthe numerical solution with the desired accuracy. Moreover, a simple Richardson\nextrapolation is used to cheaply get a fourth order approximate solution on the\nentire fine grid. Test results are reported to show that ECMG$_{jcg}$ has much\nbetter efficiency compared to the classical MG methods. Since the initial guess\nfor the iterative solution is a quite good approximation to the FE solution,\nnumerical results show that only few number of iterations are required on the\nfinest grid for ECMG$_{jcg}$ with an appropriate tolerance of the relative\nresidual to achieve full second order accuracy, which is particularly important\nwhen solving large systems of equations and can greatly reduce the\ncomputational cost. It should be pointed out that when the tolerance becomes\nsmaller, ECMG$_{jcg}$ still needs only few iterations to obtain fourth order\nextrapolated solution on each grid, except on the finest grid. Finally, we\npresent the reason why our ECMG algorithms are so highly efficient for solving\nsuch problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 16:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-05"}

We are analysing stellar evolutionary models in which the\nEddington limit is reached and exceeded, and explore the rich diversity of\nphysical phenomena which take place in their envelopes, and investigate their\nobservational consequences. We use the grids of detailed stellar models by\nBrott et al. (2011) and Koehler et al. (2015), to investigate the envelope\nproperties of core hydrogen burning massive stars. We find that at the stellar\nsurface, the Eddington limit is almost never reached, even for stars up to 500\nMsun. When an appropriate Eddington limit is defined locally in the stellar\nenvelope, most stars more massive than 40 Msun actually exceed this limit, in\nparticular in the partial ionization zones of iron, helium or hydrogen. While\nmost models adjust their structure such that the local Eddington limit is\nexceeded at most by a few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor\nof more than seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has\nsevere consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope\ninflation, convection, density inversions and possibly to pulsations. We find\nthat all models with luminosities higher than 4*10^5 Lsun i.e. stars above 40\nMsun show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We\nfind that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a line\nbeyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two, indicating a\npossible connection between S Dor variability and inflation. Furthermore, our\ncoolest models show highly inflated envelopes with masses of up to several\nsolar masses, and appear to be candidates to produce major LBV eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 16:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

The three main\ntheories of heterosis are dominance theory, overdominance theory, and epistasis\ntheory. Kacser and Burns (1981) identified the molecular basis of dominance,\nwhich has greatly enhanced our understanding of its importance to heterosis.\nThis paper aims to explain how overdominance, and some features of epistasis,\ncan similarly emerge from the molecular dynamics of proteins. Possessing\nmultiple alleles at a gene locus results in the synthesis of different\nallozymes at reduced concentrations. This in turn reduces the rate at which\neach allozyme forms soluble oligomers, which are toxic and must be degraded,\nbecause allozymes co-aggregate at low efficiencies. The model developed in this\npaper will be used to explain how heterozygosity can impact the metabolic\nefficiency of an organism. It can also explain why the viabilities of some\ninbred lines seem to decline rapidly at high inbreeding coefficients (F > 0.5),\nwhich may provide a physical basis for truncation selection for heterozygosity.\nFinally, the model has implications for the ploidy level of organisms. It can\nexplain why polyploids are frequently found in environments where severe\nphysical stresses promote the formation of soluble oligomers. The model can\nalso explain why complex organisms, which need to synthesize aggregation-prone\nproteins that contain intrinsically unstructured regions (IURs) and multiple\ndomains because they facilitate complex protein interaction networks (PINs),\ntend to be diploid while haploidy tends to be restricted to relatively simple\norganisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 17:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 2019 20:23:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 02:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

For experimentally\ncompatible scenarios wherein the initial neutrino mass matrix has $\\mu-\\tau$\nsymmetry, we find that the Dirac phase can take any value under small\nperturbations. Similarly, in the second case, perturbations to the charged\nlepton mass matrix can generate large corrections to the mixing angles and\nphases of the PMNS matrix.

A variety of global\nphenomena, from innovation adoption to the emergence of social norms and\npolitical movements, arise as a result of people following a simple local rule,\nsuch as copy what others are doing. However, individuals often lack global\nknowledge of the behaviors of others and must estimate them from the\nobservations of their friends' behaviors. In some cases, the structure of the\nunderlying social network can dramatically skew an individual's local\nobservations, making a behavior appear far more common locally than it is\nglobally. We trace the origins of this phenomenon, which we call \"the majority\nillusion,\" to the friendship paradox in social networks. As a result of this\nparadox, a behavior that is globally rare may be systematically overrepresented\nin the local neighborhoods of many people, i.e., among their friends. Thus, the\n\"majority illusion\" may facilitate the spread of social contagions in networks\nand also explain why systematic biases in social perceptions, for example, of\nrisky behavior, arise. Using synthetic and real-world networks, we explore how\nthe \"majority illusion\" depends on network structure and develop a statistical\nmodel to calculate its magnitude in a network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 18:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The\nshear bands relax during annealing below the glass transition temperature and\nthe diffusion enhancement reveals unexpectedly a non-monotonous behavior. The\ndevelopment of shear bands and the subsequent relaxation of stresses after\nswitching off the shearing are characterized on microscopic to mesoscopic\nlength scales by MD simulation subjecting the model glass to a constant strain\nrate. Mean-squared displacements as well as strain maps indicate that the\nheterogeneity, as manifested by shear bands in the systems under shear, persist\nafter the shear is switched off.

We parameterize the S matrix in terms of ?, which is the\ndisplacement of the the classical motion of an electron in the laser field.\nWhen ? = 0, the S matrix is singular, which we attribute to be forward Coulomb\nscattering without absorption of light quanta. By devising a regularization\nscheme, the resulting S matrix is non-singular when ? = 0, and the origins of\nVLES and LES are revealed. We attribute VLES to multiple forward scattering of\nnear-threshold electrons by the Coulomb potential, with no absorption of light\nquanta, signifying the role of the Coulomb threshold effect. We attribute LES\nto be due to the combined role of the Coulomb threshold effect and rescattering\nin the forward direction by the Coulomb potential with the absorption of light\nquanta.

The overall\nmorphology and spectral properties of the SNR suggest that the PWN has\nundergone an asymmetric interaction with the SNR reverse shock (RS) that can\noccur as a result of a density gradient in the ambient medium and/or a moving\npulsar that displaces the PWN from the center of the remnant.

The recently proposed\nconsensus Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the\ndata and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel (Scott et\nal, 2013). A fixed aggregation function then combines these samples, yielding\napproximate posterior samples. We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo\n(VCMC), a variational Bayes algorithm that optimizes over aggregation functions\nto obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The\nresulting objective contains an intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a\nrelaxation of the objective and show that the relaxed problem is blockwise\nconcave under mild conditions. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on\nthree inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior\nquality of the posterior approximation and the moderate overhead of the\noptimization step. Our algorithm achieves a relative error reduction (measured\nagainst serial MCMC) of up to 39% compared to consensus Monte Carlo on the task\nof estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations;\nsimilarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92% on the task of estimating\ncluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8\ncomponents in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come at moderate cost\ncompared to the runtime of serial MCMC, achieving near-ideal speedup in some\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 20:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Whether such a dependence\nexists at higher redshifts, and whether the resulting M-Z-SFR relation is\nredshift invariant, is debated. We re-examine these issues by applying the\nnon-parametric techniques of Salim et al. (2014) to ~130 $z\\sim2.3$ galaxies\nwith N2 and O3 measurements from KBSS (Steidel et al. 2014). We find that the\nKBSS M-Z relation depends on SSFR at intermediate masses, where such dependence\nexists locally. KBSS and SDSS galaxies of the same mass and SSFR (\"local\nanalogs\") are similarly offset in the BPT diagram relative to the bulk of local\nstar-forming galaxies, and thus we posit that metallicities can be compared\nself-consistently at different redshifts as long as the masses and SSFRs of the\ngalaxies are similar. We find that the M-Z-SFR relation of $z\\sim2$ galaxies is\nconsistent with the local one at $\\log M_*<10$, but is offset up to -0.25 dex\nat higher masses, so it is altogether not redshift invariant. This high-mass\noffset could arise from a bias that high-redshift spectroscopic surveys have\nagainst high-metallicity galaxies, but additional evidence disfavors this\npossibility. We identify three causes for the reported discrepancy between N2\nand O3N2 metallicities at $z\\sim2$: (1) a smaller offset that is also present\nfor SDSS galaxies, which we remove with new N2 calibration, (2) a genuine\noffset due to differing ISM condition, which is also present in local analogs,\n(3) an additional offset due to unrecognized AGN contamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 20:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We use HST\ngrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields,\nmore than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these\ndata with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a\npopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, using\nK-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0<z<2.5. They have a median\nNII/Halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with SFR(tot)/SFR(Halpha)~10, and\nhave a large range of observed line widths. We infer from the kinematics and\nspatial distribution of Halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized\ngas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By\ncombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are\nconsistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc to\nV_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is\ndominated by the dense stellar component. Next, we study the size and mass\nevolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. Even though\nindividual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compaction\nand mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed a\nsimple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(log\nM_stars). This mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within a\nfixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density or\nvelocity dispersion threshold. As shown in other studies, the mode of growth\nchanges after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steep\ntrack in the size-mass plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 20:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 18:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 21:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 00:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Lack of evidence for supersymmetry at the LHC instigated recent\ninterest in non-supersymmetric heterotic-string vacua. We explore what may be\nlearned in this context from the quasi--realistic free fermionic models. We\nshow that constructions with a low number of families give rise to\nproliferation of a priori tachyon producing sectors, compared to the\nnon--realistic examples, which typically may contain only one such sector. The\nreason being that in the realistic cases the internal six dimensional space is\nfragmented into smaller units. We present one example of a quasi--realistic,\nnon--supersymmetric, non--tachyonic, heterotic--string vacuum and compare the\nstructure of its massless spectrum to the corresponding supersymmetric vacuum.\nWhile in some sectors supersymmetry is broken explicitly, i.e. the bosonic and\nfermionic sectors produce massless and massive states, other sectors, and in\nparticular those leading to the chiral families, continue to exhibit fermi-bose\ndegeneracy. In these sectors the massless spectrum, as compared to the\nsupersymmetric cases, will only differ in some local or global U(1) charges. We\ndiscuss the conditions for obtaining $n_b=n_f$ at the massless level in these\nmodels. Our example model contains an anomalous U(1) symmetry, which generates\na tadpole diagram at one loop-order in string perturbation theory. We speculate\nthat this tadpole diagram may cancel the corresponding diagram generated by the\none-loop non-vanishing vacuum energy and that in this respect the\nsupersymmetric and non-supersymmetric vacua should be regarded on equal\nfooting.

In March 2012, the most significant neutrino alert\nduring the first three years of operation was issued by IceCube. In the\nfollow-up observations performed by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), a Type\nIIn supernova (SN) PTF12csy was found $0.2^\\circ$ away from the neutrino alert\ndirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\\circ$. It has a redshift of\n$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \\,\n\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and the Pan-STARRS1 survey shows that its explosion time was at\nleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that a\ncausal connection is unlikely. The a posteriori significance of the chance\ndetection of both the neutrinos and the SN at any epoch is $2.2 \\, \\sigma$\nwithin IceCube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. Also, a complementary\nneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.\nTherefore, we consider the SN detection coincidental and the neutrinos\nuncorrelated to the SN. However, the SN is unusual and interesting by itself:\nIt is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the SN IIn 2010jl,\nand shows signs of interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense circumstellar\nmedium. High-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shock\nacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific SN. In this\npaper, we describe the SN PTF12csy and present both the neutrino and\nelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 21:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 19:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-16"}

In this paper, we provide\na novel approach to study the traffic statics and dynamics in a signalized\ndouble-ring network, which can provide insights into the operation of more\ngeneral signalized traffic networks. Under the framework of the link queue\nmodel (LQM) and the assumption of a triangular traffic flow fundamental\ndiagram, the signalized double-ring network is studied as a switched affine\nsystem. Due to periodic signal regulations, periodic density evolution orbits\nare formed and defined as stationary states. A Poincar\\'{e} map approach is\nintroduced to analyze the properties of such stationary states. With short\ncycle lengths, closed-form Poincar\\'{e} maps are derived. Stationary states and\ntheir stability properties are obtained by finding and analyzing the fixed\npoints on the Poincar\\'{e} maps. It is found that a stationary state can be\nasymptotically stable, Lyapunov stable, or unstable. The impacts of retaining\nratios and initial densities on the macroscopic fundamental diagrams (MFDs) and\nthe gridlock times are analyzed. Multivaluedness and gridlock phenomena as well\nas the unstable branch with non-zero average network flow-rates are observed on\nthe MFDs. With long cycle lengths, fixed points on the Poincar\\'{e} maps are\nsolved numerically, and the obtained stationary states and the MFDs are very\nsimilar to those with short cycle lengths.\n  Compared with earlier studies, this paper provides an analytical framework\nthat can be used to provide complete and closed-form solutions to the statics\nand dynamics of double-ring networks. This can lead to a better understanding\nof how the combination of signalized intersections and turning maneuvers is\nexpected to impact network properties, like the MFD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 22:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For comparison, we have also analyzed two\nsimilarly-aged, ejecta-dominated SNRs: Tycho's SNR, thought to be the remnant\nof a typical Type Ia SN, and SNR 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud,\nthought to be the remnant of an overluminous Type Ia SN. By simply comparing\nthe X-ray spectra, we find that line intensity ratios of iron-group elements\n(IGE) to intermediate-mass elements (IME) for Kepler's SNR and SNR 0509-67.5\nare much higher than those for Tycho's SNR. We therefore argue that Kepler is\nthe product of an overluminous Type Ia SN. This inference is supported by our\nspectral modeling, which reveals the IGE and IME masses respectively to be\n~0.95 M_sun and ~0.12 M_sun (Kepler's SNR), ~0.75 M_sun and ~0.34 M_sun (SNR\n0509-67.5), and ~0.35 M_sun and ~0.70 M_sun (Tycho's SNR). We find that the CSM\ncomponent in Kepler's SNR consists of tenuous diffuse gas (~0.3 M_sun) present\nthroughout the entire remnant, plus dense knots (~0.035 M_sun). Both of these\ncomponents have an elevated N abundance (N/H ~ 4 times the solar value),\nsuggesting that they originate from CNO-processed material from the progenitor\nsystem. The mass of the diffuse CSM allows us to infer the pre-SN mass-loss\nrate to be ~1.5e-5 (V_w/10 km/s) M_sun/yr, in general agreement with results\nfrom recent hydrodynamical simulations. Since the dense knots have slow proper\nmotions and relatively small ionization timescales, they were likely located a\nfew pc away from the progenitor system. Therefore, we argue that Kepler's SN\nwas an overluminous event that started to interact with massive CSM a few\nhundred years after the explosion.

New MESA capabilities in fully\ncoupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow\nMESA to accurately simulate advanced burning stages needed to construct\nsupernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be\ntreated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from\npre-main sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis\nfrom the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation\ninstrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for\nmassive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology\ndata. We improve treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust\nnear-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates\n\"on-the-fly\" from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion\ninduced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars.

DRAM reads a whole row\nsimultaneously from the cell array to a row buffer, but can transfer only a\nfraction of the data from the row buffer to peripheral IO circuit, through a\nlimited and expensive set of wires referred to as global bitlines. In presence\nof wider memory channels, the major bottleneck becomes the limited data\ntransfer capacity through these global bitlines. Our goal in this work is to\nenable higher bandwidth in 3D-stacked DRAM without the increased cost of adding\nmore global bitlines. We instead exploit otherwise-idle resources, such as\nglobal bitlines, already existing within the multiple DRAM layers by accessing\nthe layers simultaneously. Our architecture, Simultaneous Multi Layer Access\n(SMLA), provides higher bandwidth by aggregating the internal bandwidth of\nmultiple layers and transferring the available data at a higher IO frequency.\n  To implement SMLA, simultaneous data transfer from multiple layers through\nthe same IO TSVs requires coordination between layers to avoid channel\nconflict. We first study coordination by static partitioning, which we call\nDedicated-IO, that assigns groups of TSVs to each layer. We then provide a\nsimple, yet sophisticated mechanism, called Cascaded-IO, which enables\nsimultaneous access to each layer by time-multiplexing the IOs.

A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly\nparallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets\nand runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior\ndraws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final\napproximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation\naccuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new\nEP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems. The new algorithm applies\nrandom partition trees to combine the subset posterior draws, which is\ndistribution-free, easy to resample from and can adapt to multiple scales. We\nprovide theoretical justification and extensive experiments illustrating\nempirical performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 05:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 18:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

As disc fragmentation results in the formation of several bodies\nat comparable distances to the host star, their orbits are generally unstable.\nHere, we study the dynamical evolution of these objects. We set up the initial\nconditions based on the outcomes of the SPH simulations of Stamatellos &\nWhitworth, and for comparison we also study the evolution of systems resulting\nfrom lower-mass fragmenting discs. We refer to these two sets of simulations as\nset 1 and set 2. At 10 Myr, approximately half of the host stars have one\ncompanion left, and approximately 22% (set 1) to 9.8% (set 2) of the host stars\nare single. Systems with multiple secondaries in relatively stable\nconfigurations are common (about 30% and 44%, respectively). The majority of\nthe companions are ejected within 1 Myr with velocities mostly below 5 km/s,\nwith some runaway escapers with velocities over 30 km/s. About 6% (set 1) and\n2% (set 2) of the companions pair up into very low-mass binary systems. The\nmajority of these pairs escape as very low-mass binaries, while others remain\nbound to the host star in hierarchical configurations (often with retrograde\ninner orbits). Physical collisions with the host star (0.43 and 0.18 events per\nhost star for set 1 and set 2) and between companions (0.08 and 0.04 events per\nhost star for set 1 and set 2) are relatively common and their frequency\nincreases with increasing disc mass. Our study predicts observable properties\nof very low-mass binaries, low-mass hierarchical systems, the brown dwarf\ndesert, and free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects in and near\nyoung stellar groupings, which can be used to distinguish between different\nformation scenarios of very low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 06:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In the field theory, the R\\'enyi entropy is\nencoded in the CFT partition function on $n$-sheeted torus connected with each\nother by a large branch cut. As proposed by Chen and Wu [Large interval limit\nof R\\'enyi entropy at high temperature, arXiv:1412.0763], the effective way to\nread the entropy in the large interval limit is to insert a complete set of\nstate bases of the twist sector at the branch cut. Then the calculation\ntransforms into an expansion of four-point functions in the twist sector with\nrespect to $e^{-\\frac{2\\pi TR}{n}}$. By using the operator product expansion of\nthe twist operators at the branch points, we read the first few terms of the\nR\\'enyi entropy, including the leading and next-to-leading contributions in the\nlarge central charge limit.

However, understanding how multiplicative corruptions\nprevent overfitting has been difficult due to the complexity of a DNN's\nfunctional form. In this paper, we show that when a Gaussian prior is placed on\na DNN's weights, applying multiplicative noise induces a Gaussian scale\nmixture, which can be reparameterized to circumvent the problematic likelihood\nfunction. Analysis can then proceed by using a type-II maximum likelihood\nprocedure to derive a closed-form expression revealing how regularization\nevolves as a function of the network's weights. Results show that\nmultiplicative noise forces weights to become either sparse or invariant to\nrescaling. We find our analysis has implications for model compression as it\nnaturally reveals a weight pruning rule that starkly contrasts with the\ncommonly used signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While the SNR prunes weights with\nlarge variances, seeing them as noisy, our approach recognizes their robustness\nand retains them. We empirically demonstrate our approach has a strong\nadvantage over the SNR heuristic and is competitive to retraining with soft\ntargets produced from a teacher model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 08:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In a simple discrete model, the standard map, we tackle the\nproblem of chaotic orbit determination when observations extend beyond the\npredictability horizon. If the orbit is hyperbolic, a shadowing orbit is\ncomputed by the least squares orbit determination. We test both the convergence\nof the orbit determination iterative procedure and the behaviour of the\nuncertainties as a function of the maximum number $n$ of map iterations\nobserved. When the initial conditions belong to a chaotic orbit, the orbit\ndetermination is made impossible by numerical instability beyond a\ncomputability horizon, which can be approximately predicted by a simple\nformula. Moreover, the uncertainty of the results is sharply increased if a\ndynamical parameter is added to the initial conditions as parameter to be\nestimated. The uncertainty of the dynamical parameter decreases like $n^a$ with\n$a<0$ but not large (of the order of unity). If only the initial conditions are\nestimated, their uncertainty decreases exponentially with $n$. If they belong\nto a non-chaotic orbit the computational horizon is much larger, if it exists\nat all, and the decrease of the uncertainty is polynomial in all parameters,\nlike $n^a$ with $a\\simeq 1/2$. The Shadowing Lemma does not dictate what the\nasymptotic behaviour of the uncertainties should be. These phenomena have\nsignificant implications, which remain to be studied, in practical problems of\norbit determination involving chaos, such as the chaotic rotation state of a\ncelestial body and a chaotic orbit of a planet-crossing asteroid undergoing\nmany close approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 09:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The matrix\n$S(\\mathscr{C})$ is a symmetric matrix, its entries are cyclotomic integers and\nthe matrix $(\\dim \\mathscr{C})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot S(\\mathscr{C})$ is a unitary\nmatrix. Here $\\dim \\mathscr{C}\\in k$ denotes the categorical dimension of\n$\\mathscr{C}$ and it is a totally positive cyclotomic integer. Now suppose that\nwe also have a modular autoequivalence $F:\\mathscr{C}\\to \\mathscr{C}$. In this\npaper, we will define and study the notion of a crossed S-matrix associated\nwith the modular autoequivalence $F$. We will see that the crossed S-matrix\noccurs as a submatrix of the usual S-matrix of some \"bigger\" modular category\nand hence the entries of a crossed S-matrix are also cyclotomic integers.

The motivation for most of our\nresults comes from the theory of character sheaves on algebraic groups, where\nwe expect that the transition matrices between irreducible characters and\ncharacter sheaves can be obtained as certain crossed S-matrices. In the\ncharacter theory of algebraic groups defined over finite fields, there is the\nnotion of Shintani descent of Frobenius stable characters.

This 'pitch\nangle problem' is explored using local numerical mean-field dynamo solutions as\nwell as asymptotic analytical solutions.

In this\npaper, we extend the Smart Sampling Kalman Filter (S2KF) with a new point\nsymmetric Gaussian sampling scheme. This not only improves the S2KF's\nestimation quality, but also reduces the time needed to compute the required\noptimal Gaussian samples drastically. Moreover, we improve the numerical\nstability of the sample computation, which allows us to accurately approximate\na thousand-dimensional Gaussian distribution using tens of thousands of\noptimally placed samples. We evaluate the new symmetric S2KF by computing\nhigher-order moments of standard normal distributions and investigate the\nestimation quality of the S2KF when dealing with symmetric measurement\nequations. Finally, extended object tracking based on many measurements per\ntime step is considered. This high-dimensional estimation problem shows the\nadvantage of the S2KF being able to use an arbitrary number of samples\nindependent of the state dimension, in contrast to other state-of-the-art\nsample-based Kalman Filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 11:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

These sources are ultimate for\nproduction of polarized positrons necessary for future linear colliders ILC,\nCLIC. We developed a novel method for evaluating the energy spectrum of\nelectrons emitting the undulator- and the inverse Compton radiation. The method\nbased on Poisson weighted superposition of electron states is applicable for\nwhole range of the emission intensity per electron pass through the driving\nforce, from much less than unity emitted photons (Compton sources) to many\nphotons emitted (undulators), and for any energy of the photons. The method\nallows for account contributions in the energy spread both from the Poisson\nstatistics and diffusion due to recoils. The theoretical results were confirmed\nby simulations. The electron energy spectrum was used for evaluation of the\non-axis density of photons and their coherency making use of the\n`carrier--envelope' presentation for the emitting photons. The evaluated\nmaximum coherency degree of single--electron radiation is evaluated to be\nproportional to the undulator spatial period and inversely to the energy of\nelectrons, the number of coherently emitted undulator periods almost\nindependent of the undulator deflection parameter. The results of our study are\napplicable both for the classical limit of classical undulator and for the\nquantum limit of Compton gamma--ray sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 11:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 11:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

Recent observations\nsuggest that many flaring disks have gaps, whereas flat disks are thought to be\ngapless. The different groups of objects can be expected to have different\nstructural signatures in high-angular-resolution data. Over the past 10 years,\nthe MIDI instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer has collected\nobservations of several tens of protoplanetary disks. We model the large set of\nobservations with simple geometric models. A population of radiative-transfer\nmodels is synthesized for interpreting the mid-infrared signatures. Objects\nwith similar luminosities show very different disk sizes in the mid-infrared.\nRestricting to the young objects of intermediate mass, we confirm that most\ngroup I disks are in agreement with being transitional. We find that several\ngroup II objects have mid-infrared sizes and colors overlapping with sources\nclassified as group I, transition disks. This suggests that these sources have\ngaps, which has been demonstrated for a subset of them. This may point to an\nintermediate population between gapless and transition disks. Flat disks with\ngaps are most likely descendants of flat disks without gaps. Gaps, potentially\nrelated to the formation of massive bodies, may therefore even develop in disks\nin a far stage of grain growth and settling. The evolutionary implications of\nthis new population could be twofold. Either gapped flat disks form a separate\npopulation of evolved disks, or some of them may further evolve into flaring\ndisks with large gaps. The latter transformation may be governed by the\ninteraction with a massive planet, carving a large gap and dynamically exciting\nthe grain population in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 12:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 14:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

This\nprocedure needs many evaluations of the regression function which is clearly\nprohibitive when a time-consuming solver is used for computing it. In this work\na meta-model relying on a Gaussian process emulator is proposed to replace this\nregression function. The new source of uncertainty due to this approximation\ncan be incorporated in the model which leads to what is called a mixed\nmeta-model. A control on the distance between the maximum likelihood estimates\nin this mixed meta-model and the maximum likelihood estimates obtained with the\nexact mixed model is guaranteed. Eventually, numerical simulations are\nperformed to illustrate the efficiency of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 14:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the\nproposal using an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the\ntrue posterior and the proposal distribution. The method is very flexible,\napplicable to any parameterized proposal distribution and it supports online\nand batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal\ndistributions with rich parameterizations based upon neural networks leading to\nNeural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (NASMC).

For both uplink and downlink, we derive\ntractable expressions for the achievable rate with zero-forcing receivers and\nprecoders respectively. To avoid high complexity joint optimization across the\nnetwork, we propose a scheduling mechanism for power allocation, where in a\nsingle time slot, only cells that do not interfere with each other adjust their\ntransmit powers. Based on this, corresponding transmit power allocation\nstrategies are derived, aimed at maximizing the sum rate per-cell. These\nschemes are shown to bring considerable gains over equal power allocation for\npractical antenna configurations (e.g., up to a few hundred). However, with\nfixed number of users (N), these gains diminish as M turns to infinity, and\nequal power allocation becomes optimal. A different conclusion is drawn for the\ncase where both M and N grow large together, in which case: (i) improved rates\nare achieved as M grows with fixed M/N ratio, and (ii) the relative gains over\nthe equal power allocation diminish as M/N grows. Moreover, we also provide\napplicable values of M/N under an acceptable power allocation gain threshold,\nwhich can be used as to determine when the proposed power allocation schemes\nyield appreciable gains, and when they do not. From the network point of view,\nthe proposed scheduling approach can achieve almost the same performance as the\njoint power allocation after one scheduling round, with much reduced\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

This paper proposes a\npossible structure of an asteroid interior that leads to such surface shedding\ndue to rapid rotation rates. A rubble pile asteroid is modeled as a spheroid\ncomposed of a surface shell and a concentric internal core, the entire assembly\ncalled the test body. The test body is assumed to be uniformly rotating around\na constant rotation axis. We also assume that while the bulk density and the\nfriction angle are constant, the cohesion of the surface shell is different\nfrom that of the internal core. First, developing an analytical model based on\nlimit analysis, we provide the upper and lower bounds for the actual surface\nshedding condition. Second, we use a Soft-Sphere Discrete Element Method\n(SSDEM) to study dynamical deformation of the test body due to a quasi-static\nspin-up. In this paper we show the consistency of both approaches.\nAdditionally, the SSDEM simulations show that the initial failure always occurs\nlocally and not globally. In addition, as the core becomes larger, the size of\nlofted components becomes smaller. These results imply that if there is a\nstrong enough core in a progenitor body, surface shedding is the most likely\nfailure mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

However, they can be linked by imposing the\nstability of the electroweak (EW) vacuum. The crucial ingredient is provided by\nthe generation of neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism triggered by Yukawa\ninteractions between the standard model (SM) Higgs and lepton doublets and\nadditional heavy right-handed neutrinos. These neutrinos participate to the\nrenormalization group (RG) running of the dimensionless SM couplings, affecting\ntheir high-energy behavior. The Higgs quartic coupling is dragged towards\nnegative values, thus altering the stability of the EW vacuum. In the usual\ntype-I seesaw model, this effect is too small to be a threat since, in order to\ncomply with low-energy neutrino data, one is forced to consider either too\nsmall Yukawa couplings or too heavy right-handed neutrinos. In this paper we\nexplore this general idea in the context of low-scale seesaw models. These\nmodels are characterized by sizable Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrinos\nwith mass of the order of the EW scale, thus maximizing their impact on the RG\nflow.

We\nhave conducted a 1446 hour survey for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at 145~MHz,\ncovering a total of 4193 sq. deg on the sky. We used the UK station of the\nLOFAR radio telescope -- the Rawlings Array -- , accompanied for a majority of\nthe time by the LOFAR station at Nan\\c{c}ay, observing the same fields at the\nsame frequency. Our real-time search backend, ARTEMIS, utilizes graphics\nprocessing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320\ncm$^{-3}$ pc. Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4~GHz, and\nfavoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous\ndetections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs\nabove a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper\nlimit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$\nfor 5~ms-duration pulses above 62~Jy. The non-detection could be due to\nscatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape\nof FRB flux density spectra.

Our\nresults suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequency\ncomponent of the Square Kilometre Array, will have better chances to detect,\nestimate rates and understand the origin and properties of FRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Our goal is to construct upper bound functions for the reach-avoid\nprobability by means of tractable convex optimization problems. We achieve this\nby restricting attention to the span of Gaussian radial basis functions and\nimposing structural assumptions on the transition kernel of the stochastic\nprocesses as well as the target and safe sets of the reach-avoid problem. In\nparticular, we require the kernel to be written as a Gaussian mixture density\nwith each mean of the distribution being affine in the current state and input\nand the target and safe sets to be written as intersections of quadratic\ninequalities. Taking advantage of these structural assumptions, we formulate a\nrecursion of semidefinite programs where each step provides an upper bound to\nthe value function of the reach- avoid problem. The upper bounds provide a\nperformance metric to which any suboptimal control policy can be compared, and\ncan themselves be used to construct suboptimal control policies. We illustrate\nvia numerical examples that even if the resulting bounds are conservative, the\nassociated control policies achieve higher reach-avoid probabilities than\nheuristic controllers for problems of large state-input space dimensions (more\nthan 20). The results presented in this paper, far exceed the limits of current\napproximation methods for reach-avoid problems in the specific class of\nstochastic systems considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

What makes this group anomaly\ndetection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset\nof features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is\nunknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this\nwork, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset\nof samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster.
