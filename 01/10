Specifically, we consider a\nLagrangian with a generic function of curvature invariants $f(R,\nR_{\\alpha\\beta}R^{\\alpha\\beta},\nR_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta})$. It is well known that\nwhen dealing with General Relativity such an approach provides massless\nspin-two waves as propagating degree of freedom of the gravitational field\nwhile this theory implies other additional propagating modes in the gravity\nspectra. We show that, in general, fourth order gravity, besides the standard\nmassless graviton is characterized by two further massive modes with a\nfinite-distance interaction. We find out the most general gravitational wave\nsolutions in terms of Green functions in vacuum and in presence of matter\nsources. If an electromagnetic source is chosen, only the modes induced by\n$R_{\\alpha\\beta}R^{\\alpha\\beta}$ are present, otherwise, for any $f(R)$ gravity\nmodel, we have the complete analogy with tensor modes of General Relativity.\nPolarizations and helicity states are classified in the hypothesis of plane\nwave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 16:02:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 22:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

High angular resolution, high sensitivity, and polarization\ncapability enable us to perform a detailed study of the different constituents\nof the HII region. For the first time, we resolve three distinct regions at\nmicrowave frequencies, two of which are part of the same annular diffuse\nstructure. Our observations enable us to confirm the presence of anomalous\nmicrowave emission (AME) from RCW175. Fitting the integrated flux density\nacross the entire region with the currently available spinning dust models,\nusing physically motivated assumptions, indicates the presence of at least two\nspinning dust components: a warm component with a relatively large hydrogen\nnumber density n_H=26.3/cm^3 and a cold component with a hydrogen number\ndensity of n_H=150/cm^3. The present study is an example highlighting the\npotential of using high angular-resolution microwave data to break model\nparameter degeneracies. Thanks to our spectral coverage and angular resolution,\nwe have been able to derive one of the first AME maps, at 13.5GHz, showing\nclear evidence that the bulk of the AME arises in particular from one of the\nsource components, with some additional contribution from the diffuse\nstructure.

Using parameters closely mimicking previous Zeeman deceleration\nexperiments, this approach reveals a hitherto unconsidered velocity dependence\nof the phase stability which we ascribe to the finite rise and fall times of\nthe current pulses that generate the magnetic fields inside the deceleration\ncoils. It is shown that changing the current switch-off times as the sequence\nprogresses, so as to maintain a constant mean acceleration per pulse, can lead\nto a constant phase stability and hence a beam with well-defined\ncharacteristics. We also find that the time overlap between fields of adjacent\ncoils has an influence on the phase-space acceptance. Previous theoretical and\nexperimental results suggested unfilled regions in phase space that influence\nparticle transmission through the decelerator. Our model provides, for the\nfirst time, a means to directly identify the origin of these effects due to\ncoupling between longitudinal and transverse dynamics. Since optimum phase\nstability is restricted to a rather small parameter range in terms of the\nreduced position of the synchronous particle, only a limited range of final\nvelocities can be attained using a given number of coils. We evaluate phase\nstability for different Zeeman deceleration sequences, and, by comparison with\nnumerical three-dimensional particle trajectory simulations, we demonstrate\nthat our model provides a valuable tool to find optimum parameter sets for\nimproved Zeeman deceleration schemes. An acceleration-deceleration scheme is\nshown to be a useful approach to generating beams with well-defined properties\nfor variable-energy collision experiments.

Variable flux modulated with the\norbital period of ~26.5 d has been detected from radio to very high-energy\ngamma rays. In addition, the system presents a superorbital variability of the\nphase and amplitude of the radio outburst with a period of ~4.6 yr. We present\noptical photometric observations of LS I +61 303 spanning ~1.5 yr and\ncontemporaneous Halpha equivalent width (EW Halpha) data. The optical\nphotometry shows, for the first time, that the known orbital modulation suffers\na positive orbital phase shift and an increase in flux for data obtained 1-yr\napart. This behavior is similar to that already known at radio wavelengths,\nindicating that the optical flux follows the superorbital variability as well.\nThe orbital modulation of the EW Halpha presents the already known superorbital\nflux variability but shows, also for the first time, a positive orbital phase\nshift. In addition, the optical photometry exhibits a lag of ~0.1-0.2 in\norbital phase with respect to the EW Halpha measurements at similar\nsuperorbital phases, and presents a lag of ~0.1 and ~0.3 orbital phases with\nrespect noncontemperaneous radio and X-ray outbursts, respectively. The phase\nshifts detected in the orbital modulation of thermal indicators, such as the\noptical flux and the EW Halpha, are in line with the observed behavior for\nnonthermal indicators, such as X-ray or radio emission. This shows that there\nis a strong coupling between the thermal and nonthermal emission processes in\nthe gamma-ray binary LS I +61 303.

In order to overcome this obstacle,\nhybrid network architectures are being considered where mm-wave small cells can\nexploit an overlay coverage layer based on legacy technology. The additional\nmm-wave layer can also take advantage of a functional split between control and\nuser plane, that allows to delegate most of the signaling functions to legacy\nbase stations and to gather context information from users for resource\noptimization. However, mm-wave technology requires high gain antenna systems to\ncompensate for high path loss and limited power, e.g., through the use of\nmultiple antennas for high directivity.

We introduce a simple prescription for\nradial migration that preserves the overall profile of the disc while allowing\nindividual stars to migrate throughout the disc. Our models explicitly consider\nthe thin and thick discs as two distinct components separated in age.\n  We show how an EDF can be used to incorporate realistic selection functions\nin models, and to construct mock catalogues of observed samples.

Several studies have\nfound that radiative transfer models that successfully explain the optical\nextinction in edge-on spiral galaxies generally underestimate the observed\nFIR/submm fluxes by a factor of about three. In order to investigate this\nso-called dust energy balance problem, we use two Milky Way-like galaxies\nproduced by high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. We create mock optical\nedge-on views of these simulated galaxies (using the radiative transfer code\nSKIRT), and we then fit the parameters of a basic spiral galaxy model to these\nimages (using the fitting code FitSKIRT). The basic model includes smooth\naxisymmetric distributions along a S\\'ersic bulge and exponential disc for the\nstars, and a second exponential disc for the dust. We find that the dust mass\nrecovered by the fitted models is about three times smaller than the known dust\nmass of the hydrodynamical input models. This factor is in agreement with\nprevious energy balance studies of real edge-on spiral galaxies. On the other\nhand, fitting the same basic model to less complex input models (e.g. a smooth\nexponential disc with a spiral perturbation or with random clumps), does\nrecover the dust mass of the input model almost perfectly. Thus it seems that\nthe complex asymmetries and the inhomogeneous structure of real and\nhydrodynamically simulated galaxies are a lot more efficient at hiding dust\nthan the rather contrived geometries in typical quasi-analytical models. This\neffect may help explain the discrepancy between the dust emission predicted by\nradiative transfer models and the observed emission in energy balance studies\nfor edge-on spiral galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 19:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

A laboratory experiment that\nwas set up a decade ago to find out whether the D$_1$ enigma is a problem of\nsolar physics or quantum physics revealed that the D$_1$ system has a rich\npolarization structure in situations where standard scattering theory predicts\nzero polarization, even when optical pumping of the $m$ state populations of\nthe hyperfine-split ground state is accounted for.

These trends are consistent with other\nobservations in the literature, yet, given the widespread use and acceptance of\n[OIII] as a temperature determinant, the magnitude of the T[OIII] discrepancies\nstill came as a surprise. Based on these results, we conduct a uniform\nabundance analysis using the temperatures derived from [SIII] and [NII], and\nreport the gas-phase abundance gradients for NGC628. Relative abundances of\nS/O, Ne/O, and Ar/O are constant across the galaxy, consistent with no\nsystematic change in the upper IMF over the sampled range in metallicity. These\nalpha-element ratios, along with N/O, all show small dispersions consistent\nwith no intrinsic dispersion (0.05) over 70% of the azimuthally averaged\nradius. We interpret these results as an indication that, at a given radius,\nthe interstellar medium in NGC628 is chemically well-mixed. Unlike the nearly\ntemperature-independent gradients, O/H abundances have a larger intrinsic\ndispersion of ~0.13 dex. We posit that this dispersion represents an upper\nlimit to the true dispersion in O/H at a given radius and that some of that\ndispersion is due to systematic uncertainties arising from temperature\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 21:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 06:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We have conducted a variability survey of $\\omega$ Cen in the NIR, using\nESO's 4.1m Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). This is\nthe first paper of a series describing our results.\n  $\\omega$ Cen was observed using VIRCAM mounted on VISTA. A total of 42 and\n100 epochs in $J$ and $K_{\\rm S}$, respectively, were obtained, distributed\nover a total timespan of 352 days. PSF photometry was performed, and periods of\nthe known variable stars were improved when necessary using an ANOVA analysis.\n  An unprecedented homogeneous and complete NIR catalogue of RR Lyrae stars in\nthe field of $\\omega$ Cen was collected, allowing us to study, for the first\ntime, all the RR Lyrae stars associated to the cluster, except 4 located far\naway from the cluster center. Membership status, subclassifications between\nRRab and RRc subtypes, periods, amplitudes, and mean magnitudes were derived\nfor all the stars in our sample. Additionally, 4 new RR Lyrae stars were\ndiscovered, 2 of them with high probability of being cluster members. The\ndistribution of $\\omega$ Cen stars in the Bailey (period-amplitude) diagram is\nalso discussed. Reference lines in this plane, for both Oosterhoff type I (OoI)\nand II (OoII) components, are provided.\n  In the present paper, we clarify the status of many (candidate) RR Lyrae\nstars that had been unclear in previous studies. This includes stars with\nanomalous positions in the color-magnitude diagram, uncertain periods or/and\nvariability types, and possible field interlopers. We conclude that $\\omega$\nCen hosts a total of 88 RRab and 101 RRc stars, for a grand total of 189 likely\nmembers. We confirm that most RRab stars in the cluster belong to an OoII\ncomponent, as previously found using visual data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 22:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Herein,\nwe describe fluid-structure interaction models of the aortic root, including\nthe aortic valve leaflets, the sinuses of Valsalva, the aortic annulus, and the\nsinotubular junction, that employ a version of Peskin's immersed boundary (IB)\nmethod with a finite element (FE) description of the structural elasticity. We\ndevelop both an idealized model of the root with three-fold symmetry of the\naortic sinuses and valve leaflets, and a more realistic model that accounts for\nthe differences in the sizes of the left, right, and noncoronary sinuses and\ncorresponding valve cusps. As in earlier work, we use fiber-based models of the\nvalve leaflets, but this study extends earlier IB models of the aortic root by\nemploying incompressible hyperelastic models of the mechanics of the sinuses\nand ascending aorta using a constitutive law fit to experimental data from\nhuman aortic root tissue. In vivo pressure loading is accounted for by a\nbackwards displacement method that determines the unloaded configurations of\nthe root models. Our models yield realistic cardiac output at physiological\npressures, with low transvalvular pressure differences during forward flow,\nminimal regurgitation during valve closure, and realistic pressure loads when\nthe valve is closed during diastole. Further, results from high-resolution\ncomputations demonstrate that IB models of the aortic valve are able to produce\nessentially grid-converged dynamics at practical grid spacings for the\nhigh-Reynolds number flows of the aortic root.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 23:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Turbulent and mean\nmeteorological data were continuously measured at multiple levels at four\ntowers deployed along the East lower slope (2-4 deg) of Granite Mountain. The\nmulti-level observations made during a 30-day long MATERHORN-Fall field\ncampaign in September-October 2012 allowed studying of temporal and spatial\nstructure of katabatic flows in detail, and herein we report turbulence and\ntheir variations in katabatic winds. Observed vertical profiles show steep\ngradients near the surface, but in the layer above the slope jet the vertical\nvariability is smaller. It is found that the vertical (normal to the slope)\nmomentum flux and horizontal (along the slope) heat flux in a slope-following\ncoordinate system change their sign below and above the wind maximum of a\nkatabatic flow. The vertical momentum flux is directed downward (upward)\nwhereas the horizontal heat flux is downslope (upslope) below (above) the wind\nmaximum. Our study therefore suggests that the position of the jet-speed\nmaximum can be obtained by linear interpolation between positive and negative\nvalues of the momentum flux (or the horizontal heat flux) to derive the height\nwhere flux becomes zero. It is shown that the standard deviations of all wind\nspeed components (therefore the turbulent kinetic energy) and the dissipation\nrate of turbulent kinetic energy have a local minimum, whereas the standard\ndeviation of air temperature has an absolute maximum at the height of\nwind-speed maximum. We report several cases where the vertical and horizontal\nheat fluxes are compensated. Turbulence above the wind-speed maximum is\ndecoupled from the surface, and follows the classical local z-less predictions\nfor stably stratified boundary layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 00:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-13"}

The obscuration of part of\nthe stellar disk during a transit will reveal aspects of its surface structure\nresulting from general centre-to-limb variations (CLVs). These become apparent\nwhen forming the ratio between the stellar light in and out of transit. These\nphenomena can be seen particularly clearly during the progress of a penumbral\nlunar eclipse, where the Earth transits the solar disk and masks different\nregions of the solar disk as the eclipse progresses. When inferring the\nproperties of the planetary atmosphere, it is essential that this effect\noriginating at the star is properly accounted for. Using the data observed from\nthe 2014-April-15 lunar eclipse with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph mounted on the\nCanada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), we have obtained for the first time a\ntime sequence of the penumbral spectra. These penumbral spectra enable us to\nstudy the centre-to-limb variations of solar Fraunhofer lines when the Earth is\ntransiting Sun. The Na i and Ca ii absorption features reported from previous\nlunar eclipse observations are demonstrated to be CLV features, which dominate\nthe corresponding line profiles and mask possible planetary signal. Detecting\natmospheric species in exoplanets via transit spectroscopy must account for the\nCLV effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 03:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

The grand partition function has been completely integrated in the\nphase-space of the collective variables. The basic density measure is the\nquartic one. It has the form of the exponent function with the first, second,\nthird and fourth degree of the collective variables. The problem has been\nreduced to the Ising model in an external field, the role of which is played by\nthe generalised chemical potential $\\mu^*$. The line $\\mu^*(\\eta) =0$, where\n$\\eta$ is the density, is the line of the phase transition. We consider the\nisothermal compression of the gas till the point where the phase transition on\nthe line $\\mu^*(\\eta) =0$ is reached. When the path of the pressing reaches the\nline $\\mu^* =0$ in the gas medium, a droplet of liquid springs up. The work for\nits formation is obtained, the surface-tension energy is calculated. On the\nline $\\mu^* =0$ we have a two-phase system: the gas and the liquid (the\ndroplet) one. The equality of the gas and of the liquid chemical potentials is\nproved. The process of pressing is going on. But the pressure inside the system\nhas stopped, two fixed densities have arisen: one for the gas-phase $\\eta_{g} =\n\\eta_{c} ( 1 - {d}/{2})$ and the other for the liquid-phase $\\eta_{l} =\n\\eta_{c} (1 + {d}/{2} )$ (symmetrically to the rectlinear diameter), where\n$\\eta_{c} = 0.13044$ is the critical density. Starting from that moment the\nexternal pressure works as a latent work of pressure. Its value is obtained. As\na result, the gas-phase disappears and the whole system turns into liquid. The\njump of the density is equal to $\\eta_{c} d$, where $d = \\sqrt{{D}/{2G}} \\sim\n\\tau^{\\nu/2}$. $D$ and $G$ are coefficients of the Hamiltonian in the last cell\nconnected with the renormalisation-group symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 10:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

We demonstrate that the major radii and the radial mode indices play\nan important role in tailoring the $GVD$ of WGM resonators.

However, measurement traces from real-world production\nenvironment show that the duration of tasks within a job vary widely. The\noverall elapsed time of a job, i.e. the so-called flowtime, is often dictated\nby one or few slowly-running tasks within a job, generally referred as the\n\"stragglers\". The cause of stragglers include tasks running on\npartially/intermittently failing machines or the existence of some localized\nresource bottleneck(s) within a MapReduce cluster. To tackle this online job\nscheduling challenge, we adopt the task cloning approach and design the\ncorresponding scheduling algorithms which aim at minimizing the weighted sum of\njob flowtimes in a MapReduce cluster based on the Shortest Remaining Processing\nTime scheduler (SRPT). To be more specific, we first design a 2-competitive\noffline algorithm when the variance of task-duration is negligible. We then\nextend this offline algorithm to yield the so-called SRPTMS+C algorithm for the\nonline case and show that SRPTMS+C is $(1+\\epsilon)-speed$\n$o(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})-competitive$ in reducing the weighted sum of job\nflowtimes within a cluster. Both of the algorithms explicitly consider the\nprecedence constraints between the two phases within the MapReduce framework.\nWe also demonstrate via trace-driven simulations that SRPTMS+C can\nsignificantly reduce the weighted/unweighted sum of job flowtimes by cutting\ndown the elapsed time of small jobs substantially. In particular, SRPTMS+C\nbeats the Microsoft Mantri scheme by nearly 25% according to this metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jan 2015 10:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

The\nsimulated wave packet is discretized on a spatial grid and the grid points are\nmapped on the ion motional states which define the qubit network. The\nlocalization probability at each grid point is obtained from the population in\nthe corresponding motional state. The quantum gate is the elementary evolution\noperator corresponding to the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation of the\nsimulated system. The corresponding matrix can be estimated by any numerical\nalgorithm. The radio-frequency field able to drive this unitary transformation\namong the qubit states of the ion is obtained by multi-target optimal control\ntheory. The ion is assumed to be cooled in the ground motional state and the\npreliminary step consists in initializing the qubits with the amplitudes of the\ninitial simulated wave packet. The time evolution of the localization\nprobability at the grids points is then obtained by successive applications of\nthe gate and reading out the motional state population. The gate field is\nalways identical for a given simulated potential, only the field preparing the\ninitial wave packet has to be optimized for different simulations.

Through the observation of the negative\nparts of the Wigner distribution of the post-selected atomic cat state, we find\nthat the post-selected atomic cat state becomes more nonclassical when the\npost-selected polarization state of the single photon field tends toward\nbecoming orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We show that the small phase\nshift in the post-selected atomic cat state can be amplified via measuring the\npeak shift of its phase distribution when the post-selected state of the single\nphoton field is nearly orthogonal to its pre-selected state. We find that the\namplification factor of 15 [5] can be obtained for a sample of 10 [100] atoms.\nThis effectively provides us with a method to discriminate two close lying\nstates on the Bloch sphere.

This prompt pulse ultimately produces a\nsignal, which can be highly problematic for a subset of instruments and\nmeasurements due to the time-correlated properties, and different to that from\nreactor sources. Measurements of this background have been made at both SNS\n(ORNL, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) and SINQ (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland).

We explore this old\nquestion from a modern viewpoint, taking into account linear algebra, shape\ntheory, numerical analysis, random matrix theory, the Hopf fibration, and much\nmuch more. One of the best distributions of random triangles takes all six\nvertex coordinates as independent standard Gaussians. Six can be reduced to\nfour by translation of the center to $(0,0)$ or reformulation as a 2x2 matrix\nproblem.\n  In this note, we develop shape theory in its historical context for a wide\naudience. We hope to encourage other to look again (and differently) at\ntriangles.\n  We provide a new constructive proof, using the geometry of parallelians, of a\ncentral result of shape theory: Triangle shapes naturally fall on a hemisphere.\nWe give several proofs of the key random result: that triangles are uniformly\ndistributed when the normal distribution is transferred to the hemisphere. A\nnew proof connects to the distribution of random condition numbers.\nGeneralizing to higher dimensions, we obtain the \"square root ellipticity\nstatistic\" of random matrix theory.\n  Another proof connects the Hopf map to the SVD of 2 by 2 matrices. A new\ntheorem describes three similar triangles hidden in the hemisphere. Many\ntriangle properties are reformulated as matrix theorems, providing insight to\nboth. This paper argues for a shift of viewpoint to the modern approaches of\nrandom matrix theory. As one example, we propose that the smallest singular\nvalue is an effective test for uniformity.
