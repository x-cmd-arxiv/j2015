The purpose of this paper is to\ndevelop Mallat's theory further by allowing for different and, most\nimportantly, general semi-discrete frames (such as, e.g., Gabor frames,\nwavelets, curvelets, shearlets, ridgelets) in distinct network layers. This\nallows to extract wider classes of features than point singularities resolved\nby the wavelet transform. Our generalized feature extractor is proven to be\ntranslation-invariant, and we develop deformation stability results for a\nlarger class of deformations than those considered by Mallat. For Mallat's\nwavelet-based feature extractor, we get rid of a number of technical\nconditions.

This work proposes three linear precoding\nstrategies, formulated in such a way that the achievable DoF can be derived as\na function of the transmission delay, thus elucidating its achievable DoF-delay\ntrade-off. All strategies are based on the concept of interference alignment,\nand built upon three main ingredients: delayed CSIT precoding, user scheduling,\nand redundancy transmission. In this respect, the interference alignment is\nrealized by exploiting delayed CSIT in order to align the interference at the\nnon-intended receivers along the space-time domain. Finally, the latter part of\nthis work settles that all the proposed strategies work also for constant\nchannels, except for SISO.

We first propose to improve the\npopular dense trajectory features by explicit camera motion estimation. More\nspecifically, we extract feature point matches between frames using SURF\ndescriptors and dense optical flow. The matches are used to estimate a\nhomography with RANSAC. To improve the robustness of homography estimation, a\nhuman detector is employed to remove outlier matches from the human body as\nhuman motion is not constrained by the camera. Trajectories consistent with the\nhomography are considered as due to camera motion, and thus removed. We also\nuse the homography to cancel out camera motion from the optical flow. This\nresults in significant improvement on motion-based HOF and MBH descriptors.

Here,\nwe aim to study therefore, how local phase perturbations which may be caused by\nlocal power fluctuations, affect the AC grid stability. To this end, we start\nfrom nonlinear power balance equations and map them to complex linear wave\nequations, yielding stationary solutions with phases $\\varphi_i$ at generator\nand consumer sites $i$. Next, we study deviations from these stationary\nsolutions. Starting with an initially localized perturbation, it is found to\nspread in a periodic grid diffusively throughout the grid. We derive the\nparametric dependence of diffusion constant $D$. We apply the same solution\nstrategy to general grid topologies and analyse their stability against local\nperturbations. The perturbation remains either localized or becomes\ndelocalized, depending on grid topology, power capacity and distribution of\nconsumers and generators $P_i$. Delocalization is found to increase the\nlifetime of perturbations and thereby their influence on grid stability, while\nlocalization results in an exponentiallyfast decay of perturbations at all grid\nsites. These results may therefore lead to new strategies to control the\nstability of electricity grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 18:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 20:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 07:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}

We find that pairs of\nhost halos \"know about\" each others' assembly histories even when their\npresent-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either\nhalo. These distances are far too large for direct interaction between the\nhalos to explain the correlation in their dMvir/dt.

This splashback\nradius, $R_{sp}$, manifests itself as a sharp density drop in the halo\noutskirts, at a location that depends upon the mass accretion rate.

The extent of a halo and its\nassociated environmental effects can thus extend well beyond the conventionally\ndefined \"virial\" radius.

In particular, $M_{sp}$\nevolves significantly even for the smallest dwarf-sized halos at $z=0$.

During the\nearly stages of halo assembly, $M_{sp}$ and $M_{<4rs}$ evolve similarly, but in\nthe late stages $M_{<4rs}$ stops increasing while $M_{sp}$ continues to grow\nsignificantly. This illustrates that halos at low $z$ can have \"quiet\"\ninteriors while continuing to accrete mass in their outskirts.

Due to the low\nmeasured amplitude, the detection significance is moderate (~2$\\sigma$) and the\ndata are in tension with the theoretical prediction (~2-$2.5\\sigma$). The\ntension is reduced somewhat when compared to predictions using WMAP9\nparameters, for which we find $A_{2013}=0.56\\pm0.30$ and\n$A_{2015}=0.52\\pm0.26$. We consider various systematic effects, finding that\nphotometric redshift uncertainties, contamination by intrinsic alignments, and\neffects due to the masking of galaxy clusters in the Planck 2015 CMB lensing\nreconstruction are able to help resolve the tension at a significant level\n(~10% each). An overall multiplicative bias in the CFHTLenS shear data could\nalso play a role, which can be tested with existing data. We close with\nforecasts for measurements of this cross-correlation using ongoing and future\nweak lensing surveys, which will definitively test the significance of the\ntension in our results with respect to LCDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 22:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-05"}

These functions are ordered in terms of\ntheir degrees of smoothness with a higher-order function corresponding to\nlarger-scale features and a lower-order one corresponding to smaller-scale\ndetails, leading to a parsimonious representation for a nonstationary spatial\ncovariance function. Consequently, only a small to moderate number of functions\nare needed in a spatial random-effects model. The proposed class of basis\nfunctions has several advantages over commonly used ones. First, we do not need\nto concern about the allocation of the basis functions, but simply select the\ntotal number of functions corresponding to a resolution. Second, only a small\nnumber of basis functions is usually required, which facilitates computation.\nThird, estimation variability of model parameters can be considerably reduced,\nand hence more precise covariance function estimates can be obtained.

The key challenge is that,\neven in small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control\nproblems with continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality, and are\nintractable in general settings.

In the present work, four extensions are\nintroduced compared to our previous calculations: (i) going beyond the\nsoft-photon approximation (SPA) in the calculation of the bremsstrahlung\nprocesses $meson+meson\\to meson+meson+\\gamma$, (ii) quantifying the suppression\ndue to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) coherence effect, (iii) adding the\nadditional channels $V+N\\to N+\\gamma$ and $\\Delta\\to N+\\gamma$ and (iv)\nproviding predictions for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV.

Extremely reddened AGB stars lose mass at high rates of >10^-5\nMsun/yr. This is the very last stage of AGB evolution, in which stars in the\nmass range 2.0--4.0 Msun (for solar metallicity) should have been converted to\nC stars already. The extremely reddened AGB stars in the Galactic bulge are\nhowever predominantly O-rich, implying that they might be either low-mass stars\nor stars at the upper end of the AGB mass range. Aims. To determine the mass\nrange of the most reddened AGB stars in the Galactic bulge. Methods. Using\nVirtual Observatory tools, we constructed spectral energy distributions of a\nsample of 37 evolved stars in the Galactic bulge with extremely red IRAS\ncolours. We fitted DUSTY models to the observational data to infer the\nbolometric fluxes. Applying individual corrections for interstellar extinction\nand adopting a common distance, we determined luminosities and mass-loss rates,\nand inferred the progenitor mass range from comparisons with AGB evolutionary\nmodels. Results. The observed spectral energy distributions are consistent with\na classification as reddened AGB stars, except for two stars, which are\nproto-planetary nebula candidates. For the AGB stars, we found luminosities in\nthe range 3000--30,000 Lsun and mass-loss rates 10^-5--3x10^-4 Msun/yr. The\ncorresponding mass range is 1.1--6.0 Msun assuming solar metallicity.\nConclusions. Contrary to the predictions of the evolutionary models, the\nluminosity distribution is continuous, with many O-rich AGB stars in the mass\nrange in which they should have been converted into C stars already. We suspect\nthat bulge AGB stars have higher than solar metallicity and therefore may avoid\nthe conversion to C-rich. The presence of low-mass stars in the sample shows\nthat their termination of the AGB evolution also occurs during a final phase of\nvery high mass-loss rate, leading to optically thick circumstellar shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 09:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 11:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 21:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The noises can naturally be\nnon-Gaussian (skewed and/or heavy tailed) or to accommodate spurious\nobservations, noises can be modeled as heavy tailed. However, at the cost of\nsuch noise robustness, the performance may degrade when such spurious\nobservations are absent. Therefore, any inference engine should not only be\nrobust to noise outlier, but also be adaptive to potentially unknown and time\nvarying noise parameters; yet it should be scalable and easy to implement.\n  To address them, we envisage here a new noise adaptive Rao-Blackwellized\nparticle filter (RBPF), by leveraging a hierarchically Gaussian model as a\nproxy for any non-Gaussian (process or measurement) noise density. This leads\nto a conditionally linear Gaussian model (CLGM), that is tractable.

The lifetime of the flash is a\nfunction of the number of block erasures and can be as small as several\nthousands. To reduce the number of block erasures, pages, which are the\nsmallest write unit, are rewritten out-of-place in the memory. A Write-once\nmemory (WOM) code is a coding scheme which enables to write multiple times to\nthe block before an erasure. However, these codes come with significant rate\nloss. For example, the rate for writing twice (with the same rate) is at most\n0.77.\n  In this paper, we study WOM codes and their tradeoff between rate loss and\nreduction in the number of block erasures, when pages are written uniformly at\nrandom. First, we introduce a new measure, called erasure factor, that reflects\nboth the number of block erasures and the amount of data that can be written on\neach block. A key point in our analysis is that this tradeoff depends upon the\nspecific implementation of WOM codes in the memory. We consider two systems\nthat use WOM codes; a conventional scheme that was commonly used, and a new\nrecent design that preserves the overall storage capacity. While the first\nsystem can improve the erasure factor only when the storage rate is at most\n0.6442, we show that the second scheme always improves this figure of merit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-23"}

Macro-level descriptors of the topology of the World\nAirline Network (WAN) explains middle and late stage dynamics of pandemic\nspread mediated by this network, but necessarily regard early stage variation\nas stochastic. We propose that much of early stage variation can be explained\nby appropriately characterizing the local topology surrounding the debut\nlocation of an outbreak. We measure for each airport the expected force of\ninfection (AEF) which a pandemic originating at that airport would generate. We\nobserve, for a subset of world airports, the minimum transmission rate at which\na disease becomes pandemically competent at each airport. We also observe, for\na larger subset, the time until a pandemically competent outbreak achieves\npandemic status given its debut location. Observations are generated using a\nhighly sophisticated metapopulation reaction-diffusion simulator under a\ndisease model known to well replicate the 2009 influenza pandemic. The\nrobustness of the AEF measure to model misspecification is examined by\ndegrading the network model. AEF powerfully explains pandemic risk, showing\ncorrelation of 0.90 to the transmission level needed to give a disease pandemic\ncompetence, and correlation of 0.85 to the delay until an outbreak becomes a\npandemic. The AEF is robust to model misspecification. For 97% of airports,\nremoving 15% of airports from the model changes their AEF metric by less than\n1%. Appropriately summarizing the size, shape, and diversity of an airport's\nlocal neighborhood in the WAN accurately explains much of the macro-level\nstochasticity in pandemic outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-27"}

We\ndescribe a new phase-occulting (PO) interferometric nulling coronagraphy (NC)\napproach. The PO-NC approach employs beamwalk and freeform optical surfaces\ninternal to the interferometer cavity to introduce a radially dependent plate\nscale difference between each interferometer arm (optical path) that nulls the\ncentral star at high contrast while transmitting the off-axis field. The design\nis readily implemented on segmented-mirror telescope architectures, utilizing a\nsingle nulling interferometer to achieve high throughput, a small inner working\nangle (IWA), sixth-order or higher starlight suppression, and full off-axis\ndiscovery space, a combination of features that other coronagraph designs\ngenerally must trade. Unlike previous NC approaches, the PO-NC approach does\nnot require pupil shearing; this increases throughput and renders it less\nsensitive to on-axis common-mode telescope errors, permitting relief of the\nobservatory stability required to achieve contrast levels of $\\leq10^{-10}$.\nObservatory operations are also simplified by removing the need for multiple\ntelescope rolls and shears to construct a high contrast image.

In\nStudy 1 we show how shared HR dynamics are driven by a plurality of sources\nincluding task constraints and behavioral coordination. Generally, shared HR\ndynamics are more prevalent in individual trials (involving participants doing\nthe same things) than in collective ones (involving participants taking turns\nand performing complementary actions). However, when contrasted against virtual\npairs, collective trials display more stable shared HR dynamics suggesting that\nonline social interaction plays an important role. Furthermore, in contrast to\nindividual trials, shared HR dynamics are found to increase across collective\ntrials. Study 2 investigates which aspects of social interaction might drive\nthese effects. We show that shared HR dynamics are statistically predicted by\ninterpersonal speech and building coordination. In Study 3, we explore the\nrelation between HR dynamics, behavioral coordination, and self-reported\nmeasures of rapport and group competence. While behavioral coordination\npredicts rapport and group competence, shared HR dynamics do not.

In such cases, Monte\nCarlo algorithms are remarkably flexible and extremely powerful approaches to\nsolve such inference problems. However, in the presence of a high-dimensional\nand/or multimodal posterior distribution, it is widely documented that standard\nMonte-Carlo techniques could lead to poor performance. In this paper, the study\nis focused on a Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) sampler framework, a more robust\nand efficient Monte Carlo algorithm. Although this approach presents many\nadvantages over traditional Monte-Carlo methods, the potential of this emergent\ntechnique is however largely underexploited in signal processing. In this work,\nwe aim at proposing some novel strategies that will improve the efficiency and\nfacilitate practical implementation of the SMC sampler specifically for signal\nprocessing applications. Firstly, we propose an automatic and adaptive strategy\nthat selects the sequence of distributions within the SMC sampler that\nminimizes the asymptotic variance of the estimator of the posterior\nnormalization constant. This is critical for performing model selection in\nmodelling applications in Bayesian signal processing. The second original\ncontribution we present improves the global efficiency of the SMC sampler by\nintroducing a novel correction mechanism that allows the use of the particles\ngenerated through all the iterations of the algorithm (instead of only\nparticles from the last iteration). This is a significant contribution as it\nremoves the need to discard a large portion of the samples obtained, as is\nstandard in standard SMC methods. This will improve estimation performance in\npractical settings where computational budget is important to consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-23"}

The basic approach of reducing the\nresolution of the weights in these algorithms by standard rounding methods\nincurs drastic losses in performance. To reduce the resolution further, in the\nextreme case even to binary weights, more advanced techniques are necessary. To\nthis end, we propose two methods for mapping neural network algorithms with\nhigh resolution weights to corresponding algorithms that work with low\nresolution weights and demonstrate that their performance is substantially\nbetter than standard rounding.

Therefore, the appropriate cooperative relationship between a human\noperator and automated system should be considered. This paper proposes a\nmethodology to evaluate the cooperative status between the operator and the\nautomated system in the haptic shared control of a steering operation using a\npseudo-power pair of torque from each agent and the vehicle lateral velocity as\neach agent's contribution to vehicle motion. This method allows us to estimate\ncooperative status based on two axes: the initiative holder and the intent\nconsistency between the two agents. A control method for a lane-keeping assist\nsystem (LKAS) that enables drivers to change lanes smoothly is proposed based\non the estimated cooperative status. A gain-tuning control method based on the\nestimated cooperative status is proposed to decrease the assistance system's\npseudo-power when intent inconsistency occurs. A method for switching the\nfollowed lane to match the driver's and assistance system's intentions is also\nproposed. A user study using a driving simulator is conducted to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results demonstrate that the\nproposed methods facilitate smooth driver-initiated lane changes without\nsignificantly affecting the driver's torque or steering wheel angle while\nsignificantly improve lane-keeping performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 12:56:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-23"}

However, equilibria are atypical for\nsystems with continuous symmetries, i.e. for systems with homogeneous spatial\ndimensions, whereas relative equilibria (traveling waves) are generic. In order\nto visualize the unstable manifolds of such solutions, a practical symmetry\nreduction method is required that converts relative equilibria into equilibria,\nand relative periodic orbits into periodic orbits. In this article we extend\nthe fixed Fourier mode slice approach, previously applied 1-dimensional PDEs,\nto a spatially 3-dimensional fluid flow, and show that is substantially more\neffective than our previous approach to slicing. Application of this method to\na minimal flow unit pipe leads to the discovery of many relative periodic\norbits that appear to fill out the turbulent regions of state space. We further\ndemonstrate the value of this approach to symmetry reduction through\nprojections (projections only possible in the symmetry-reduced space) that\nreveal the interrelations between these relative periodic orbits and the ways\nin which they shape the geometry of the turbulent attractor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 14:33:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 16:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

One key concept in constraint programming is\npropagation: reasoning on a constraint or set of constraints to derive new\nfacts, typically to remove values from the domains of decision variables.\nSpecialised propagation algorithms (propagators) exist for many classes of\nconstraints.\n  The concept of support is pervasive in the design of propagators.\nTraditionally, when a domain value ceases to have support, it may be removed\nbecause it takes part in no solutions. Arc-consistency algorithms such as\nAC2001 make use of support in the form of a single domain value. GAC algorithms\nsuch as GAC-Schema use a tuple of values to support each literal. We generalize\nthese notions of support in two ways. First, we allow a set of tuples to act as\nsupport. Second, the supported object is generalized from a set of literals\n(GAC-Schema) to an entire constraint or any part of it.\n  We design a methodology for developing correct propagators using generalized\nsupport. A constraint is expressed as a family of support properties, which may\nbe proven correct against the formal semantics of the constraint. Using\nCurry-Howard isomorphism to interpret constructive proofs as programs, we show\nhow to derive correct propagators from the constructive proofs of the support\nproperties.

The\nlatter is shown to exhibit a maximum not near the impact point, but rather at\nthe contact line. The motion of the contact line is furthermore shown to\nexhibit a 'tank treading' motion. These observations are apprehended at the\nlight of a variant of Wagner theory for liquid impact. This framework offers a\nsimple analogy where the fluid motion within the impacting drop may be viewed\nas the flow induced by a flat rising expanding disk. The theoretical\npredictions are found to be in very close agreement both qualitatively and\nquantitatively with the numerical observations for about three decades in time.\nInterestingly the inviscid self-similar impact pressure and velocities are\nshown to depend solely on the self-similar variables $(r/\\sqrt{t},z/\\sqrt{t})$.\nThe structure of the boundary layer developing along the wet substrate is\ninvestigated as well, and is proven to be formally analogous to that of the\nboundary layer growing in the trail of a shockwave.

A\nLow-Earth-Orbit, LEO, rotovator-based space-elevator version called\n'sling-on-a-ring' may overcome them. This mass-lifting system uses the spatial\nstability of an orbital ring, accessorized for transfer and storage of momentum\nand electrical power. A high-tensile-strength equatorial circum-terra loop of\ncolossal-carbon tube, CCT, fiber has solar-power and station-keeping units and\nrotating sling modules. Long sling assemblies, ~600 km, periodically descend\ninto the atmosphere to ~13 km. At perigee, the sling rotational tip velocity\nalmost cancels the orbital-ring velocity relative to Earth surface.\nSplit-second timing detaches a ~10 ton payload from an ordinary aircraft and\njerks it into space by sling momentum, with the proven specific strength of\nCCTs now under development. This system eliminates the immense mass in space of\nother space-elevator systems, but needs extremely long (~100km) compressive\nmembers. Conceptual analysis for mass reduction of these structures is the\nsubject of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 03:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}
