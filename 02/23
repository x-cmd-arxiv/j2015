Lastly, it discusses prospects for future developments in active\nseismic isolation and the anticipated benefits to astrophysical gravitational\nwave searches.\n  Beyond gravitational wave research, the goal of this article is to provide\ndetailed isolation strategy guidelines for sensitive ground-based physics\nexperiments that may benefit from similar levels of inertial isolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 01:10:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 21:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 19:42:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 15:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The super-Eddington wind can naturally\nprevent the carbon--oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) with high mass-accretion rates\nfrom becoming red-giant-like stars. Furthermore, it works in low-metallicity\nenvironments, which may explain SNe Ia observed at high redshifts. In this\narticle, we systematically investigated the most prominent single-degenerate\nWD+MS channel based on the super-Eddington wind scenario. We combined the\nEggleton stellar evolution code with a rapid binary population synthesis (BPS)\napproach to predict SN Ia birthrates for the WD+MS channel by adopting the\nsuper-Eddington wind scenario and detailed mass-accumulation efficiencies of\nH-shell flashes on the WDs. Our BPS calculations found that the estimated SN Ia\nbirthrates for the WD+MS channel are ~0.009-0.315*10^{-3}{yr}^{-1} if we adopt\nthe Eddington accretion rate as the critical accretion rate, which are much\nlower than that of the observations (<10% of the observed SN Ia birthrates).\nThis indicates that the WD+MS channel only contributes a small proportion of\nall SNe Ia. The birthrates in this simulation are lower than previous studies,\nthe main reason of which is that new mass-accumulation efficiencies of H-shell\nflashes are adopted. We also found that the critical mass-accretion rate has a\nsignificant influence on the birthrates of SNe Ia.

Understanding the contribution of\nmagnetic structures to total solar irradiance and solar spectral irradiance\nrequires assessing their contributions as a function of disk position. Since\nonly relative photometry is possible from the ground, the contrasts of image\npixels are measured with respect to a center-to-limb intensity profile. Using\nnine years of full-disk red and blue continuum images from the Precision Solar\nPhotometric Telescope at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (PSPT/MLSO), we\nexamine the sensitivity of continuum contrast measurements to the\ncenter-to-limb profile definition. Profiles which differ only by the amount of\nmagnetic activity allowed in the pixels used to determine them yield oppositely\nsigned solar cycle length continuum contrast trends; either agreeing with the\nresult of Preminger et al.

Changes in\nthe center-to-limb profile shape over the solar cycle are responsible for the\ncontradictory contrast results, and we demonstrate that the lowest contrast\nstructures, internetwork and network, are most sensitive to these. Thus the\nstrengths of the full-disk, internetwork, and network photometric trends depend\ncritically on the magnetic flux density used in the quiet-sun definition.

In this paper we study the learnability\n(whether a problem can be learned by any algorithm) under Vapnik's general\nlearning setting with differential privacy constraint, and reveal some\nintricate relationships between privacy, stability and learnability.\n  In particular, we show that a problem is privately learnable **if an only\nif** there is a private algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical\nrisk (AERM). In contrast, for non-private learning AERM alone is not sufficient\nfor learnability.

In light of\nthis, we propose a conceptual procedure that always finds a universally\nconsistent algorithm whenever the problem is learnable under privacy\nconstraint.

In this research, such a provisioning technique for wireless\nnetworks is performed by Call Admission Control (CAC). A new approach in CAC\nnamed by Uniform Fractional Band (UFB) is proposed in this work for the\nwireless networks for providing proper priority between new calls and handover\ncalls. This UFB scheme is basically a new style of handover priority scheme.\nHandover priority is provided by two stages in this scheme which help the\nnetwork to utilize more resources. In addition, the handover call rate\nestimation and its impact on QoS provisioning is discussed widely to attain the\noptimum QoS in proposed handover priority scheme. In multiple services\nproviding wireless network, excessive call blocking of lower priority traffic\nis very often event at very high traffic rate which is a concerning issue for\nQoS provisioning. To attain such QoS provisioning for multiple services,\nanother CAC scheme is proposed in this research work. This scheme is recognized\nby Uniform Band Thinning (UBT) scheme which is based on uniform thinning\ntechnique (UTT) and this is quite similar idea as UFB scheme. In this scheme, a\nset of channels experiences the fractionizing policy. This scheme reduces the\ncall blocking probabilities (CBP) of lower priority traffic classes without\nnotably increasing the CBP of the higher priority traffic classes. The\nanalytical functions of this scheme are deduced in general form which is useful\nto deduce for any number of traffic classes. In addition, numerical analysis of\nthe proposed UBT scheme shows that the performances in terms of call blocking\nprobability, overall call blocking probability, and channel utilization are\nimproved and optimized compared to the conventional fixed guard channel scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 06:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

By\nconsidering the negligible thickness of the membrane, usually on the order of a\nfraction of one millimeter, we derive a relation showing that the sum of the\nincoming sound waves' (complex) pressure amplitudes, averaged over the area of\nthe membrane, must be equal to that of the outgoing waves.

The solution, called \"Black Wormhole\", consists of two different\nstates, depending on its mass M and an IR parameter omega: For the black hole\nstate, a non-traversable wormhole occupies the interior region of the black\nhole around the singularity at the origin, whereas for the wormhole state, the\ninterior wormhole is exposed to an outside observer as the black hole horizon\nis disappeared from evaporation. The black hole state becomes thermodynamically\nstable as it approaches to the merge point where the interior wormhole throat\nand the black hole horizon merges, and the Hawking temperature vanishes at the\nexact merge point. This solution suggests the \"Generalized Cosmic Censorship\"\nby the existence of a wormhole-like structure which protects the naked\nsingularity even after the black hole evaporation. One could understand the\nwould-be wormholes inside the black hole horizon as the results of microscopic\nwormholes created by \"negative\" energy quanta which have entered the black hole\nhorizon in Hawking radiation processes: The quantum black hole could be a\nwormhole factory. It is found that this speculative picture may be consistent\nwith the recent \"ER=EPR\" proposal for resolving the recent black hole\nentanglement debates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 10:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 16:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 12:27:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2015 08:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

As a result, the atom-field dynamics in the\nHilbert space splits into two independent parity chains, exhibiting a\ncollapse-revival pattern and exact periodic dynamics in the limit of degenerate\natomic levels. Here we introduce a mixed Rabi Jaynes-Cummings model by\nconsidering a three-level atom interacting with two quantized bosonic fields,\nin which the RWA is made for one transition (with a weak atom-field coupling)\nbut not for the other one (with an ultrastrong atom-field coupling). As a\nresult, we show that the field in the weak coupled atomic transition can be\nused as a tool to control the atom-field dynamics of the other (strong coupled)\ntransition, thus realizing an effective two-level quantum Rabi model with a\ncontrollable field. In particular, a periodic temporal dynamics of the\natom-field state can be realized by appropriate tuning of the weak control\nfield, even for non-degenerate atomic levels.

On the other hand, it appears that there are no fundamental\nlimitations on broadband matching of thin absorbing layers. However, known thin\nabsorbers produce significant reflections outside of the resonant absorption\nband. In this paper we explore possibilities to realize a thin absorbing layer\nwhich produces no reflected waves in a very wide frequency range, while the\ntransmission coefficient has a narrow peak of full absorption. Here we show,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, that a wide-band-matched thin resonant\nabsorber, invisible in reflection, can be realized if one and the same resonant\nmode of the absorbing array unit cells is utilized to create both electric and\nmagnetic responses. We test this concept using chiral particles in each unit\ncells, arranged in a periodic planar racemic array, utilizing chirality\ncoupling in each unit cell but compensating the field coupling at the\nmacroscopic level. We prove that the concept and the proposed realization\napproach also can be used to create non-reflecting layers for full control of\ntransmitted fields. Our results can have a broad range of potential\napplications over the entire electromagnetic spectrum including, for example,\nperfect ultra-compact wave filters and selective multi-frequency sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 13:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

However,\ncurrent algorithms are strongly limited by their sampling variance, which\nscales proportionate to 1/N_S for N_S samples. In this paper, we obtain a new\nclass of variance reduction methods for treating stochastic equations, called\nparallel optimized sampling. The objective of parallel optimized sampling is to\nreduce the sampling variance in the observables of an ensemble of stochastic\ntrajectories. This is achieved through calculating a finite set of observables\n- typically statistical moments - in parallel, and minimizing the errors\ncompared to known values. The algorithm is both numerically efficient and\nunbiased. Importantly, it does not increase the errors in higher order moments,\nand generally reduces such errors as well. The same procedure is applied both\nto initial ensembles and to changes in a finite time-step. Results of these\nmethods show that errors in initially optimized moments can be reduced to the\nmachine precision level, typically around 10^(-16) in current hardware. For\nnonlinear stochastic equations, sampled moment errors during time-evolution are\nlarger than this, due to error propagation effects. Even so, we provide\nevidence for error reductions of up to two orders of magnitude in a nonlinear\nequation example, for low order moments, which is a large practical benefit.\nThe sampling variance typically scales as 1/N_S, but with the advantage of a\nvery much smaller prefactor than for standard, non-optimized methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 09:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 02:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}
