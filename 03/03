Various Be stars exhibit intensity variations of the violet and red\nemission peaks in their HI lines observed in emission. This so-called $V/R$\nphenomenon is usually explained by the precession of a one-armed spiral density\nperturbation in the circumstellar disk. That global-disk oscillation scenario\nwas confirmed, both observationally and theoretically, in the previous series\nof two papers analyzing the Be shell star {\\zeta} Tauri. The vertically\naveraged (2D) global-disk oscillation model used at the time was able to\nreproduce the $V/R$ variations observed in H{\\alpha}, as well as the spatially\nresolved interferometric data from AMBER/VLTI. Unfortunately, that model failed\nto reproduce the $V/R$ phase of Br15 and the amplitude of the polarization\nvariation, suggesting that the inner disk structure predicted by the model was\nincorrect.\n  Aims. The first aim of the present paper is to quantify the temporal\nvariations of the shell-line characteristics of {\\zeta} Tauri. The second aim\nis to better understand the physics underlying the $V/R$ phenomenon by modeling\nthe shell-line variations together with the $V/R$ and polarimetric variations.\nThe third aim is to test a new 2.5D disk oscillation model, which solves the\nset of equations that describe the 3D perturbed disk structure but keeps only\nthe equatorial (i.e., 2D) component of the solution. This approximation was\nadopted to allow comparisons with the previous 2D model, and as a first step\ntoward a future 3D model.\n  Results. The new 2.5D formalism improves the agreement with the observed\n$V/R$ variations of H{\\alpha} and Br15, under the proviso that a large value of\nthe viscosity parameter, {\\alpha} = 0.8, be adopted. Nonetheless, it remains\nchallenging for the models to reproduce consistently the amplitude and the\naverage level of the polarization data, whatever formalism is adopted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 16:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

One successfully used framework of\ndomain adaptation is to learn a transformation to match both the distribution\nof the features (marginal distribution), and the distribution of the labels\ngiven features (conditional distribution). In this paper, we propose a new\ndomain adaptation framework named Deep Transfer Network (DTN), where the highly\nflexible deep neural networks are used to implement such a distribution\nmatching process.\n  This is achieved by two types of layers in DTN: the shared feature extraction\nlayers which learn a shared feature subspace in which the marginal\ndistributions of the source and the target samples are drawn close, and the\ndiscrimination layers which match conditional distributions by classifier\ntransduction. We also show that DTN has a computation complexity linear to the\nnumber of training samples, making it suitable to large-scale problems. By\ncombining the best paradigms in both worlds (deep neural networks in\nrecognition, and matching marginal and conditional distributions in domain\nadaptation), we demonstrate by extensive experiments that DTN improves\nsignificantly over former methods in both execution time and classification\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 16:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

The 250 m/s prograde jet peaking near 60 N was confirmed and more\naccurately characterized. Several long-lived cloud features have also been\ntracked. The winds pole-ward of 60 N are consistent with solid body rotation at\na westward (prograde) rate of 4.3 deg/h with respect to Uranus' interior. When\ncombined with 2007 and other recent measurements, it is clear that a small but\nwell-resolved asymmetry exists in the zonal profile at middle latitudes,\npeaking at 35 deg, where southern winds are 20 m/s more westward than\ncorresponding northern winds. High S/N Keck II imaging of the north polar\nregion of Uranus reveals a transition from streaky bands below 60 N to a region\nfrom 60 deg to nearly the north pole, where widely distributed small bright\nspots, resembling cumulus cloud fields, with several isolated dark spots, are\nthe dominant style of cloud features.

The pressure\nlevels of discrete clouds estimated from spatial modulations in H and Hcont\nimages indicate that the polar cloud features are generally in the 1.3 to 2-3\nbar range, as are equatorial and several mid-latitude features.

In many cases, the interaction with the environment affects only\none degree of freedom of the end-effector of the manipulator. Therefore, the\nfocus is on this contact degree of freedom, and a switching position-force\ncontroller is proposed to perform the hybrid position-force tracking task.\nSufficient conditions are presented to guarantee input-to-state stability of\nthe switching closed-loop system with respect to perturbations related to the\ntime-varying desired motion-force profile. The switching occurs when the\nmanipulator makes or breaks contact with the environment. The analysis shows\nthat to guarantee closed-loop stability while tracking arbitrary time-varying\nmotion-force profiles, the controller should implement a considerable (and\noften unrealistic) amount of damping, resulting in inferior tracking\nperformance. Therefore, we propose to redesign the manipulator with a compliant\nwrist. Guidelines are provided for the design of the compliant wrist while\nemploying the designed switching control strategy, such that stable tracking of\na motion-force reference trajectory can be achieved and bouncing of the\nmanipulator while making contact with the stiff environment can be avoided.\nFinally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 16:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

We obtain a running time of $O(n \\log^2 n)$\nfor computing the characteristic polynomial, while the previously fastest\nalgorithm ran in quadratic time.

The modular structure of the framework allows to accommodate\nfor a variety of shock scenarios, methods to estimate interbank exposures and\nmechanisms of distress propagation.

First,\nthe framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects\n(i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced\nin the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible\nfire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks\non individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their\nvulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it\nincludes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with\nfamiliar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform\nrobustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a\nmodule for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are\ncoherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration,\nwe carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over\nthe years 2008-2013.

To efficiently analyze such large graphs, many\ndistributed graph computing systems have been developed. These systems employ\nthe \"think like a vertex\" programming paradigm, where a program proceeds in\niterations and at each iteration, vertices exchange messages with each other.\nHowever, using Pregel's simple message passing mechanism, some vertices may\nsend/receive significantly more messages than others due to either the high\ndegree of these vertices or the logic of the algorithm used. This forms the\ncommunication bottleneck and leads to imbalanced workload among machines in the\ncluster. In this paper, we propose two effective message reduction techniques:\n(1)vertex mirroring with message combining, and (2)an additional\nrequest-respond API. These techniques not only reduce the total number of\nmessages exchanged through the network, but also bound the number of messages\nsent/received by any single vertex. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness\nof our techniques, and implement them on top of our open-source Pregel\nimplementation called Pregel+.

The accretion flow is radiation pressure\ndominated and takes the form of a geometrically thick disk with twin\nlow-density funnels around the rotation axis. For accretion rates $\\gtrsim 10\n\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$, there is sufficient gas in the funnel to make this region\noptically thick. Radiation from the disk first flows into the funnel, after\nwhich it accelerates the optically thick funnel gas along the axis. The\nresulting jet is baryon-loaded and has a terminal density-weighted velocity\n$\\approx 0.3c$. Much of the radiative luminosity is converted into kinetic\nenergy by the time the escaping gas becomes optically thin. For an observer\nviewing down the axis, the isotropic equivalent luminosity of total energy is\nas much as $10^{48}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$ for a $10^7 M_\\odot$ BH accreting at\n$10^3$ Eddington. Therefore, energetically, the simulated jets are consistent\nwith observations of the most powerful tidal disruption events, e.g., Swift\nJ1644. The jet velocity is, however, too low to match the Lorentz factor\n$\\gamma > 2$ inferred in J1644. There is no such conflict in the case of other\ntidal disruption events. Since favorably oriented observers see isotropic\nequivalent luminosities that are highly super-Eddington, the simulated models\ncan explain observations of ultra-luminous X-ray sources, at least in terms of\nluminosity and energetics, without requiring intermediate mass black holes.\nFinally, since the simulated jets are baryon-loaded and have mildly\nrelativistic velocities, they match well the jets observed in SS433. The latter\nare, however, more collimated than the simulated jets. This suggests that, even\nif magnetic fields are not important for acceleration, they may perhaps still\nplay a role in confining the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 18:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

The UCHVC\npopulation of HI clouds are thought to be candidate gas-rich, low mass halos at\nthe edge of the Local Group and beyond, but no comprehensive search for stellar\ncounterparts to these systems has been presented. Careful visual inspection of\nall publicly available optical and ultraviolet imaging at the position of the\nUCHVCs revealed six blue, diffuse counterparts with a morphology consistent\nwith a faint dwarf galaxy beyond the Local Group. Optical spectroscopy of all\nsix candidate dwarf counterparts show that five have an H$\\alpha$-derived\nvelocity consistent with the coincident HI cloud, confirming their association,\nthe sixth diffuse counterpart is likely a background object. The size and\nluminosity of the UCHVC dwarfs is consistent with other known Local Volume\ndwarf irregular galaxies. The gas fraction ($M_{HI}/M_{star}$) of the five\ndwarfs are generally consistent with that of dwarf irregular galaxies in the\nLocal Volume, although ALFALFA-Dw1 (associated with ALFALFA UCHVC\nHVC274.68+74.70$-$123) has a very high $M_{HI}/M_{star}$$\\sim$40. Despite the\nheterogenous nature of our search, we demonstrate that the current dwarf\ncompanions to UCHVCs are at the edge of detectability due to their low surface\nbrightness, and that deeper searches are likely to find more stellar systems.\nIf more sensitive searches do not reveal further stellar counterparts to\nUCHVCs, then the dearth of such systems around the Local Group may be in\nconflict with $\\Lambda$CDM simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 21:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 02:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The ICD shows a relation with the stellar masses and morphologies\nof the galaxies.

By studying the relations between the ICD and\nother galaxy properties including sizes, total colors, star-formation rate, and\ndust attenuation, we conclude that the largest variations in stellar\npopulations occur in galaxies where the light from newly, high star-forming\nclumps contrasts older stellar disk populations.

This problem is\ninteresting since, on equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds, there is always an\nintrinsic volume (e.g. Popp's one $P$) but not a canonical choice of\ncomplement. The result depends heavily on the type of structure under\ninvestigation. On contact structures, for every volume $\\omega$, there exists a\nunique complement $c$ such that $\\Delta_\\omega=L^c$. On Carnot groups, if $H$\nis the Haar volume, then there always exists a complement $c$ such that\n$\\Delta_H=L^c$. However this complement is not unique in general.

The recently\nintroduced notion of geo-indistinguishability tries to address this problem by\nadapting the well-known concept of differential privacy to the area of\nlocation-based systems. Although geo-indistinguishability presents various\nappealing aspects, it has the problem of treating space in a uniform way,\nimposing the addition of the same amount of noise everywhere on the map. In\nthis paper we propose a novel elastic distinguishability metric that warps the\ngeometrical distance, capturing the different degrees of density of each area.\nAs a consequence, the obtained mechanism adapts the level of noise while\nachieving the same degree of privacy everywhere.

In a\nrecent paper a systematic method was proposed for devising gradient control\nlaws for asymptotically stabilizing a large class of rigid, undirected\nformations in two dimensional space assuming all agents are described by\nkinematic point models. The aim of this paper is to explain what happens to\nsuch formations if neighboring agents have slightly different understandings of\nwhat the desired distance between them is supposed to be or equivalently if\nneighboring agents have differing estimates of what the actual distance between\nthem is. In either case, what one would expect would be a gradual distortion of\nthe formation from its target shape as discrepancies in desired or sensed\ndistances increase. While this is observed for the gradient laws in question,\nsomething else quite unexpected happens at the same time. It is shown that for\nany rigidity-based, undirected formation of this type which is comprised of\nthree or more agents, that if some neighboring agents have slightly different\nunderstandings of what the desired distances between them are suppose to be,\nthen almost for certain, the trajectory of the resulting distorted but rigid\nformation will converge exponentially fast to a closed circular orbit in\ntwo-dimensional space which is traversed periodically at a constant angular\nspeed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 02:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

The departure of\nthe spectral indices of magnetic energy and current helicity from 5/3 are\nanalyzed, and it is found that it is lower than the spectral index of the\nmagnetic energy spectrum. Furthermore, the fractional magnetic helicity tends\nto increase when the scale of the energy-carrying magnetic structures\nincreases. The magnetic helicity of NOAA 11515 violates the expected\nhemispheric sign rule, which is interpreted as an effect of enhanced field\nstrengths at scales larger than 30-60Mm with opposite signs of helicity.

In this\npaper, we analyze a short-lived type II burst that started at 07:40 UT on 2011\nFebruary 28.

However, in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images\nprovided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO), we find a wave-like structure that propagated at a speed of\n$\\sim$ 600 km s$^{-1}$ during the burst. The relationship between the type II\nradio burst and the wave-like structure is in particular explored. For this\npurpose, we first derive the density distribution under the wave by the\ndifferential emission measure (DEM) method, which is used to restrict the\nempirical density model. We then use the restricted density model to invert the\nspeed of the shock that produces the observed frequency drift rate in the\ndynamic spectrum. The inverted shock speed is similar to the speed of the\nwave-like structure. This implies that the wave-like structure is most likely a\ncoronal shock that produces the type II radio burst. We also examine the\nevolution of the magnetic field in the flare-associated active region and find\ncontinuous flux emergence and cancellation taking place near the flare site.\nBased on these facts, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of the type\nII radio burst, i.e., the expansion of the strongly-inclined magnetic loops\nafter reconnected with nearby emerging flux acts as a piston to generate the\nshock wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 09:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

In order to compute reasonably precise post-fixpoints of the\nresulting systems of equations, Cousot and Cousot have suggested accelerated\nfixpoint iteration by means of widening and narrowing.\n  The strict separation into phases, however, may unnecessarily give up\nprecision that cannot be recovered later, as over-approximated interim results\nhave to be fully propagated through the equation the system. Additionally,\nclassical two-phased approach is not suitable for equation systems with\ninfinitely many unknowns---where demand driven solving must be used.\nConstruction of an intertwined approach must be able to answer when it is safe\nto apply narrowing---or when widening must be applied. In general, this is a\ndifficult problem. In case the right-hand sides of equations are monotonic,\nhowever, we can always apply narrowing whenever we have reached a post-fixpoint\nfor an equation. The assumption of monotonicity, though, is not met in presence\nof widening. It is also not met by equation systems corresponding to\ncontext-sensitive inter-procedural analysis, possibly combining\ncontext-sensitive analysis of local information with flow-insensitive analysis\nof globals.\n  As a remedy, we present a novel operator that combines a given widening\noperator with a given narrowing operator.

Two different approaches in the framework of AQFT are\ndiscussed. On the one hand, an inverse scattering problem is considered. A\ngiven factorizing S-matrix is thereby taken as the starting point of the\nconstruction. The particle spectrum taken into account involves an arbitrary\nnumber of massive particle species, transforming under a global gauge group.\nStarting from known wedge-local auxiliary fields, the transition to local\ntheories is shown. To his end, we make use of the modular nuclearity condition\nand investigate certain maps from the wedge algebras, generated by the\nauxiliary fields, to the considered Hilbert space. Under a very plausible\nconjecture it is shown that these maps are nuclear, which implies the\nnontriviality of algebras associated with bounded regions in the sense that the\nReeh-Schlieder property holds. A large class of integrable models with\nfactorizing S-matrices in 1+1 dimensions can be constructed in this way. Among\nthem are the O(N)-invariant nonlinear sigma-models. Deformation techniques, on\nthe other hand, constitute a method of construction which may be applied in\narbitrary spacetime dimensions. This approach starts from a known quantum field\ntheoretic model which is subjected to a certain modification. Here, concretely,\nthe model of a scalar massive Fermion was deformed. The emerging models are\nbased on wedge-local fields, allowing for the computation of the two-particle\nS-matrix. The resulting scattering matrix depends on the deformation and\ndiffers from the one of the initial model. By restricting to 1+1 dimensions,\nthe deformation method yields a large class of integrable models with\nfactorizing S-matrices, including the Sinh-Gordon model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 11:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

Although the models that explain the\nvarious states of financial markets offer substantial evidences from the fields\nof finance, mathematics, and even physics to explain states observed in the\nreal financial markets, previous theories that attempt to fully explain the\ncomplexities of financial markets have been inadequate. In this study, we\npropose an artificial double auction market as an agent-based model approach to\nstudy the origin of complex states in the financial markets, characterizing\nimportant parameters with an investment strategy that can cover the dynamics of\nthe financial market. The investment strategy of chartist traders after market\ninformation arrives should reduce market stability originating in the price\nfluctuations of risky assets.

Nodes\nrepresent e.g. financial actors, whereas weighted links represent e.g.\nfinancial obligations (credits/debts). Each node has a risk to fail because of\nlosses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure\ncascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network\neffects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses\n(i.e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification,\nED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher\nconnectivity of the system as a whole which can also lead to increasing failure\nrisk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage\ndiversification, DD), i.e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on\nneighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we\nquantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For\nthis, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to\nweighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This\nallows us to identify systemically relevant nodes in a network even if their\ndirected weights differ strongly. On the macro level, we provide an analytical\nexpression for the average cascade size, to quantify systemic risk.\nFurthermore, on the meso level we calculate failure probabilities of nodes\nconditional on their system relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 12:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

One of\nthe fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity, or\npattern speed $\\Omega_p$, which determines the location of resonances in the\ndisc and the spirals' radial extent. The most direct method for estimating the\npattern speed relies on backward integration techniques, trying to locate the\nstellar birthplace of open clusters. Here we propose a new method based on the\ninteraction between the spiral arms and the stars in the disc. Using a sample\nof around 500 open clusters from the {\\it New Catalogue of Optically Visible\nOpen Clusters and Candidates}, and a sample of 500 giant stars observed by\nAPOGEE, we find $\\Omega_p = 23.0\\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, for a local\nstandard of rest rotation $V_0=220$~km s$^{-1}$ and solar radius $R_0=8.0$~kpc.\nExploring a range in $V_0$ and $R_0$ within the acceptable values, 200-240 km\ns$^{-1}$ and 7.5-8.5 kpc, respectively, results only in a small change in our\nestimate of $\\Omega_p$, that is within the error. Our result is in close\nagreement with a number of studies which suggest values in the range 20-25 km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. An advantage of our method is that we do not need\nknowledge of the stellar age, unlike in the case of the birthplace method,\nwhich allows us to use data from large Galactic surveys. The precision of our\nmethod will be improved once larger samples of disk stars with spectroscopic\ninformation will become available thanks to future surveys such as 4MOST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 12:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

On the other hand EuRhGe$_3$ presents a single magnetic\ntransition with a $T_{\\rm N}$ = 12 K. $^{151}$Eu M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectra present\nevidence for a cascade of transitions from paramagnetic to incommensurate\namplitude modulated followed by an equal moment antiferromagnetic phase at\nlower temperatures in EuIrGe$_3$, the transitions having a substantial first\norder character. On the other hand the $^{151}$Eu M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectra at 4.2\nand 9 K in EuRhGe$_3$ present evidence of a single magnetic transition. In both\ncompounds a superzone gap is observed for the current density $J\\parallel$\n[001], which enhances with transverse magnetic field. The magnetisation\nmeasured up to 14 T shows the occurrence of field induced transitions, which\nare well documented in the magnetotransport data as well.

Given a set of $n$ agents and a set of goods, the\nmaximin share of a single agent is the best that she can guarantee to herself,\nif she would be allowed to partition the goods in any way she prefers, into $n$\nbundles, and then receive her least desirable bundle. The objective then in our\nproblem is to find a partition, so that each agent is guaranteed her maximin\nshare. In settings with indivisible goods, such allocations are not guaranteed\nto exist, so we resort to approximation algorithms. Our main result is a\n$2/3$-approximation, that runs in polynomial time for any number of agents.\nThis improves upon the algorithm of Procaccia and Wang, which also produces a\n$2/3$-approximation but runs in polynomial time only for a constant number of\nagents. To achieve this, we redesign certain parts of their algorithm.\nFurthermore, motivated by the apparent difficulty, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, in finding lower bounds on the existence of approximate\nsolutions, we undertake a probabilistic analysis. We prove that in randomly\ngenerated instances, with high probability there exists a maximin share\nallocation. This can be seen as a justification of the experimental evidence\nreported in relevant works. Finally, we provide further positive results for\ntwo special cases that arise from previous works. The first one is the\nintriguing case of $3$ agents, for which it is already known that exact maximin\nshare allocations do not always exist (contrary to the case of $2$ agents).

In this work we explain the mechanism by which this population transfer\nis blocked. We then develop a novel concept of geometric control, assuming full\nor partial coherent manipulation within the manifolds and show that by\npreparing specific coherent superpositions in the initial manifold, full\npopulation inversion or full population blockade, {\\it i.e} laser-induced\ntransparency, can be achieved. In particular, by parallel population transfer\nwe show how population inversion between the manifolds can be obtained with\nminimal pulse area. As the number of sublevels increases, population inversion\ncan overcome the pulse area theorem at the expense of full control over the\ninitial manifold of sublevels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 14:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

In addition to flexible chains, we also extend our study to\nsemiflexible chains for different stiffness controlled by a bending potential.\nThe persistence lengths of chains extracted from the orientational correlations\nare estimated for all cases.

The individual consumes at a constant rate $c$, so the level of wealth\nrequired for risklessly meeting consumption equals $c/r$, in which $r$ is the\nrate of return of the riskless asset.\n  Our problem is related to, but different from, the goal-reaching problems of\nBrowne (1997).

This process leads to a significantly faster decrease of the number\nof overlapping monomers on the lattice. This is useful for simulating very\nlarge systems, where the statistical properties of the model with a marginally\nincomplete elimination of excluded volume violations are the same as those of\nthe model with strictly excluded volume. We find that the internal mean square\nend-to-end distance for moderately stiff chains in a melt can be very well\ndescribed by a freely rotating chain model with a precise estimate of the\nbond-bond orientational correlation between two successive bond vectors in\nequilibrium. The plot of the probability distributions of the reduced\nend-to-end distance of chains of different stiffness also shows that the data\ncollapse is excellent and described very well by the Gaussian distribution for\nideal chains. However, while our results confirm the systematic deviations\nbetween Gaussian statistics for the chain structure factor $S_c(q)$ [minimum in\nthe Kratky-plot] found by Wittmer et al.~\\{EPL {\\bf 77} 56003 (2007).\\} for\nfully flexible chains in a melt, we show that for the available chain length\nthese deviations are no longer visible, when the chain stiffness is included.\nThe mean square bond length and the compressibility estimated from collective\nstructure factors depend slightly on the stiffness of the chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 14:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This\nmeans that these kind of gravitational extensions are statistically robust and\nshow that no dark matter and/or energy is required to explain the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 20:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}
