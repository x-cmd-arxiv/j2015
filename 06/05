It is clear that\nan important role in driving this dynamics is played by social influence, which\nis the essential ingredient of many quantitative models. Such models require\nthat all traits are fixed when specifying the \"initial cultural state\".\nTypically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform\ndistribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent\nwork has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends\non the nature of the initial state. If the latter is sampled from empirical\ndata instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of\ncultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of\npropensity towards collective behavior in the short-term. Moreover, if the\ninitial state is randomized by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the\nlevel of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the\nempirical and uniformly random counterparts. The current study repeats the\nanalysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are\nremarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural\nvariables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust\nstructural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, possibly due to\nuniversal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world. The results\nalso suggest that this dynamics might be characterized by criticality and\ninvolve mechanisms beyond social influence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 16:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 23:07:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 16:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 14:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

The light variations are dominated by the beating of two\ndominant frequencies located at around 4 c/d. The amplitudes of these two\nfrequencies show a monotonic long-term trend. The frequency spacing analysis\nrevealed two possibilities: the pulsator is either a highly inclined moderate\nrotator (v~70 km/s, i > 70 deg) or a fast rotator (v~200 km/s) with i~20 deg.\nThe transit analysis disclosed that the transit events which occur with a ~197\nc/d period may be caused by a 1.6 R_Jup body orbiting a fainter star, which\nwould be spatially coincident with KIC 9533489.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 17:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

All pieces come together to show that Hund's\ncoupling, besides being responsible for the electronic correlations even in\nabsence of a strong Coulomb repulsion is also the origin of a subtle emergent\nbehavior: orbital decoupling. Indeed Hund's exchange decouples the charge\nexcitations in the different Iron orbitals involved in the conduction bands\nthus causing an independent tuning of the degree of electronic correlation in\neach one of them. The latter becomes sensitive almost only to the offset of the\norbital population from half-filling, where a Mott insulating state is\ninvariably realized at these interaction strengths. Depending on the difference\nin orbital population a different 'Mottness' affects each orbital, and thus\nreflects in the conduction bands and in the Fermi surfaces depending on the\norbital content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 18:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Many overlay networks operate in dynamic environments (e.g. the\nInternet), where faults are frequent and widespread, and the number of\nprocesses in a system may be quite large.

While the most massive members of the subhalo population can\nappear as luminous satellites and be detected in optical surveys, establishing\nthe existence of the low mass and mostly dark subhalos has proven to be a\ndaunting task. Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses have been successfully\nused to study mass substructures lying close to lensed images of bright\nbackground sources. However, in typical galaxy-scale lenses, the strong lensing\nregion only covers a small projected area of the lens's dark matter halo,\nimplying that the vast majority of subhalos cannot be directly detected in\nlensing observations.

The tempo of CTL escape and reversion is known to differ between\nCTL escape variants in a given host population.

However, the relationship between escape/reversion\nrates and viral replicative capacity across a large number of epitopes has not\nbeen interrogated. We investigate this relationship by examining $in$ $vitro$\nreplicative capacities of viral sequences with minimal variation: point escape\nmutants induced in a lab strain. Remarkably, despite the complexities of\nepistatic effects exemplified by pathways to escape in famous epitopes, and the\ndiversity of both hosts and viruses, CTL escape mutants which escape rapidly\ntend to be those with the highest replicative capacity when applied as a single\npoint mutation. Similarly, mutants inducing the greatest costs to viral\nreplicative capacity tend to revert more quickly. These data suggest that\nescape rates in Gag are consistent across host populations, and that in general\nthese rates are dominated by site specific effects upon viral replicative\ncapacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 21:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 19:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

Our hypotheses are\nthat the use of trade credit contributes to contagion (from many customers to a\nsingle supplier - \"many to one\" contagion) and amplification (through their\ninteraction with the macrocopic variables, such as interest rate) of growth\nrate. In this paper we test the contagion hypothesis, measuring empirically the\nmesoscopic \"many-to-one\" effect. The effect of amplification has been dealt\nwith in another paper.\n  Our empirical analysis is based on the delayed payments between trading\npartners across many different industrial sectors, intermediated by a large\nItalian bank during the year 2007. The data is used to create a weighted and\ndirected trade credit network. Assuming that the linkages are static, we look\nat the dynamics of the nodes/firms. On the ratio of the 2007 trade credit in\nSales and Purchases items on the profit and loss statements, we estimate the\ntrade credit in 2006 and 2008.\n  Applying the \"many to one\" approach we compare such predicted growth of trade\n(demand) aggregated per supplier, and compare it with the real growth of Sales\nof the supplier. We analyze the correlation of these two growth rates over two\nyearly periods, 2007/2006 and 2008/2007, and in this way we test our contagion\nhypotheses. We could not find strong correlations between the predicted and the\nactual growth rates. We provide an evidence of contagion only in restricted\nsub-groups of our network, and not in the whole network. We do find a strong\nmacroscopic effect of the crisis, indicated by a coincident negative drift in\nthe growth of sales of nearly all the firms in our sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 21:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

Here we investigate a three-dimensional nanorod metamaterial\nplatform, serving as an auxiliary tool for the optical manipulation, able to\nsupport and control near-field interactions and generate both steep and flat\noptical potential profiles. It was shown that the 'topological transition' from\nthe elliptic to hyperbolic dispersion regime of the metamaterial, usually\nhaving a significant impact on various light-matter interaction processes, does\nnot strongly affect the distribution of optical forces in the metamaterial.\nThis effect is explained by the predominant near-fields contributions of the\nnanostructure to optomechanical interactions.

In this paper, we present a\nnew prediction task, Neighbor Distribution Prediction (NDP), which aims at\npredicting the distribution of the labels on neighbors of a given node and is\nvaluable for many different applications in heterogeneous information networks.\nThe challenges of NDP mainly come from three aspects: the infinity of the state\nspace of a neighbor distribution, the sparsity of available data, and how to\nfairly evaluate the predictions. To address these challenges, we first propose\nan Evolution Factor Model (EFM) for NDP, which utilizes two new structures\nproposed in this paper, i.e. Neighbor Distribution Vector (NDV) to represent\nthe state of a given node's neighbors, and Neighbor Label Evolution Matrix\n(NLEM) to capture the dynamics of a neighbor distribution, respectively. We\nfurther propose a learning algorithm for Evolution Factor Model. To overcome\nthe problem of data sparsity, the learning algorithm first clusters all the\nnodes and learns an NLEM for each cluster instead of for each node. For fairly\nevaluating the predicting results, we propose a new metric: Virtual Accuracy\n(VA), which takes into consideration both the absolute accuracy and the\npredictability of a node.

However, the aforementioned sure screening property\nstrongly relies on the assumption that the important variables in the model\nhave large marginal correlations with the response, which rarely holds in\nreality. To overcome this, we propose a novel and simple screening technique\ncalled the high-dimensional ordinary least-squares projection (HOLP). We show\nthat HOLP possesses the sure screening property and gives consistent variable\nselection without the strong correlation assumption, and has a low\ncomputational complexity. A ridge type HOLP procedure is also discussed.\nSimulation study shows that HOLP performs competitively compared to many other\nmarginal correlation based methods. An application to a mammalian eye disease\ndata illustrates the attractiveness of HOLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 05:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

In\nparticular, there is a $2$-approximation algorithm for directed Radius with\none-way distances that runs in $\\tilde{O}(m\\sqrt{n})$ time, while a\n$(2-\\delta)$-approximation algorithm in $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ time is unlikely. -\nOn graphs with treewidth $k$, we can solve the problems in\n$2^{O(k\\log{k})}n^{1+o(1)}$ time. We show that these algorithms are near\noptimal since even a $(3/2-\\delta)$-approximation algorithm that runs in time\n$2^{o(k)}n^{2-\\epsilon}$ would refute the plausible assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 07:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

In this work an analytic model is formulated to simulate this\neffect. The deformation time scale of a galaxy in a cluster is usually much\nshorter than the time scale of change of the tidal force; the dynamical process\nof the tidal interaction within the galaxy can thus be ignored. An equilibrium\nshape of a galaxy is then assumed to be the surface of equipotential, which is\nthe sum of the self-gravitational potential of the galaxy and the tidal\npotential of the cluster at this location. We use a Monte-Carlo method to\ncalculate the radial orientation distribution of these galaxies, by assuming\nthe NFW mass profile of the cluster and the initial ellipticity of field\ngalaxies. The radial angles show a single peak distribution centered at zero.\nThe Monte-Carlo simulations also show that a shift of the reference center from\nthe real cluster center weakens the anisotropy of the radial angle\ndistribution. Therefore, the expected radial alignment cannot be revealed if\nthe distribution of spatial position angle is used instead of that of radial\nangle. The observed radial orientations of elliptical galaxies in cluster\nAbell~2744 are consistent with the simulated distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 07:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-23"}

A biframe spacetime is initiated to describe such a\nquantum gravity theory. The gravifield sided on both locally flat noncoordinate\nspacetime and globally flat Minkowski spacetime is an essential ingredient for\ngauging global spin and scaling symmetries. The locally flat gravifield\nspacetime spanned by the gravifield is associated with a noncommutative\ngeometry characterized by a gauge-type field strength of the gravifield. A\ncoordinate-independent and gauge-invariant action for the quantum gravity is\nbuilt in the gravifield basis. In the coordinate basis, we derive equations of\nmotion for all quantum fields including the gravitational effect and obtain\nbasic conservation laws for all symmetries. The equation of motion for\ngravifield tensor is deduced in connection directly with the total\nenergy-momentum tensor. When the spin and scaling gauge symmetries are broken\ndown to a background structure that possesses the global Lorentz and scaling\nsymmetries, we obtain exact solutions by solving equations of motion for the\nbackground fields in a unitary basis. The massless graviton and massive spinon\nresult as physical quantum degrees of freedom. The resulting Lorentz-invariant\nand conformally flat background gravifield space-time is characterized by a\ncosmic vector with a nonzero cosmological mass scale. The conformal size of the\nUniverse becomes singular at the cosmological horizon and turns out to be\ninflationary.

Anchoring the SLIP for lossy\nphysical systems resulted in newer models which are extended versions of\noriginal SLIP with viscous damping in the leg. However, such lossy models\nrequire an additional mechanism for pumping energy to the system to control the\nlocomotion and to reach a limit-cycle. Some studies solved this problem by\nadding an actively controllable torque actuation at the hip joint and this\nactuation has been successively used in many robotic platforms, such as the\npopular RHex robot. However, hip torque actuation produces forces on the COM\ndominantly at forward direction with respect to ground, making height control\nchallenging especially at slow speeds. The situation becomes more severe when\nthe horizontal speed of the robot reaches zero, i.e. steady hoping without\nmoving in horizontal direction, and the system reaches to singularity in which\nvertical degrees of freedom is completely lost. To this end, we propose an\nextension of the lossy SLIP model with a slider-crank mechanism, SLIP- SCM,\nthat can generate a stable limit-cycle when the body is constrained to vertical\ndirection. We propose an approximate analytical solution to the nonlinear\nsystem dynamics of SLIP- SCM model to characterize its behavior during the\nlocomotion.

A specific feature, which we call the bordering\neffect, is revealed: some local extrema of B_v are bordered with areas of\nlocally enhanced B_h. This effect suggests a fountainlike spatial structure of\nthe magnetic field near the B_v extrema, which is also hardly compatible with\nthe emergence of a flux-tube loop.

In this paper, we focus on the\nspectral characteristics and the origin of the emission lines, and the phases\nof carbon-bearing species in the N159 star-forming region in the LMC.

Long-range\ninteractions are incorporated through an efficient and second-order accurate\nimmersed boundary method (IBM). Short-range interactions are also partly\nreproduced by the IBM. However, since the IBM uses a fixed-grid, a lubrication\nmodel is needed for an inter-particle gap width smaller than the grid spacing.\nThe lubrication model is based on asymptotic expansions of analytical solutions\nfor canonical lubrication interactions between spheres in the Stokes regime.\nRoughness effects are incorporated by making the lubrication correction\nindependent of the gap width for gap widths smaller than $\\sim 1\\%$ of the\nparticle radius. This correction is applied until the particles reach\nsolid-solid contact. To model solid-solid contact we use a variant of a linear\nsoft-sphere collision model capable of stretching the collision time. This\nchoice is computationally attractive because it allows to reduce the number of\ntime steps required for integrating the collision force accurately and is\nphysically realistic, provided that the prescribed collision time is much\nsmaller than the characteristic timescale of particle motion.

Many dynamic analysis techniques are performed on\nthe exploitation of execution traces from test cases. However, in practice,\nthere is only one trace that results from the execution of one manually-written\ntest case.\n  Objective: In this paper, we propose a new technique of test suite\nrefactoring, called B-Refactoring. The idea behind B-Refactoring is to split a\ntest case into small test fragments, which cover a simpler part of the control\nflow to provide better support for dynamic analysis.\n  Method: For a given dynamic analysis technique, our test suite refactoring\napproach monitors the execution of test cases and identifies small test cases\nwithout loss of the test ability. We apply B-Refactoring to assist two existing\nanalysis tasks: automatic repair of if-statements bugs and automatic analysis\nof exception contracts.\n  Results: Experimental results show that test suite refactoring can\neffectively simplify the execution traces of the test suite. Three real-world\nbugs that could previously not be fixed with the original test suite are fixed\nafter applying B-Refactoring; meanwhile, exception contracts are better\nverified via applying B-Refactoring to original test suites.\n  Conclusions: We conclude that applying B-Refactoring can effectively improve\nthe purity of test cases.

The performances of this test are illustrated by Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 13:11:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 10:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

The energy band is then divided\ninto a subcritical regime with the usual unique correspondence between wave\nnumber and energy of the travelling waves, and a supercritical regime, in which\nwaves of different wave number are degenerate in energy.

To avoid\nattacks, a brute force approach is to restrict the mixing at the source.\nHowever, source restricted NC generally reduces the robustness of the code in\nthe face of errors, losses and mobility induced intermittence. CB-MANETs\nintroduce a new option. Caching is common in CB MANETs and a fully reassembled\ncached file can be viewed as a new source.

The relation between the\nshift-invariant spaces generated by the cardinal functions and those generated\nby the multiquadrics themselves is considered. Additionally, $L_p$ error\nestimates in terms of the dilation $h$ are considered for the associated\ncardinal interpolation scheme. This analysis expands the range of $\\alpha$\nvalues which were previously known to give such convergence rates (i.e.\n$O(h^k)$ for functions with derivatives of order up to $k$ in $L_p$,\n$1<p<\\infty$). Additionally, the analysis here demonstrates that some known\nbest approximation rates for multiquadric approximation are obtained by their\ncardinal interpolants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 18:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 16:23:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 19:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 21:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-12"}

The present paper describes\ncomputed total energies and \"SWB-tension\" energies (often referred to as\n\"strain\" energies) for species having $n$ adamantane or diamantane units\nsharing pairwise: one carbon atom (spiro-[n]adamantane or\nspiro-[$n$]diamantane); one C-C bond (one-bond-sharing-[$n$]adamantane or\none-bond-sharing-[$n$]diamantane); or one chair-shaped hexagon of carbon atoms\n(1234-helical-cata-[$n$]diamantanes). Each of the five investigated\npolymer-like types is considered either as an acyclic or a cyclic chain of\nadamantane- or diamantane-unit cages. With increasing $n$ values, SWB-tension\nenergies for acyclic aggregates are found to increase linearly, while the net\nSWB-tension energies of cyclic aggregates often go thru a minimum at a suitable\nvalue of $n$. In all five cases, a limiting common energy per unit ($E/n$ ) is\nfound to be approached by both cyclic and acyclic chains as $n\\to \\infty $, as\nrevealed from plots of $E/n$ versus $1/n$ for acyclic chains and of $E/n$\nversus $1/n^2$ for cyclic chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 20:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}
