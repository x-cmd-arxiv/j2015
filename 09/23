The halo bias of high redshift halos ($z \\geq 2$) is found to be\nstrongly non-linear and scale-dependent on quasi-linear scales that are larger\nthan their virial radii ($0.5-10$ Mpc/h). However, at lower redshifts, the\nscale-dependence of non-linear bias is weaker and and is of the order of a few\npercent on quasi-linear scales at $z \\sim 0$. We find that the redshift\nevolution of the scale dependent bias of dark matter halos can be expressed as\na function of four physical parameters: the peak height of halos, the\nnon-linear matter correlation function at the scale of interest, an effective\npower law index of the {\\it rms} linear density fluctuations and the matter\ndensity of the universe at the given redshift. This suggests that the\nscale-dependence of halo bias is not a universal function of the dark matter\npower spectrum, which is commonly assumed.

Beside that most of those conditions suffer from the\ndrawback of a potentially singular integral representations. However, we can\nhave various orders of approximation by normal distributions, e.g. Berry-Essen\nTypes and Edgeworth types. In this paper we indicate that for Berry-Essen Types\nof normal approximation and related asymptotic normality of generalized Hill\nestimators, we do not necessarily need 2nd order regularity conditions and we\ncan apply only Karamata's representation for regularly varying tails. 2nd order\nregularity conditions however better relates to Edgeworth types of normal\napproximations, albeit requiring larger data samples for their proper check.\nFinally both expansions are prone for bootstrap and other subsampling\ntechniques.

We develop a fully coupled\nfluid-solid-electric model by combining the inviscid vortex sheet model with a\nlinear electro-mechanical coupling model. A resistance only circuit and a\nresonant resistance-inductance (RL) circuit are considered. For a purely\nresistive circuit, an increased electro-mechanical coupling factor results in\nan increased flutter speed, vibration frequency, averaged electric power and\nefficiency. A consistent optimal resistance is found that maximizes the flutter\nspeed and the energy harvesting power. For a resonant RL circuit, by tuning the\ninductance to match the circuit frequency to the flag's vibration frequency,\nthe flutter speed can be greatly decreased, and a larger averaged power and\nefficiency are obtained. We also consider a model scale set-up with several\ncommonly used commercial materials for operating in air and water. Typical\nranges of dimensionless parameters are obtained for four types of material that\nspan a wide range of solid density and rigidity values.

The quantum\nvariance generalizes the concept of thermal de Broglie wavelength (for the\nposition of a free quantum particle) to the space of eigenvalues of any\nobservable, quantifying the degree of coherent delocalization in that space.\nThe quantum variance is generically measurable and computable as the difference\nbetween the static fluctuations and the static susceptibility of the\nobservable; despite its simplicity, it is found to provide a tight lower bound\nto most widely accepted estimators of \"quantumness\" of observables (both as a\nfeature as well as a resource), such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information and\nthe quantum Fisher information. When considering bipartite fluctuations in an\nextended quantum system, the quantum variance expresses genuine quantum\ncorrelations (of discord type) among the two parts. In the case of many-body\nsystems it is found to obey an area law at finite temperature, extending\ntherefore area laws of entanglement and quantum fluctuations of pure states to\nthe mixed-state context.

However, a detailed study of the validity of this assumption is\ncurrently missing. We aim to test whether departures from azimuthal\npolarization can naturally be produced by scattering processes in optically\nthick protoplanetary disks at near infrared wavelengths. We use the radiative\ntransfer code MCFOST to create a generic model of a transition disk using\ndifferent grain size distributions and dust masses. From these models we\ngenerate synthetic polarized images at 2.2\\mum. We find that even for moderate\ninclinations (e.g., i = 40degr), multiple scattering alone can produce\nsignificant (up to ~4.5% of the Q_phi image) non-azimuthal polarization\nreflected in the U_phi images. We also find that different grain populations\ncan naturally produce radial polarization (negative values in the Q_phi\nimages). Our results suggest that caution is recommended when interpreting\npolarized images by only analyzing the Q_phi and U_phi images. We find that\nthere can be astrophysical signal in the U_phi images and negative values in\nthe Q_phi images, which indicate departures from azimuthal polarization. If\nsignificant signal is detected in the U_phi images, we recommend to check the\nstandard Q and U images to look for departures from azimuthal polarization. On\nthe positive side, signal in the U_phi images once all instrumental and\ndata-reduction artifacts have been corrected for means that there is more\ninformation to be extracted regarding the dust population and particle density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 20:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Research\nof the Saturnian satellite surfaces has clear implications for Saturn history\nand surroundings. In a recent paper, the production of craters on the mid sized\nSaturnian satellites by Centaur objects was calculated considering the current\nSolar System. We have compared our results with crater counts from Cassini\nimages and we have noted that the number of observed small craters is less than\nour calculated number. In this paper we estimate the age of the surface for\neach observed terrain on each mid sized satellite of Saturn. We have noticed\nthat since there are less observed small craters than calculated (except on\nIapetus), this results in younger ages. This could be the result of efficient\nendogenous or exogenous process(es) for erasing small craters and or crater\nsaturation at those sizes. The size limit from which the observed number of\nsmaller craters is less than the calculated is different for each satellite,\npossibly indicating processes that are unique to each, but other potential\ncommon explanations would be crater saturation and or deposition of E ring\nparticles. These processes are also suggested by the findings that the smaller\ncraters are being preferentially removed, and the erasure process is gradual.\nOn Enceladus, only mid and high latitude plains have remnants of old terrains;\nthe other regions could be young; the regions near the South Polar Terrain\ncould be as young as 50 Myr old. On the contrary for Iapetus, all the surface\nis old and it notably registers a primordial source of craters. As the crater\nsize is decreased, it would be perceived to approach saturation until D less\nthan 2 km craters, where saturation is complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 20:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

Previous studies indicate that this\nfailure is related to pre-existing immune response to antigens that are common\nto environmental sources of mycobacterial antigens and Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis. Specifically, two different mechanisms have been hypothesized:\nthe masking, (previous sensitization confers some level of protection against\nTB), and the blocking (previous immune response prevent vaccine taking of a new\nTB vaccine), effects. In this work we introduce a series of models to\ndiscriminate between masking and blocking mechanisms and address their relative\nlikelihood.

However,\napplication of MPC can be computationally demanding, and typically requires\nestimating the state of the system, which can be challenging in complex,\nunstructured environments. Reinforcement learning can in principle forego the\nneed for explicit state estimation and acquire a policy that directly maps\nsensor readings to actions, but is difficult to apply to unstable systems that\nare liable to fail catastrophically during training before an effective policy\nhas been found. We propose to combine MPC with reinforcement learning in the\nframework of guided policy search, where MPC is used to generate data at\ntraining time, under full state observations provided by an instrumented\ntraining environment. This data is used to train a deep neural network policy,\nwhich is allowed to access only the raw observations from the vehicle's onboard\nsensors. After training, the neural network policy can successfully control the\nrobot without knowledge of the full state, and at a fraction of the\ncomputational cost of MPC.

To understand the origin of galaxy\nalignments on small scales, one must investigate how galaxies were accreted in\nthe early universe and quantify their primordial anisotropic at the time of\naccretion. In this paper we use N-body simulations to investigate the accretion\nof dark matter subhaloes, focusing on their alignment with the host halo shape\nand the orientation of mass distribution on large scale, defined using the\nhessian matrix of the density field. The large/small (e1/e3) eigenvalues of the\nhessian matrix define the fast/slow collapse direction of dark matter on large\nscale. We find that: 1) the halo major axis is well aligned with the e3 (slow\ncollapse) direction, and it is stronger for massive haloes; 2) subhaloes are\npredominately accreted along the major axis of the host halo, and the alignment\nincreases with the host halo mass. Most importantly, this alignment is\nuniversal; 3) accretion of subhaloes with respect to the e3 direction is not\nuniversal. In massive haloes, subhaloes are accreted along the e3 (even\nstronger than the alignment with the halo major axis), but in low-mass haloes\nsubhaloes are accreted perpendicular to the e3. The transit mass is lower at\nhigh redshift. The last result well explains the puzzled correlation (both in\nrecent observations and simulations) that massive galaxies/haloes have their\nspin perpendicular to the filament, and the spin of low-mass galaxies/haloes is\nslightly aligned with the filament, under the assumption that the orbital\nangular momentum of subhaloes is converted to halo spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 22:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

For smooth migration, the\nsecular spin-orbit resonance mechanism can tilt Saturn's spin axis to the\ncurrent obliquity if the product of the migration time scale and the orbital\ninclinations is sufficiently large (exceeding 30 Myr deg). For the resonant\nNice model with imposed migration, it is difficult to reproduce today's\nobliquity values, because the compactness of the initial system raises the\nfrequency that tilts Saturn above the spin precession frequency of Jupiter,\ncausing a Jupiter spin-orbit resonance crossing.

Therefore, even though stress testing on real TV\nsets is tedious, it is the de facto approach to ensure the reliability of these\napplications in the industry. In this paper, we study to what extent stress\ntesting of smart TV applications can be fully automated in the industrial\nenvironments. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work has addressed this\nimportant question. We summarize the find-ings collected from 10 industrial\ntest engineers to have tested 20 such TV applications in a real production\nenvironment.

With such supports, 87%\nof the industrial test specifications of one TV model can be fully automated\nand 71.4% of them were found to be fully reusable to test a subsequent TV model\nwith major up-grades of hardware, operating system and application. It\nrepre-sents a significant improvement with margins of 28% and 38%,\nrespectively, compared to stress testing without such supports.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 06:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

In particular, we focus on the role of the\nmomentum-dependence of the two-particle interaction V(q). Usually, V(q) is\nassumed to be a constant and integrals are regularized in the ultraviolet `by\nhand' employing an ad hoc procedure. As the momentum dependence of the\ninteraction is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense this does not\naffect the universal low-energy properties of the model, e.g. exponents of\npower laws, if all energy scales are sent to zero. If, however, the momentum k\nis fixed away from the Fermi momentum k_F, with |k-k_F| setting a nonvanishing\nenergy scale, the details of V(q) start to matter. We provide strong evidence\nthat any curvature of the two-particle interaction at small transferred\nmomentum q destroys power-law scaling of the momentum resolved spectral\nfunction as a function of energy.

The first one is a standard FPV model, built\npresuming the functional shape of the PDFs of the mixture fraction, Z, and of\nthe progress parameter, {\\Lambda}. In order to enhance the prediction\ncapabilities of such a model in high-speed reacting flows, a second approach is\nproposed employing the statistically most likely distribution (SMLD) techcnique\nto presume the joint PDF of Z and {\\Lambda}, without any assumption about their\nbehaviour. The standard and FPV-SMLD models have been developed using the low\nMach number assumption. In both cases, the temperature is evaluated by solving\nthe total-energy conservation equation, providing a more suitable approach for\nthe simulation of supersonic combustion. By comparison with experimental data,\nthe proposed SMLD model is shown to provide a clear improvement with respect to\nthe standard FPV model, especially in the auto-ignition and stabilization\nregions of the flame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 07:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

The first one is that it gives a quasi\nequilibrium description on how glassy systems explore the phase space in the\nslow relaxation part of their dynamics. The second one is that it gives an\nalternative way to obtain dynamical equations starting from a dynamical rule\nthat is static in spirit. This provides a way to overcome the difficulties\nencountered in the short time part of the dynamics where current conservation\nmust be enforced. We study this approach in detail in a prototypical mean field\ndisordered spin system, namely the p-spin spherical model, showing how we can\nobtain the well known equations that describes its dynamics. Then we apply the\nsame approach to structural glasses. We first derive a set of dynamical\nOrnstein-Zernike equations which are very general in nature. Finally we\nconsider two possible closure schemes for them, namely the Hypernetted Chain\napproximation of liquid theory and a closure of the BBGKY hierarchy that has\nbeen recently introduced by G.

Whereas the model of Piffl et al violated\nconstraints on the terminal-velocity curve, our model respects these\nconstraints by adopting a long scale length R_d=3.66 kpc for the thin and thick\ndiscs. The model is, however, inconsistent with the measured optical depth for\nmicrolensing of bulge stars because it attributes too large a fraction of the\ndensity at R <~ 3 kpc to dark matter rather than stars. Moreover, it now seems\nlikely that the thick disc's scale-length is significantly shorter than the\nmodel implies.

A maximum suppression by a\nfactor of 5-6 with respect to binary-scaled pp yields is observed for the most\ncentral collisions at $p_{\\rm T}$ of about 10 GeV/$c$. A suppression by a\nfactor of about 2-3 persists at the highest $p_{\\rm T}$ covered by the\nmeasurements. At low $p_{\\rm T}$ (1-3 GeV/$c$), the $R_{\\rm AA}$ has large\nuncertainties that span the range 0.35 (factor of about 3 suppression) to 1 (no\nsuppression). In all $p_{\\rm T}$ intervals, the $R_{\\rm AA}$ is larger in the\n30-50% centrality class compared to central collisions. The D-meson $R_{\\rm\nAA}$ is also compared with that of charged pions and, at large $p_{\\rm T}$,\ncharged hadrons, and with model calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 08:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 19:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Hence, error\nmitigation and recovery techniques are absolutely necessary to protect the FPGA\nhardware from soft errors arising due to such transient faults. In this paper,\na new efficient multi-bit error correcting method for FPGAs is proposed using\nadaptive cross parity check (ACPC) code. ACPC is easy to implement and the\nneeded decoding circuit is also simple. In the proposed scheme total\nconfiguration memory is partitioned into two parts. One part will contain ACPC\nhardware, which is static and assumed to be unaffected by any kind of errors.\nOther portion will store the binary file for logic, which is to be protected\nfrom transient error and is assumed to be dynamically reconfigurable (Partial\nreconfigurable area). Binary file from the secondary memory passes through ACPC\nhardware and the bits for forward error correction (FEC) field are calculated\nbefore entering into the reconfigurable portion. In the runtime scenario, the\ndata from the dynamically reconfigurable portion of the configuration memory\nwill be read back and passed through the ACPC hardware. The ACPC hardware will\ncorrect the errors before the data enters into the dynamic configuration\nmemory.

It is vital to robots to track objects accurately in these\napplications, so it is necessary to focus on tracking algorithms to improve the\nrobustness and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a robust object tracking\nalgorithm based on a hierarchical ensemble framework which can incorporate\ninformation including individual pixel features, local patches and holistic\ntarget models. The framework combines multiple ensemble models simultaneously\ninstead of using a single ensemble model individually. A discriminative model\nwhich accounts for the matching degree of local patches is adopted via a bottom\nensemble layer, and a generative model which exploits holistic templates is\nused to search for the object through the middle ensemble layer as well as an\nadaptive Kalman filter. We test the proposed tracker on challenging benchmark\nimage sequences.

They\ncan be divided into different families according to the relative mass of the\nco-orbital partners and the particularities of their movement. Janus and\nEpimetheus are unique in that they are the only known co-orbital pair of\ncomparable masses and thus the only known system in mutual horseshoe orbit.\n  Aims: We aim to establish whether the Janus-Epimetheus system might have\nformed by disruption of an object in the current orbit of Epimetheus.\n  Methods: We assumed that four large main fragments were formed and neglected\nsmaller fragments. We used numerical integration of the full N-body problem to\nstudy the evolution of different fragment arrangements. Collisions were assumed\nto result in perfectly inelastic merging of bodies. We statistically analysed\nthe outcome of these simulations to infer whether co-orbital systems might have\nformed from the chosen initial conditions.\n  Results: Depending on the range of initial conditions, up to 9% of the\nsimulations evolve into co-orbital systems. Initial velocities around the\nescape velocity of Janus yield the highest formation probability. Analysis of\nthe evolution shows that all co-orbital systems are produced via secondary\ncollisions. The velocity of these collisions needs to be low enough that the\nfragments can merge and not be destroyed. Generally, collisions are found to be\nfaster than an approximate cut-off velocity threshold. However, given a\nsufficiently low initial velocity, up to 15% of collisions is expected to\nresult in merging. Hence, the results of this study show that the considered\nformation scenario is viable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 11:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

The interest of studying the 16 Cyg system is that the two star have\nthe same age and the same initial composition.

We put forward\na principled mathematical formalism that describes human movements using an\noptimal control model in which the subject controls the jerk of the movement.\nWe construct the formalism by assuming that the movement a subject chooses to\nmake is better than the alternatives. We quantify the relative quality of\nmovements mathematically by specifying a cost functional that assigns a\nnumerical value to every possible movement; the subject makes the movement that\nminimizes the cost functional. We develop the mathematical structure of\nmovements that minimize a cost functional, and observe that this development\nparallels the development of analytical mechanics from the Principle of Least\nAction. We derive a constant of the motion for human movements that plays a\nrole that is analogous to the role that the energy plays in classical\nmechanics. We apply the formalism to the description of two movements: (1)\nrapid, targeted movements of a computer mouse, and (2) finger-tapping, and show\nthat the constant of the motion that we have derived provides a useful value\nwith which we can characterize the performance of the movements. In the case of\nrapid, targeted movements of a computer mouse, we show how the model of human\nmovement that we have developed can be made to agree with Fitts' law, and we\nshow how Fitts' law is related to the constant of the motion that we have\nderived. We finally show that solutions exist within the model of human\nmovements that exhibit an oscillatory character reminiscent of tremor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 16:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 19:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

These observations\nare extremely useful for constraining rotational evolution models of stars, as\nwell as for characterizing the generation of magnetic field. We recently\ndemonstrated that the impact of coronal magnetic field topology on the\nrotational braking of a star can be parametrized with a scalar parameter: the\nopen magnetic flux. However, without running costly numerical simulations of\nthe stellar wind, reconstructing the coronal structure of the large scale\nmagnetic field is not trivial. An alternative -broadly used in solar physics-\nis to extrapolate the surface magnetic field assuming a potential field in the\ncorona, to describe the opening of the field lines by the magnetized wind. This\ntechnique relies on the definition of a so-called source surface radius, which\nis often fixed to the canonical value of 2.5Rsun. However this value likely\nvaries from star to star. To resolve this issue, we use our extended set of\n2.5D wind simulations published in 2015, to provide a criteria for the opening\nof field lines as well as a simple tool to assess the source surface radius and\nthe open magnetic flux. This allows us to derive the magnetic torque applied to\nthe star by the wind from any spectropolarimetric observation.

Fits to the model constrain the median\nextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction of\nreddened stars. The resulting extinction map has >4 times better resolution\nthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of the\ndust column. There is superb morphological agreement between the new map and\nmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by Draine et al. 2014.\nHowever, the widely-used Draine & Li (2007) dust models overpredict the\nobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that M31's true dust mass\nis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed in\nDraine et al.

In the present study, the\nvariation of the pulse current waveforms over a wide range of reactive gas\nflows and pulse frequencies during a reactive HiPIMS process of Hf-N in an\nAr-N2 atmosphere illustrates that the discharge current waveform is a an\nexcellent indicator of the process conditions.

We self-consistently simulate\nthree-waved based plasma emission through all stages by using 2D, fully\nkinetic, electromagnetic particle-in-cell simulations of relaxing electron\nbeams using the EPOCH2D code.

Consider an optical network that is represented by a\nconnected, simple graph $G$. We assume all communication channels are\nbidirectional, so that all links and paths are undirected. It follows that\nthere are ${|G|\\choose 2}$ distinct node pairs associated with $G$, where $|G|$\nis the number of nodes in $G$. A path system $\\mathcal{P}$ of $G$ consists of\n${|G|\\choose 2}$ paths, one path to connect each of the node pairs. The global\npacking number of a path system $\\mathcal{P}$, denoted by\n$\\Phi(G,\\mathcal{P})$, is the minimum integer $k$ to guarantee the existence of\na mapping $\\omega:\\mathcal{P}\\to\\{1,2,\\ldots,k\\}$, such that\n$\\omega(P)\\neq\\omega(P')$ if $P$ and $P'$ have common edge(s).

We introduce the concept of ATTRACTOR NETWORK,\nin which the nodes are the distinct attractors of the system, and there is a\ndirectional link from one attractor to another if the system can be driven from\nthe former to the latter using restricted control perturbation. Introduction of\nthe attractor network allows us to formulate a controllability framework for\nnonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the underlying\nattractor network is more strongly connected, which can be quantified. We\ndemonstrate our control framework using examples from various models of\nexperimental GRNs. A finding is that, due to nonlinearity, noise can\ncounter-intuitively facilitate control of the network dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 15:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}
