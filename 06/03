This task generalizes several important problems such\nas multi-arm bandits, active search and the knapsack problem. We present an\nalgorithm, GP-Select, which utilizes prior knowledge about similarity be- tween\nitems, expressed as a kernel function. GP-Select uses Gaussian process\nprediction to balance exploration (estimating the unknown value of items) and\nexploitation (selecting items of high value). We extend GP-Select to be able to\ndiscover sets that simultaneously have high utility and are diverse. Our\npreference for diversity can be specified as an arbitrary monotone submodular\nfunction that quantifies the diminishing returns obtained when selecting\nsimilar items. Furthermore, we exploit the structure of the model updates to\nachieve an order of magnitude (up to 40X) speedup in our experiments without\nresorting to approximations. We provide strong guarantees on the performance of\nGP-Select and apply it to three real-world case studies of industrial\nrelevance: (1) Refreshing a repository of prices in a Global Distribution\nSystem for the travel industry, (2) Identifying diverse, binding-affine\npeptides in a vaccine de- sign task and (3) Maximizing clicks in a web-scale\nrecommender system by recommending items to users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 16:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

The refined models are stable with respect to all\nscalar fields at all $\\alpha$, no additional stabilization terms are required.\nThe scalar potential V has a nearly Minkowski minimum at small values of the\ninflaton field $\\varphi$, and an infinitely long dS valley of constant depth\nand width at large $\\varphi$. Because of the infinite length of this\nshift-symmetric valley, the initial value of the inflaton field at the Planck\ndensity is expected to be extremely large.

We employ a spherical\nshell code which we show accurately reproduces the results of a tree gravity\ncode for a collisionless star cluster. Streams from clusters on high\neccentricity orbits, $e\\gtrsim 0.6$, can spread out so much that the amount of\nmaterial at high enough surface density to stand out on the sky may be only a\nfew percent of the stream's total mass. Low eccentricity streams remain more\nspatially coherent, but sub-halos both broaden the stream and displace the\ncenterline with details depending on the orbits allowed within the potential.\nOverall, the majority of stream particles have changes in their total actions\nof only 1-2\\%, leaving the mean stream relatively undisturbed.

This correlation affects the\nmass-distribution in the Universe and leads to the off-diagonal correlations of\nthe density field modes in the form of the quadrupole anisotropy.\nInterestingly, this effect survives even after the tensor mode decays when it\nre-enters the horizon, known as the fossil effect. As a result, the\noff-diagonal correlation function between different Fourier modes of the\ndensity fluctuations can be thought as a way to probe the large-scale GW and\nthe mechanism of inflation behind the fossil effect. Models of single field\nslow roll inflation generically predict a very small quadrupole anisotropy in\nTSS while in models of multiple fields inflation this effect can be observable.\nTherefore this large scale quadrupole anisotropy can be thought as a\nspectroscopy for different inflationary models. In addition, in models of\nanisotropic inflation there exists quadrupole anisotropy in curvature\nperturbation power spectrum. Here we consider TSS in models of anisotropic\ninflation and show that the shape of quadrupole anisotropy is different than in\nsingle field models. In addition in these models the quadrupole anisotropy is\nprojected into the preferred direction and its amplitude is proportional to\n$g_* N_e$ where $N_e$ is the number of e-folds and $g_*$ is the amplitude of\nquadrupole anisotropy in curvature perturbation power spectrum.

A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled\nRenyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the Renyi family\nof entropies.

Refinements of entropy inequalities such as\nmonotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a\nconsequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled Renyi entropies.\nDue to the lack of convergence at $\\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether the\nswiveled Renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so\nthat the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 18:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 17:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 11:42:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 13:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

In the late phase of\nplanetary formation, when embryo-sized objects dominate the inner region of the\nsystem, asteroids are also present and can provide additional material for\nobjects inside the habitable zone (hereafter HZ). In this study, we make a\ncomparison of several binary star systems and their efficiency to move icy\nasteroids from beyond the snow-line into orbits crossing the HZ. We modeled a\nbelt of 10000 asteroids (remnants from the late phase of planetary formation\nprocess) beyond the snow-line. The planetesimals are placed randomly around the\nprimary star and move under the gravitational influence of the two stars and a\ngas giant. As the planetesimals do not interact with each other, we divided the\nbelt into 100 subrings which were separately integrated. In this statistical\nstudy, several double star configurations with a G-type star as primary are\ninvestigated. Our results show that small bodies also participate in bearing a\nnon-negligible amount of water to the HZ. The proximity of a companion moving\non an eccentric orbit increases the flux of asteroids to the HZ, which could\nresult into a more efficient water transport on a short timescale, causing a\nheavy bombardment. In contrast to asteroids moving under the gravitational\nperturbations of one G-type star and a gas giant, we show that the presence of\na companion star can not only favor a faster depletion of our disk of\nplanetesimals but can also bring 4 -- 5 times more water into the whole HZ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 19:18:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 13:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 07:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

We present the first stellar evolution\ncalculations using a prescription for semiconvection derived from extrapolation\nof direct numerical simulations of double-diffusive mixing down to stellar\nparameters. The dominant mode of semiconvection in stars is layered\nsemiconvection, where the layer height is an adjustable parameter analogous to\nthe mixing length in convection. The rate of mixing across the semiconvective\nregion is sensitively dependent on the layer height. We find that there is a\ncritical layer height that separates weak semiconvective mixing (where\nevolution is well-approximated by using the Ledoux criterion) from strong\nsemiconvective mixing (where evolution is well-approximated by using the\nSchwarzschild criterion). This critical layer height is much smaller than the\nminimum layer height expected from simulations so we predict that for realistic\nlayer heights, the evolution is nearly the same as a model ran with the\nSchwarzschild criterion. We also investigate the effects of compositional\ngradient smoothing, finding that it causes convective cores to artificially\nshrink in the absence of additional mixing beyond the convective boundary.\nLayered semiconvection with realistic layer heights provides enough such mixing\nthat stars will still evolve as if the Schwarzschild criterion is employed.\nFinally, we discuss the potential of detecting such semiconvection and its\nimplication on convective core sizes in solar-like oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 20:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump\noperates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of\nactivating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a\nconstant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a\nthermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the\nset-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g. when the occupants are\nnot at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential\ndecision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. A\nfirst challenge is that for most residential buildings a description of the\nthermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to\nobtain. A second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e.\nthe building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to\novercome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with\na batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated\nfor two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in\nthe winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the\nproposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4-9% during 100\nwinter days and by 9-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional\nconstant set-point strategy\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 20:46:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 16:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Limited\nstudies exist on the software architecture and APIs that enable WBOSC to\nperform and be integrated into a larger system. In this paper we address this\nby presenting ControlIt!, a new open-source software framework for WBOSC.\nUnlike previous implementations, ControlIt! is multi-threaded to increase servo\nfrequencies on standard PC hardware. A new parameter binding mechanism enables\ntight integration between ControlIt! and external processes via an extensible\nset of transport protocols.

Using\nthis testbed, we show that ControlIt! can achieve average servo latencies of\nabout 0.5ms when configured with two Cartesian position tasks, two orientation\ntasks, and a lower priority posture task. This is significantly higher than the\n5ms that was achieved using UTA-WBC, the prototype implementation of WBOSC that\nis both application and platform-specific.

Recently, we developped a fast\nstochastic forward model to predict weak-lensing peak counts. Our model is able\nto reconstruct the underlying distribution of observables for analyses. In this\nwork, we explore and compare various strategies for constraining parameter\nusing our model, focusing on the matter density $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ and the\ndensity fluctuation amplitude $\\sigma_8$. First, we examine the impact from the\ncosmological dependency of covariances (CDC). Second, we perform the analysis\nwith the copula likelihood, a technique which makes a weaker assumption\ncompared to the Gaussian likelihood. Third, direct, non-analytic parameter\nestimations are applied using the full information of the distribution. Fourth,\nwe obtain constraints with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an\nefficient, robust, and likelihood-free algorithm based on accept-reject\nsampling. We find that neglecting the CDC effect enlarges parameter contours by\n22%, and that the covariance-varying copula likelihood is a very good\napproximation to the true likelihood. The direct techniques work well in spite\nof noisier contours. Concerning ABC, the iterative process converges quickly to\na posterior distribution that is in an excellent agreement with results from\nour other analyses. The time cost for ABC is reduced by two orders of\nmagnitude. The stochastic nature of our weak-lensing peak count model allows us\nto use various techniques that approach the true underlying probability\ndistribution of observables, without making simplifying assumptions.

We track the\nevolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright\nlow/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO\nand time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or\nsimilar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is\ndramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and\nthe QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum.\nClearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean\nthat the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved\nspectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are\nconsistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low\ntemperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be\ndescribed by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum is similar\nto that of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor harmonic\nshow signs of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged\nspectrum. While the similarity between the harmonic and QPO spectra in the\nintermediate state can be produced from the angular dependence of Compton\nscattering in a single region, this cannot explain the dramatic differences\nseen in the soft state. Instead, we propose that the soft Compton region is\nlocated predominantly above the disc while the hard Compton is from the hotter\ninner flow. Our results therefore point to multiple possible mechanisms for\nproducing harmonic features in the power spectrum. The dominant mechanism in a\ngiven observation is likely a function of both inclination angle and inner disc\nradius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 01:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 02:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

The reconstruction process\ninvolves a number of free parameters and the computation of homology for a\nlarge number of simplices can be expensive. This paper is a study of how to\navoid a full (diffeomorphic) reconstruction and how to decrease the\ncomputational burden. Using trajectories from the classic Lorenz system, we\nreconstruct the dynamics using the method of delays, then build a parsimonious\nsimplicial complex---the \"witness complex\"---to compute its homology.\nSurprisingly, we find that the witness complex correctly resolves the homology\nof the underlying invariant set from noisy samples of that set even if the\nreconstruction dimension is well below the thresholds specified in the\nembedding theorems for assuring topological conjugacy between the true and\nreconstructed dynamics. We conjecture that this is because the requirements for\nreconstructing homology, are less stringent than those in the embedding\ntheorems. In particular, to faithfully reconstruct the homology, a\nhomeomorphism is sufficient---as opposed to a diffeomorphism, as is necessary\nfor the full dynamics. We provide preliminary evidence that a homeomorphism, in\nthe form of a delay-coordinate reconstruction map, may manifest at a lower\ndimension than that required to achieve an embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 05:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

However, some\nchannels may not be available (e.g., they are being used by the licensed users)\nand these existing algorithms would randomly replace the unavailable channels\nin the CH sequence. This random replacement is not effective, especially when\nthe number of unavailable channels is large.

A\nmajor problem is that successful optical flow control seems to require distance\nestimates, while optical flow is known to provide only the ratio of velocity to\ndistance. In this article, a novel, stability-based strategy is proposed to\nestimate distances with monocular optical flow and knowledge of the control\ninputs (efference copies). It is shown analytically that given a fixed control\ngain, the stability of a constant divergence control loop only depends on the\ndistance to the approached surface. At close distances, the control loop first\nstarts to exhibit self-induced oscillations, eventually leading to instability.\nThe proposed stability-based strategy for estimating distances has two major\nattractive characteristics. First, self-induced oscillations are easy for the\nrobot to detect and are hardly influenced by wind. Second, the distance can be\nestimated during a zero divergence maneuver, i.e., around hover. The\nstability-based strategy is implemented and tested both in simulation and with\na Parrot AR drone 2.0. It is shown that it can be used to: (1) trigger a final\napproach response during a constant divergence landing with fixed gain, (2)\nestimate the distance in hover, and (3) estimate distances during an entire\nlanding if the robot uses adaptive gain control to continuously stay on the\n'edge of oscillation'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 07:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Such\nfields can also create particles from the vacuum, the Klein paradox being\nclosely related to this process. We believe that the present work presents a\nconsistent solution of the latter problem. Quantizing the Dirac and scalar\nfields with time independent backgrounds, we have found in- and out-creation\nand annihilation operators that allow one to have particle interpretation of\nthe physical system under consideration. To justify the proposed\nidentification, we have performed a detailed mathematical and physical analysis\nof solutions of the corresponding relativistic wave equations with a subsequent\nQFT analysis. We elaborated a nonperturbative technique that allows one to\ncalculate all characteristics of zero-order processes such scattering,\nreflection, and electron-positron pair creation, and to calculate Feynman\ndiagrams that describe all characteristics of processes with interaction\nbetween the in-, out-particles and photons. These diagrams have formally the\nusual form, but contain special propagators. Expressions for these propagators\nin terms of in- and out-solutions are presented. We apply the elaborated\napproach to two popular exactly solvable cases: to the Sauter potential and to\nthe Klein step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 08:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 18:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 16:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 13:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 17:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

Researchers have captured this\nnaturalness of software through statistical models and used them to good effect\nin suggestion engines, porting tools, coding standards checkers, and idiom\nminers. This suggests that code that appears improbable, or surprising, to a\ngood statistical language model is \"unnatural\" in some sense, and thus possibly\nsuspicious. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis. We consider a large\ncorpus of bug fix commits (ca.~8,296), from 10 different Java projects, and we\nfocus on its language statistics, evaluating the naturalness of buggy code and\nthe corresponding fixes. We find that code with bugs tends to be more entropic\n(i.e., unnatural), becoming less so as bugs are fixed. Focusing on highly\nentropic lines is similar in cost-effectiveness to some well-known static bug\nfinders (PMD, FindBugs) and ordering warnings from these bug finders using an\nentropy measure improves the cost-effectiveness of inspecting code implicated\nin warnings. This suggests that entropy may be a valid language-independent and\nsimple way to complement the effectiveness of PMD or FindBugs, and that\nsearch-based bug-fixing methods may benefit from using entropy both for\nfault-localization and searching for fixes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 08:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 08:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

The diffusive shock acceleration mechanism has been widely accepted\nas the acceleration mechanism for galactic cosmic rays. While self-consistent\nhybrid simulations have shown how power-law spectra are produced, detailed\ninformation on the interplay of diffusive particle motion and the turbulent\nelectromagnetic fields responsible for repeated shock crossings are still\nelusive. Aims. The framework of test-particle theory is applied to investigate\nthe effect of diffusive shock acceleration by inspecting the obtained\ncosmic-ray energy spectra. The resulting energy spectra can be obtained this\nway from the particle motion and, depending on the prescribed turbulence model,\nthe influence of stochastic acceleration through plasma waves can be studied.\nMethods. A numerical Monte-Carlo simulation code is extended to include\ncollisionless shock waves. This allows one to trace the trajectories of test\nparticle while they are being accelerated. In addition, the diffusion\ncoefficients can be obtained directly from the particle motion, which allows\nfor a detailed understanding of the acceleration process. Results. The classic\nresult of an energy spectrum with $E^{-2}$ is only reproduced for parallel\nshocks, while, for all other cases, the energy spectral index is reduced\ndepending on the shock obliqueness.

Although acoustic model\npersonalization has been investigated for decades, much less work have been\nreported on personalizing language model, probably because of the difficulties\nin collecting enough personalized corpora. Previous work used the corpora\ncollected from social networks to solve the problem, but constructing a\npersonalized model for each user is troublesome. In this paper, we propose a\nuniversal recurrent neural network language model with user characteristic\nfeatures, so all users share the same model, except each with different user\ncharacteristic features. These user characteristic features can be obtained by\ncrowdsouring over social networks, which include huge quantity of texts posted\nby users with known friend relationships, who may share some subject topics and\nwording patterns. The preliminary experiments on Facebook corpus showed that\nthis proposed approach not only drastically reduced the model perplexity, but\noffered very good improvement in recognition accuracy in n-best rescoring\ntests.

The stellar structure\nduring CHeB is very uncertain because the growth of the convective core, and/or\nthe development of a semiconvection zone, is critically dependent on the\ntreatment of convective boundaries. In this study we calculate a suite of\nstellar structure models and their non-radial pulsations to investigate why the\npredicted asymptotic g-mode $\\ell = 1$ period spacing $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ is\nsystematically lower than is inferred from Kepler field stars. We find that\nonly models with large convective cores, such as those calculated with our\nnewly proposed \"maximal-overshoot\" scheme, can match the average $\\Delta\\Pi_1$\nreported. However, we also find another possible solution that is related to\nthe method used to determine $\\Delta\\Pi_1$: mode trapping can raise the\nobservationally inferred $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ well above its true value. Even after\naccounting for these two proposed resolutions to the discrepancy in average\n$\\Delta\\Pi_1$, models still predict more CHeB stars with low $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ ($ <\n270$ s) than are observed. We establish two possible remedies for this: i)\nthere may be a difficulty in determining $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ for early CHeB stars\n(when $\\Delta\\Pi_1$ is lowest) because of the effect that the sharp composition\nprofile at the hydrogen burning shell has on the pulsations, or ii) the mass of\nthe helium core at the flash is higher than predicted.

In the past, the edge counting is considered to\nbe the default method for the path computation, which is simple, intuitive and\nhas low computational complexity. However, a large lexical taxonomy of such as\nWordNet has the irregular densities of links between concepts due to its broad\ndomain but. The edge counting-based path computation is powerless for this\nnon-uniformity problem. In this paper, we advocate that the path computation is\nable to be separated from the edge-based similarity measures and form various\ngeneral computing models. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of\nnon-uniformity of concept density in a large taxonomic ontology, we propose a\nnew path computing model based on the compensation of local area density of\nconcepts, which is equal to the number of direct hyponyms of the subsumers of\nconcepts in their shortest path. This path model considers the local area\ndensity of concepts as an extension of the edge-based path and converts the\nlocal area density divided by their depth into the compensation for edge-based\npath with an adjustable parameter, which idea has been proven to be consistent\nwith the information theory. This model is a general path computing model and\ncan be applied in various edge-based similarity algorithms. The experiment\nresults show that the proposed path model improves the average correlation\nbetween edge-based measures with human judgments on Miller and Charles\nbenchmark from less than 0.8 to more than 0.85, and has a big advantage in\nefficiency than information content (IC) computation in a dynamic ontology,\nthereby successfully solving the non-uniformity problem of taxonomic ontology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 13:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

However, as we demonstrate in this letter, the production of\nentropy is not the only means by which a cosmological arrow of time may emerge.\nRemarkably, systems which are dissipationless may nevertheless demonstrate a\npreferred direction of time provided they possess attractors. An example of a\nsystem with well defined attractors is scalar-field driven cosmology. In this\ncase, for a wide class of potentials (especially those responsible for\ninflation), the attractor equation of state during expansion can have the form\n$p \\simeq -\\rho$, and during contraction $p \\simeq \\rho$. If the resulting\ncosmology is cyclic, then the presence of cosmological hysteresis, $\\oint p~dV\n\\neq 0$ during successive cycles, causes an arrow of time to emerge in a system\nwhich is formally dissipationless. An important analogy is drawn between the\narrow of time in cyclic cosmology and an arrow of time in an $N$-body system of\ngravitationally interacting particles.

This scenario can be an\nalternative to the standard flare model, where particles are accelerated only\nin a small volume located in the upper corona. We use a combination of MHD\nsimulations and test-particle methods, which describe the development of kink\ninstability and magnetic reconnection in twisted coronal loops using resistive\ncompressible MHD, and incorporate atmospheric stratification and large-scale\nloop curvature. The resulting distributions of hot plasma let us estimate\nthermal X-ray emission intensities. The electric and magnetic fields obtained\nare used to calculate electron trajectories using the guiding-centre\napproximation.

From 2006 to 2010 we obtained 121 high-resolution\nand high-S/N \\'{e}chelle spectra of this object. Spectral disentangling yields\nthe individual spectra of all three stars, and greatly improved elements both\nthe inner and outer orbits. We find masses of $M_{\\rm A} = 3.39\\pm0.06$\nM$_\\odot$, $M_{\\rm B} = 0.770\\pm0.009$ M$_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm C} = 1.58\\pm0.09$\nM$_\\odot$. The disentangled spectra also give the light ratios between the\ncomponents in the $B$ and $V$ bands. Atmospheric parameters for the three stars\nare determined, including detailed elemental abundances for Algol A and Algol\nC. We find the following effective temperatures: $T_{\\rm A} = 12\\,550\\pm120$ K,\n$T_{\\rm B} = 4900\\pm300$ K and $T_{\\rm C} = 7550\\pm250$ K.

This is the first measurement of the rotational velocity for Algol B, and\nconfirms that it is synchronous with the orbital motion. The abundance patterns\nof components A and C are identical to within the measurement errors, and are\nbasically solar. They can be summarised as mean metal abundances: [M/H]$_{\\rm\nA} = -0.03\\pm0.08$ and [M/H]$_{\\rm C} = 0.04\\pm0.09$. A carbon deficiency is\nconfirmed for Algol A, with tentative indications for a slight overabundance of\nnitrogen.
