In order to solve this problem, we propose to relax the\nperiodicity condition in one direction (say, the $k_z$ direction) so that a\ngauge discontinuity is introduced on a 2D $\\mathbf{k}$ plane normal to $k_z$.\nThe total $\\theta$ response then has contributions from both the integral of\nthe Chern-Simons 3-form over the 3D bulk BZ and the gauge discontinuity\nexpressed as a 2D integral over the $\\mathbf{k}$ plane. Sometimes the boundary\nplane may be further divided into subregions by 1D \"vortex loops\" which make a\nthird kind of contribution to the total $\\theta$, expressed as a combination of\nBerry phases around the vortex loops. The total $\\theta$ thus consists of three\nterms which can be expressed as integrals over 3D, 2D and 1D manifolds. When\ntime-reversal symmetry is present and the gauge in the bulk BZ is chosen to\nrespect this symmetry, both the 3D and 2D integrals vanish; the entire\ncontribution then comes from the vortex-loop integral, which is either 0 or\n$\\pi$ corresponding to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of 3D time-reversal\ninvariant insulators. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the\nFu-Kane-Mele model with an applied staggered Zeeman field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 17:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

In the presence of a magnetic field $h$, the Hamiltonian possesses\ncompeting interactions between a $Z_2$-invariant easy-axis ferromagnetic\ninteraction $J_{\\pm\\pm}$ and a frustrated Ising term $J_z$. As in the\nU(1)-invariant model, we obtain four classical distinctive phases, however, the\nclassical phases in the $Z_2$-invariant model are different.

The MSGP framework enables the use of Gaussian processes (GPs)\non billions of datapoints, without requiring distributed inference, or severe\nassumptions. In particular, MSGP reduces the standard $O(n^3)$ complexity of GP\nlearning and inference to $O(n)$, and the standard $O(n^2)$ complexity per test\npoint prediction to $O(1)$. MSGP involves 1) decomposing covariance matrices as\nKronecker products of Toeplitz matrices approximated by circulant matrices.\nThis multi-level circulant approximation allows one to unify the orthogonal\ncomputational benefits of fast Kronecker and Toeplitz approaches, and is\nsignificantly faster than either approach in isolation; 2) local kernel\ninterpolation and inducing points to allow for arbitrarily located data inputs,\nand $O(1)$ test time predictions; 3) exploiting block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block\nstructure (BTTB), which enables fast inference and learning when\nmultidimensional Kronecker structure is not present; and 4) projections of the\ninput space to flexibly model correlated inputs and high dimensional data. The\nability to handle many ($m \\approx n$) inducing points allows for near-exact\naccuracy and large scale kernel learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 19:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

The Gaia project will determine positions, proper motions, and\nparallaxes for more than one billion stars in our Galaxy. It is known that\nGaia's two telescopes are affected by a small but significant variation of the\nbasic angle between them. Unless this variation is taken into account during\ndata processing, e.g. using on-board metrology, it causes systematic errors in\nthe astrometric parameters, in particular a shift of the parallax zero-point.\nPreviously, we suggested an early reduction of Gaia data for the subset of\nTycho-2 stars (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution; TGAS).\n  Aims. We aim to investigate whether quasars can be used to independently\nverify the parallax zero-point already in early data reductions.

We repeat TGAS simulations but additionally include simulated Gaia\nobservations of quasars from ground-based surveys. All observations are\nsimulated with basic angle variations. To obtain a full astrometric solution\nfor the quasars in TGAS we explore the use of prior information for their\nproper motions.\n  Results.

Archival pre-explosion Subaru Telescope Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space\nTelescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images of the region obtained in 2009\nshow a coincident source that is most likely a compact massive star cluster in\nNGC 7331 that hosted the progenitor system. By comparing the emission\nproperties of the source with stellar population models that incorporate\ninteracting binary stars we estimate the age of the host cluster to be 30 - 300\nMyr, and favor ages closer to 30 Myr in light of relatively strong Halpha\nemission. SN 2014C is the best-observed member of a class of core-collapse\nsupernovae that fill the gap between events that interact strongly with dense,\nnearby environments immediately after explosion and those that never show signs\nof interaction. Better understanding of the frequency and nature of this\nintermediate population can contribute valuable information about the poorly\nunderstood final stages of stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Observations and surveys have shown that the number of sources\nincreases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-called\nLLAGNs). Furthermore, many AGNs show changes in their obscuration properties at\nX-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretion\ndisk. However, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsic\ncontinuum of the source. It is therefore important to study nearby AGN to\nbetter understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood of\nthe nucleus. We aim to study the nuclear obscuration of LLAGN NGC835 and its\nextended emission using mid-infrared observations. We present mid-infrared 11.5\nmicrons imaging of the LLAGN galaxy NGC835 obtained with the instrument\nCanariCam in the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC), archival Spitzer/IRS\nspectroscopy, and archival Chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. The\nGTC/CanariCam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6\narcsec. We obtained a nuclear flux of F(11.5 microns) ~18 mJy, whereas the\nextended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. This\nmeans that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) IRS spectrum is dominated by\nthis extended emission and not by the AGN, clearly seen in the Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum. Although the extended soft X-ray emission shows some resemblance with\nthat of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at X-rays are mostly located in the\ninner side of this mid-infrared emission. The nuclear X-ray spectrum of the\nsource has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. We argue\nthat this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~\n8x10E+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10E+23 cm-2. NGC835 therefore is one of the few LLAGN,\ntogether with NGC1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 21:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The\ngoals of an agent in a multi-agent world may involve manipulating the knowledge\nand beliefs of other agents' and again, not just their knowledge/belief about\nthe world, but also their knowledge about other agents' knowledge about the\nworld.

Graphlets are particularly well suited to compare networks and\nto assess their level of similarity but are almost always used as small\nundirected graphs of up to five nodes, thus limiting their applicability in\ndirected networks.

Commonly Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are invoked to\nfulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic of\nmuch debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression and\nenhancement of star-formation in AGN hosts. Using the ZFOURGE and NMBS galaxy\nsurveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited\n(M$_{\\odot}$ $\\ge$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), high-luminosity (L$_{1.4}$ $>$\n10$^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) sample of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei to a\nredshift of z = 2.25. In contrast to low redshift studies, which associate\nradio-AGN activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z $>$ 1.5\nradio-AGN are hosted by star-forming galaxies. Indeed, the stellar populations\nof radio-AGN are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistent\nwith the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy population. Interestingly, we find the\nradio-AGN fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 $\\le$ z $<$\n2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-AGN duty cycle has little dependence on\nredshift or galaxy type. We do however see a strong relation between the\nradio-AGN fraction and stellar mass, with radio-AGN becoming rare below $\\sim$\n10$^{10.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ or a halo-mass of 10$^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. This halo-mass\nthreshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-AGN\nfeedback at this mass limit. Despite this we find that radio-AGN host\nstar-formation rates are consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy\nsample, suggesting that while radio-AGN are in the right place to suppress\nstar-formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible for\ndoing so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 05:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

For this reason, designing quantum information processes with\nHamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile\nchallenge. Enabling error suppression with two-local Hamiltonians is\nparticularly challenging. A no-go theorem of Marvian and Lidar [Physical Review\nLetters 113(26), 260504 (2014)] demonstrates that, even allowing particles with\nhigh Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information\nfrom single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian\ncontaining only commuting two-local terms. Here, we get around this no-go\nresult by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of\nnon-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem\ncode. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against\nsingle-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge\ngenerators from Bacon-Shor codes [Physical Review A 73(1), 012340 (2006)] and\ngeneralized-Bacon-Shor code [Physical Review A 83(1), 012320 (2011)]. Our\nresults imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more\nerror-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. While far from\nproviding full fault tolerance, this approach improves the robustness\nachievable in near-term implementable quantum storage and adiabatic quantum\ncomputations, reducing the number of higher-order terms required to encode\ncommonly used adiabatic Hamiltonians such as the Ising Hamiltonians common in\nadiabatic quantum optimization and quantum annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 07:29:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 03:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 21:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We find that the most relevant differences from an\noptimization perspective are (i) predict models work in a low dimensional space\nwhere embedding vectors can interact heavily; (ii) since predict models have\nfewer parameters, they are less prone to overfitting.\n  Motivated by the insight of our analysis, we show how count models can be\nregularized in a principled manner and provide closed-form solutions for L1 and\nL2 regularization. Finally, we propose a new embedding model with a convex\nobjective and the additional benefit of being intelligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 10:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

Recently we discover that the thermal entropy of a free theory\non $\\mathbb{S}^3$ gets reduced by a universal constant term, $-N^2/4$, compared\nto that from completely deconfined colored states. This entropy deficit is due\nto the persistence of Gauss's law, and actually independent of the shape of the\nmanifold. In this paper we show that this universal term can be identified as\nthe topological entangle entropy both in the corresponding $4+1 D$ bulk theory\nand the dimensionally reduced theory. First, entanglement entropy in the bulk\ntheory contains the so-called \"particle\" contribution on the entangling\nsurface, which naturally gives rise to an area-law term. The topological term\nresults from the Gauss's constraint of these surface states. Secondly, the\nhigh-temperature limit also defines a dimensionally reduced theory. We\ncalculate the geometric entropy in the reduced theory explicitly, and find that\nit is given by the same constant term after subtracting the leading term of\n${\\mathcal O}(\\beta^{-1})$. The two procedures are then applied to the\nconfining phase, by extending the temperature to the complex plane.\nGeneralizing the recently proposed $2D$ modular description to an arbitrary\nmatter content, we show the leading local term is missing and no topological\nterm could be definitely isolated.

We show that in real space, the shapes of the\nGaussianized power spectra of both red and blue galaxies agree with that of the\nunderlying dark matter, with the initial power spectrum, and with each other to\nsmaller scales than do the statistics of the usual (untransformed) density\nfield.

We attribute this to the fact that red and blue\ngalaxies exhibit very different fingers of god in redshift space. After\napplying a finger-of-god compression, the agreement on small scales between the\nGaussianized power spectra is restored. We also compare the Gaussianization\ntransform to the clipped galaxy density field and find that while both methods\nare effective in real space, they have more complicated behaviour in redshift\nspace.

The question for the optimal numerical integration of\nmultivariate functions with non-trivial boundary data, in particular\nnon-periodic functions, arises. In this paper we give a general result that the\nasymptotic rate of the minimal worst-case integration error is not affected by\nboundary conditions in the above mentioned spaces. In fact, we propose two\ntailored modifications of Frolov's cubature formulae suitable for functions\nsupported on the cube (not in the cube) which provide the same minimal\nworst-case error up to a constant. This constant involves the norms of a\n``change of variable'' and a ``pointwise multiplication'' mapping,\nrespectively, between the function spaces of interest. In fact, we complement,\nextend and improve classical results by Bykovskii, Dubinin and Temlyakov on the\nboundedness of change of variable mappings in Besov-Sobolev spaces of mixed\nsmoothness. Our proof technique relies on a new characterization via integral\nmeans of mixed differences and maximal function techniques, general enough to\ntreat Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces at once. The second modification, which\nonly tackles the case of periodic functions, is based on a pointwise\nmultiplication and is therefore most likely more suitable for applications than\nthe (traditional) ``change of variable'' approach.

This pinning induces non-linearities\nin the crack propagation problem, even within Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics\ntheory, and modifies the overall failure properties of the material. For\nexample crack front pinning by tougher places could increase the fracture\nresistance of multilayer structures, with interesting technological\napplications. Analytical perturbation approaches, based on Bueckner-Rice\nelastic line models, focus on the crack front perturbations, hence allow for a\ndescription of these phenomena.

We study the effect of such a neglection\nfor the case of aligned-spin CBC searches for equal-spin (and non-spinning)\nbinary black holes in the context of two versions of Advanced LIGO: the\nupcoming 2015 version, known as early Advanced LIGO (eaLIGO) and its\nZero-Detuned High Energy Power version, that we will refer to as Advanced LIGO\n(AdvLIGO). In addition, we study the case of a non-spinning search for initial\nLIGO (iLIGO). We do this via computing the effectualness of the aligned-spin\nSEOBNRv1 ROM waveform family, which only considers quadrupolar modes, towards\nhybrid post-Newtonian/Numerical Relativity waveforms which contain higher order\nmodes. We find that for all LIGO versions, losses of more than $10\\%$ of events\noccur for mass ratio $q\\geq6$ and $M \\geq 100M_\\odot$ due to the neglection of\nhigher modes. Moreover, for iLIGO and eaLIGO, losses notably increase up to\n$(39,23)\\%$ respectively for the highest mass $(220M_\\odot)$ and mass ratio\n($q=8$) studied. For the case of early AdvLIGO, losses of $10\\%$ occur for\n$M>50M_\\odot$ and $q\\geq6$. Neglection of higher modes leads to\nobservation-averaged systematic parameter biases towards lower spin, total mass\nand chirp mass. For completeness, we perform a preliminar, non-exhaustive\ncomparison of systematic biases to statistical errors. We find that, for a\ngiven SNR, systematic biases dominate over statistical errors at much lower\ntotal mass for eaLIGO than for AdvLIGO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 13:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 12:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Recent experiments\nshow that naturally occurring processes such as resonance fluorescence from\nexcited states of an atom can exhibit weak value amplification effect. In this\npaper, we theoretically analyze the process of elastic resonance fluorescence\nfrom a V-type three level atomic system, using the well known Weiskopff-Wigner\n(W-W) theory of spontaneous emission.

The squared local roughness w_2 is defined as the variance of the\nheight inside a box of lateral size r and the LRD P_r(w_2) is sampled as this\nbox glides along a surface with size L >> r. The variation coefficient C and\nthe skewness S of the distributions are functions of the scaled box size r /\nxi, where xi(t) is a correlation length. For r <~ 0.3 xi, plateaus of C and S\nare observed, but with a small time dependence. For a quantitative\ncharacterization of the universal LRD, extrapolation of these values with\npower-law corrections in time are performed. The reliability of this procedure\nis confirmed in 1+1 dimensions by comparison of results of the restricted\nsolid-on-solid model and theoretically predicted values of Edwards-Wilkinson\ninterfaces. For r >> xi, C and S vanish because the LRD converges to a Dirac\ndelta function. This confirms the inadequacy of extrapolations of amplitude\nratios to r -> infinity, as proposed in recent works. On the other hand, it\nhighlights the advantage of scaling LRDs by the average instead of scaling by\nthe variance due to the usually higher accuracy of C compared to S. The scaled\nLRD of the VLDS model is very close to the KPZ one due to the small difference\nbetween their variation coefficients and the plateaus of C and S are very\nnarrow due to the slow time increase of xi.

At Earth, ions with\nenergies exceeding 100 keV are seen upstream of the bow shock when the magnetic\ngeometry is quasi-parallel, and large-scale supernova remnant shocks can\naccelerate ions into cosmic rays energies. This energization is attributed to\ndiffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become active the\nions must first be sufficiently energized. How and where this initial\nacceleration takes place has been one of the key unresolved issues in shock\nacceleration theory. Using Cluster spacecraft observations, we study the\nsignatures of ion reflection events in the turbulent transition layer upstream\nof the terrestrial bow shock, and with the support of a hybrid simulation of\nthe shock, we show that these reflection signatures are characteristic of the\nfirst step in the ion injection process. These reflection events develop in\nparticular in the region where the trailing edge of large-amplitude upstream\nwaves intercept the local shock ramp and the upstream magnetic field changes\nfrom quasi-perpendicular to quasi-parallel. The dispersed ion velocity\nsignature observed can be attributed to a rapid succession of ion reflections\nat this wave boundary. After the ions' initial interaction with the shock, they\nflow upstream along the quasi-parallel magnetic field. Each subsequent wave\nfront in the upstream region will sweep the ions back toward the shock, where\nthey gain energy with each transition between the upstream and the shock wave\nframes. Within three to five gyroperiods, some ions have gained enough parallel\nvelocity to escape upstream, thus completing the injection process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 13:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 12:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The analytical approximation for equation of state\nequation of state of Potekhin and Chabrier of fully ionized electron-ionic\nplasma was used for description of the ion-ion correlations (Coulomb\nnon-ideality) in combination with ``linear mixture'' (LM) approximation. Phase\nequilibrium for the charged species was calculated according to the\nGibbs-Guggenheim conditions. The presently considered BIM($\\sim$) model allows\nto calculate full set of parameters for phase boundaries of non-congruent\nvariant of phase equilibrium and to study all features for this non-congruent\nphase transition realization in Coulomb system in comparison with the simpler\n(standard) forced-congruent evaporation mode. In particular, in BIM($\\sim$)\nthere were reproduced two-dimensional remarkable (``banana-like'') structure of\ntwo-phase region $P-T$ diagram and the characteristic non-monotonic shape of\ncaloric phase enthalpy-temperature diagram, similar to the non-congruent\nevaporation of reactive plasma products in high-temperature heating with the\nuranium-oxygen system. The parameters of critical points (CP) line were\ncalculated on the entire range of proportions of ions $0<X<1$, including two\nreference values, when CP coincides with a point of extreme temperature and\nextreme pressure, $X_{T}$ and $X_{P}$. Finally, it is clearly demonstrated the\nlow-temperature property of non-congruent gas--liquid\ntransition---``distillation'', which is weak in chemically reactive plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 14:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

Two massive starless core candidates, C1-N & C1-S, have been\ndetected in IRDC G028.37+00.07 in $\\rm N_2D^+$(3-2) with $ALMA$. From their\nline widths, either the cores are subvirial and are thus young structures on\nthe verge of near free-fall collapse, or they are threaded by $\\sim1$ mG\n$B$-fields that help support them in near virial equilibrium and potentially\nhave older ages. We modeled the deuteration rate of $\\rm N_2H^+$ to constrain\ncollapse rates of the cores. First, to measure their current deuterium\nfraction, $D_{\\rm\n  frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}$ $\\equiv [\\rm N_2D^+]/[N_2H^+]$, we observed multiple\ntransitions of $\\rm N_2H^+$ and $\\rm N_2D^+$ with $CARMA$, $SMA$, $JCMT$,\n$NRO~45m$ and $IRAM~30m$, to complement the $ALMA$ data. For both cores we\nderived $D_{\\rm\n  frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}\\sim0.3$, several orders of magnitude above the cosmic\n[D]/[H] ratio. We then carried out chemodynamical modeling, exploring how\ncollapse rate relative to free-fall, $\\alpha_{\\rm ff}$, affects the level of\n$D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm N_2H^+}$ that is achieved from a given initial condition. To\nreach the observed $D_{\\rm frac}^{\\rm\n  N_2H^+}$, most models require slow collapse with $\\alpha_{\\rm\n  ff}\\sim0.1$, i.e., $\\sim1/10$th of free-fall. This makes it more likely that\nthe cores have been able to reach a near virial equilibrium state and we\npredict that strong $B$-fields will eventually be detected. The methods\ndeveloped here will be useful for measurement of the pre-stellar core mass\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 14:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

Asteroseismology is a valuable tool in the characterisation of\nstars and \\Kepler is an excellent observing facility to perform\nasteroseismology. Here we select a sample of 35 \\Kepler solar-type stars which\nhost transiting exoplanets (or planet candidates) with detected solar-like\noscillations. Using available \\Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 16 we\ncreate power spectra optimised for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. We\nidentify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by ``peak bagging''\nusing a Bayesian MCMC framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of\nquality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We\nreport the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars\nand frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to\nthe high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance\nmatrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These\nfrequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain\ntight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 15:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This setup has\nthe potential for revealing unprecedented features associated to the\nnon-trivial role of the spherical curvatures. For a proof of concept, we\nmeasure femtonewton double layer forces between polystyrene microspheres at\ndistances above $400$ nm by employing very soft optical tweezers, with\nstiffness of the order of fractions of a fN/nm. As a future application, we\npropose to tune the Casimir interaction between a metallic and a polystyrene\nmicrosphere in saline solution from attraction to repulsion by varying the salt\nconcentration. With those materials, the screened Casimir interaction may have\na larger magnitude than the unscreened one.

However, the\ncorresponding extremal positive maps can be presented graphically, as we\nattempt to do in the present paper. We understand that a positive map is\nextremal when the image of $\\mathcal{D}$, the set of density matrices, fills\nout $\\mathcal{D}$ maximally, in a certain sense. For the graphical presentation\nof a map we transform it to a standard form where it is unital and trace\npreserving. We present an iterative algorithm for the transformation, which\nconverges rapidly in all our numerical examples and presumably works for any\npositive map. This standard form of an entanglement witness is unique up to\nunitary product transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 15:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

In two dimensions,\nthis means counting walks in the first quadrant of the plane (possibly after a\nlinear transformation). But what about walks in non-convex cones? We\ninvestigate the two most natural cases: first, square lattice walks avoiding\nthe negative quadrant Q 1 = {(i, j) : i \\textless{} 0 and j \\textless{} 0}, and\nthen, square lattice walks avoiding the West quadrant Q 2 = {(i, j) : i\n\\textless{} j and i \\textless{} --j}. In both cases, the generating function\nthat counts walks starting from the origin is found to differ from a simple\nD-finite series by an algebraic one. We also obtain closed form expressions for\nthe number of n-step walks ending at certain prescribed endpoints, as a sum of\nthree hypergeometric terms. One of these terms already appears in the\nenumeration of square lattice walks confined to the cone {(i, j) : i +j $\\ge$ 0\nand j $\\ge$ 0}, known as Gessel's walks. In fact, the enumeration of Gessel's\nwalks follows, by the reflection principle, from the enumeration of walks\nstarting from (--1, 0) and avoiding Q 1. Their generating function turns out to\nbe purely algebraic (as the generating function of Gessel's walks). Another\napproach to Gessel's walks consists in counting walks that start from (--1, 1)\nand avoid the West quadrant Q 2.

The underlying finite\nvolume scheme is conservative and it is accurate up to the second order in\nspace. The main novelty consists in the motion of the grid. This new dynamic\naspect can be used to resolve better the areas with large solution gradients or\nany other special features. No interpolation procedure is employed, thus\nunnecessary solution smearing is avoided, and therefore, our method enjoys\nexcellent conservation properties. The resulting grid is completely\nredistributed according the choice of the so-called monitor function. Several\nmore or less universal choices of the monitor function are provided. Finally,\nthe performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on several examples\nstemming from the simple linear advection to the simulation of complex shallow\nwater waves. The exact well-balanced property is proven.

The field equations\nhave been solved by incorporating an empirical function f(t) in the expression\nrepresenting the conservation of matter. This function f(t) has been chosen to\naccount for a conversion of matter (both dark and baryonic) into some other\nform, possibly dark energy, which is known to be responsible for the\naccelerated expansion of universe. The requirement of a signature flip of the\ndeceleration parameter (q), which is evident from other studies, sets the\nboundary conditions to be satisfied by the function f(t), leading to the\nformulation of its time dependence. A simple empirical relation was initially\nassumed to represent the time dependence of f(t), and the constants in this\nexpression have been determined from these boundary conditions. The BD\nparameter has been found to have a negative value throughout the range of\nstudy. The dependence of BD parameter upon the scalar field has been depicted\ngraphically. A smooth transition of the universe, from a decelerated to an\naccelerated phase of expansion, is found to occur due to a conversion of matter\ninto dark energy. The gravitational constant is found to be increasing with\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 09:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

Yet there is an unshakable view that he was wrong on quantum physics.\nAlthough it may be a subject of considerable debate, the core of his allegedly\nwrong demurral was the insistence on finding an objective reality underlying\nthe manifestly bizarre behavior of quantum objects. The uncanny wave-particle\nduality of a quantum particle is a prime example. In view of the latest\ndevelopments, particularly in quantum field theory, objections of Einstein are\nsubstantially corroborated. Careful investigation suggests that a travelling\nquantum particle is a holistic wave packet consisting of an assemblage of\nirregular disturbances in quantum fields. It acts as a particle because only\nthe totality of all the disturbances in the wave packet yields the energy\nmomentum with the mass of a particle, along with its other conserved quantities\nsuch as charge and spin. Thus the wave function representing a particle is not\njust a fictitious mathematical construct but embodies a reality of nature as\nasserted by Einstein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 21:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 13:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}
