In this paper, we show that the per-pixel color statistics\nof natural scenes---without any spatial or semantic context---can by themselves\nbe a powerful cue for color constancy. Specifically, we describe an illuminant\nestimation method that is built around a \"classifier\" for identifying the true\nchromaticity of a pixel given its luminance (absolute brightness across color\nchannels). During inference, each pixel's observed color restricts its true\nchromaticity to those values that can be explained by one of a candidate set of\nilluminants, and applying the classifier over these values yields a\ndistribution over the corresponding illuminants. A global estimate for the\nscene illuminant is computed through a simple aggregation of these\ndistributions across all pixels. We begin by simply defining the\nluminance-to-chromaticity classifier by computing empirical histograms over\ndiscretized chromaticity and luminance values from a training set of natural\nimages. These histograms reflect a preference for hues corresponding to smooth\nreflectance functions, and for achromatic colors in brighter pixels. Despite\nits simplicity, the resulting estimation algorithm outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art color constancy methods. Next, we propose a method to learn\nthe luminance-to-chromaticity classifier \"end-to-end\". Using stochastic\ngradient descent, we set chromaticity-luminance likelihoods to minimize errors\nin the final scene illuminant estimates on a training set. This leads to\nfurther improvements in accuracy, most significantly in the tail of the error\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 16:13:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 18:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

To this end, integrands of mass matrix\nentries get separated to two multiplicative parts. The first depends on natural\ncoordinates while the second depends also on element parameters (mesh). Second\npart is approximated using polynomials and function evaluations at sampling\n(integration) points, allowing later analytical integration to precompute the\nweight matrices. Resulting formulas possess typical form such that\ncomputational efficiency equivalence to traditional schemes is demonstrated,\nnamely our n-point formula is computationally equivalent to the conventional\nuse of n-point quadrature.

Compared with the growing number of\nfrequentist methodologies, there are rather few theoretically optimal Bayes\nmethods that can deal with very general high dimensional models. In contrast,\nBayes methods have been extensively studied in various nonparametric settings\nand rate optimal posterior contraction results have been established. This\npaper provides a unified approach to both Bayes high dimensional statistics and\nBayes nonparametrics in a general framework of structured linear models. With\nthe proposed two-step model selection prior, we prove a general theorem of\nposterior contraction under an abstract setting.

Human action\nrecognition, as one of the key components in these devices, plays an important\nrole to guarantee the quality of user experience. Although the model-driven\nmethods have achieved huge success, they cannot provide a scalable solution for\nefficiently storing, retrieving and recognizing actions in the large-scale\napplications. These models are also vulnerable to the temporal translation and\nwarping, as well as the variations in motion scales and execution rates. To\naddress these challenges, we propose to treat the 3D human action recognition\nas a video-level hashing problem and propose a novel First-Take-All (FTA)\nHashing algorithm capable of hashing the entire video into hash codes of fixed\nlength. We demonstrate that this FTA algorithm produces a compact\nrepresentation of the video invariant to the above mentioned variations,\nthrough which action recognition can be solved by an efficient nearest neighbor\nsearch by the Hamming distance between the FTA hash codes. Experiments on the\npublic 3D human action datasets shows that the FTA algorithm can reach a\nrecognition accuracy higher than 80%, with about 15 bits per frame considering\nthere are 65 frames per video over the datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 19:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

The -dependent\nrotational relaxation times were fitted with Arrhenius equations to obtain\nactivation energies. Our data show a close correlation between the C4\nrotational mode and the temperature dependent dielectric permittivity.

Here we explore the temporal\nrelationship between the human brain's time-varying representation of visual\npatterns and behavioral judgments of perceptual similarity. The visual stimuli\nwere abstract patterns constructed from identical perceptual units (oriented\nGabor patches) so that each pattern had a unique global form or perceptual\n'Gestalt'.

Early after stimulus onset (from 50ms), a model based on\nretinotopic organization predicted the representational similarity of the\nvisual stimuli. Following the peak correlation between the retinotopic model\nand neural data at 80ms, the neural representations quickly evolved so that\nretinotopy no longer provided a sufficient account of the brain's time-varying\nrepresentation of the stimuli. Overall the strongest predictor of the brain's\nrepresentation was a model based on human judgments of perceptual similarity,\nwhich reached the limits of the maximum correlation with the neural data\ndefined by the 'noise ceiling'.

The research of nonlinear CS is\ndevoted to answering this question. In this paper, unlike the existing research\nangles of nonlinear CS, we study it from the perspective of mapping\ndecomposition, and propose a new concept, namely, nonlinear CS based on\ncomposite mappings. Through the analysis of two forms of a nonlinear composite\nmapping Phi, i.e., Phi(x) = F(Ax) and Phi(x) = AF(x), we give the requirements\nrespectively for the sensing matrix A and the nonlinear mapping F when\nreconstructing all sparse signals exactly from the nonlinear measurements\nPhi(x).

This linearization method\ncan guarantee the exact recovery of all given sparse signals even if Phi is not\nan injection for all sparse signals.

When applied to cosmology, aka\ncosmological hysteresis, has interesting and vivid implications in the scenario\nof a cyclic bouncy universe. Most importantly, this physical prescription can\nbe treated as an alternative proposal to inflationary paradigm. Cosmological\nhysteresis is caused by the asymmetry in the equation of state parameter during\nexpansion and contraction phase of the universe, due to the presence of a\nsingle scalar field.
