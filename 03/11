We looked for correlations between the different energy bands,\nincluding radio data at 37 GHz collected at the Mets\\\"ahovi Radio Observatory\nand built quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength spectra in the high energy domain\nwhen the source is flaring either in the X-rays or in the {\\gamma} rays.\nResults. Both temporal and spectral analysis suggest a two-component model to\nexplain the complete high energy spectrum. X-ray emission is likely dominated\nby a Seyfert-like component while the {\\gamma}-ray emission is dominated by a\nblazar-like component produced by the relativistic jet. The variability of the\nblazar-like component is discussed, comparing the spectral parameters in the\ntwo different spectral states. Changes of the electron Lorentz factor are found\nto be the most likely source of the observed variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 16:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

The present study aims to contribute to the set of boundary conditions,\ndefined by observations, which must be met by physical models that describe the\nflickering. In particular, time lags in the occurrence of flickering events at\ndifferent wavelengths over the optical range are examined. To this end, the\ncross-correlation functions (CCFs) of numerous light curves of a sample of CVs\nare analysed that were observed simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously in\ndifferent bands of various photometric systems. Deviations of the maxima of the\nCCFs from zero time-shift indicate a dependence of the flickering activity on\nthe wavelength in the sense that flickering flares reach their maxima slightly\nearlier in the blue range than in the red. While the available observational\nmaterial does not permit detecting this individually in all observed systems,\nthe ensemble of all data clearly shows this effect. Particularly instructive\nare the cases of V603 Aql and TT Ari, where time lags of 15.1 sec and 4.3 sec,\nrespectively, are observed between the U and R bands. In principle this can be\nunderstood if during the development of a flickering flare the radiation\ncharacteristics of the light source responsible for flickering change such that\nin the early phases of a flare more short-wavelength radiation is emitted, and\nlater on, the peak of the emission shifts to the red. Respective scenarios are\ndiscussed and shown to be in qualitative and quantitative agreement with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 16:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Here we discuss particle acceleration at the forward shock of SN and\ndiscuss the possibility that the escaping particle current may excite a\nnon-resonant instability that in turn leads to the formation of resonant modes\nconfining particles close to the shock and increasing the maximum energy. This\nmechanism works throughout the expansion of the SN explosion, from the ejecta\ndominated (ED) to the Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase. Because of their higher\nexplosion rate,we focus on type II SNae expanding in the slow, dense red\nsupergiant wind. When the explosion occurs in such winds, the transition\nbetween the ED and the ST phase is likely to take place within a few tens of\nyears. As a result, the spectrum of accelerated particles shows a break in the\nslope, at the maximum energy (Em) achieved at the beginning of the ST phase.\nAbove this energy, the spectrum becomes steeper but remains a power law than\ndeveloping an exponential cutoff. We show that for type II SNae typical\nparameters, proton Em can easily reach PeV energies, confirming that type II\nSNRs are the best candidate sources for CRs at the knee. We have tried to fit\nKASCADE-Grande, ARGO -YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array data with our model but we could\nnot find any parameter combination that could explain all data sets. Indeed the\nrecent measurement of the proton and helium spectra in the knee region, with\nthe ARGO-YBJ and YAC1-Tibet Array, has made the situation very confused. These\nmeasurements suggest that the knee in the light component is at 650 TeV,\nappreciably below the overall spectrum knee. This finding would resolve the\nproblem of reaching very high energies in SNae, but, on the other hand, it\nwould open a critical issue in the transition region between Galactic and\nextragalactic CRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 17:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Our methodology consists in the use of ratios of\npseudo equivalent widths of spectral features as a temperature diagnostic.\nStars with effective temperatures obtained from interferometric estimates of\ntheir radii are used as calibrators. Empirical calibrations for the spectral\ntype are also provided. Combinations of features and ratios of features are\nused to derive calibrations for the stellar metallicity. Our methods are then\napplied to a large sample of M dwarfs that are being observed in the framework\nof the HARPS search for extrasolar planets.The derived temperatures and\nmetallicities are used together with photometric estimates of mass, radius, and\nsurface gravity to calibrate empirical relationships for these parameters. A\ntotal of 112 temperature sensitive ratios have been calibrated over the range\n3100-3950 K, providing Teff values with typical uncertainties of the order of\n70 K. Eighty-two ratios of pseudo equivalent widths of features were calibrated\nto derive spectral types. Regarding stellar metallicity, 696 combinations of\npseudo equivalent widths of individual features and temperature-sensitive\nratios have been calibrated, over the metallicity range from -0.54 to +0.24\ndex, with estimated uncertainties in the range of 0.07-0.10 dex. We provide our\nown empirical calibrations for stellar mass, radius, and surface gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 17:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

This leads to a\nkeen analysis of the overall process, in particular on the role of the tail of\nthe spectrum in modulating the wind input and the white-capping. We suggest\nthat the relationship between white-capping and generation by wind is deeper\nand more implicative than presently generally assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 18:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

Then,\nin the presence of a tiny source of flavor violation, heavier dark matter\nflavors can decay via a dipole transition on cosmological timescales, giving\nrise to three photon lines. The ratios of the line energies are completely\ndetermined in terms of the charged lepton masses, and constitute a firm\nprediction of this framework. For dark matter masses of order the weak scale,\nthe couplet lies in the keV-MeV region, with a much weaker line in the eV-keV\nregion.

Most studies to date have compared the yields from potential\nsources (asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), fast rotating massive stars\n(FRMS), high mass interacting binaries (IBs), and very massive stars (VMS))\nwith observations of specific elements that are observed to vary from\nstar-to-star in GCs, focussing on extreme GCs such as NGC 2808, which display\nlarge He variations. However, a consistency check between the results of\nfitting extreme cases with the requirements of more typical clusters, has\nrarely been done. Such a check is particularly timely given the constraints on\nHe abundances in GCs now available. Here we show that all of the popular\nenrichment sources fail to reproduce the observed trends in GCs, focussing\nprimarily on Na, O and He. In particular, we show that any model that can fit\nclusters like NGC 2808, will necessarily fail (by construction) to fit more\ntypical clusters like 47 Tuc or NGC 288. All sources severely over-produce He\nfor most clusters. Additionally, given the large differences in He spreads\nbetween clusters, but similar spreads observed in Na--O, only sources with\nlarge degrees of stochasticity in the resulting yields will be able to fit the\nobservations. We conclude that no enrichment source put forward so far (AGBs,\nFRMS, IBs, VMS - or combinations thereof) is consistent with the observations\nof GCs. Finally, the observed trends of increasing [N/Fe] and He spread with\nincreasing cluster mass cannot be resolved within a self-enrichment framework,\nwithout further exacerbating the mass budget problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 20:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

If this occurs in\na star cluster, the FFP may remain bound to the star cluster for some time and\ninteract with the other cluster members until it is ejected. Here, we use\n$N$-body simulations to characterise close star-planet and planet-planet\nencounters and the dynamical fate of the FFP population in star clusters\ncontaining $500-2000$ single or binary star members. We find that FFPs ejected\nfrom their planetary system at low velocities typically leave the star cluster\n40% earlier than their host stars, and experience tens of close ($<1000$ AU)\nencounters with other stars and planets before they escape. The fraction of\nFFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and\nthe initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close\nencounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10% occur after 100 Myr. The\nperiastron velocity distribution for all encounters is well-described by a\nmodified Maxwell-Bolzmann distribution, and the periastron distance\ndistribution is linear over almost the entire range of distances considered,\nand flattens off for very close encounters due to strong gravitational\nfocusing. Close encounters with FFPs can perturb existing planetary systems and\ntheir debris structures, and they can result in re-capture of FFPs. In\naddition, these FFP populations may be observed in young star clusters in\nimaging surveys; a comparison between observations and dynamical predictions\nmay provide clues to the early phases of stellar and planetary dynamics in star\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

Upward propagating waves find obstacles, such as the equipartition\nlayer with plasma b=1 and the transition region, and get converted, reflected\nand refracted. Understanding the mechanisms by which MHD waves can reach the\ncorona can give us information about the solar atmosphere and the magnetic\nstructures. We carry out two-dimensional numerical simulations of wave\npropagation in a magnetic field structure that consists of two vertical flux\ntubes separated by an arcade shaped magnetic field. This configuration contains\na null point in the corona, that significantly modifies the behaviour of the\nwaves. We describe in detail the wave propagation through the atmosphere under\ndifferent driving conditions. We also present the spatial distribution of the\nmean acoustic and magnetic energy fluxes and the spatial distribution of the\ndominant frequencies in the whole domain. We conclude that the energy reaches\nthe corona preferably along vertical magnetic fields, inside the flux tubes,\nand it has an acoustic nature. Most of the magnetic energy keeps concentrated\nbelow the transition region due to the refraction of the magnetic waves and the\ncontinuous conversion of acoustic-like waves into fast magnetic waves in the\nequipartition layer located in the photosphere. However, part of the magnetic\nenergy reaches the low corona when propagating in the region where the arcades\nare located, but waves are sent back downwards to the lower atmosphere at the\nnull point surroundings. This phenomenon, together with the reflection and\nrefraction of waves in the TR and the lower turning point, act as a re-feeding\nof the atmosphere. In the frequency distribution, we find that high frequency\nwaves can reach the corona outside the vertical flux tubes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 20:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The non-uniform ring-like structure around epsilon Eridani,\noriginally discovered at lambda=850 microns with the bolometer camera SCUBA,\ncould be the signpost of unseen long-period planets interior to the disk that\ngravitationally interact with it through mean-motion resonances.

We present a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio image of this structure at lambda=1.2 mm made with the\nbolometer camera MAMBO and compare this with the SCUBA image.

Our main result (i)\nimplies the access lemma for all minimally self-adjusting BST algorithms for\nwhich it was known to hold: splay trees and their generalization to the class\nof local algorithms (Subramanian, Georgakopoulos and Mc-Clurkin), as well as\nGreedy BST, introduced by Demaine et al. and shown to satisfy the access lemma\nby Fox, (ii) implies that BST algorithms based on \"strict\" depth-halving\nsatisfy the access lemma, addressing an open question that was raised several\ntimes since 1985, and (iii) yields an extremely short proof for the O(log n log\nlog n) amortized access cost for the path-balance heuristic (proposed by\nSleator), matching the best known bound (Balasubramanian and Raman) to a\nlower-order factor.\n  One of our combinatorial properties is locality. We show that any\nBST-algorithm that satisfies the access lemma via the sum-of-log (SOL)\npotential is necessarily local. The other property states that the sum of the\nnumber of leaves of the after-tree plus the number of side alternations in the\nsearch path must be at least a constant fraction of the length of the search\npath. We show that a weak form of this property is necessary for sequential\naccess to be linear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 21:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 09:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

Swanepoel introduced the covering parameter of a convex body as a\nmeans of quantifying its covering properties. In this paper, we introduce two\nrelatives of the covering parameter called covering index and weak covering\nindex, which upper bound well-studied quantities like the illumination number,\nthe illumination parameter and the covering parameter of a convex body.\nIntuitively, the two indices measure how well a convex body can be covered by a\nrelatively small number of homothets having the same relatively small homothety\nratio. We show that the covering index is a lower semicontinuous functional on\nthe Banach-Mazur space of convex bodies. We further show that the affine\nd-cubes minimize covering index in any dimension d, while circular disks\nmaximize it in the plane. Furthermore, the covering index satisfies a nice\ncompatibility with the operations of direct vector sum and vector sum. In fact,\nwe obtain an exact formula for the covering index of a direct vector sum of\nconvex bodies that works in infinitely many instances. This together with a\nminimization property can be used to determine the covering index of infinitely\nmany convex bodies. As the name suggests, the weak covering index loses some of\nthe important properties of the covering index.

The\nlandscape of the potential energy surface shows that the configuration of the\nNi + Ca + Sn decay channel is lower about 12 MeV than that of the Ca + Ni + Sn\nchannel. This leads to the fact, that the yield of Ni and Sn is large. The\nanalysis on the dependence of the velocity of the middle fragment on mass\nnumbers of the outer products leads to the conclusion that, in the collinear\ntripartition channel of \\nuclide[252]{Cf}, the middle cluster has a very small\nvelocity, which does not allow it to be found in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 02:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall\nKepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. We present the\nresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the\nSpitzer telescope during the the Kepler mission. These observations are\ndedicated to estimating the false positive rate (FPR) amongst the Kepler\ncandidates. We select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges in\nstellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transits\nwith Spitzer at 4.5 microns. We use these observations to measures the\ncandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. A bandpass-dependent depth\nalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source\nof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. For most of the candidates\n(85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths\nmeasured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the\nmost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that\ndilute the photometry. The Spitzer constraints on their own yield FPRs between\n5-40%, depending on the KOIs. By considering the population of the Kepler field\nstars, and by combining follow-up observations (imaging) when available, we\nfind that the overall FPR of our sample is low. The measured upper limit on the\nFPR of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma. This observational\nresult, which uses the achromatic property of planetary transit signals that is\nnot investigated by the Kepler observations, provides an independent indication\nthat Kepler's false positive rate is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 04:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

High-mass NSs ($2<m<3$ $M_\\odot$) are often\nconsistent with low-mass BH ($m<5\\ M_\\odot$), posing a challenge for\ndetermining the maximum NS mass from LIGO/Virgo observations alone. Individual\nsources will seldom be measured well enough to confirm objects in the mass gap\nand statistical inferences drawn from the detected population will be strongly\ndependent on the underlying distribution. If nature happens to provide a mass\ndistribution with the populations relatively cleanly separated in chirp mass\nspace, as some population synthesis models suggest, then NSs and BHs are more\neasily distinguishable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 05:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 22:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

One\nprediction of the models is that some afterglow temporal breaks at different\nenergy bands should be achromatic. Observations in the Swift era have revealed\nchromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some GRBs, casting doubts on the EFS\norigin of GRB afterglows. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to\naddress the question: how bad/good are the external forward shock models? Our\nsample includes 85 GRBs well-monitored X-ray and optical lightcurves. Based on\nhow well the data abide by the EFS models, we categorize them as: Gold sample:\n(Grade I and II) include 45/85 GRBs. They show evidence of, or are consistent\nwith having, an achromatic break. The temporal/spectral behaviors in each\nafterglow segment are consistent with the predictions (closure relations) of\nthe EFS models. Silver sample: (Grade III and IV) include 37/85 GRBs. They are\nalso consistent with having an achromatic break, even though one or more\nafterglow segments do not comply with the closure relations. Bad sample: (Grade\nV), 3/85 shows direct evidence of chromatic behaviors, suggesting that the EFS\nmodels are inconsistent with the data. These are included in the Bad sample. We\nfurther perform statistical analyses of various observational properties\n($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $t_b$ and model parameters (energy injection index q, p,\n$\\theta_j$, $\\eta_\\gamma$, etc) of the GRBs in the Gold Sample, and derive\nconstraints on the magnetization parameter $\\epsilon_B$ in the EFS. Overall, we\nconclude that the simplest EFS models can account for the multi-wavelength\nafterglow data of at least half of the GRBs. When more advanced modeling (e.g.,\nlong-lasting reverse shock, structured jets) is invoked, up to $>90 \\%$ of the\nafterglows may be interpreted within the framework of the ESF models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 07:05:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 01:02:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 06:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

The event demonstrates the capability of current\nreal-time microlensing modeling and the usefulness of microlensing in detecting\nand characterizing faint or dark objects in the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 07:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

However, up to now, TI-based\nheterostructures always resulted in very disordered interfaces, characterized\nby strong mesoscopic fluctuations of the chemical potential which make the\nspin-momentum locking ill-defined over length scales of few nanometers or even\ncompletely destroy topological states. These limitations call for the ability\nto control topological interfaces with atomic precision. Here, we demonstrate\nthat molecular self-assembly processes driven by inherent interactions among\nthe constituents offer the opportunity to create well-defined networks at TIs\nsurfaces. Even more remarkably, we show that the symmetry of the overlayer can\nbe finely controlled by appropriate chemical modifications. By analyzing the\ninfluence of the molecules on the TI electronic properties, we rationalize our\nresults in terms of the charge redistribution taking place at the interface.\nOverall, our approach offers a precise and fast way to produce tailor-made\nnanoscale surface landscapes. In particular, our findings make organic\nmaterials ideal TIs counterparts, since they offer the possibility to\nchemically tune both electronic and magnetic properties within the same family\nof molecules, thereby bringing us a significant step closer towards an\napplication of this fascinating class of materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 09:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-12"}

A classic region for investigating this phenomenon\nis in the region around $Z=82$ and the neutron mid-shell at $N=104$.\n  Purpose: Evidence for shape coexistence has been inferred from $\\alpha$-decay\nmeasurements, laser spectroscopy and in-beam measurements. While the latter\nallow the pattern of excited states and rotational band structures to be mapped\nout, a detailed understanding of shape coexistence can only come from\nmeasurements of electromagnetic matrix elements.\n  Method: Secondary, radioactive ion beams of $^{202}$Rn and $^{204}$Rn were\nstudied by means of low-energy Coulomb excitation at the REX-ISOLDE facility in\nCERN.\n  Results: The electric-quadrupole ($E2$) matrix element connecting the ground\nstate and first-excited $2^{+}_{1}$ state was extracted for both $^{202}$Rn and\n$^{204}$Rn, corresponding to ${B(E2;2^{+}_{1} \\to 2^{+}_{1})=29^{+8}_{-8}}$\nW.u. and $43^{+17}_{-12}$ W.u., respectively.

In this limit we work out in detail the microscopic ground\nstate configuration and show that by varying the density of the weak species a\nseries of compatible--incompatible transitions occurs.

To this end an intuitive\nsemiclassical picture based on the local constant-crossed field approximation\napplied on the probability-amplitude level is established and compared with the\nstandard approach used in QED-PIC codes. The main difference is the\nsubstructure of the spectrum, which results from interference effects between\nmacroscopically separated formation regions. In order to compare the\npredictions of the semiclassical approach with exact calculations, a very fast\nnumerical scheme is introduced. It renders the calculation of the fully\ndifferential spectrum on a grid which resolves all interference fringes\nfeasible. Finally, the difference between classical and quantum absorption of\nlaser four-momentum in the process is pointed out and the dominance of the\nformer is proven. As a self-consistent treatment of the quantum absorption is\nnot feasible within existing QED-PIC approaches, our results provide reliable\nerror estimates relevant for regimes where the laser depletion due to a\ndeveloping QED cascade becomes significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 11:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 10:42:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 12:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

Nevertheless, the reconstruction of electron density distribution by\nstraightforward Fourier synthesis is usually hindered due to the well-known\nphase problem and finite resolution of diffraction data. In analogy with\noptical imaging system, the reconstructed electron density map may be regarded\nas the image of the real electron density distribution in crystals. Inspired by\nimage definition evaluation functions applied in auto-focusing process, we\nproposed two evaluation functions for the reconstructed electron density\nimages. One of them is based on atomicity of electron density distribution and\nproperties of Fourier synthesis. Tests were performed on synthetic data of\nknown structures, and it was found that this evaluation function can\ndistinguish the correctly reconstructed electron density image from wrong ones\nwhen diffraction data of atomic resolution is available. An algorithm was\nestablished based on this evaluation function and applied in reconstructing the\nelectron density image from synthetic data of known structures. The other\nevaluation function, which is based on the positivity of electron density and\nconstrained entropy maximization, was designed for cases where only diffraction\ndata of rather limited resolution is available. Tests on synthetic data\nindicate that this evaluation function may identify the correct phase set even\nfor a dataset at the resolution as low as 3.5 {\\AA}.

The\nquantification of such error or uncertainty in the test score data--or rather\nthe complementary test reliability--is pursued within the paradigm of Classical\nTest Theory in a variety of ways, with no existing method of finding\nreliability, isomorphic to the theoretical definition that parametrises\nreliability as the ratio of the true score variance and observed (i.e.\nerror-ridden) score variance. Thus, multiple reliability coefficients for the\nsame test have been advanced. This paper describes a much needed method of\nobtaining reliability of a test as per its theoretical definition, via a single\nadministration of the test, by using a new fast method of splitting of a given\ntest into parallel halves, achieving near-coincident empirical distributions of\nthe two halves. The method has the desirable property of achieving splitting on\nthe basis of difficulty of the questions (or items) that constitute the test,\nthus allowing for fast computation of reliability even for very large test data\nsets, i.e. test data obtained by a very large examinee sample. An interval\nestimate for the true score is offered, given an examinee score, subsequent to\nthe determination of the test reliability.

Red timing noise - the stochastic wandering of\npulse arrival times with a red spectrum - is prevalent in slow-spinning pulsars\nand has been identified in many millisecond pulsars. Phenomenological models of\ntiming noise, such as from superfluid turbulence, suggest that the timing noise\nspectrum plateaus below some critical frequency, $f_c$, potentially aiding the\nhunt for gravitational waves. We examine this effect for individual pulsars by\ncalculating minimum observation times, $T_{\\rm min}(f_c)$, over which the\ngravitational wave signal becomes larger than the timing noise plateau. We do\nthis in two ways: 1) in a model-independent manner, and 2) by using the\nsuperfluid turbulence model for timing noise as an example to illustrate how\nneutron star parameters can be constrained. We show that the superfluid\nturbulence model can reproduce the data qualitatively from a number of pulsars\nobserved as part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array.

Spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing are special cases of\nGSM with $N_{a}=1$ and $N_{a}=N_t$, respectively. We first derive an analytical\nupper bound on the bit error rate (BER) for maximum likelihood (ML) detection\nof GSM in VLC systems.

The\nchannel gains and channel correlations influence the GSM performance such that\nthe best BER is achieved at an optimum LED spacing.

We propose a neural mechanism to non-destructively translate the\ncurrent state of memory into the future, so as to construct an ordered set of\nfuture predictions. This framework applies equally well to translations in time\nor in one-dimensional position. In a two-layer memory network that encodes the\nLaplace transform of the external input in real time, translation can be\naccomplished by modulating the weights between the layers. We propose that\nwithin each cycle of hippocampal theta oscillations, the memory state is swept\nthrough a range of translations to yield an ordered set of future predictions.\nWe operationalize several neurobiological findings into phenomenological\nequations constraining translation. Combined with constraints based on physical\nprinciples requiring scale-invariance and coherence in translation across\nmemory nodes, the proposition results in Weber-Fechner spacing for the\nrepresentation of both past (memory) and future (prediction) timelines. The\nresulting expressions are consistent with findings from phase precession\nexperiments in different regions of the hippocampus and reward systems in the\nventral striatum.

A general,\nnon permutation invariant quasispecies model is studied, therefore the\ndimension of the problem is $2^N\\times 2^N$, where $N$ is the sequence length.\nIt is shown that if the fitness function is equal to $w+s$ on a $G$-orbit $A$\nand is equal to $w$ elsewhere, then the mean population fitness can be found as\nthe largest root of an algebraic equation of degree at most $N+1$. Here $G$ is\nan arbitrary isometry group acting on the metric space of sequences of zeroes\nand ones of the length $N$ with the Hamming distance. An explicit form of this\nexact algebraic equation is given in terms of the spherical growth function of\nthe $G$-orbit $A$.

Starting from a minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), we find that the\ndisk mid-plane temperature profile shows several plateaux (0.1-1 AU wide) at\nthe different sublimation temperatures of the species that make up the dust.\nFor water ice, the correspond- ing plateau can be larger than 1 AU, which means\nthat this is a snow \"region\" rather than a snow \"line\".

However, to the best knowledge of the authors, a\nquantitative analysis of the cost of such networks is yet to be undertaken.\nThis paper develops a theoretic framework that enables computation of the\ndeployment cost of a network (modeled using various spatial point processes) to\nanswer the question posed by the paper's title. Then, the framework obtained is\nused along with a complexity model, which enables computing the information\nprocessing costs of a network, to compare the deployment cost of a cloud based\nnetwork against that of a traditional LTE network, and to analyze why they are\nmore economical. Using this framework and an exemplary budget, this paper shows\nthat cloud-based radio access networks require approximately 10 to 15% less\ncapital expenditure per square kilometer than traditional LTE networks.

The underlying game is a multicast game in a\nrooted undirected graph with nonnegative edge costs. A set of k terminal\nvertices or players need to establish connectivity with the root. The social\noptimum is the Minimum Steiner Tree. We are interested in situations where the\ndesigner has incomplete information about the input. We propose two different\nmodels, the adversarial and the stochastic. In both models, the designer has\nprior knowledge of the underlying metric but the requested subset of the\nplayers is not known and is activated either in an adversarial manner\n(adversarial model) or is drawn from a known probability distribution\n(stochastic model).\n  In the adversarial model, the designer's goal is to choose a single,\nuniversal protocol that has low Price of Anarchy (PoA) for all possible\nrequested subsets of players. The main question we address is: to what extent\ncan prior knowledge of the underlying metric help in the design? We first\ndemonstrate that there exist graphs (outerplanar) where knowledge of the\nunderlying metric can dramatically improve the performance of good network\ndesign. Then, in our main technical result, we show that there exist graph\nmetrics, for which knowing the underlying metric does not help and any\nuniversal protocol has PoA of $\\Omega(\\log k)$, which is tight. We attack this\nproblem by developing new techniques that employ powerful tools from extremal\ncombinatorics, and more specifically Ramsey Theory in high dimensional\nhypercubes.\n  Then we switch to the stochastic model, where each player is independently\nactivated. We show that there exists a randomized ordered protocol that\nachieves constant PoA. By using standard derandomization techniques, we produce\na deterministic ordered protocol with constant PoA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 15:56:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 15:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

These findings are the same as for\nchess and support the conjecture that the popularity distribution of board game\nopenings follows the Zipf law with a universal exponent. We also find that the\ndistribution of out-degrees has a power-law form, the distribution of branching\nratios has a very complicated pattern, and the distribution of uniqueness\nscores defined by the path lengths from the root vertex to the leaf vertices\nexhibits a unimodal shape.
