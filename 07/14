The details of the propagation in the Galactic halo and the\nescape into the intergalactic medium remain uncertain. The densities of cosmic\nrays in specific locations can be traced via the gamma rays they produce in\ninelastic collisions with clouds of interstellar gas. Therefore, we analyze 73\nmonths of Fermi-LAT data from 300 MeV to 10 GeV in the direction of several\nhigh- and intermediate-velocity clouds that are located in the halo of the\nMilky Way. These clouds are supposed to be free of internal sources of cosmic\nrays and hence any gamma-ray emission from them samples the large-scale\ndistribution of Galactic cosmic rays. We evaluate for the first time the\ngamma-ray emissivity per hydrogen atom up to ~7 kpc above the Galactic disk.\nThe emissivity is found to decrease with distance from the disk, which provides\ndirect evidence that cosmic rays at the relevant energies originate therein.\nFurthermore, the emissivity of one of the targets, the upper\nintermediate-velocity Arch, hints at a 50% decline of the cosmic-ray intensity\nwithin 2 kpc from the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 16:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

We consider greedy\nadaptive walks in which the population moves to the fittest among all single\nmutant neighbors of the current genotype until a local fitness maximum is\nreached. The landscape is of the rough mount Fuji type, which means that the\nfitness value assigned to a sequence is the sum of a random and a deterministic\ncomponent. The random components are independent and identically distributed\nrandom variables, and the deterministic component varies linearly with the\ndistance to a reference sequence. The deterministic fitness gradient $c$ is a\nparameter that interpolates between the limits of an uncorrelated random\nlandscape ($c = 0$) and an effectively additive landscape ($c \\to \\infty$).\nWhen the random fitness component is chosen from the Gumbel distribution,\nexplicit expressions for the distribution of the number of steps taken by the\ngreedy walk are obtained, and it is shown that the walk length varies\nnon-monotonically with the strength of the fitness gradient when the starting\npoint is sufficiently close to the reference sequence.

One\ncan notice that, the asymptotic behavior which is characterized by\nStephan-Boltzmann limit would be satisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 17:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 09:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-01"}

The first coordinate of this data is the ratio of counts in mid\nto low energy band (color 1), the second coordinate is the ratio of counts in\nhigh to low energy band (color 2), and the third coordinate is the sum of\ncounts in all three bands.

Task scheduling\nalgorithms play an important role in the efficiency of cloud computing services\nas they aim to reduce the turnaround time of tasks and improve resource\nutilization. Several task scheduling algorithms have been proposed in the\nliterature for cloud computing systems, the majority relying on the\ncomputational complexity of tasks and the distribution of resources. However,\nseveral tasks scheduled following these algorithms still fail because of\nunforeseen changes in the cloud environments. In this paper, using tasks\nexecution and resource utilization data extracted from the execution traces of\nreal world applications at Google, we explore the possibility of predicting the\nscheduling outcome of a task using statistical models. If we can successfully\npredict tasks failures, we may be able to reduce the execution time of jobs by\nrescheduling failed tasks earlier (i.e., before their actual failing time). Our\nresults show that statistical models can predict task failures with a precision\nup to 97.4%, and a recall up to 96.2%.

We find an enhanced Ohmic dissipation of\ncurrents in the corona above areas that also have enhanced upwards-directed\nPoynting flux. These regions coincide with the regions where hot coronal loops\nwithin the AR core are observed. The coronal density plays a role in estimating\nthe coronal temperature due to the generated heat input.

In particular, with just a few sources studied in detail, it is\nunclear what role environment plays in complex molecule formation. In this\nlight, a comparison of relative abundances of related species between sources\nmight be useful to explain observed differences. We seek to measure the\nrelative abundance between three important complex organic molecules, ethylene\nglycol ((CH$_2$OH)$_2$), glycolaldehyde (CH$_2$OHCHO) and methyl formate\n(HCOOCH$_3$), toward high-mass protostars and thereby provide additional\nconstraints on their formation pathways. We use IRAM 30-m single dish\nobservations of the three species toward two high-mass star-forming regions -\nW51/e2 and G34.3+0.2 - and report a tentative detection of (CH2OH)2 toward both\nsources. Assuming that (CH$_2$OH)$_2$, CH$_2$OHCHO and HCOOCH$_3$ spatially\ncoexist, relative abundance ratios, HCOOCH$_3$/(CH$_2$OH)$_2$, of 31 and 35 are\nderived for G34.3+0.2 and W51/e2, respectively.

Links between line profile variability, enhancements/depletions\nof surface chemical abundances, and magnetic fields have been identified for\nlow-mass B-stars, but for the O-type domain this is almost unexplored. Based on\nFORS2 and HARPS spectropolarimetric data, we present the first detection of a\nmagnetic field in HD54879, a single slowly rotating O9.7 V star. Using two\nindependent and different techniques we obtained the firm detection of a\nsurface average longitudinal magnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about\n600 G, in modulus. A quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the star with the\nstellar atmosphere code FASTWIND results in an effective temperature and a\nsurface gravity of 33000$\\pm1000$ K and 4.0$\\pm0.1$ dex. The abundances of\ncarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and magnesium are found to be slightly lower\nthan solar, but compatible within the errors. We investigate line-profile\nvariability in HD54879 by complementing our spectra with spectroscopic data\nfrom other recent OB-star surveys. The photospheric lines remain constant in\nshape between 2009 and 2014, although H$\\alpha$ shows a variable emission. The\nH$\\alpha$ emission is too strong for a standard O9.7 V and is probably linked\nto the magnetic field and the presence of circumstellar material. Its normal\nchemical composition and the absence of photospheric line profile variations\nmake HD54879 the most strongly magnetic, non-variable single O-star detected to\ndate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 20:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The core statistical quantity in this\nmodel is the stellar mass assembly distribution, $P(dM_{*}/dt|\\mathbf{X},a)$,\nwhich specifies the probability density distribution of stellar mass assembly\nrates given a set of halo properties $\\mathbf{X}$ and epoch $a$. Predictions\nfrom this model are obtained by integrating the stellar mass assembly\ndistribution (SMAD) over halo merger trees, easily obtained from modern,\nhigh-resolution $N$-body simulations. Further properties of the galaxies hosted\nby the halos can be obtained by post-processing the stellar mass assembly\nhistories with stellar population synthesis models. In my particular example\nimplementation of this model, I use the \\citet{behroozi13a} constraint on the\nmedian stellar mass assembly rates of halos as a function of their mass and\nredshift to construct an example parameterization of\n$P(dM_{*}/dt|\\mathbf{X},a)$. This SMAD is then integrated over individual halo\nmass accretion histories from $N$-body merger trees starting at z = 4, using\nsimple rules to account for merging halos. I find that this a simple model can\nreproduce qualitatively the bimodal features of the low-redshift galaxy\npopulation, including the qualitative split in the two-point clustering as a\nfunction of specific star formation rate. These results indicate that models\nwhich directly couple halo and galaxy growth through simple efficiency\nfunctions can naturally predict the star formation rate bimodality in\nhigher-order statistics of the galaxy field, such as its two-point correlations\nor galactic conformity signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 20:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Many solar activity proxies exhibit a quasi-biennial ($\\sim$2\nyear) variation, which is superimposed upon the dominant 11 year cycle. A\nwell-characterized stellar sample suggests at least two different relationships\nbetween rotation period and cycle period, with some stars exhibiting long and\nshort cycles simultaneously. Within this sample, the solar cycle periods are\ntypical of a more rapidly rotating star, implying that the Sun might be in a\ntransitional state or that it has an unusual evolutionary history. In this\nwork, we present new and archival observations of dual magnetic cycles in the\nyoung solar analog HD 30495, an $\\sim$1 Gyr-old G1.5V star with a rotation\nperiod near 11 days. This star falls squarely on the relationships established\nby the broader stellar sample, with short-period variations at $\\sim$1.7 years\nand a long cycle of $\\sim$12 years. We measure three individual long-period\ncycles and find durations ranging from 9.6-15.5 years. We find the short-term\nvariability to be intermittent, but present throughout the majority of the time\nseries, though its occurrence and amplitude are uncorrelated with the longer\ncycle. These essentially solar-like variations occur in a Sun-like star with\nmore rapid rotation, though surface differential rotation measurements leave\nopen the possibility of a solar equivalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 20:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Here we describe a possible\nsignature of the central engine: a burst of shock breakout emission occurring\nseveral days after the supernova explosion. The energy input from the magnetar\ninflates a high-pressure bubble that drives a shock through the pre-exploded\nsupernova ejecta. If the magnetar is powerful enough, that shock will near the\nejecta surface and become radiative. At the time of shock breakout, the ejecta\nwill have expanded to a large radius (~10^{14} cm) so that the radiation\nreleased is at optical/ultraviolet wavelengths (T ~ 20,000 K) and lasts for\nseveral days. The luminosity and timescale of this magnetar driven shock\nbreakout are similar to the first peak observed recently in the double-peaked\nlight curve of SNLSQ14BDQ. However, for a large region of model parameter\nspace, the breakout emission is predicted to be dimmer than the diffusive\nluminosity from direct magnetar heating. A distinct double peaked light curve\nmay therefore only be conspicuous if thermal heating from the magnetar is\nsuppressed at early times. We describe how such a delay in heating may\nnaturally result from inefficient dissipation and thermalization of the pulsar\nwind magnetic energy. Without such suppression, the breakout may only be\nnoticeable as a small bump or kink in the early luminosity or color evolution,\nor as a small but abrupt rise in the photospheric velocity. A similar breakout\nsignature may accompany other central engines in supernovae, such as a black\nhole accreting fallback material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 22:41:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 08:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

We base our\nanalysis on a set of about 450 direct numerical simulations of the\n(magneto)hydrodynamic equations under the Boussinesq approximation. The Ekman\nnumber ranges from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-5}$. The supercriticality of the\nconvection reaches about 1000 in some models. Four sets of simulations are\nconsidered: non-magnetic simulations and dynamo simulations with either\nfree-slip or no-slip flow boundary conditions. The non-magnetic setup with\nfree-slip boundaries generates the strongest zonal flows. Both non-magnetic\nsimulations with no-slip flow boundary conditions and self-consistent dynamos\nwith free-slip boundaries have drastically reduced zonal-flows. Suppression of\nshear leads to a substantial gain in heat-transfer efficiency, increasing by a\nfactor of 3 in some cases. Such efficiency enhancement occurs as long as the\nconvection is significantly influenced by rotation. At higher convective\ndriving the heat-transfer efficiency tends towards that of the classical\nnon-rotating Rayleigh-B\\'enard system.

This is a skill that seems to\nrequire extensive practice to obtain, suggesting a teaching strategy that\ninvolves the assignment of numerous exercises involving the formulation of some\nbit of knowledge, communicated using a natural language such as English, as a\nsentence in some logic. The number of such exercises needed to master this\nskill is far too large to allow typical artificial intelligence course teaching\nteams to provide prompt feedback on student efforts. Thus, an automated\nassessment system for such exercises is needed to ensure that students receive\nan adequate amount of practice, with the rapid delivery of feedback allowing\nstudents to identify errors in their understanding and correct them. This paper\ndescribes an automated grading system for knowledge representation exercises\nusing first-order logic. A resolution theorem prover, \\textit{Prover9}, is used\nto check if a student-submitted formula is logically equivalent to a solution\nprovided by the instructor. This system has been used by students enrolled in\nundergraduate artificial intelligence classes for several years. Use of this\nteaching tool resulted in a statistically significant improvement on\nfirst-order logic knowledge representation questions appearing on the course\nfinal examination. This article explains how this system works, provides an\nanalysis of changes in student learning outcomes, and explores potential\nenhancements of this system, including the possibility of providing rich\nformative feedback by replacing the resolution theorem prover with a\ntableaux-based method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

By adopting green RSs,\nthe grid power consumption of the BS is greatly reduced. But due to the\nuncertainty and stochastic characteristics of the renewable energy, power\nsupply for RSs is not always sufficient. Thus the harvested energy needs to be\nscheduled appropriately to cater to the dynamic traffic so as to minimize the\nenergy saving in the long term. An optimization problem is formulated to find\nthe optimal sleep ratio of RSs to match the time variation of energy harvesting\nand traffic arrival. To fully use the renewable energy, green-RS-first\nprinciple is adopted in the user association process. The optimal RS sleeping\npolicy is obtained through dynamic programming (DP) approach, which divides the\noriginal optimization problem into per-stage subproblems. A reduced DP\nalgorithm and a greedy algorithm are further proposed to greatly reduce the\ncomputation complexity.

Explaining how they\nfragment to dense cores is a missing step in understanding their role in star\nformation. We perform a case study of whether low-mass filaments are close-to\nhydrostatic prior to their fragmentation, and whether their fragmentation\nagrees with gravitational fragmentation models. For this, we study the 6.5 pc\nlong Musca molecular cloud that is an ideal candidate for a filament at an\nearly stage of fragmentation. We employ dust extinction mapping in conjunction\nwith near-infrared data from the NEWFIRM instrument, and 870 um dust continuum\nemission data from the LABOCA instrument, to estimate column densities. We use\nthe data to identify fragments from the cloud and to determine the radial\ndensity distribution of its filamentary part. We compare the cloud's morphology\nwith 13CO and C18O line emission observed with the APEX/SHeFI instrument. The\nMusca cloud is pronouncedly fragmented at its ends, but harbours a remarkably\nwell-defined, 1.6 pc long filament in its Center region. The line mass of the\nfilament is 21-31 Ms pc^-1 and FWHM 0.07 pc. Its radial profile can be fitted\nwith a Plummer profile that has the power-index of 2.6 \\pm 11%, flatter than\nthat of an infinite hydrostatic filament. The profile can also be fitted with a\nhydrostatic cylinder truncated by external pressure. These models imply a\ncentral density of 5-10 x 10^4 cm^-3. The fragments in the cloud have a mean\nseparation of 0.4 pc, in agreement with gravitational fragmentation. These\nproperties, together with the subsonic and velocity-coherent nature of the\ncloud, suggest a scenario in which an initially hydrostatic cloud is currently\ngravitationally fragmenting. The fragmentation has started a few tenths of a\nMyr ago from the cloud ends, leaving its center yet relatively non-fragmented,\npossibly because of gravitational focusing in a finite geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 07:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

It also completely invalidates\nthe mentioned single- or few-particle thought experiments.

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

We also discuss that\nthe magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.\nTherefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an\nalternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson\njunctions. Our results also provide a basic concept for tunable magnetization\nin superconducting spintronics devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

After an initial rejection of cases\nwith unrealistic VDA path lengths, we assembled composite radio spectra for the\nremaining events using data from ground-based and space-borne\nradio-spectrographs. For every event we registered the associated radio\nemissions and we divided the events in groups according to their associated\nradio emissions. The proton release was found to be most often accompanied by\nboth type III and II radio bursts, but a good association percentage was also\nregistered in cases accompanied by type IIIs only.

These radio association\npercentages support the idea that both flare- and shock-resident particle\nrelease processes are observed in high-energy proton events.

CO$_2$ is to be passed into a specially designed converter provided with\nheating mechanism to maintain the contents from blast furnace in a molten state\nfor decarburisation of the melt. The out coming hot gases consisting of CO has\nto be burnt in a combustion chamber with stochiometric proportions of pure\nO$_2$ to produce CO$_2$ at a partial pressure close to 1 atm.The process will\nbe extremely useful as it involves reuse and recycle of CO$_2$ and in turn\nwould reduce the overall amount of CO$_2$ discharged into the atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 12:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Therefore, huge number\n(theoretically any number) of terminals could be supported concurrently at\nfinite and small downlink power budget. This could be very useful to support\nthe downlink signalling channels in HSPA+, LTE, and 5G. It can be very useful\nalso to support huge D2D communication downlinks.

Our motivation to consider time average QoS constraint comes from the\nfact that modern wireless applications such as file sharing, multi-media etc.\nallow some flexibility in terms of their delay tolerance. Time average QoS\nconstraints can lead to greater transmit power savings as compared to\ninstantaneous QoS constraints since it provides the flexibility to dynamically\nallocate resources over the fading channel states.

In total four atomic and ionic levels\nwere analyzed and all of them exhibit a similar behaviour. The electric field\ngradient for the atomic $5s\\,5p\\,\\; ^3\\mathrm{P}_2$ level is derived from\nmulti-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations in order to evaluate the\nspectroscopic nuclear quadrupole moments. The results are consistent with those\nobtained in an ionic transition and based on a similar calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 13:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The ETCC provides all the parameters of\nCompton-scattering by measuring 3-D recoil electron tracks; then the Scatter\nPlane Deviation (SPD) lost in CCs is recovered. The energy loss rate (dE/dx),\nwhich CCs cannot measure, is also obtained, and is found to be indeed helpful\nto reduce the background under conditions similar to space. Accordingly the\nsignificance in gamma detection is improved severalfold. On the other hand, SPD\nis essential to determine the point-spread function (PSF) quantitatively. The\nSPD resolution is improved close to the theoretical limit for multiple\nscattering of recoil electrons.

We study the growth of black\nhole event horizons due to the cosmological expansion and accretion of cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, for different cosmological models. We propose\ngeneralized McVittie co-moving metrics and integrate the rate of accretion of\ncosmic microwave background radiation onto a supermassive black hole over\ncosmic time. We find that for flat, open, and closed Friedmann cosmological\nmodels, the ratio of the total area of the black hole event horizons with\nrespect to the area of a radial co-moving space-like hypersurface always\nincreases. Since accretion of cosmic radiation sets an absolute lower limit to\nthe total matter accreted by black holes, this implies that the causal past and\nfuture are not mirror symmetric for any spacetime event. The asymmetry causes a\nnet Poynting flux in the global future direction; the latter is in turn related\nto the ever increasing thermodynamic entropy. Thus, we expose a connection\nbetween four different \"time arrows\": cosmological, electromagnetic,\ngravitational, and thermodynamic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 18:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 18:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-20"}

However, the global optimization for non-convex\nobjective functions is particularly difficult since most of the existing global\noptimization methods depend on the local linear search algorithms that easily\ntraps into a local point, or the random search strategies that may frequently\nnot produce good off-springs. According to human behavior, a one-dimensional\nglobal search method in the global optimization should adopt alternating\ndescent and ascent (up-hill and down hill) strategies. This paper proposes the\nhuman behavior algorithms (HBA) based on alternating descent and ascent\napproaches along a direction or multiple different directions. Very\nfortunately, the proposed HBA make a global optimization method have high\npossibility for finding a global minimum point. Several benchmark experiments\ntest that our HBA are highly effective for solving some benchmark optimization\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

Overall, we find that the complexity of urban transportation networks\nis naturally coupled, consisting of two distinct patterns: (1) a fractal\ncomponent (i.e., power law) that represent a uniform grid, and (2) a second\ncomponent that can be exponential, power law, or logarithmic that captures\nchanges in road density. From this second component, we introduce two new\nindices, density index and decay index, which jointly capture essential\ncharacteristics of urban systems and therefore can help us gain new insights\ninto how cities evolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 19:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-20"}

Detection and prevention of cascading failures in power grids\nis impor- tant. Currently, grid operators mainly monitor the state (loading\nlevel) of individual components in power grids. The complex architecture of\npower grids, with many interdependencies, makes it difficult to aggregate data\nprovided by local compo- nents in a timely manner and meaningful way:\nmonitoring the resilience with re- spect to cascading failures of an\noperational power grid is a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge. The\nmain ideas behind the paper are that (i) a robustness metric based on both the\ntopology and the operative state of the power grid can be used to quantify\npower grid robustness and (ii) a new proposed a distributed computation method\nwith self-stabilizing properties can be used to achieving near real-time\nmonitoring of the robustness of the power grid. Our con- tributions thus\nprovide insight into the resilience with respect to cascading failures of a\ndynamic operational power grid at runtime, in a scalable and robust way. Com-\nputations are pushed into the network, making the results available at each\nnode, allowing automated distributed control mechanisms to be implemented on\ntop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 14:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-20"}

In equilibrium, however, rational agents\nwho maximize their objective survival probability are, individually and\ncollectively, eliminated by the forces of competition. Instead of rationality,\nthere emerges a unique distribution of irrational players who are individually\nnot fit for the struggle of survival. The selection of irrational players over\nrational ones relies on the fact that all rational players coordinate on the\nsame optimal action, which leaves them collectively undiversified and thus\nvulnerable to aggregate risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 15:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-20"}

One of the cornerstones of GR, as well as Newton's theory of gravity,\nis the weak equivalence principle (WEP), stating that the trajectory of a\nfreely falling test body is independent of its internal structure and\ncomposition. WEP is known to be valid for the normal matter with a high\nprecision. However, due to the rarity of antimatter and weakness of the\ngravitational forces, the WEP has never been confirmed for antimatter. The\ncurrent direct bounds on the ratio between the gravitational and inertial\nmasses of the antihydrogen do not rule out a repulsive nature for the\nantimatter gravity. Here we establish an indirect bound of 0.13% on the\ndifference between the gravitational and inertial masses of the positron\n(antielectron) from the analysis of synchrotron losses at the Large\nElectron-Positron collider (LEP).
