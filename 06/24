The fully dynamic version, in which edges are inserted\nand deleted over time has also been the subject of much attention. Existing\nalgorithms for dynamic matching (in general graphs) seem to fall into two\ngroups: there are fast (mostly randomized) algorithms that do not achieve a\nbetter than 2-approximation, and there slow algorithms with $\\O(\\sqrt{m})$\nupdate time that achieve a better-than-2 approximation. Thus the obvious\nquestion is whether we can design an algorithm -- deterministic or randomized\n-- that achieves a tradeoff between these two: a $o(\\sqrt{m})$ approximation\nand a better-than-2 approximation simultaneously. We answer this question in\nthe affirmative for bipartite graphs.\n  Our main result is a fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $3/2 + \\eps$\napproximation in worst-case update time $O(m^{1/4}\\eps^{/2.5})$. We also give\nstronger results for graphs whose arboricity is at most $\\al$, achieving a $(1+\n\\eps)$ approximation in worst-case time $O(\\al (\\al + \\log n))$ for constant\n$\\eps$. When the arboricity is constant, this bound is $O(\\log n)$ and when the\narboricity is polylogarithmic the update time is also polylogarithmic.\n  The most important technical developement is the use of an intermediate graph\nwe call an edge degree constrained subgraph (EDCS). This graph places\nconstraints on the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of each edge: upper\nbounds for matched edges and lower bounds for unmatched edges. The main\ntechnical content of our paper involves showing both how to maintain an EDCS\ndynamically and that and EDCS always contains a sufficiently large matching.

Embedded replications of the spin variables result in\na set of hierarchical free energies and overlap susceptibilities between\nreplica hierarchies as order parameters. The limit to infinite number of\nreplica hierarchies leads to the Parisi solution with a continuous\nreplica-symmetry breaking.

Hence, solutions with continuous and discrete\nreplica-symmetry breaking can coexist.

Here,\nwe show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes\nlead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure\nbetween two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally\nconnected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system.

It is well established that the ordering temperature\nof both models is zero. The Gaussian has a non-degenerate ground state so\nexponent $\\eta \\equiv 0$ and it has a continuous distribution of energy levels.\nFor the bimodal model, above a size dependent cross-over temperature $T^{*}(L)$\nthere is a regime of effectively continuous energy levels; below $T^{*}(L)$\nthere is a distinct regime dominated by the highly degenerate ground state plus\nan energy gap to the excited states. $T^{*}(L)$ tends to zero at very large $L$\nleaving only the effectively continuous regime in the thermodynamic limit. We\nshow that in this regime the critical exponent $\\eta$ is not zero, so the\neffectively continuous regime $2$D bimodal ISG is not in the same universality\nclass as the $2$D Gaussian ISG. The simulation data on both models are analyzed\nusing a scaling variable $\\tau = T^2/(1+T^2)$ suitable for zero temperature\ntransition ISGs, together with appropriate scaling expressions.

However,\nrecent studies have demonstrated high-specific-strength in a number of\nnanocrystalline Mg-alloys. Even so, applications of these alloys would be\nrestricted to low-temperature automotive components due to microstructural\ninstability under high temperature creep loading. Hence, this work aims to gain\na better understanding of creep and associated deformation behavior of columnar\nnanocrystalline Mg and Mg-yttrium (Y) (up to 3at.%Y(10wt.%Y)) with a grain size\nof 5 nm and 10 nm. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, nanocrystalline\nmagnesium with and without local concentrations of yttrium is subjected to\nconstant-stress loading ranging from 0 to 500 MPa at different initial\ntemperatures ranging from 473 to 723 K. In pure Mg, the analyses of the\ndiffusion coefficient and energy barrier reveal that at lower temperatures\n(i.e., T < ~423K) the contribution of grain boundary diffusion to the overall\ncreep deformation is stronger that the contribution of lattice diffusion.\nHowever, at higher temperatures (T > ~423K) lattice diffusion dominates the\noverall creep behavior. Interestingly, for the first time, we have shown that\nthe(101-1),(101-2),(101-3) and (101-6) boundary sliding energy is reduced with\nthe addition of yttrium. This softening effect in the presence of yttrium\nsuggests that the experimentally observed high temperature beneficial effects\nof yttrium addition is likely to be attributed to some combination of other\nreported creep strengthening mechanisms or phenomena such as formation of\nstable yttrium oxides at grain boundaries or increased forest dislocation-based\nhardening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 19:25:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Toward\nthis end, we re-evaluate fine-tuning arguments that lead to upper bounds on\n(some) superpartner masses.

By\nmeans of a quantitative investigation of the order parameter $m$, it is shown\nthat a nonzero $M_0$ is bound to lead to nonzero quark-antiquark condensates\nthroughout chiral phase transitions , no matter whether the order parameter $m$\nvaries discontinuously or continuously.

In physical reality, it is the\nnonzero-ness of the quark-antiquark condensates that leads to the appearance of\na critical end point in the first order phase transition line and the crossover\nbehavior at high $T$ and/or high $\\mu$ cases, rather than a possible\ntricritical point and a second order phase transition line.

For appropriate conditions, the reduced\ndynamics derived from perturbation and variational techniques allows to\ndescribe a chain of dark or bright solitons as a chain of effective masses\nconnected by nonlinear springs taking the form of a Toda lattice model on the\nsoliton's positions. In turn, the Toda lattice possesses exact solitary\ntravelling compression wave solutions corresponding to travelling compression\nwaves in the original soliton chain. We coin the term hypersoliton to describe\nsuch solitary waves riding on a chain of solitons. We corroborate our\nanalytical results with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. It is observed that in the case of dark soliton chains,\nthe formulated reduction dynamics provides an accurate description for the\nrobust evolution of travelling compression waves. In contrast, bright soliton\nchains do not have such stable propagating solutions due to the\ndesynchronization of the mutual phases between consecutive solitons during\nevolution. Finally, as an application to Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a\nstandard external harmonic trapping potential, we study the case of finite dark\nsoliton chain confined at the center of the trap. We find that when the central\nchain is hit by a dark soliton initiated at the edge of the external trap, the\nenergy is transferred through the chain as a hypersoliton. When the\nhypersoliton reaches the end of the central chain, a dark soliton is ejected\naway from the center of the trap and, as it returns from its excursion up the\ntrap, hits the central chain producing again a hypersoliton. This periodic\nevolution is the equivalent of the classical Newton's cradle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 22:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The improved hard X-ray\nsensitivity of the imaging NuSTAR data has resulted in the first robust\ndetection of Compton hump in all three objects, with amplitudes of ~1 or\ngreater in NY Lup, and likely <1.0 in the other two.

One can relate the first few multipole\nmoments of a neutron star, or quantities that can be derived from them, with\nrelations that are independent of the equation of state (EoS). This is a very\nsignificant result that has great implications for the description of neutron\nstars and in particular for the description of the spacetime around them.\nAdditionally, it was recently shown that there is a four parameter analytic\nspacetime, known as the two-soliton spacetime, which can accurately capture the\nproperties of the geometry around neutron stars. This allows for the\npossibility of describing in a unified formalism the astrophysically relevant\nproperties of the spacetime around a neutron star independently of the\nparticulars of the EoS for the matter of the star.

In the present\nwork we investigate properties such as the location of the innermost stable\ncircular orbit $R_{ISCO}$ (or the surface of the star when the latter overcomes\nthe former), the various frequencies of perturbed circular equatorial\ngeodesics, the efficiency of an accretion disc, its temperature distribution,\nand other properties associated with the emitted radiation from the disc, in a\nway that holds for all possible choices of a realistic EoS for the neutron\nstar.

In this\npaper we present the results of a study of the spin dynamics of the CoOEP\nmolecule in the Low Spin (LS) state and the High Spin (HS) state induced by\napplying the magnetic pulse of 36.8 T. We show that the spin switching in case\nof the HS state of the CoOEP molecule is characterized by a long lifetime and\nis dependent on the magnitude and duration of the applied field. Thus, after\napplying an external stimuli the system in the LS state after the spin\nswitching reverts to its ground state, whereas the system in the HS state\nremains in the excited state for a long time. We found that the temperature\ndependency of magnetic susceptibility shows an abrupt thermal spin transition\nbetween two spin states at 40K. The proposed here theoretical approach opens\nthe way to create modern devices for spintronics with the controllable spin\nswitching process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 10:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

We illustrate quantitatively the\nimplications of a temperature-dependent anisotropy on the switching rate and in\nparticular for the interpretation of the prefactor as an attempt frequency. In\nparticular, we show that realistic numbers for the attempt frequency are\nobtained when the temperature dependence of the anisotropy is taken into\naccount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 12:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

Using a suited analytical formula it has been shown that in the\nflared part of the disc the migration is inwards; planets can migrate outwards\nonly in shadowed regions of the disc, { because the radial gradient of entropy\nis stronger there}. In order to confirm this result numerically, we have\ncomputed the total torque acting on planets held on fixed orbits embedded in\nstellar irradiated 3D discs using the hydrodynamical code FARGOCA.

It is found that the SWNT networks inherit\nthe excellent mechanical properties from the constituent SWNTs, possessing a\nhigh natural frequency. However, although a high quality factor is suggested\nfrom the simulation results, it is hard to obtain an unambiguous Q-factor due\nto the existence of vibration modes in addition to the dominant mode. The\nnonlinearities resulting from these extra vibration modes are found to exist\nuniformly under various testing conditions including different initial\nactuations and temperatures. Further testing shows that these modes can be\neffectively suppressed through the introduction of axial strain, leading to an\nextremely high quality factor in the order of 109 estimated from the SWNT\nnetwork with 2% tensile strain. Additional studies indicate that the carbon\nrings connecting the SWNTs can also be used to alter the vibrational properties\nof the resulting network. This study suggests that the SWNT network can be a\ngood candidate for the applications as nanoresonators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 12:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate\npolicy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then\nidentify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches\nmost frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative,\noptimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the\nfull-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual\ninfluences among agents and capture related self-reinforcing (positive\nfeedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and\npath-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent\nheterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling\napproach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its\nuse in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption\nand diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3)\ninteractions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and\n(4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the\nproposed methodology is discussed by reference to four applications: the\ndiffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on\nincome and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the\ncross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies.

An effective turbulent resistivity which acts upon the island outer\nlayer is also calculated, and shown to always be significantly (10x - 100x)\ngreater than the collisional resistivity used in the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 15:58:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2015 13:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Although knots and links are observables of\nthe Chern-Simons (C-S) functional, the dynamical conditions for their\ngeneration lie outside of the scope of the C-S theory. The nontriviality of\ndynamical generation of knotted structures is caused by the fact that the\ncomplements of all knots/links, say, in S^3 are 3-manifolds which have\npositive, negative or zero curvature. The ability to curve the ambient space\nthus far is attributed to masses. The mass theorem of general relativity\nrequires the ambient 3-manifolds to be of non negative curvature. Recently, we\nestablished that, in the absence of boundaries, complements of dynamically\ngenerated knots/links are represented by 3-manifolds of non negative curvature.\nThis fact opens the possibility to discuss masses in terms of dynamically\ngenerated knotted/ linked structures. The key tool is the notion of knot/link\nconcordance. The concept of concordance is an adaptation of the concept of\ncobordism to knots and links. The logic of implementation of the concordance\nconcept to physical masses results in new interpretation of Casson's surgery\nformula in terms of the Regge trajectories. The latest thoroughly examined\nChew-Frautschi (C-F) plots associated with these trajectories demonstrate that\nthe hadron mass spectrum for both mesons and baryons is nicely described by the\ndata on the corresponding C-F plots.
