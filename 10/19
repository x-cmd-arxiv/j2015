While a TCP connection is\ninitialized, a routing protocol takes the responsibility for checking the hop\ncount between a source and destination pair. If the hop count is greater than a\npredefined value, the routing protocol decides to use a proxy node. The\nresponsibility of a proxy node is to check the correctness of data packets and\ninform the missing packets by sending an acknowledgement from a proxy node to\nthe source node. By doing so, the source node is able to retransmit any missing\npacket in advance without waiting until an end-to-end acknowledgement is\nreceived from the destination. Simulation results show that the proposed\nmechanism is able to increase throughput up to 55% in static network and\ndecrease routing overhead up to 95% in mobile network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 16:05:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

However, they become\nproblematic in long-time simulations: Along the event horizon, the truncation\nerror grows exponentially in the outgoing Eddington null coordinate - which we\ndenote $v_e$ - and runs out of control for a sufficiently long interval of\n$v_e$. This problem, if not properly addressed, would destroy the numerics both\ninside and outside the black hole at late times (i.e. large $v_e$). In this\npaper we explore the origin of this problem, and propose a resolution based on\nadaptive gauge for the ingoing null coordinate $u$. This resolves the problem\noutside the BH - and also inside the BH, if the latter is uncharged. However,\nin the case of a charged BH, an analogous large-$v_e$ numerical problem occurs\nat the inner horizon. We thus generalize our adaptive-gauge method in order to\novercome the IH problem as well. This improved adaptive gauge, to which we\nrefer as the maximal-$\\sigma$ gauge, allows long-$v$ double-null numerical\nsimulation across both the event horizon and the (outgoing) inner horizon, and\nup to the vicinity of the spacelike $r=0$ singularity. We conclude by\npresenting a few numerical results deep inside a perturbed charged BH, in the\nvicinity of the contracting Cauchy Horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 16:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 12:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The stability of these schemes does not\ndepend on the characteristics of the sensor measurement noise or external\ndisturbances. In addition, they are robust to initial errors in the state\nestimates and do not need to be re-tuned when sensor noise properties change.\nIn the first part of this dissertation, estimation of rigid body states is\nconsidered, given the dynamics model of the rigid body. In the second part, an\nestimation scheme that does not require knowledge of the dynamics of the rigid\nbody is derived, based on onboard sensor measurements obtained at an\nappropriate frequency. The frequency of such measurements must be suitably high\nto resolve the motion of the rigid body.

They are composed\nof monolithic elements of ice or rock bound by gravity. Voids occupy a\nsignificant fraction of the volume of a rubble pile. They can exist up to\npressure $P\\approx \\epsy\\mu$, where $\\epsy$ is the monolithic material's yield\nstrain and $\\mu$ its rigidity. At low $P$, contacts between neighboring\nelements are confined to a small fraction of their surface areas. As a result,\nthe effective thermal conductivity of a rubble pile, $\\kcon\\approx\nk(P/(\\epsy\\mu))^{1/2}$, can be orders of magnitude smaller than, $k$, the\nthermal conductivity of its monolithic elements. In a fluid-free environment,\nonly radiation can transfer energy across voids. It contributes an additional\ncomponent, $\\krad=16\\ell\\sigma T^3/3$, to the total effective conductivity,\n$\\keff=\\kcon +\\krad$. Here $\\ell$, the inverse of the opacity per unit volume,\nis of order the size of the elements and voids.

The modelled scaling relations generally match\nthe observed relations and are remarkably robust to all changes allowed within\nthese models. The empirical relationships can fail beyond the parameter ranges\nwhere they were calibrated and we discuss the nature of those failures. Because\nthe location of individual models relative to the FP and FM is sensitive to the\nadopted physical scaling of the models, unconstrained rescaling produces a much\nlarger scatter about the scaling relations than that observed. We conclude that\nonly certain combinations of scaling values, which define the physical radial\nand kinematic scale of the model, produce low scatter versions of the FP and\nFM. These combinations further result in reproducing a condition observed\npreviously for galaxies, $r_c \\rho_0 = $ constant, where $r_c$ is the scaling\nradius and $\\rho_0$ is the central density. As such, we conclude that this\nempirical finding and global galaxy scaling relations are not independent and\nthat finding the physical cause of one should lead to the solution to the\nother. Although our models are strictly for pressure supported galaxies, these\nresults may well hold generally because the central density constraint was\nfirst identified in dwarf spheroidals but later extended to rotating giant\ngalaxies and the FM applies to galaxies of any morphological type and\nluminosity class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 20:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

This channel serves as a generalization to the binary erasure\nchannel, and mimics situations when a symbol output from the channel is known\nonly partially, that is, the output symbol contains some ambiguity, but is not\nfully erased. This type of channel is motivated by non-volatile memory\nmulti-level read channels. In such channels the readout is obtained by a\nsequence of current/voltage measurements, which may terminate with partial\nknowledge of the stored level.

Traditional analysis of techno-social systems\ndata has focused mainly on describing either the dynamics of social\ninteractions, or the attributes and behaviors of the users. However,\noverwhelming empirical evidence suggests that the two dimensions affect one\nanother, and therefore they should be jointly modeled and analyzed in a\nmulti-modal framework. The benefits of such an approach include the ability to\nbuild better predictive models, leveraging social network information as well\nas user behavioral signals. To this purpose, here we propose the Constrained\nLatent Space Model (CLSM), a generalized framework that combines Mixed\nMembership Stochastic Blockmodels (MMSB) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\nincorporating a constraint that forces the latent space to concurrently\ndescribe the multiple data modalities. We derive an efficient inference\nalgorithm based on Variational Expectation Maximization that has a\ncomputational cost linear in the size of the network, thus making it feasible\nto analyze massive social datasets. We validate the proposed framework on two\nproblems: prediction of social interactions from user attributes and behaviors,\nand behavior prediction exploiting network information.

Beyond its well-known merits, the polar rotation\ntensor also has a lesser known dynamical inconsistency: it does not satisfy the\nfundamental superposition principle of rigid-body rotations over adjacent time\nintervals. As a consequence, the polar rotation diverts from the observed mean\nmaterial rotation of fibers in fluids, and introduces a purely kinematic memory\neffect into computed material rotation. Here we derive a generalized polar\ndecomposition for linear processes that yields a unique, dynamically consistent\nrotation component, the dynamic rotation tensor, for the deformation gradient.\nThe left dynamic stretch tensor is objective, and shares the principal strain\nvalues and axes with its classic polar counterpart. Unlike its classic polar\ncounterpart, however, the dynamic stretch tensor evolves in time without spin.\nThe dynamic rotation tensor further decomposes into a spatially constant mean\nrotation tensor and a dynamically consistent relative rotation tensor that is\nobjective for planar deformations. We also obtain simple expressions for\ndynamic analogues of Cauchy's mean rotation angle that characterize a deforming\nbody objectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 06:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

Spectrophotometric data of 11 PNe and two H II regions were obtained\nwith the OSIRIS spectrograph attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Data for\nother 13 PNe and three H II regions were retrieved from the literature.\nPhysical conditions and chemical abundances of O, N, Ne, Ar and S were derived\nfor 19 PNe and 4 H II regions. Abundances in the PNe sample are widely\ndistributed showing 12+log(O/H) from 7.4 to 8.2 and 12+log(Ar/H) from 4.97 to\n5.80. Two groups of PNe can be differentiated: one old, with low metallicity\n(12+log(O/H)<8.0 and 12+log(Ar/H)<5.7) and another younger with metallicities\nsimilar to the values of H II regions. The old objects are distributed in a\nlarger volume than the young ones. An important fraction of PNe (>30%) was\nfound to be highly N-rich (Type I PNe). Such PNe occur at any metallicity. In\naddition, about 60% of the sample presents high ionization (He++/He >= 0.1),\npossessing a central star with effective temperature larger than 10^6 K.\nPossible biases in the sample are discussed.

Tanaka and Nakagawa (2014) proposed a mixed integer\nquadratic optimization formulation for solving the problem based on a quadratic\napproximation of the logistic loss function. However, since there is a\nsignificant gap between the logistic loss function and its quadratic\napproximation, their formulation may fail to find a good subset of features. To\novercome this drawback, we apply a piecewise-linear approximation to the\nlogistic loss function. Accordingly, we frame the feature subset selection\nproblem of minimizing an information criterion as a mixed integer linear\noptimization problem.

Experimental\nsimulations were performed in an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Ice samples were\ndeposited onto an infrared transparent window at 8K and were subsequently\nirradiated with a microwave-discharged hydrogen flow lamp. After irradiation,\nice samples were warmed up until complete sublimation was attained. Photolysis\nof CO2 molecules initiates a network of photon-induced chemical reactions\nleading to the formation of CO, CO3 ,O2 , and O3 . During irradiation,\nphoton-induced desorption of CO and, to a lesser extent, O2 and CO2 took place\nthrough a process called indirect desorption induced by electronic transitions\n(DIET), with maximum photodesorption yields (Ypd) of 1.2 x 10-2\nmolecules/incident photon , 9.3 x 10-4 molecules/incident photon , and 1.1 x\n10-4 molecules/incident photon , respectively.

The coagulation process\nchanges the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the disk in\nsignificant ways. To properly interpret observations of protoplanetary disks\nand to place these observations in the context of the first steps of planet\nformation, it is crucial to understand the optical properties of these complex\nstructures. We derive the optical properties of dust aggregates using detailed\ncomputations of aggregate structures and compare these computa- tionally\ndemanding results with approximate methods that are cheaper to compute in\npractice. In this way we wish to understand the merits and problems of\napproximate methods and define the context in which they can or cannot be used\nto analyze observations of objects where significant grain growth is taking\nplace. For the detailed computations we used the discrete dipole approximation\n(DDA), a method able to compute the interaction of light with a complexly\nshaped, inhomogeneous particle. We compared the results to those obtained using\nspherical and irregular, homogeneous and inhomogeneous particles. While no\napproximate method properly reproduces all characteristics of large dust\naggregates, the thermal properties of dust can be analyzed using irregularly\nshaped, porous, inhomogeneous grains. The asymmetry of the scattering phase\nfunction is a good indicator of aggregate size, while the degree of\npolarization is probably determined by the size of the constituent particles.\nOptical properties derived from aggregates significantly differ from the most\nfrequently used standard (\"astronomical silicate\" in spherical grains).

Also, the constructed\ncodes enable the receivers use small number of transmissions to decode their\nwanted messages which is important to have the probability of message error\nreduced in a noisy broadcast channel. Some of the cases considered are shown to\nbe critical index coding problems and these codes help to identify some of the\nsubclasses considered by others to be not critical index coding problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 11:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

Connectivity means, that neighboring robots of the chain need to be\npositioned at the same or neighboring points of the grid. In our model,\ngathering means to keep shortening the chain until the robots are located\ninside a $2\\times 2$ subgrid. Our model is completely local (no global control,\nno global coordinates, no compass, no global communication or vision, \\ldots).\nEach robot can only see its next constant number of left and right neighbors on\nthe chain.

Nation published in 1995: \"Which lattices (and in particular which\ncountable lattices) are sublattices of a free lattice?\"\n  Despite partial progress over the decades, the problem is still unsolved.\nThere is emphasis on the countable case because the current body of knowledge\non sublattices of free lattices is most concentrated on when these sublattices\nare countably infinite.\n  It is known that sublattices of free lattices which are finite can be\ncharacterized as being those lattices which satisfy Whitman's condition and are\nsemidistributive. This assertion was conjectured by B. Jonsson in the 1960's\nand proven by J.B. Nation in 1980. However, there is a desire for a new proof\nto this deep result as Nation's proof is very involved and more insight into\nsublattices of free lattices is sought after.\n  In this article, a sufficient condition involving a construct known as a join\nminimal pair, or just a minimal pair, implying J'onsson's conjecture is proven.\nMinimal pairs were first defined by H. Gaskill when analysing sharply\ntransferable lattices. Using this sufficient condition, research by I.Rival and\nB.Sands is used to compare this condition with properties of finite\nsemidistributive lattices and in the process refute the main assertion of a\nmanuscript by H.Muhle. Moreover, inspired by the approaches used by Henri\nMuhle, I will make a partial result which investigates a possible forbidden\nsublattice characterization involving breadth-two planar semidistributive\nlattices. To the best of my knowledge, the two results of this article (the\nsufficient condition for Jonsson's conjecture and the partial result\naforementioned) are new.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 14:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

The solvent swells the\ncylinder asymmetrically at one side and evaporates out of it from where it is\nexposed to atmosphere. Because of inhomogeneous swelling, the cylinder bends\nbut tends to straighten out following evaporation of the solvent. Balance of\nthese two opposing effects induces the static state of the cylinder to\neventually bifurcate to a dynamic state of rolling. Similar to marangoni effect\nin liquid, the rolling motion of cylinder is driven and sustained by the\ncurvature of the cylinder. The rolling velocity increases linearly with\ncurvature of the bent cylinder which ceases to locomote as the curvature\ndiminishes below a threshold limit. Similar to marangoni effect, the rolling\nvelocity increases also with temperature of the substrate and surroundings.

Coherency and persistence of LAVs may\nhave drastic effect on quantum tunneling due to correlation effects discovered\nby Schrodinger and Robertson in 1930. These effects have been applied to the\ntunneling problem by a number of authors, who demonstrated a giant increase of\nsub-barrier transparency during the increase of the correlation coefficient at\na special high-frequency periodic action on quantum system. Recently, it has\nbeen proposed that discrete breathers (a sub-class of LAVs arising in periodic\nsystems) present the most natural and efficient way to produce correlation\neffects in regular crystals due to time-periodic modulation of the potential\nwell (or the Coulomb barrier) width and hence to act as breather nano-colliders\ncatalyzing low energy nuclear reactions (LENR) in solids.

For instance, deriving the electrostatic energy in\nsemiconductors using the traditional formula fails at giving the correct\nelectrostatic force between capacitor plates and reveals the existence of an\nextra contribution to the standard electrostatic energy. This additional energy\nis found to proceed from the generation of space charge regions which are\npredicted when combining electrostatics laws with semiconductor statistics,\nsuch as for accumulation and inversion layers. On the contrary, no such energy\nexists when relying on electrostatics only, as for instance when adopting the\nso-called full depletion approximation. The same holds for charged or neutral\ninsulators that are still consistent with the customary definition, but which\nare in fact singular cases. In semiconductors, this additional free energy can\nlargely exceed the energy gained by the dipoles, thus becoming the dominant\nterm. Consequently, erroneous electrostatic forces in nanostructure systems\nsuch as for MEMS and NEMS as well as incorrect energy calculations are expected\nusing the standard definition.

Parrondo paradox refers to the\nsituation that the mixture of A and B game in a sequence leads to winning in\nthe long run. The paradox can be resolved using Markov chain analysis. We\nextend this setting of Parrondo game to involve players with one-step memory.\nThe player can win by switching his choice of A or B game in a Parrondo game\nsequence.
