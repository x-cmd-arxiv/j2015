The flare originated on 2013\nMay 17 and belonged to active region NOAA 11748. We detected strong He I 10830\nA emission in the flare. The red component of the He I triplet peaks at an\nintensity ratio to the continuum of about 1.86. During the flare, He I Stokes V\nis substantially larger and appears reversed compared to the usually larger Si\nI Stokes V profile. The photospheric Si I inversions of the four Stokes\nprofiles reveal the following: (1) the magnetic field strength in the\nphotosphere decreases or is even absent during the flare phase, as compared to\nthe pre-flare phase. However, this decrease is not permanent. After the flare\nthe magnetic field recovers its pre-flare configuration in a short time (i.e.,\nin 30 minutes after the flare). (2) In the photosphere, the line-of-sight\nvelocities show a regular granular up- and down-flow pattern before the flare\nerupts. During the flare, upflows (blueshifts) dominate the area where the\nflare is produced. Evaporation rates of ~ $10^{-3}$ and ~ $10^{-4}$ g cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ have been derived in the deep and high photosphere, respectively,\ncapable of increasing the chromospheric density by a factor of two in about 400\nseconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 16:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The detector consists in two parts: a PET\nhead mounted on an ultrasound probe and an external PET plate.

These effects can be modelled on a\nmultidimensional integer lattice by using a dynamical system obtained by\ncomposing the transition operator of the original system with a quantizer. Such\nmodels manifest pseudorandomness which can be studied using a rigorous\nprobability theoretic approach. To this end, the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is\nendowed with a class of frequency measurable subsets and a spatial frequency\nfunctional as a finitely additive probability measure on them. Using a\nmultivariate version of Weyl's equidistribution criterion, we introduce an\nalgebra of frequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice. This\napproach is applied to quantized linear systems with the transition operator $R\n\\circ L$, where $L$ is a nonsingular matrix of the original linear system in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, and the map $R$ commutes with the additive group of\ntranslations of the lattice. For almost every $L$, the events associated with\nthe deviation of trajectories of the quantized and original systems are\nfrequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice whose frequencies\ninvolve geometric probabilities on finite-dimensional tori. Using the skew\nproducts of measure preserving toral automorphisms, we prove mutual\nindependence and uniform distribution of the quantization errors and\ninvestigate statistical properties of invertibility loss for the quantized\nlinear system, extending V.V.Voevodin's results.

This structure introduces non-Gaussian statistics into\nthe redshifted 21 cm fluctuation amplitudes that can only be studied through\ntomographic imaging, which will clearly discriminate between different galaxy\nformation scenarios. Imaging the ionisation structure and cosmological HII\nregions during reionisation is therefore a key goal for the SKA. For example,\nthe SKA1-LOW baseline design with a 1 km diameter core will resolve HII regions\nexpected from galaxy formation models which include strong feedback on low-mass\ngalaxy formation. Imaging the smaller HII regions that result from galaxy\nformation in the absence of SNe feedback will also be possible for SKA1-LOW in\nthe later stages of reionisation, but may require the greater sensitivity of\nSKA early in the reionisation era. In addition to having baselines long enough\nto resolve the HII regions, the field of view for SKA1-LOW reionisation\nexperiments should be at least several degrees in order to image the largest HI\nstructures towards the end of reionisation. The baseline design with 35 meter\ndiameter stations has a field of view within a single primary pointing which is\nsufficient for this purpose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 23:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

We explore linear and nonlinear contributions to phonon\ndissipation in silica at cryogenic temperatures using fiber-optic structures\nthat tightly confine both photons and phonons to the fiber-optic core. When\nimmersed in helium, this fiber system supports nearly perfect guidance of 9 GHz\nacoustic phonons; strong electrostrictively mediated photon-phonon coupling (or\nguided-wave stimulated Brillouin scattering) permits a flexible form of\nlaser-based phonon spectroscopy. Through linear and nonlinear phonon\nspectroscopy, we isolate the effects of disorder-induced two-level tunneling\nstates as a source of phononic dissipation in this system. We show that an\nensemble of such two-level tunneling states can be driven into\ntransparency--virtually eliminating this source of phonon dissipation over a\nbroad range of frequencies. Experimental studies of phononic self-frequency\nsaturation show excellent agreement with a theoretical model accounting for the\nphonon coupling to an ensemble of two-level tunneling states. Extending these\nresults, we demonstrate a general approach to suppress dissipation produced by\ntwo-level tunneling states via cross-saturation, where the lifetime of a\nphonons at one frequency can be extended by the presence of a high intensity\nacoustic beam at another frequency.

While much effort has been put into detecting somatic genomic\nvariation in these data, somatic structural variation induced by the activity\nof transposable element insertions has not been reported. Transposable elements\n(TEs) are particularly relevant in cancer in part because of several known\ncases in which a TE insertion is directly linked to cancer formation and\nstudies linking the epigenetic status of retrotransposons to carcinogenesis and\npatient outcome. Additionally, evidence for somatic retrotransposition in\neukaryotic genomes suggests that some tissues and therefore some cancer types\nmay be disposed to increased retrotransposition. We built upon previous work to\ndevelop a highly efficient computational pipeline for the detection of\nnon-reference mobile ele- ment insertions from high-throughput paired-end whole\ngenome sequencing data that is capable of detecting breakpoints through a local\nassembly strategy. Using this, we analyzed 33 whole genome tumor datasets with\npaired normal samples from TCGA across 3 different cancer types: glioblastoma\nmultiforme (GBM), ovarian serous cystoadenocarcinoma (OV) and colorectal ade-\nnocarcinoma (COAD).

The amount of somatic\nretrotransposition varies widely between samples with 61 insertions present in\none case.

Given a set of data\npoints drawn from a union of subspaces, the goal is to partition them into\ntheir underlying subspaces they were drawn from. The spectral clustering method\nis used as the framework. It requires to find an affinity matrix which is close\nto block diagonal, with nonzero entries corresponding to the data point pairs\nfrom the same subspace. In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the\ngrouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity\nmatrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points\nfrom different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected\ndata which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together. Sparse\nSubspace Clustering (SSC), by using $\\ell^1$-minimization, encourages sparsity\nfor data selection, but it lacks of the grouping effect. On the contrary,\nLow-Rank Representation (LRR), by rank minimization, and Least Squares\nRegression (LSR), by $\\ell^2$-regularization, exhibit strong grouping effect,\nbut they are short in subset selection. Thus the obtained affinity matrix is\nusually very sparse by SSC, yet very dense by LRR and LSR.\n  In this work, we propose the Correlation Adaptive Subspace Segmentation\n(CASS) method by using trace Lasso. CASS is a data correlation dependent method\nwhich simultaneously performs automatic data selection and groups correlated\ndata together. It can be regarded as a method which adaptively balances SSC and\nLSR.

Although very influential\nin the literature, the traditional visual BOW model has two distinct drawbacks.\nFirstly, for efficiency purposes, the visual vocabulary is commonly constructed\nby directly clustering the low-level visual feature vectors extracted from\nlocal keypoints, without considering the high-level semantics of images. That\nis, the visual BOW model still suffers from the semantic gap, and thus may lead\nto significant performance degradation in more challenging tasks (e.g. social\nimage classification). Secondly, typically thousands of visual words are\ngenerated to obtain better performance on a relatively large image dataset. Due\nto such large vocabulary size, the subsequent image classification may take\nsheer amount of time. To overcome the first drawback, we develop a graph-based\nmethod for visual BOW refinement by exploiting the tags (easy to access\nalthough noisy) of social images. More notably, for efficient image\nclassification, we further reduce the refined visual BOW model to a much\nsmaller size through semantic spectral clustering. Extensive experimental\nresults show the promising performance of the proposed framework for visual BOW\nrefinement and reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 12:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

Compared to related\nwork, WiGest is unique in using standard WiFi equipment, with no\nmodi-fications, and no training for gesture recognition. The system identifies\ndifferent signal change primitives, from which we construct mutually\nindependent gesture families. These families can be mapped to distinguishable\napplication actions. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy\nsignals, gesture type and attributes detection, reducing false positives due to\ninterfering humans, and adapting to changing signal polarity. We implement a\nproof-of-concept prototype using off-the-shelf laptops and extensively evaluate\nthe system in both an office environment and a typical apartment with standard\nWiFi access points. Our results show that WiGest detects the basic primitives\nwith an accuracy of 87.5% using a single AP only, including through-the-wall\nnon-line-of-sight scenarios. This accuracy in-creases to 96% using three\noverheard APs. In addition, when evaluating the system using a multi-media\nplayer application, we achieve a classification accuracy of 96%.

Moreover,\nunder suitable assumptions on the spectrum of the covariance operator of $X$\nand as $d$ diverges to infinity when $\\varepsilon$ vanishes, some\nsimplifications occur. In particular, the SmBP factorizes asymptotically as the\nproduct of the joint density of the first $d$ PCs and a pure volume parameter.\nAll the provided factorizations allow to define a surrogate intensity of the\nSmBP that, in some cases, leads to a genuine intensity. To operationalize the\nstated results, a non-parametric estimator for the surrogate intensity is\nintroduced and it is proved that the use of estimated PCs, instead of the true\nones, does not affect the rate of convergence.

For OIA the transmitter needs channel\nstate information (CSI), which is usually measured on the receiver side and\nsent to the transmitter side via a feedback channel. Lee and Choi show that $d$\ndegrees of freedom (DoF) per transmitter are achievable in a 3-cell MIMO\ninterference channel assuming perfect real-valued feedback. However, the\nfeedback of a real-valued variable still requires infinite rate. In this paper,\nwe investigate 1-bit quantization for opportunistic interference alignment\n(OIA) in 3-cell interference channels. We prove that 1-bit feedback is\nsufficient to achieve the optimal DoF $d$ in 3-cell MIMO interference channels\nif the number of users per cell is scaled as ${\\rm SNR}^{d^2}$. Importantly,\nthe required number of users for OIA with 1-bit feedback remains the same as\nwith real-valued feedback. For a given system configuration, we provide an\noptimal choice of the 1-bit quantizer, which captures most of the capacity\nprovided by a system with real-valued feedback.

We\nconsider the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension $7$ in the\noperator product expansion(OPE). And all possible off-shell cases are\nconsidered, $\\phi$, $D_{s}$ and $D_{s}^{*}$, resulting in three different form\nfactors. Then we fit the form factors into analytical functions and extrapolate\nthem into time-like regions, which giving the coupling constant for the\nprocess. Our analysis indicates that the coupling constant for this vertex is\n$G_{Ds*Ds\\phi}=4.12\\pm0.70 GeV^{-1}$. The results of this work are very useful\nin the other phenomenological analysis. As an application, we calculate the\ncoupling constant for the decay channel $D_{s}^{*}\\rightarrow D_{s}\\gamma$ and\nanalyze the width of this decay with the assumption of the vector meson\ndominance of the intermediate $\\phi(1020)$. Our final result about the decay\nwidth of this decay channel is $\\Gamma=0.59\\pm0.15keV$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 06:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 05:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

The integration of\nspins on the structural glass model well represents the magnetic moments in the\nglassy metal. The model is exactly solved by the recursive calculation\ntechnique. The magnetization of the amorphous Ising spins, i.e. the glassy\nmetallic magnet is investigated by our modeling and calculation on a\ntheoretical base. The results show that the glassy metallic magnets has a lower\nCurie temperature, weaker magnetization, and higher entropy comparing to the\nregular ferromagnet in crystal form. These findings can be understood with the\nrandomness of the amorphous system, and agrees well with others' experimental\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 12:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 14:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-06"}
