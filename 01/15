However, when the x-ray energy is tuned to an absorption edge, this\nhomogeneity no longer exists. Within the same material, spatial regions\ncontaining elements at resonance will have optical properties very different\nfrom regions without resonating sites. In this situation, models assuming\nhomogeneous optical properties throughout the material can fail to describe the\nreflectivity adequately. As we show here, resonant soft x-ray reflectivity is\nsensitive to these variations, even though the wavelength is typically large as\ncompared to the atomic distances over which the optical properties vary. We\nhave therefore developed a scheme for analyzing resonant soft x-ray\nreflectivity data, which takes the atomic structure of a material into account\nby \"slicing\" it into atomic planes with characteristic optical properties.\nUsing LaSrMnO4 as an example, we discuss both the theoretical and experimental\nimplications of this approach.

We developed and validated a method which uses these\nprojections to determine the trajectory of and dose to highly mobile tumors\nduring each fraction of treatment.\n  Methods: CBCT images of a respiration phantom were acquired, the trajectory\nof which mimicked a lung tumor with high amplitude (up to 2.5 cm) and\nhysteresis. A template-matching algorithm was used to identify the location of\na steel BB in each CBCT projection, and a Gaussian probability density function\nfor the absolute BB position was calculated which best fit the observed\ntrajectory of the BB in the imager geometry. Two modifications of the\ntrajectory reconstruction were investigated: first, using respiratory phase\ninformation to refine the trajectory estimation (Phase), and second, using the\nMonte Carlo (MC) method to sample the estimated Gaussian tumor position\ndistribution.\n  Results: With all methods, the mean position of the BB was determined with\naccuracy better than 0.1 mm, and trajectory errors averaged 3.8$\\pm$1.1% of the\nmarker amplitude. Dosimetric calculations using Phase methods were more\naccurate, with mean absolute error less than 0.5%, and with error less than 1%\nin the highest-noise trajectory. MC-based trajectories prevent the\nover-estimation of dose, but when viewed in an absolute sense, add a small\namount of dosimetric error (<0.1%).\n  Conclusions: Marker trajectory and target dose-of-the-day were accurately\ncalculated using CBCT projections. This technique provides a method to evaluate\nhighly-mobile tumors using ordinary CBCT data, and could facilitate better\nstrategies to mitigate or compensate for motion during SBRT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 16:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

In this work, the critical length\nscale $L_c$ for the onset of instability is determined via stability analysis\nof the linearized Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations of $d$-dimensional\ngranular binary mixtures at moderate densities. In contrast to previous\nattempts, the analysis is not restricted to nearly elastic systems since it\ntakes into account the nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients and\nthe cooling rate on the collisional dissipation. As expected from previous\nresults obtained in the very dilute regime, linear stability shows $d-1$\ntransversal (shear) modes and a longitudinal (\"heat\") mode to be unstable with\nrespect to long enough wavelength excitations. The theoretical predictions also\nshow that the origin of the instability is driven by the transversal component\nof the velocity field that becomes \\emph{unstable} when the system length\n$L>L_c$. An explicit expression of $L_c$ is obtained in terms of the masses and\ndiameters of the mixture, the composition, the volume fraction and the\ncoefficients of restitution.

We successfully\nisolated and investigated this instability in the canonical problem of piston\ndriven shock waves propagating into a medium characterized by inelastic\ncollision processes. We treat the standard model of granular gases, where\nparticle collisions are taken as inelastic with constant coefficient of\nrestitution. The inelasticity is activated for sufficiently strong collisions.\nMolecular dynamic simulations were performed for 30,000 particles. We find that\nall shock waves investigated become unstable, with density non-uniformities\nforming in the relaxation region. The wavelength of these fingers is found\ncomparable to the characteristic relaxation thickness. Shock Hugoniot curves\nfor both elastic and inelastic collisions were obtained analytically and\nnumerically. Analysis of these curves indicate that the instability is not of\nthe Bethe-Zeldovich-Thompson or Dyakov-Kontorovich types. Analysis of the shock\nrelaxation rates and rates for clustering in a convected fluid element with the\nsame thermodynamic history outruled the clustering instability of a homogeneous\ngranular gas. Instead, wave reconstruction of the early transient evolution\nindicates that the onset of instability occurs during the re-pressurization of\nthe gas following the initial relaxation of the medium behind the lead shock.\nThis re-pressurization gives rise to internal pressure waves in the presence of\nstrong density gradients. This indicates that the mechanism of instability is\nmore likely of the vorticity-generating Richtmyer-Meshkov type, relying on the\naction of the inner pressure waves development during the transient relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 18:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

We introduce the Bayesian measurement\nmodel imposed and derive the algorithm to reconstruct a \"statistical template\"\nout of noisy data. The properties of these \"statistical templates\" are analysed\nwith simulated and real measurement data from PSR B1133+16.

While the average template contains\nfluctuations and noise as unavoidable artifacts, we find that the \"statistical\ntemplate\" derived by Bayesian inference quantifies fluctuations and remaining\nuncertainty.

A moving\ndata window of fifty pulses, taking out one single pulse at the beginning and\nadding one at the end of the window unravels the characteristics of the methods\nto be compared. It shows that the change induced in the classical\nreconstruction is dominated by random fluctuations for the average template,\nwhile statistically significant changes drive the dynamics of the proposed\nmethod's reconstruction.

This work is focused on the study\nof the correlation between environmental density and radio AGN presence. Using\ndata from the photometric COSMOS survey and the radio 1.4GHz VLA-COSMOS, a\nsample of radio AGNs has been defined. The environment has been studied\nthroughout the use of the richness distributions inside a parallelepipedon with\nbase side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the photometric redshift\nprecision. Richness distributions have been compared as a function of both the\nredshift and the relative evolution of the stellar masses of galaxies and AGN\nhosts up to $z=2$. Radio AGNs are always located in environments that are\nsignificantly denser than those around galaxies in which radio emission is\nabsent. Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy\nto host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power\nradio AGNs leads to the conclusion that the significance in the environmental\neffect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the\nevolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence\nis a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z=2$, with a significant\nincrease of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with\ndecreasing redshift.

So, one is led to considering a combination of\nthese anomalies. But, if we \"hand-pick\" the anomalies (test statistics) to\nconsider, we are making an \\textit{a posteriori} choice. In this article, we\npropose two statistics that do not suffer from this problem. The statistics are\nlinear and quadratic combinations of the $a_{\\ell m}$'s with random\nco-efficients, and they test the null hypothesis that the $a_{\\ell m}$'s are\nindependent, normally-distributed, zero-mean random variables with an\n$m$-independent variance. The motivation for such statistics is generality;\nequivalently, it is a non \\textit{a posteriori} choice. But, a very useful\nby-product of considering such statistics is this: Because most physical models\nthat lead to large-scale anomalies result in coupling multiple $\\ell$ and $m$\nmodes, the \"coherence\" of this coupling should get enhanced if a combination of\ndifferent modes is considered. Using fiducial data, we demonstrate that the\nmethod works and discuss how it can be used with actual CMB data to make quite\ngeneral statements about how incompatible the data are with the null\nhypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 21:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Although H$_2$O on rutile TiO$_2$(110) has been\nthoroughly studied both experimentally and theoretically, a quantitative value\nfor the energy of the highest H$_2$O occupied levels is still lacking. For\nexperiment, this is due to the H$_2$O levels being obscured by hybridization\nwith TiO$_2$(110) levels in the difference spectra obtained via ultraviolet\nphotoemission spectroscopy (UPS). For theory, this is due to inherent\ndifficulties in properly describing many-body effects at the\nH$_2$O-TiO$_2$(110) interface. Using the projected density of states (DOS) from\nstate-of-the-art quasiparticle (QP) $G_0W_0$, we disentangle the adsorbate and\nsurface contributions to the complex UPS spectra of H$_2$O on TiO$_2$(110). We\nperform this separation as a function of H$_2$O coverage and dissociation on\nstoichiometric and reduced surfaces. Due to hybridization with the TiO$_2$(110)\nsurface, the H$_2$O 3a$_1$ and 1b$_1$ levels are broadened into several peaks\nbetween 5 and 1 eV below the TiO$_2$(110) valence band maximum (VBM).

We find the highest occupied levels of H$_2$O adsorbed intact and\ndissociated on stoichiometric TiO$_2$(110) are 1.1 and 0.9 eV below the VBM. We\nalso find a similar energy of 1.1 eV for the highest occupied levels of H$_2$O\nwhen adsorbed dissociatively on a bridging O vacancy of the reduced surface. In\nboth cases, these energies are significantly higher (by 0.6 to 2.6 eV) than\nthose estimated from UPS difference spectra, which are inconclusive in this\nenergy region.

These problems are typically characterized by physical processes\nin domains with multiple scales (see Figure 1 for the illustration of a\nperforated domain). Moreover, these problems are intrinsically multiscale and\ntheir discretizations can yield very large linear or nonlinear systems. In this\npaper, we investigate multiscale approaches that attempt to solve such problems\non a coarse grid by constructing multiscale basis functions in each coarse\ngrid, where the coarse grid can contain many perforations. In particular, we\nare interested in cases when there is no scale separation and the perforations\ncan have different sizes. In this regard, we mention some earlier pioneering\nworks [14, 18, 17], where the authors develop multiscale finite element\nmethods. In our paper, we follow Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method\n(GMsFEM) and develop a multiscale procedure where we identify multiscale basis\nfunctions in each coarse block using snapshot space and local spectral\nproblems.

Realistic generative network models are important in this\ncontext as they avoid privacy concerns of real data and simplify complex\nnetwork research regarding data sharing, reproducibility, and scalability\nstudies. \\emph{Random hyperbolic graphs} are a well-analyzed family of\ngeometric graphs. Previous work provided empirical and theoretical evidence\nthat this generative graph model creates networks with non-vanishing clustering\nand other realistic features. However, the investigated networks in previous\napplied work were small, possibly due to the quadratic running time of a\nprevious generator.\n  In this work we provide the first generation algorithm for these networks\nwith subquadratic running time. We prove a time complexity of $O((n^{3/2}+m)\n\\log n)$ with high probability for the generation process. This running time is\nconfirmed by experimental data with our implementation. The acceleration stems\nprimarily from the reduction of pairwise distance computations through a polar\nquadtree, which we adapt to hyperbolic space for this purpose. In practice we\nimprove the running time of a previous implementation by at least two orders of\nmagnitude this way. Networks with billions of edges can now be generated in a\nfew minutes.\n  Finally, we evaluate the largest networks of this model published so far.

He minimized the power dissipation arising from the trade-off between\nfluid circulation and blood maintenance. The law, based on a constant fluid\nviscosity, states that in the optimal configuration the fluid flow rate inside\nthe vessel is proportional to the cube of the vessel radius, implying that wall\nshear stress is not dependent on the vessel radius. Murray's law has been found\nto be true in blood macrocirculation, but not in microcirculation. In 2005,\nAlarc\\'on et al took into account the non monotonous dependence of viscosity on\nvessel radius - F{\\aa}hr{\\ae}us-Lindqvist effect - due to phase separation\neffect of blood. They were able to predict correctly the behavior of wall shear\nstresses in microcirculation. One last crucial step remains however: to account\nfor the dependence of blood viscosity on shear rates. In this work, we\ninvestigate how viscosity dependence on shear rate affects Murray's law. We\nextended Murray's optimal design to the whole range of Qu\\'emada's fluids, that\nmodels pseudo-plastic fluids such as blood. Our study shows that Murray's\noriginal law is not restricted to Newtonian fluids, it is actually universal\nfor all Qu\\'emada's fluid as long as there is no phase separation effect. When\nphase separation effect occurs, then we derive an extended version of Murray's\nlaw. Our analyses are very general and apply to most of fluids with shear\ndependent rheology.

To assess the importance of a resulting causality, it needs to be\nnormalized. The normalization is achieved through distinguishing three types of\nfundamental mechanisms that govern the marginal entropy change of the flow\nrecipient. A normalized or relative flow measures its importance relative to\nother mechanisms. In analyzing realistic series, both absolute and relative\ninformation flows need to be taken into account, since the normalizers for a\npair of reverse flows belong to two different entropy balances; it is quite\nnormal that two identical flows may differ a lot in relative importance in\ntheir respective balances.

In the\npresence of an ac drive, the dynamics of a single spin acquires additional\nharmonics at frequencies determined by both, the drive frequency and the local\nfield. These harmonics are reflected as additional peaks in the noise spectrum.\nWe study how the ensemble-averaged \\delta s_{\\omega}^2 evolves with the drive\namplitude, \\omega_dr (in the frequency units). Our main finding is that\nadditional peaks in the spectrum, caused by the drive, remain sharp even when\n\\omega_dr is much smaller than the typical hyperfine field. The reason is that\nthe drive affects only the spins for which the local Larmour frequency is close\nto the drive frequency. The shape of the low-frequency \"Rabi\"-peak in \\delta\ns_{\\omega}^2 is universal with both, the position and the width, being of the\norder of \\omega_dr.

Previously, the hydrodynamic\nequations were derived from this theory and its transport coefficients were\ngiven in terms of infinite series. Here, I show that the transport coefficients\ntake a simple form in the large density limit. This allows me to analytically\nevaluate the well-known density instability of the polarly ordered phase near\nthe flocking threshold at moderate and large densities. The growth rate of a\nlongitudinal perturbation is calculated and several scaling regimes, including\nthree different power laws, are identified.

Analytical predictions for the width of the unstable band, the maximum\ngrowth rate and for the wave number below which the instability occurs are\ngiven. In particular, the system size below which spatial perturbations of the\nhomogeneous ordered state are stable is predicted to scale with $\\sqrt{M}$\nwhere $M$ is the average number of collision partners.

A class of\nphylogenetic methods known as \"species tree methods\" have been proposed to\ndirectly address one important source of gene tree heterogeneity, namely the\nincomplete lineage sorting or deep coalescence that occurs when evolving\nlineages radiate rapidly, resulting in a diversity of gene trees from a single\nunderlying species tree. Although such methods are gaining in popularity, they\nare being adopted with caution in some quarters, in part because of an\nincreasing number of examples of strong phylogenetic conflict between\nconcatenation or supermatrix methods and species tree methods. Here we review\ntheory and empirical examples that help clarify these conflicts. Thinking of\nconcatenation as a special case of the more general model provided by the\nmultispecies coalescent can help explain a number of differences in the\nbehavior of the two methods on phylogenomic data sets. Recent work suggests\nthat species tree methods are more robust than concatenation approaches to some\nof the classic challenges of phylogenetic analysis, including rapidly evolving\nsites in DNA sequences, base compositional heterogeneity and long branch\nattraction. We show that approaches such as binning, designed to augment the\nsignal in species tree analyses, can distort the distribution of gene trees and\nare inconsistent. Computationally efficient species tree methods that\nincorporate biological realism are a key to phylogenetic analysis of whole\ngenome data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 05:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

Also\npseudo-bulges, with a more disky morphology and kinematics, can form more\nslowly through secular evolution of a bar, where resonant stars are elevated\nout of the plane, in a peanut/box shape. As a result, in CDM cosmological\nsimulations, it is very difficult to find a bulgeless galaxy, while they are\nobserved very frequently in the local universe. A different picture emerges in\nalternative models of the missing mass problem. In MOND (MOdified Newtonian\nDynamics), galaxy mergers are much less frequent, since the absence of dark\nmatter halos reduces the dynamical friction between two galaxies. Also, while\nclumpy galaxies lead to rapid classical bulge formation in CDM, the inefficient\ndynamical friction with MOND in the early-universe galaxies prevents the clumps\nto coalesce together in the center to form spheroids. This leads to less\nfrequent and less massive classical bulges. Bars in MOND are more frequent and\nstronger, and have a more constant pattern speed, which modifies significantly\nthe pseudo-bulge morphology. The fraction of pseudo-bulges is expected to be\ndominant in MOND.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 09:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

We focus on applications\nwith real-time constraints, in which the user must receive each result update\nwithin a given period after the update occurs. To handle fast data, the DSMS is\ncommonly placed on top of a cloud infrastructure. Because stream properties\nsuch as arrival rates can fluctuate unpredictably, cloud resources must be\ndynamically provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time response.\nIt is quite essential, for the existing systems or future developments, to\npossess the ability of scheduling resources dynamically according to the\ncurrent workload, in order to avoid wasting resources, or failing in delivering\ncorrect results on time. Motivated by this, we propose DRS, a novel dynamic\nresource scheduler for cloud-based DSMSs. DRS overcomes three fundamental\nchallenges: (a) how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources\nand query response time (b) where to best place resources; and (c) how to\nmeasure system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes an\naccurate performance model based on the theory of \\emph{Jackson open queueing\nnetworks} and is capable of handling \\emph{arbitrary} operator topologies,\npossibly with loops, splits and joins.

A linear dependency of this density to the amount of energy\ntransferred into the plasma from an energy storage was found by C. Teske. Since\nthe amount of stored energy is known, the energy transfer efficiency is a\nreliable parameter for the design of a spherical theta pinch device.

By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky.

On small scales the Sigma_SFR derived using Ha systematically\nunderestimates the count-based Sigma_SFR, by up to a factor of 10.

The fraction of the total mass\n(gas plus young stars) locked in young stars is systematically high (~10 per\ncent) within the central 15 pc and systematically lower outside (2 per cent),\nwhich we interpret as variations in star formation efficiency. The inner 15 pc\nis dominated by young stars belonging to a centrally condensed cluster, while\nthe outer parts are dominated by a dispersed population.

Using the galaxy formation SAM GALFORM, we create\nmock galaxy SEDs using realistic star formation histories (SFH) and add an AGN\nof Type 1, Type 2, or intermediate type whose contribution to the bolometric\nluminosity can be variable. We perform an SED fitting of these catalogues with\nCIGALE assuming three different SFHs: a single- and\ndouble-exponentially-decreasing, and a delayed SFH. Constraining\nthecontribution of an AGN to the LIR (fracAGN) is very challenging for\nfracAGN<20%, with uncertainties of ~5-30% for higher fractions depending on the\nAGN type, while FIR and sub-mm are essential. The AGN power has an impact on\nthe estimation of $M_*$ in Type 1 and intermediate type AGNs but has no effect\nfor galaxies hosting Type 2 AGNs. We find that in the absence of AGN emission,\nthe best estimates of $M_*$ are obtained using the\ndouble-exponentially-decreasing model but at the expense of realistic ages of\nthe stellar population. The delayed SFH model provides good estimates of $M_*$\nand SFR, with a maximum offset of 10% as well as better estimates of the age.\nOur analysis shows that the underestimation of the SFR increases with fracAGN\nfor Type 1 systems, as well as for low contributions of an intermediate AGN\ntype, but it is quite insensitive to the emission of Type 2 AGNs up to\nfracAGN~45%. Similarly the UV emission is critical in accurately retrieving the\n$M_*$ for Type 1 and intermediate type AGN, and the SFR of all of the three AGN\ntypes.

Although the methodology applies to general scenarios, the\npresent work focuses on a situation with an asymmetric observation structure\nthat only involves two agents.

In both cases, the second agent has access to some strictly\ncausal observations of the first agent's actions, which enables the two agents\nto coordinate. These scenarios are applied to the problem of distributed power\ncontrol; the key idea is that a transmitter may embed information about the\nwireless channel state into its transmit power levels so that an observation of\nthese levels, e.g. the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, allows the\nother transmitter to coordinate its power levels.

The last decade has\nwitnessed a surge of algorithms and theoretical results addressing this\nquestion. One of the most popular algorithms is the $\\ell_p$-regularized least\nsquares (LPLS) given by the following formulation: \\[ \\hat{x}(\\gamma,p )\\in\n\\arg\\min_x \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - Ax\\|_2^2+\\gamma\\|x\\|_p^p, \\] where $p \\in [0,1]$.\nDespite the non-convexity of these problems for $p<1$, they are still appealing\nbecause of the following folklores in compressed sensing: (i) $\\hat{x}(\\gamma,p\n)$ is closer to $x_o$ than $\\hat{x}(\\gamma,1)$.

A new method\nwas developed to simulate these images which accounted for vortices with a\nnon-zero core in a thin, anisotropic superconductor and a simplex algorithm was\nused to make a quantitative comparison between the images and simulations to\nmeasure the penetration depths and coherence lengths.

This involution conjugates (though not topologically) the\nGauss' continued fraction map to an intermittent dynamical system on the unit\ninterval with an infinite invariant measure. The transfer operator (resp. the\nfunctional equation) naturally associated to this dynamical system is closely\nrelated to the Mayer transfer operator (resp. the Lewis' functional equation).\nWe give a description of this involution as the boundary action of a certain\nautomorphism of the infinite trivalent tree. We prove that its derivative\nexists and vanishes almost everywhere. It is conjectured that algebraic numbers\nof degree at least three are mapped to transcendental numbers under this\ninvolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 17:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 20:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

That unnecessary doubt in turn is\npartly responsible for the reluctance to adopt the view that probability is\npart of logic. Several authors have pointed out deficiencies in grue;\nnevertheless, the \"problem\" still excites. Here, adapted from Groarke, is\npresented the basis of grue, along with another simple demonstration that the\n\"problem\" makes no sense and is brought about by a misunderstanding of\ncausation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 22:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}

A matrix weight may not be expressible as direct\nsum of irreducible weights, but it is always equivalent to a direct sum of\nirreducible weights.
