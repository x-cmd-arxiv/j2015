One reason why this topic occupies an important place in\nthe theory of probability and mathematical statistical physics is that scaling\nlimits provide the link between statistical mechanics and (Euclidean) field\ntheory. In order to explain the main ideas behind the concept of scaling limit,\nI will focus on a \"toy\" model that exhibits the typical behavior of statistical\nmechanical models at and near the critical point. This model, known as the\nrandom walk loop soup, is actually interesting in its own right. It can be\ndescribed as a Poissonian ensemble of lattice loops, or a lattice gas of loops\nsince it fits within the ideal gas framework of statistical mechanics. After\nintroducing the model and discussing some interesting connections with the\ndiscrete Gaussian free field, I will present some results concerning its\nscaling limit, which leads to a Poissonian ensemble of continuum loops known as\nthe Brownian loop soup. The latter was introduced by Lawler and Werner and is a\nvery interesting object with connections to the Schramm-Loewner Evolution and\nvarious models of statistical mechanics. In the second part of the lectures, I\nwill use the Brownian loop soup to construct a family of functions that behave\nlike correlation functions of a conformal field. I will then use these\nfunctions and their derivation to introduce the concept of conformal field and\nto explore the connection between scaling limits and conformal fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 16:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 06:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

A popular method for multi-label\nclassification is classifier chains, in which the predictions of individual\nclassifiers are cascaded along a chain, thus taking into account inter-label\ndependencies and improving the overall performance. Several varieties of\nclassifier chain methods have been introduced, and many of them perform very\ncompetitively across a wide range of benchmark datasets. However, scalability\nlimitations become apparent on larger datasets when modeling a fully-cascaded\nchain. In particular, the methods' strategies for discovering and modeling a\ngood chain structure constitutes a mayor computational bottleneck. In this\npaper, we present the classifier trellis (CT) method for scalable multi-label\nclassification. We compare CT with several recently proposed classifier chain\nmethods to show that it occupies an important niche: it is highly competitive\non standard multi-label problems, yet it can also scale up to thousands or even\ntens of thousands of labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 16:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

Specifically, we consider the\nlong-pulse illumination regime, in which the time for electron-phonon\nthermalisation can be neglected and photoacoustic wave generation arises solely\nfrom the thermo-elastic stress caused by the temperature increase of the\nnanosphere or its liquid environment. Photoacoustic signals are predicted\ncomputed based on the successive resolution of a thermal diffusion problem and\na thermoelastic problem, taking into account the finite size of the gold\nnanosphere and the temperature-dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient\nof water. For sufficiently high illumination fluences, this temperature\ndependence yields a nonlinear relationship between the photoacoustic amplitude\nand the fluence. For nanosecond pulses in the linear regime, we show that more\nthan 90 % of the emitted photoacoustic energy is generated in water, and the\nthickness of the generating layer around the particle scales close to the\nsquare root of the pulse duration. Our results demonstrate that the\npoint-absorber model introduced by Calasso et al.[17] significantly\noverestimates the amplitude of photoacoustic waves in the nonlinear regime. We\ntherefore provide quantitative estimates of a critical energy, defined as the\nabsorbed energy required such that the nonlinear contribution is equal to that\nof the linear contribution. Our results suggest that the critical energy scales\nas the volume of water over which heat diffuses during the illumination pulse.\nMoreover, thermal nonlinearity is shown to be expected only for sufficiently\nhigh ultrasound frequency. Finally, we show that the relationship between the\nphotoacoustic amplitude and the equilibrium temperature at sufficiently high\nfluence reflects the thermal diffusion at the nanoscale around the gold\nnanosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 16:34:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 15:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 20:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 10:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Our calculation results show that for the\nisolated Feq3, mer-Feq3 is more stable than the fac-Feq3; and both Feq3 isomers\nhave a high spin-state of 5 {\\mu}B as the ground state when an on-site\nHubbard-U term is included to treat the highly localized Fe 3d electrons; while\nthe standard DFT calculations produce a low spin-state of 1 {\\mu}B. These\nmagnetic behaviors can be understood by the octahedral ligand field splitting\ntheory. Furthermore, we found that fac-Feq3 has a stronger bonding to the Co\nsurface than mer-Feq3 and an anti-ferromagnetic coupling was discovered between\nFe and Co substrate, originating from the superexchange coupling between Fe and\nCo mediated by the interface oxygen and nitrogen atoms. These findings suggest\nthat Feq3 molecular films may serve as a promising spin-filter material in\nspintronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 19:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We use dynamical multi-mass models, that include a prescription\nfor equipartition, to quantify the bias in the inferred dynamical mass as the\nresult of the assumption that light follows mass. For a universal IMF and a\nmetallicity dependent present day mass function we find that the inferred mass\nfrom integrated light properties systematically under estimates the true mass,\nand that the bias is more important at high metallicities, as was found for the\nM31 GCs. We show that mass segregation and a flattening of the mass function\nhave opposing effects of similar magnitude on the mass inferred from integrated\nproperties. This makes the mass-to-light ratio as derived from integrated\nproperties an inadequate probe of the low-mass end of the stellar mass\nfunction. There is, therefore, no need for variations in the IMF, nor the need\nto invoke depletion of low-mass stars, to explain the observations. Finally, we\nfind that the retention fraction of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is an\nequally important parameter in understanding the mass segregation bias.

When a gravitationally unstable disk is unable to\ncool rapidly it settles into a quasi-stationary, fluctuating gravitoturbulent\nstate, in which its Toomre Q remains close to a constant value Q_0~1. Here we\ndevelop an analytical formalism describing the evolution of such a disk, which\nis based on the assumptions of Q=Q_0 and local thermal equilibrium. Our\napproach works in the presence of additional sources of angular momentum\ntransport (e.g. MRI), as well as external irradiation. Thermal balance dictates\na unique value of the gravitoturbulent stress \\alpha_{gt} driving disk\nevolution, which is a function of the local surface density and angular\nfrequency. We compare this approach with other commonly used gravitoturbulent\nviscosity prescriptions, which specify the explicit dependence of stress\n\\alpha_{gt} on Toomre Q in an ad hoc fashion, and identify the ones that\nprovide consistent results. We nevertheless argue that our Q=Q_0 approach is\nmore flexible, robust, and straightforward, and should be given preference in\napplications. We illustrate this with a couple of analytical calculations -\nlocations of the snow line and of the outer edge of the dead zone in a\ngravitoturbulent protoplanetary disk - which clearly show the simplicity and\nversatility of the Q=Q_0 approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 21:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

One possible mechanism for the occurrence of such rare,\nunusually-intense waves is nonlinear wave focusing. Recent results have\ndemonstrated that random localizations of energy, induced by the dispersive\nmixing of different harmonics, can grow significantly due to localized\nnonlinear focusing. Here we show how the interplay between i) statistical\nproperties captured through linear information such as the waves power spectrum\nand ii) nonlinear dynamical properties of focusing localized wave groups\ndefines a critical length scale associated with the formation of extreme\nevents. The energy that is locally concentrated over this length scale acts as\nthe \"trigger\" of nonlinear focusing for wave groups and the formation of\nsubsequent rare events. We use this property to develop inexpensive, short-term\npredictors of large water waves. Specifically, we show that by merely tracking\nthe energy of the wave field over the critical length scale allows for the\nrobust, inexpensive prediction of the location of intense waves with a\nprediction window of 25 wave periods. We demonstrate our results in numerical\nexperiments of unidirectional water wave fields described by the Modified\nNonlinear Schrodinger equation.

The\ncritical dynamics is characterized by the coupling of the density field with\nthe bond-orientational order parameter $Q_4$, which measures the degree of\nlocal crystallization. Two setups are compared, which present the transition at\ndifferent critical accelerations as a a result of modifying the energy\ndissipation parameters. In both setups five independent critical exponents are\nmeasured, associated to different properties of $Q_4$: the correlation length,\nrelaxation time, vanishing wavenumber limit (static susceptibility), the\nhydrodynamic regime of the pair correlation function, and the amplitude of the\norder parameter. The respective critical exponents agree in both setups and are\ngiven by $\\nu_{\\perp} = 1$, $\\nu_{\\parallel} = 2$, $\\gamma = 1$, $\\eta \\approx\n0.6 - 0.67$, and $\\beta=1/2$, whereas the dynamical critical exponent is $z =\n\\nu_{\\parallel}/\\nu_{\\perp} = 2$. The agreement on five exponents is an exigent\ntest for the universality of the transition. Thus, while dissipation is\nstrictly necessary to form the crystal, the path the system undergoes towards\nthe phase separation is part of a well defined universality class. In fact, the\nlocal order shows critical properties while density does not. Being the later\nconserved, the appropriate model that couples both is model C in the Hohenberg\nand Halperin classification. The measured exponents are in accord with the\nnon-equilibrium extension to model C if we assume that $\\alpha$, the exponent\nassociated in equilibrium to the specific heat divergence but with no\ncounterpart in this non-equilibrium experiment, vanishes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 22:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

These extensions enhance the occurrence of\nhigh-speed solar wind streams (HSS) and related co-rotating interaction regions\nin the low-latitude heliosphere, and cause moderate, recurrent geomagnetic\nactivity in the near-Earth space. Here, using a novel definition of geomagnetic\nactivity at high (polar cap) latitudes and the longest record of magnetic\nobservations at a polar cap station, we calculate the annually averaged solar\nwind speeds as proxies for the effective annual occurrence of HSS over the\nwhole Grand Modern Maximum (GMM) from 1920s onwards.

For most cycles the HSS activity clearly maximizes\nduring one year, suggesting that typically only one strong activation leading\nto a coronal hole extension is responsible for the HSS maximum. We find that\nthe most persistent HSS activity occurred in the declining phase of solar cycle\n18. This suggests that cycle 19, which marks the sunspot maximum period of the\nGMM, was preceded by exceptionally strong polar fields during the previous\nsunspot minimum.

This problem was promoted in\nthe survey of Montanaro and de Wolf under the name of testing unitarily\ninvariant properties of mixed states. It is the natural quantum analogue of the\nclassical problem of testing symmetric properties of probability distributions.\n  Here, the hope is for algorithms with subquadratic copy complexity in the\ndimension $d$. This is because the \"empirical Young diagram (EYD) algorithm\"\ncan estimate the spectrum of a mixed state up to $\\epsilon$-accuracy using only\n$\\widetilde{O}(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$ copies.

Here we study the\npresence of communities in the inferred stock market network, and show that the\nknowledge about the communities alone can provide a nearly complete\nrepresentation of the system topology.

While there are many powerful computational and\nanalytical libraries available on HPC (e.g. for scalable linear algebra), they\ngenerally lack the usability and variety of analytical libraries found in other\nenvironments (e.g. the Apache Hadoop ecosystem). Further, there is a lack of\nabstractions that unify access to increasingly heterogeneous infrastructure\n(HPC, Hadoop, clouds) and allow reasoning about performance trade-offs in this\ncomplex environment.

In this paper,\nwe explore paths to interoperability between Hadoop and HPC, examine the\ndifferences and challenges, such as the different architectural paradigms and\nabstractions, and investigate ways to address them.

The formula is significantly different\nfrom the traditional Richardson-Dushman (RD) law for which it is independent of\nmass to account for the supply function of the electrons in the graphene\nbehaving like massless Fermion quasiparticles. By comparing with a recent\nexperiment [Kaili Jiang et al., Nano Research 7, 553 (2014)] measuring electron\nthermionic emission from a suspended single layer graphene, our model predicts\nthat the intrinsic work function of a single-layer graphene is about 4.514 eV\nwith a Fermi energy level of 0.083 eV. For a given work function, a new scaling\nof $T^{3}$ is predicted, which is different from the traditional RD scaling of\n$T^2$. If the work function of the graphene is lowered to 2.5 to 3 eV, and the\nFermi energy level is increased to 0.8 to 0.9 eV, it is possible to design a\ngraphene cathode based TIC operating at around 900 K or lower, as compared with\nthe metal-based cathode TIC (operating at about 1500 K). With a graphene based\ncathode (work function = 4.514 eV) at 900 K, and a metallic based anode (work\nfunction = 2.5 eV) like LaB$_6$ at 425 K, the efficiency of our proposed-TIC is\nabout 45$\\%$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 05:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

By numerically\ncalculating the eigenfunctions in the basis of the angular momentum we find\nthat the localization length ${\\cal L}$ for fixed parameter values has a\ncertain distribution, in fact its inverse is Gaussian distributed, in analogy\nand in connection with the distribution of finite time Lyapunov exponents of\nHamilton systems. However, unlike the case of the finite time Lyapunov\nexponents, this distribution is found to be independent of $N$, and thus\nsurvives the limit $N=\\infty$. This is different from the tight-binding model\nof Anderson localization.

First, the\napplication logic has to be analyzed and then separated into a set of\ndistributed tasks for an underlying network. Then, the tasks have to be\nimplemented for the specific hardware. Apart from handling these issues, they\nhave to deal with other aspects of life-cycle such as changes in application\nrequirements and deployed devices. Several approaches have been proposed in the\nclosely related fields of wireless sensor network, ubiquitous and pervasive\ncomputing, and software engineering in general to address the above challenges.\nHowever, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned\nchallenges when applied to the IoT. This paper proposes an integrated approach\nfor addressing the above mentioned challenges.

The development\nframework provides a set of modeling languages to specify each development\nconcern and abstracts the scale and heterogeneity related complexity.

A possible marginal to fast cooling phase transition in GRB 080916C is\ndiscussed. The time resolved spectra in different pulses of GRB 100724B, GRB\n100826A and GRB 130606B are investigated. We found that the flux is\nproportional to the peak energy in almost all pulses. The phases for different\npulses are determined according to the spectral index revolution. We found the\nstrong correlations between spectral indices and the peak energy in GRB\n100826A, which can be explained by the Compton effect in the fast cooling\nphase. However, the complex scenario predicts a steeper index for the injected\nelectrons, which challenges the acceleration mechanism in GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 08:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-13"}

Most observational results on the high redshift restframe UV-bright\ngalaxies are based on samples pinpointed using the so called dropout technique\nor Ly-alpha selection. However, the availability of multifilter data allows now\nreplacing the dropout selections by direct methods based on photometric\nredshifts. In this paper we present the methodology to select and study the\npopulation of high redshift galaxies in the ALHAMBRA survey data. Aims. Our aim\nis to develop a less biased methodology than the traditional dropout technique\nto study the high redshift galaxies in ALHAMBRA and other multifilter data.\nThanks to the wide area ALHAMBRA covers, we especially aim at contributing in\nthe study of the brightest, less frequent, high redshift galaxies. Methods. The\nmethodology is based on redshift probability distribution functions (zPDFs). It\nis shown how a clean galaxy sample can be obtained by selecting the galaxies\nwith high integrated probability of being within a given redshift interval.\nHowever, reaching both a complete and clean sample with this method is\nchallenging. Hence, a method to derive statistical properties by summing the\nzPDFs of all the galaxies in the redshift bin of interest is introduced.\nResults. Using this methodology we derive the galaxy rest frame UV number\ncounts in five redshift bins centred at z=2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5, being\ncomplete up to the limiting magnitude at m_UV(AB)=24. With the wide field\nALHAMBRA data we especially contribute in the study of the brightest ends of\nthese counts, sampling well the surface densities down to m_UV(AB)=21-22.\nConclusions. We show that using the zPDFs it is easy to select a clean sample\nof high redshift galaxies. We also show that statistical analysis of the\nproperties of galaxies is better done using a probabilistic approach, which\ntakes into account both the incompleteness and contamination in a natural way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 09:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 09:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

A couple of jetted TDEs have been recently\nclaimed in hard X-rays, challenging jet models, previously applied to\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. It is therefore of paramount\nimportance to increase the current sample. In this paper, we find that the best\nstrategy is not to use up-coming X-ray instruments alone, which will yield\nbetween several (e-Rosita) and a couple of hundreds (Einstein Probe) events per\nyear below redshift one. We rather claim that a more efficient TDE hunter will\nbe the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) operating {\\it in survey mode} at 1.4 GHz.\nIt may detect up to several hundreds of events per year below $z \\sim 2.5$ with\na peak rate of a few tens per year at $z\\approx 0.5$. Therefore, even if the\njet production efficiency is {\\it not } $100\\%$ as assumed here, the predicted\nrates should be large enough to allow for statistical studies. The\ncharacteristic TDE decay of $t^{-5/3}$, however, is not seen in radio, whose\nflux is quite featureless. {\\it Identification} therefore requires localization\nand prompt repointing by higher energy instruments. If radio candidates would\nbe repointed within a day by future X-ray observatories (e.g. Athena and\nLOFT-like missions), it will be possible to detect up to $\\approx 400$ X-ray\ncounterparts, almost up to redshift $2$. The shortcome is that only for\nredshift below $\\approx 0.4$ the trigger times will be less than 10 days from\nthe explosion. In this regard the X-ray surveys are better suited to probe the\nbeginning of the flare, and are therefore complementary to SKA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 10:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We derive abundances of nine elements\n(Fe, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Ti) for 428 red giant stars in 10 globular\nclusters. The intrinsic abundance range relative to measurement errors is\nexamined, and the well-known C-N and Mg-Al anticorrelations are explored using\nan extreme-deconvolution code for the first time in a consistent way. We find\nthat Mg and Al drive the population membership in most clusters, except in M107\nand M71, the two most metal-rich clusters in our study, where the grouping is\nmost sensitive to N. We also find a diversity in the abundance distributions,\nwith some clusters exhibiting clear abundance bimodalities (for example M3 and\nM53) while others show extended distributions. The spread of Al abundances\nincreases significantly as cluster average metallicity decreases as previously\nfound by other works, which we take as evidence that low metallicity,\nintermediate mass AGB polluters were more common in the more metal poor\nclusters. The statistically significant correlation of [Al/Fe] with [Si/Fe] in\nM15 suggests that $^{28}$Si leakage has occurred in this cluster. We also\npresent C, N and O abundances for stars cooler than 4500 K and examine the\nbehavior of A(C+N+O) in each cluster as a function of temperature and [Al/Fe].\nThe scatter of A(C+N+O) is close to its estimated uncertainty in all clusters\nand independent on stellar temperature. A(C+N+O) exhibits small correlations\nand anticorrelations with [Al/Fe] in M3 and M13, but we cannot be certain about\nthese relations given the size of our abundance uncertainties.

Secondly, we introduce an approach for\nstationary distributions, such as homogeneous databases partitioned over\ndifferent learners, which ensures that all models have the same impact.

The conventional answer\nbased on analysis of games such as the Prisoners Dilemma (PD) is that it is\nnot, even though mutual cooperation results in a better outcome for all. This\nincompatibility between individual rationality and collective benefit lies at\nthe heart of questions about the evolution of cooperation, as illustrated by PD\nand similar games. Here, we argue that this apparent incompatibility is due to\nan inconsistency in the standard Nash framework for analyzing non-cooperative\ngames and propose a new paradigm, that of the co-action equilibrium. As in the\nNash solution, agents know that others are just as rational as them and taking\nthis into account leads them to realize that others will independently adopt\nthe same strategy, in contrast to the idea of unilateral deviation central to\nNash equilibrium thinking. Co-action equilibrium results in better collective\noutcomes for games representing social dilemmas, with relatively \"nicer\"\nstrategies being chosen by rational selfish individuals. In particular, the\ndilemma of PD gets resolved within this framework, suggesting that cooperation\ncan evolve in nature as the rational outcome even for selfish agents, without\nhaving to take recourse to additional mechanisms for promoting it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 11:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 10:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-14"}

Stellar evolution models\ntherefore usually adopt parameterizations for such transport based on idealized\nlaminar or mean-field models. Unfortunately, recent attempts to model this\ntransport in global simulations have produced results that are not consistent\nwith any of these idealized models. In an effort to explain the discrepancies\nbetween global simulations and idealized models, we here use three-dimensional\nlocal Cartesian simulations of compressible convection to study the efficiency\nof transport by meridional flows below a convection zone in several parameter\nregimes of relevance to the Sun and solar-type stars. In these local\nsimulations we are able to establish the correct ordering of dynamical\ntimescales, although the separation of the timescales remains unrealistic. We\nfind that, even though the generation of internal waves by convective overshoot\nproduces a high degree of time dependence in the meridional flow field, the\nmean flow has the qualitative behavior predicted by laminar, \"balanced\" models.\nIn particular, we observe a progressive deepening, or \"burrowing\", of the mean\ncirculation if the local Eddington-Sweet timescale is shorter than the viscous\ndiffusion timescale. Such burrowing is a robust prediction of laminar models in\nthis parameter regime, but has never been observed in any previous numerical\nsimulation.

The approach taken is the following.\nFirst, linear simulations are performed in order to determine the turbulence\nregime. Second, the heat fluxes in nonlinear simulations are matched to\nexperimental fluxes by varying the logarithmic ion temperature gradient within\nthe expected experimental error bars. Finally, the dependence of various\nquantities with respect to the ion temperature gradient is analyzed in detail.\nIt is found that density and temperature fluctuations can vary significantly\nwith small changes in this parameter, thus making comparisons with experiments\nvery sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental profiles.

We started a follow-up program to validate, confirm, and\ncharacterize some of the planet candidates. In this paper we present the radial\nvelocity analysis (RV) of those presenting large variations, compatible with\nbeing eclipsing binaries. We also study those showing large rotational\nvelocities, which prevents us from obtaining the necessary precision to detect\nplanetary-like objects. We present new RV results for 13 Kepler objects of\ninterest (KOIs) obtained with the CAFE spectrograph at the Calar Alto\nObservatory, and analyze their high-spatial resolution images and the Kepler\nlight curves of some interesting cases. We have found five spectroscopic and\neclipsing binaries. Among them, the case of KOI-3853 is of particular interest.\nThis system is a new example of the so-called heartbeat stars, showing dynamic\ntidal distortions in the Kepler light curve. We have also detected duration and\ndepth variations of the eclipse. We suggest possible scenarios to explain such\neffect, including the presence of a third substellar body possibly detected in\nour RV analysis. We also provide upper mass limits to the transiting companions\nof other six KOIs with large rotational velocities. This property prevents the\nRV method to obtain the necessary precision to detect planetary-like masses.\nFinally, we analyze the large RV variations of other two KOIs, incompatible\nwith the presence of planetary-mass objects. These objects are likely to be\nstellar binaries but a longer timespan is still needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 14:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 15:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization. On the\nother hand, nodal precession is too slow to produce observable signatures in\nthe radiatively inefficient case. We also discuss the relationship between our\nsimulations and the parabolic TDEs that are characteristic of most stellar\ntidal disruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 15:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 01:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}
