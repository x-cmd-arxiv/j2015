Fostered by the relevancy of a scientific\ncharacterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount\nof data, academics have recently immersed in this topic and one of the most\nstriking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling\nlaws between several urban indicators and the population size. Despite that,\nmost governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these\nnonlinearities by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of urban\nindicators, a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards\nsmall or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear\nallometries. By following the ideas of Bettencourt et al., we account for this\nbias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an urban\nindicator and the value expected by the allometry with the population size. We\nshow that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative\nsummary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not\nappear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from\nBrazilian cities. We also show that these scale-adjusted metrics are strongly\ncorrelated with their past values by a linear correspondence and that they also\ndisplay crosscorrelations among themselves. Simple linear models account for\n31%-97% of the observed variance in data and correctly reproduce the average of\nthe scale-adjusted metric when grouping the cities in above and below the\nallometric laws.

In this paper we define and\nanalyze an abstract model of traffic interception (i.e. eavesdropping) in\ndistance-vector routing networks. Specifically, we study al- gorithms that\nmeasure the potential of groups of dishonest agents to divert traffic through\ntheir infrastructure under the constraint that messages must reach their\nintended destinations. We relate two variants of our model based on the allowed\nkinds of lies, define strategies for colluding agents, and prove optimality in\nspecial cases. In our main theorem we derive a provably optimal monitoring\nstrategy for subsets of agents in which no two are adjacent, and we extend this\nstrategy to the general case.

The disc itself evolves on time-scales of several Myr during which\nboth temperature and density profiles change as matter accretes onto the\ncentral star. Here we use a detailed model of an evolving disc to determine the\ngrowth of planets by pebble accretion and their migration through the disc.\nCores that reach their pebble isolation mass accrete gas to finally form giant\nplanets with extensive gas envelopes, while planets that do not reach pebble\nisolation mass are stranded as ice giants and ice planets containing only minor\namounts of gas in their envelopes. Unlike earlier population synthesis models,\nour model works without any artificial reductions in migration speed and for\nprotoplanetary discs with gas and dust column densities similar to those\ninferred from observations. We find that in our nominal disc model the\nemergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in\norder to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller\nplanets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for\ngas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances. Gas giant planets\nnevertheless experience significant reduction in semi-major axes by migration.\nConsidering instead planetesimal accretion for planetary growth, we show that\nformation time-scales are too long to compete with the migration time-scales\nand the dissipation time of the protoplanetary disc. Altogether, we find that\npebble accretion overcomes many of the challenges in the formation of ice and\ngas giants in evolving protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 17:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 12:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

The electronic\noscillations in turn give rise to electromagnetic radiation which, in the case\nof linear media, possess the frequency of the exciting beam. Because Maxwell's\nequations are linear, one expects the total field at any point in space to be\nthe sum of the original (exciting) field and the radiation produced by all the\noscillating electrons. However, in practice the original beam appears to be\nabsent within the medium, as though it had been replaced by a different beam,\none having a shorter wavelength and propagating in a different direction. The\nEwald-Oseen theorem resolves this paradox by showing how the oscillating\nelectrons conspire to produce a field that exactly cancels out the original\nbeam everywhere inside the medium. The net field is indeed the sum of the\nincident beam and the radiated field of the oscillating electrons, but the\nlatter field completely masks the former. Although the proof of the Ewald-Oseen\ntheorem is fairly straightforward, it involves complicated integrations over\ndipolar fields in three-dimensional space, making it a brute-force drill in\ncalculus and devoid of physical insight. It is possible, however, to prove the\ntheorem using plane-waves interacting with thin slabs of material, while\ninvoking no physics beyond Fresnel's reflection coefficients. The thin slabs\nrepresent sheets of electric dipoles, and the use of Fresnel's coefficients\nallows one to derive exact expressions for the electromagnetic field radiated\nby these dipolar sheets.

At each time slot the network controller activates a set of\nnon-interfering links and forwards selected copies of packets on each activated\nlink. A packet is considered jointly received only when all nodes in the\nnetwork have obtained a copy of it. The maximum rate of jointly received\npackets is referred to as the broadcast capacity of the network. Existing\npolicies achieve the broadcast capacity by balancing traffic over a set of\nspanning trees, which are difficult to maintain in a large and time-varying\nwireless network. We propose a new dynamic algorithm that achieves the\nbroadcast capacity when the underlying network topology is a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG). This algorithm is decentralized, utilizes local queue-length\ninformation only and does not require the use of global topological structures\nsuch as spanning trees. The principal technical challenge inherent in the\nproblem is the absence of work-conservation principle due to the duplication of\npackets, which renders traditional queuing modelling inapplicable. We overcome\nthis difficulty by studying relative packet deficits and imposing in-order\ndelivery constraints to every node in the network. Although in-order packet\ndelivery, in general, leads to degraded throughput in graphs with cycles, we\nshow that it is throughput optimal in DAGs and can be exploited to simplify the\ndesign and analysis of optimal algorithms. Our characterization leads to a\npolynomial time algorithm for computing the broadcast capacity of any wireless\nDAG under the primary interference constraints. Additionally, we propose an\nextension of our algorithm which can be effectively used for broadcasting in\nany network with arbitrary topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 02:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

We then propose a generic model to unfold collaborative\nhuman activities into three modules: (i) individual behavior characterized by\nPoissonian initiation of an action, (ii) human interaction captured by a\ncascading response to others with a power-law waiting time, and (iii)\npopulation growth due to increasing number of interacting individuals. This\nunfolding allows us to obtain analytical formula that is fully supported by the\nuniversal patterns in empirical data. Our modeling approaches reveal\n\"simplicity\" beyond complex interacting human activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 05:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

However, practical applications of UCNCs are hindered\nby their low upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) and the high irradiances\nnecessary to produce relevant upconversion luminescence. Achieving high UCQY\nunder practically relevant irradiance remains a major challenge. The UCQY is\nseverely limited due to non-radiative surface quenching processes. We present a\nrate equation model for migration of the excitation energy to show that surface\nquenching does not only affect the lanthanide ions directly at the surface but\nalso many other lanthanide ions quite far away from the surface. The average\nmigration path length is in the order of several nanometers and depends on the\ndoping as well as the irradiance of the excitation. Using Er3+-doped beta-NaYF4\nUCNCs, we show that very isotropic and thick (~10 nm) beta-NaLuF4 inert shells\ndramatically reduce the surface-related quenching processes, resulting in much\nbrighter upconversion luminescence at simultaneously considerably lower\nirradiances.

In this paper, we\nshow that restricting the problem to models with monotone regression functions\nand monotone instruments significantly weakens the ill-posedness of the\nproblem. In stark contrast to the existing literature, the presence of a\nmonotone instrument implies boundedness of our measure of ill-posedness when\nrestricted to the space of monotone functions. Based on this result we derive a\nnovel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator that imposes\nmonotonicity of the regression function. For a given sample size, the bound is\nindependent of the degree of ill-posedness as long as the regression function\nis not too steep. As an implication, the bound allows us to show that the\nconstrained estimator converges at a fast, polynomial rate, independently of\nthe degree of ill-posedness, in a large, but slowly shrinking neighborhood of\nconstant functions.

In order\nto achieve this we use a two scalar field model, in the context of which the\nincorporation of the Type IV singularity can be consistently done. In the\ncontext of the exponential model we study, when a Type IV singularity is\nincluded in the evolution, an instability occurs in the slow-roll parameters,\nand in particular on the second slow-roll parameter. Particularly, if we\nabandon the slow-roll condition for both the scalars we shall use, then the\nmost consistent description of the dynamics of the inflationary era is provided\nby the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\\epsilon_H$ and $\\eta_H$. Then, the second\nHubble slow-roll parameter $\\eta_H$, which measures the duration of the\ninflationary era, becomes singular at the point where the Type IV singularity\nis chosen to occur, while the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\\epsilon_H$ is\nregular there. Therefore, this infinite singularity indicates that the\noccurrence of the finite-time singularity is responsible for the instability in\nthe scalar field model we study. This sort of instability has it's imprint on\nthe dynamical system that can be constructed from the cosmological equations,\nwith the dynamical system being unstable. In addition, the instability due to\nthe singularity mechanism we propose, is discussed in the context of other\ninflationary scalar potentials. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a\nsingularity in the Hubble slow-roll parameters and we also critically discuss\nqualitatively, what implications could this effect have on the graceful exit\nproblem of the exponential model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 10:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and analytical\ncalculations show that, when a background flow is present, mathematical\nexpressions for the AW damping via phase mixing are modified by the following\nsubstitution: $C_A^\\prime(x) \\to C_A^\\prime(x)+V_0^\\prime(x)$, where $C_A$ and\n$V_0$ are AW phase and the flow speeds, and the prime denotes a derivative in\nthe direction across the background magnetic field. In uniform magnetic fields\nand over-dense plasma structures, where $C_A$ is smaller than in the\nsurrounding plasma, the flow, which is confined to the structure and going in\nthe same direction as the AW, reduces the effect of phase-mixing, because on\nthe edges of the structure $C_A^\\prime$ and $V_0^\\prime$ have opposite signs.\nThus, the wave damps by means of slower phase-mixing compared to the case\nwithout the flow. This is the result of the co-directional flow that reduces\nthe wave front stretching in the transverse direction. We apply our findings to\naddressing the question why over-dense solar coronal open magnetic field\nstructures (OMFS) are cooler than the background plasma. Observations show that\nthe over-dense OMFS (e.g. solar coronal polar plumes) are cooler than\nsurrounding plasma and that, in these structures, Doppler line-broadening is\nconsistent with bulk plasma motions, such as AW. If over-dense solar coronal\nOMFS are heated by AW damping via phase-mixing, we show that, co-directional\nwith AW, plasma flow in them reduces the phase-mixing induced-heating, thus\nproviding an explanation of why they appear cooler than the background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 14:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

They are often proposed as complementary tools to type-Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia) in tracing the Hubble diagram of the Universe. The distance\ncalibrations of GRBs usually make use one or some of the empirical luminosity\ncorrelations, such as $\\tau_{\\rm lag}-L$, $V-L$, $E_p-L$, $E_p-E_{\\gamma}$,\n$\\tau_{\\rm RT}-L$ and $E_p-E_{\\rm iso}$ relations. These calibrating methods\nare based on the underling assumption that the empirical luminosity\ncorrelations are universal over all redshift range. In this paper, we test the\npossible redshift dependence of six luminosity correlations by dividing GRBs\ninto low-$z$ and high-$z$ classes according to their redshift smaller or larger\nthan 1.4. It is shown that the $E_p-E_{\\gamma}$ relation for low-$z$ GRBs is\nconsistent with that for high-$z$ GRBs within $1\\sigma$ uncertainty. The\nintrinsic scatter of $V-L$ relation is too larger to make a convincing\nconclusion. For the rest four correlations, however, low-$z$ GRBs differ from\nhigh-$z$ GRBs at more than $3\\sigma$ confidence level. As such, we calibrate\nGRBs using the $E_p-E_{\\gamma}$ relation in a model-independent way. The\nconstraint of high-$z$ GRBs on the $\\Lambda$CDM model gives $\\Omega_M=0.302\\pm\n0.142(1\\sigma)$, well consistent with the Planck 2015 results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 14:39:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 09:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

Among multiple solvent\ncomponents, only one component is considered to be much more volatile than the\nrest such that other components are assumed to be nonvolatile remaining\nunchanged in the droplet during the process of (single-component) volatile\nsolvent evaporation or condensation. For evaporating droplet, the droplet size\noften initially decreases following the familiar \"d^2 law\" at an accelerated\nrate. But toward the end, the rate of droplet size change diminishes due to the\npresence of nonvolatile cosolvent. Such an acceleration-deceleration reversal\nbehavior is unique for evaporating multicomponent droplet, while the droplet of\npure solvent has an accelerated rate of size change all the way through the\nend. This reversal behavior is also reflected in the droplet surface\ntemperature evolution as \"S-shaped\" curves. However, a closer mathematical\nexamination of conditions for acceleration-deceleration reversal indicates that\nthe acceleration phase may disappear when the amount of nonvolatile cosolvent\nis relatively small and ambient vapor pressure is relatively high. Because the\nnet effect of adding nonvolatile cosolvent is to reduce the mole fraction of\nthe volatile solvent such that the saturation vapor pressure is lowered, vapor\ncondensation onto the multicomponent droplet is predicted to occur when the\nambient vapor pressure is subsaturated with respect to that for the pure\nvolatile solvent. In this case, the droplet will grow asymptotically toward a\nfinite size. But when the ambient vapor pressure becomes supersaturated with\nrespect to that for the pure volatile solvent, the condensation growth of\ndroplet can continue indefinitely without bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2015 15:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}
