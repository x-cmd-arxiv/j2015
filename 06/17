They originate\nfrom intestinal crypts, glands that descend from the intestinal lumen into the\nunderlying connective tissue. Normal crypts are thought to exist in a dynamic\nequilibrium where the rate of cell production at the base of a crypt is matched\nby that of loss at the top. Understanding how genetic alterations accumulate\nand proceed to disrupt this dynamic equilibrium is fundamental to understanding\nthe origins of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer emerges from the\ninteraction of biological processes that span several spatial scales, from\nmutations that cause inappropriate intracellular responses to changes at the\ncell/tissue level, such as uncontrolled proliferation and altered motility and\nadhesion. Multiscale mathematical modelling can provide insight into the\nspatiotemporal organisation of such a complex, highly regulated and dynamic\nsystem. Moreover, the aforementioned challenges are inherent to the multiscale\nmodelling of biological tissue more generally. In this review we describe the\nmathematical approaches that have been applied to investigate multiscale\naspects of crypt behaviour, highlighting a number of model predictions that\nhave since been validated experimentally. We also discuss some of the key\nmathematical and computational challenges associated with the multiscale\nmodelling approach. We conclude by discussing recent efforts to derive\ncoarse-grained descriptions of such models, which may offer one way of reducing\nthe computational cost of simulation by leveraging well-established tools of\nmathematical analysis to address key problems in multiscale modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 16:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

In this paper we\ndistinguish numerical random variables for which a probability distribution is\ndefined by the model from numerical input variables that are only used for\nconditioning the distribution of discrete response variables. We show how\nnumerical input relations can very easily be used in the Relational Bayesian\nNetwork framework, and that existing inference and learning methods need only\nminor adjustments to be applied in this generalized setting. The resulting\nframework provides natural relational extensions of classical probabilistic\nmodels for categorical data. We demonstrate the usefulness of RBN models with\nnumeric input relations by several examples.\n  In particular, we use the augmented RBN framework to define probabilistic\nmodels for multi-relational (social) networks in which the probability of a\nlink between two nodes depends on numeric latent feature vectors associated\nwith the nodes. A generic learning procedure can be used to obtain a\nmaximum-likelihood fit of model parameters and latent feature values for a\nvariety of models that can be expressed in the high-level RBN representation.\nSpecifically, we propose a model that allows us to interpret learned latent\nfeature values as community centrality degrees by which we can identify nodes\nthat are central for one community, that are hubs between communities, or that\nare isolated nodes. In a multi-relational setting, the model also provides a\ncharacterization of how different relations are associated with each community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 18:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

Using a statistically uniform, HI-selected\nsample of 565 galaxies from the ALFALFA H-alpha survey, we explore HI\nproperties as a function of star formation activity. ALFALFA H-alpha provides\nR-band and H-alpha imaging for a volume-limited subset of the 21-cm ALFALFA\nsurvey. We identify eight starbursts based on H-alpha equivalent width and six\nwith enhanced star formation relative to the main sequence. Both starbursts and\nnon-starbursts have similar HI to stellar mass ratios (MHI/M*), which suggests\nthat feedback is not depleting the starbursts' HI. Consequently, the starbursts\ndo have shorter HI depletion times (t_dep), implying more efficient HI-to-H2\nconversion. While major mergers likely drive this enhanced efficiency in some\nstarbursts, the lowest mass starbursts may experience periodic bursts,\nconsistent with enhanced scatter in t_dep at low M*. Two starbursts appear to\nbe pre-coalescence mergers; their elevated MHI/M* suggest that HI-to-H2\nconversion is still ongoing at this stage. By comparing with the GASS sample,\nwe find that t_dep anti-correlates with stellar surface density for disks,\nwhile spheroids show no such trend. Among early-type galaxies, t_dep does not\ncorrelate with bulge-to-disk ratio; instead, the gas distribution may determine\nthe star formation efficiency. Finally, the weak connection between galaxies'\nspecific star formation rates and MHI/M* contrasts with the well-known\ncorrelation between MHI/M* and color. We show that dust extinction can explain\nthe HI-color trend, which may arise from the relationship between M*, MHI, and\nmetallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 19:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

In contrast, our initial focus is on the\nlocal complexity, and our main contribution is to provide a very simple\nalgorithm guaranteeing that each particular node $v$ terminates after $O(\\log\n\\mathsf{deg}(v)+\\log 1/\\epsilon)$ rounds, with probability at least\n$1-\\epsilon$.

The\nprediction of the model for the $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak evolution matches well with\nthe observations. We observe the blast-wave transitioning into the deceleration\nphase.

However, energetic ions can\nexcite various instabilities which can lead to their enhanced radial transport.\nConsequently, these instabilities may degrade the heating efficiency and they\ncan also cause harmful power loads on the plasma-facing components of the\ndevice. Therefore, the understanding of these modes is a key issue regarding\nfuture burning plasma experiments.\n  One of the main open questions concerning energetic particle (EP) driven\ninstabilities is the non-linear evolution of the mode structure. In this\nthesis, I present my results on the investigation of $\\beta$-induced Alfv\\'{e}n\neigenmodes (BAEs) and EP-driven geodesic acoustic modes (EGAMs) observed in the\nramp-up phase of off-axis NBI heated plasmas in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak.\nThese modes were well visible on several line-of-sights (LOSs) of the soft\nX-ray cameras which made it possible to analyse the time evolution of their\nspatial structure.\n  In order to investigate the radial structure, the mode amplitude has to be\ndetermined on different LOSs. I developed an advanced amplitude reconstruction\nmethod which can handle the rapidly changing mode frequency and the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio. This method is based on short time Fourier transform\nwhich is widely applied in the thesis, because it is ideal to investigate the\ntime evolution of transient wave-like phenomena.\n  The radial structure analysis showed that in case of the observed downward\nchirping BAEs the changes in the radial eigenfunction were smaller than the\nuncertainty of the measurement, while in case of rapidly upward chirping EGAMs\nthe analysis shows shrinkage of the mode structure. These experimental results\nare shown to be consistent with the corresponding theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 20:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Methods and Materials: Treatment plans with static\nintensity-modulated radiotherapy beams and volumetric modulated arc therapy\nbeams were generated for 13 patients for both the flattened beam and the FFF\nbeam of the TrueBeam system. Beam energies of 6 MV and 10 MV were chosen for\nplanning. A total of 104 treatment plans were generated in 13 patients. In\norder to analyze the biological effectiveness of treatment plans, dose volume\nhistograms (DVH) were utilized. Flattened and FFF beam plans are quantitatively\ncompared. Results: In head and neck cases, for VMAT plans, dose reduction in\nthe FFF beam plans compared to the flattened beam in left cochlea, right\nsubmandibular gland and right parotid gland reached up to 2.36 Gy, 1.21 Gy and\n1.45 Gy, respectively. Similarly, for static IMRT plans, the dose reduction of\nthe FFF beam plans compared to the flattened beam plans for the same organs\nreached up to 0.34 Gy, 1.36 Gy and 1.46 Gy, respectively. Overall, for head and\nneck, the FFF beam plans achieved mean dose reduction of up to 5%, 7% and 9%,\nrespectively for above organs at risk. For lung and prostate cases, the FFF\nbeams provided lower or comparable NTCP values to organ-at-risk (OAR) compared\nto the flattened beam for all plans. Conclusions: In general, we observed\ntreatment plans utilizing FFF beams can improve dose sparing to OARs without\ncompromising the target coverage. Significant dose sparing effect is obtained\nfor head and neck cancer cases, especially for the cases with relatively large\nfield sizes (about 16x20 cm^2).

In this\npaper, we want to predict anchor links between partially aligned social\nnetworks, which is formally defined as the partial network alignment problem.\nThe partial network alignment problem is very difficult to solve because of the\nfollowing two challenges: (1) the lack of general features for anchor links,\nand (2) the \"one-to-one$_\\le$\" (one to at most one) constraint on anchor links.\nTo address these two challenges, a new method PNA (Partial Network Aligner) is\nproposed in this paper. PNA (1) extracts a set of explicit anchor adjacency\nfeatures and latent topological features for anchor links based on the anchor\nmeta path concept and tensor decomposition techniques, and (2) utilizes the\ngeneric stable matching to identify the non-anchor users to prune the redundant\nanchor links attached to them. Extensive experiments conducted on two\nreal-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that PNA can solve the\npartial network alignment problem very well and outperform all the other\ncomparison methods with significant advantages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 22:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Building upon our previous work, we study the\npossibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the\nevolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a\nlower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in\nwhich the mass loss occurs slowly (\"stable mass transfer\" in the language of\nbinary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary\nevolution code MESA. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation and\nphoto-evaporation of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic\nbraking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche\nlimit, in orbit around a sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of\nRLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system\ncan indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The\nRLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer\nand on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days\nfor several Gyr. The remnant planets have a rocky core and some amount of\nenvelope material, which is slowly removed via photo-evaporation at nearly\nconstant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed\nsuper-Earths and sub-Neptunes.

Substitution\nof all symmetrically non-equivalent hydrogen atoms was compared based of the\nthermodynamic favorability. Fluorination of all sites is much more favorable\nthan chlorination, whereas chlorination is somewhat more favorable than\nbromination.

However, its spin version is rarely addressed, mainly due to\nthe fact that a macroscopic boundary in quantum spin systems is hard to define.\nIn this article, we explore the spin Casimir effect induced by the zero-point\nfluctuation of spin waves in a general non-collinear ordered quantum\nantiferromagnet. This spin Casimir effect results in a spin torque between\nlocal spins and further causes various singular and divergent results in the\nframework of spin-wave theory, which invalidate the standard $1/S$ expansion\nprocedure. To avoid this dilemma, we develop a self-consistent spin-wave\nexpansion approach, which preserves the spin-wave expansion away from\nsingularities and divergence. A detailed spin-wave analysis of the\nantiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a spatially anisotropic\ntriangular lattice is undertaken within our approach. Our results indicate that\nthe spiral order is only stable in the region $0.5<\\alpha<1.2$, where $\\alpha$\nis the ratio of the coupling constants. In addition, the instability in the\nregion $1.2<\\alpha<2$ is owing to the spin Casimir effect instead of the\nvanishing sublattice magnetization. And this extended spiral instable region\nmay host some quantum disordered phases besides the quantum order by disorder\ninduced Neel phase. Furthermore, our method provides an efficient and\nconvenient tool that can estimate the correct exchange parameters and outline\nthe quantum phase diagrams, which can be useful for experimental fitting\nprocesses in frustrated quantum magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 05:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 06:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-11"}

A prototype implementation of Dexteroid detects two types of attacks:\n(1) leakage of private information, and (2) sending SMS to premium-rate\nnumbers. A series of experiments are conducted on 1526 Google Play apps, 1259\nGenome Malware apps, and a suite of benchmark apps called DroidBench and the\nresults are compared with a state-of-the-art static analysis tool called\nFlowDroid. The evaluation results show that the proposed framework is effective\nand efficient in terms of precision, recall, and execution time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 06:38:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 19:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

In this scenario, intermediate mass black holes are\nformed as a result of dynamical interactions of hard binaries containing a\nstellar mass black hole, with other stars and binaries. We discuss the\nnecessary conditions to initiate the process of intermediate mass black hole\nformation and the influence of an intermediate mass black hole on the host\nglobal globular cluster properties. We discuss two scenarios for intermediate\nmass black hole formation. The SLOW and FAST scenarios. They occur later or\nearlier in the cluster evolution and require smaller or extremely large central\ndensities, respectively. In our simulations, the formation of intermediate mass\nblack holes is highly stochastic. In general, higher formation probabilities\nfollow from larger cluster concentrations (i.e. central densities). We further\ndiscuss possible observational signatures of the presence of intermediate mass\nblack holes in globular clusters that follow from our simulations. These\ninclude the spatial and kinematic structure of the host cluster, possible\nradio, X-ray and gravitational wave emissions due to dynamical collisions or\nmass-transfer and the creation of hypervelocity main sequence escapers during\nstrong dynamical interactions between binaries and an intermediate mass black\nhole.

We present a uniform, large-scale survey of\nX-ray flare emission.

The 2XMM Catalogue and the associated time-series\n(`light-curve') data products have been used as the basis for a survey of X-ray\nflares from cool stars in the Hipparcos Tycho-2 catalogue. In addition, we have\ngenerated and analysed spectrally-resolved (i.e. hardness-ratio), X-ray\nlight-curves. Where available, we have compared XMM OM UV/optical data with the\nX-ray light-curves. Our sample contains ~130 flares with well-observed\nprofiles; they originate from ~70 stars. The flares range in duration from ~1e3\nto ~1e4 s, have peak X-ray fluxes from ~1e-13 to ~1e-11 erg/cm2/s, peak X-ray\nluminosities from ~1e29 to ~1e32 erg/s, and X-ray energy output from ~1e32 to\n~1e35 erg. Most of the ~30 serendipitously-observed stars have little\npreviously reported information. The hardness-ratio plots clearly illustrate\nthe spectral (and hence inferred temperature) variations characteristic of many\nflares, and provide an easily accessible overview of the data. We present flare\nfrequency distributions from both target and serendipitous observations. The\nlatter provide an unbiased (with respect to stellar activity) study of flare\nenergetics; in addition, they allow us to predict numbers of stellar flares\nthat may be detected in future X-ray wide-field surveys. The serendipitous\nsample demonstrates the need for care when calculating flaring rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 11:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

The observed clustering on\nthis sequence suggests that it corresponds to some equilibrium or asymptotic\ncondition that still lacks a complete theoretical interpretation, crucial to\nour understanding of the stellar angular momentum evolution. We couple a\nrotational evolution model, which takes into account internal differential\nrotation, with classical and new proposals for the wind braking law, and fit\nmodels to the data using a MCMC method. The description of the evolution of the\nslow-rotators sequence requires taking into account the transfer of angular\nmomentum from the radiative core to the convective envelope; we find that, in\nthe mass range 0.85-1.10 $M_{\\odot}$, the core-envelope coupling time-scale for\nstars in the slow-rotators sequence scales as $M^{-7.28}$. Quasi-solid body\nrotation is achieved only after 1-2 Gyr, depending on stellar mass, which\nimplies that observing small deviations from the Skumanich law ($P \\propto\n\\sqrt{t}$) would require period data of older open clusters than available to\ndate. The observed evolution in the 0.1-2.5 Gyr age range and in the 0.85-1.10\n$M_{\\odot}$ mass range is best reproduced by assuming an empirical mass\ndependence of the wind angular momentum loss proportional to the convective\nturnover time-scale and to the stellar moment of inertia.

We\nprocess this problem using six RT codes participating in this benchmark effort,\nand compare the results to a reference solution computed with the publicly\navailable dust emission code DustEM. The participating codes implement\ndifferent heuristics to keep the calculation time at an acceptable level.

Our analysis focused on the galaxy region where\nthe disc contributes more than 95 per cent of total surface brightness in order\nto minimise the contamination of the bulge and bar. The luminosity-weighted age\nand metallicity were obtained by fitting the galaxy spectra with a linear\ncombination of stellar population synthesis models, while the total\noverabundance of {\\alpha}-elements over iron was derived by measuring the\nline-strength indices. Most of the sample discs display a bimodal age\ndistribution and they are characterised by a total [{\\alpha}/Fe] enhancement\nranging from solar and supersolar. We interpreted the age bimodality as due to\nthe simultaneous presence of both a young (Age$\\,\\leq\\,4$ Gyr) and an old\n(Age$\\,>\\,$4 Gyr) stellar population. The old stellar component usually\ndominates the disc surface brightness and its light contribution is almost\nconstant within the observed radial range. For this reason, no age gradient is\nobserved in half of the sample galaxies. The old component is slightly more\nmetal poor than the young one. The metallicity gradient is negative and\nslightly positive in the old and young components, respectively. These results\nare in agreement with an inside-out scenario of disc formation and suggest a\nreduced impact of the radial migration on the stellar populations of the disc.\nThe young component could be the result of a second burst of star formation in\ngas captured from the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 13:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

These models belong to the class of the\nspherical mean-field approximation of a spin-$1$ model with $p$-body quenched\ndisordered interaction, with $p>2$, termed spherical Blume-Emery-Griffiths\nmodels. Depending on temperature and chemical potential the system is found in\na paramagnetic or in a glassy phase and the transition between these phases can\nbe of a different nature. In specific regions of the phase diagram coexistence\nof low density and high density paramagnets can occur, as well as the\ncoexistence of spin-glass and paramagnetic phases. The exact static solution\nfor the glassy phase is known to be obtained by the one-step replica symmetry\nbreaking ansatz. Different scenarios arise for both the dynamic and the\nthermodynamic transitions. These include: (i) the usual random first- order\ntransition (Kauzmann-like) for mean-field glasses preceded by a dynamic\ntransition, (ii) a thermodynamic first-order transition with phase coexistence\nand latent heat and (iii) a regime of apparent inversion of static transition\nline and dynamic transition lines, the latter defined as a non-zero complexity\nline. The latter inversion, though, turns out to be preceded by a novel\ndynamical arrest line at higher temperature. Crossover between different\nregimes is analyzed by solving mode coupling theory equations throughout the\nspace of external thermodynamic parameters and the relationship with the\nunderlying statics is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 14:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

But can the way that genotypes are\ndistributed over phenotypes determine evolutionary outcomes? Answering such\nquestions is difficult because the number of genotypes can be\nhyper-astronomically large. By solving the genotype-phenotype (GP) map for RNA\nsecondary structure for systems up to length $L=126$ nucleotides (where the set\nof all possible RNA strands would weigh more than the mass of the visible\nuniverse) we show that the GP map strongly constrains the evolution of\nnon-coding RNA (ncRNA). Simple random sampling over genotypes predicts the\ndistribution of properties such as the mutational robustness or the number of\nstems per secondary structure found in naturally occurring ncRNA with\nsurprising accuracy. Since we ignore natural selection, this strikingly close\ncorrespondence with the mapping suggests that structures allowing for\nfunctionality are easily discovered, despite the enormous size of the genetic\nspaces. The mapping is extremely biased: the majority of genotypes map to an\nexponentially small portion of the morphospace of all biophysically possible\nstructures. Such strong constraints provide a non-adaptive explanation for the\nconvergent evolution of structures such as the hammerhead ribozyme. These\nresults presents a particularly clear example of bias in the arrival of\nvariation strongly shaping evolutionary outcomes and may be relevant to Mayr's\ndistinction between proximate and ultimate causes in evolutionary biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 14:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 04:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

Including priors into a data\nanalysis can mask the information content of a given data set alone. However,\nsince the information content of a data set is usually estimated with the\nFisher matrix, priors are added in order to enforce an approximately Gaussian\nlikelihood. Here, we compare priorless forecasts to more conventional forecasts\nthat use priors. We find strongly non-Gaussian likelihoods for 2d-weak lensing\nif no priors are used, which we approximate with the DALI-expansion. Without\npriors, the Fisher matrix of the 2d-weak lensing likelihood includes unphysical\nvalues of $\\Omega_m$ and $h$, since it does not capture the shape of the\nlikelihood well. The Cramer-Rao inequality then does not need to apply. We find\nthat DALI and Monte Carlo Markov Chains predict the presence of a dark energy\nwith high significance, whereas a Fisher forecast of the same data set also\nallows decelerated expansion. We also find that a 2d-weak lensing analysis\nprovides a sharp lower limit on the Hubble constant of $h > 0.4$, even if the\nequation of state of dark energy is jointly constrained by the data. This is\nnot predicted by the Fisher matrix and usually masked in other works by a sharp\nprior on $h$. Additionally, we find that DALI estimates Figures of Merit in the\npresence of non-Gaussianities better than the Fisher matrix. We additionally\ndemonstrate how DALI allows switching to a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling of\na highly curved likelihood with acceptance rates of $\\approx 0.5$, an effective\ncovering of the parameter space, and numerically effectively costless leapfrog\nsteps.

Here\nI explore the analogy between the Multiverse proposal and the proposal that\nthere exist an infinite number of stellar systems with planets in a flat\nUniverse, the Multiplanetverse. Although the measure problem is present in this\nscenario, the idea of a Multiplanetverse has predictive power, even in the\nabsence of direct evidence for exoplanets that appeared since the 90s. We argue\nthat the fine-tuning of Earth to life (and not only the fine-tuning of life to\nEarth) could predict with certainty the existence of exoplanets decades or even\ncenturies before that direct evidence. Several other predictions can be made by\nstudying only the Earth and the Sun, without any information about stars. The\nanalogy also shows that theories that defend that the Earth is the unique\nexisting planet and that, at the same time, is fine-tuned to life by pure\nchance (or pure physical necessity from a parameter free Theory of Everything)\nare misguided, and alike opinions about our Universe are similarly delusional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 22:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

Many observed real-world networks of diverse\nnature have a power-law degree distribution. Moreover, the observed degree\ndistribution usually has an infinite variance. Therefore, we are especially\ninterested in such degree distributions. In addition, we analyze the clustering\ncoefficient for both weighted and unweighted graphs.\n  There are two well-known definitions of the clustering coefficient of a\ngraph: the global and the average local clustering coefficients. There are\nseveral models proposed in the literature for which the average local\nclustering coefficient tends to a positive constant as a graph grows. On the\nother hand, there are no models of scale-free networks with an infinite\nvariance of the degree distribution and with an asymptotically constant global\nclustering coefficient. Models with constant global clustering and finite\nvariance were also proposed. Therefore, in this paper we focus only on the most\ninteresting case: we analyze the global clustering coefficient for graphs with\nan infinite variance of the degree distribution.\n  For unweighted graphs, we prove that the global clustering coefficient tends\nto zero with high probability and we also estimate the largest possible\nclustering coefficient for such graphs. On the contrary, for weighted graphs,\nthe constant global clustering coefficient can be obtained even for the case of\nan infinite variance of the degree distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 12:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-06"}
