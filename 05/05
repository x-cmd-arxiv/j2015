Both\ngalaxies are detected by both Chandra and NuSTAR, which together provide the\nfirst-ever spectra of these two galaxies spanning 0.3-30 keV. The X-ray\nemission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by Chandra; we find that hot\ngas dominates the E < 1-3 keV emission while ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)\ndominate at E > 1-3 keV. The NuSTAR galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies follow\nsteep power-law distributions with Gamma ~ 2.6 at E > 5-7 keV, similar to the\nspectra of bright individual ULXs and other galaxies that have been studied by\nNuSTAR. We find that both NGC 3256 and NGC 3310 have X-ray detected sources\ncoincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep NuSTAR spectra of both\ngalaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity AGN or non-AGN in\nnature (e.g., ULXs or crowded X-ray sources that reach L2-10 keV ~ 10^40 erg/s\ncannot be ruled out). Combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 keV spectra of\nNGC 3256 and NGC 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forming\ngalaxies M83 and NGC 253, we analyze the SFR-normalized spectra of these\nstarburst galaxies. The spectra of all four galaxies show sharply declining\npower-law slopes above 3-6 keV due to ULX populations. Our observations\ntherefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,\nULXs). This result is similar to the super-Eddington accreting ULXs that have\nbeen studied individually in a targeted NuSTAR ULX program. We also find that\nNGC 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of X-ray emission over the other\nstar-forming galaxies. We argue that the excess is most likely explained by the\nrelatively low metallicity of the young stellar population in NGC 3310.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 20:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

The datasets are from\nthe panchromatic STARBurst IRregular Dwarf Survey (STARBIRDS) and include deep\nlegacy GALEX UV imaging, HST optical imaging, and Spitzer MIPS imaging. For the\nmajority of the sample, the integrated near UV fluxes predicted from the\nCMD-based SFRs - using four different models - agree with the measured,\nextinction corrected, integrated near UV fluxes from GALEX images, but the far\nUV predicted fluxes do not. Further, we find a systematic deviation between the\nSFRs based on integrated far UV luminosities and existing scaling relations,\nand the SFRs based on the resolved stellar populations. This offset is not\ndriven by different star formation timescales, variations in SFRs, UV\nattenuation, nor stochastic effects. This first comparison between CMD-based\nSFRs and an integrated FUV emission SFR indicator suggests that the most likely\ncause of the discrepancy is the theoretical FUV-SFR calibration from stellar\nevolutionary libraries and/or stellar atmospheric models.

The\narriving customer then chooses whether to take the slip or balk, a decision\nbased on the perceived queue length and associated waiting time. Even after\ntaking a ticket, a customer may abandon the queue, an event that will be\nunobservable until the abandoning customer would have begun service. In\ncontrast, a standard queue has a physical waiting area so that abandonment is\napparent immediately when it takes place and balking is based on the actual\nqueue length at the time of arrival. We prove heavy tra?c limit theorems for\nthe generalized ticket and standard queueing processes, discovering that the\nprocesses converge together to the same limit, a regulated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\n(ROU) process.

We define a core size based on\nthe logarithmic slope of the dark matter density profile so that it is\ninsensitive to the functional form used to fit observed data. The energy\nrequired to form a core depends sensitively on the radial scale over which dark\nmatter within the cusp is redistributed within the halo. Simulations indicate\nthat within a region of comparable size to the active star forming regions of\nthe central galaxy that inhabits the halo, dark matter particles have their\norbits radially increased by a factor of 2--3 during core formation. Thus the\ninner properties of the dark matter halo, such as halo concentration, and final\ncore size, set the energy requirements. As a result, the energy cost increases\nslowly with halo mass as M$_{\\rm{h}}^{0.3-0.7}$ for core sizes $\\lesssim1$ kpc.\nWe use the expected star formation history for a given dark matter halo mass to\npredict dwarf galaxy core sizes.

To date, most of the previous research only consider a partial\naspect of the cost optimization problem.

The proposed model combines these partial\nmodels into a single unified cost optimization model. Therefore, it is able to\nanalyze scenarios which are closer to practical implementation. Furthermore, it\nis useful to analyze the behavior of a population (e.g., smart buildings, smart\ncities, etc.) and properties of the components for specific scenarios (e.g.,\nthe impact of aggregate storage capacity, etc.). It allows energy trading in\nmicrogrid which introduces a cost fairness problem. It ensures Pareto\noptimality among the households which guarantees that no household will be\nworse off to improve the cost of others.

We develop a machine that is able to make\naesthetic-related semantic-level judgments, such as predicting a painting's\nstyle, genre, and artist, as well as providing similarity measures optimized\nbased on the knowledge available in the domain of art historical\ninterpretation. Our experiments show the value of using this similarity measure\nfor the aforementioned prediction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 01:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

Evolution equation\nfor a particle from population $k$ depends on the $K$ empirical measures of\nparticle states corresponding to the various populations and the form of this\ndependence may change from one population to another. In addition, the drift\ncoefficients in the particle evolution equations may depend on a factor that is\ncommon to all particles and which is described through the solution of a\nstochastic differential equation coupled, through the empirical measures, with\nthe $N$-particle dynamics. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior as\n$N\\to \\infty$. Although the full system is not exchangeable, particles in the\nsame population have an exchangeable distribution. Using this structure, one\ncan prove using standard techniques a law of large numbers result and a\npropagation of chaos property. In the current work we study fluctuations about\nthe law of large number limit. For the case where the common factor is absent\nthe limit is given in terms of a Gaussian field whereas in the presence of a\ncommon factor it is characterized through a mixture of Gaussian distributions.\nWe also obtain, as a corollary, new fluctuation results for disjoint\nsub-families of single type particle systems, i.e. when $K=1$. Finally, we\nestablish limit theorems for multi-type statistics of such weakly interacting\nparticles, given in terms of multiple Wiener integrals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 01:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

To facilitate the computational\nprocess, a divide-and-conquer scheme is often used for the analysis of big\ndata. In such a strategy, a full dataset is first split into several manageable\nsegments; the final output is then averaged from the individual outputs of the\nsegments. Despite its popularity in practice, it remains largely unknown that\nwhether such a distributive strategy provides valid theoretical inferences to\nthe original data. In this paper, we address this fundamental issue for the\ndistributed kernel regression (DKR), where the algorithmic feasibility is\nmeasured by the generalization performance of the resulting estimator. To\njustify DKR, a uniform convergence rate is needed for bounding the\ngeneralization error over the individual outputs, which brings new and\nchallenging issues in the big data setup. Under mild conditions, we show that,\nwith a proper number of segments, DKR leads to an estimator that is\ngeneralization consistent to the unknown regression function.

In the foreseeable future, cars will have the\nability to communicate with one another in order to better coordinate their\nmotion. This motivates a number of interesting algorithmic problems. One of the\nmost challenging aspects of traffic coordination involves traffic\nintersections. In this paper we consider two formulations of a simple and\nfundamental geometric optimization problem involving coordinating the motion of\nvehicles through an intersection.\n  We are given a set of $n$ vehicles in the plane, each modeled as a unit\nlength line segment that moves monotonically, either horizontally or\nvertically, subject to a maximum speed limit. Each vehicle is described by a\nstart and goal position and a start time and deadline. The question is whether,\nsubject to the speed limit, there exists a collision-free motion plan so that\neach vehicle travels from its start position to its goal position prior to its\ndeadline.\n  We present three results. We begin by showing that this problem is\nNP-complete with a reduction from 3-SAT. Second, we consider a constrained\nversion in which cars traveling horizontally can alter their speeds while cars\ntraveling vertically cannot. We present a simple algorithm that solves this\nproblem in $O(n \\log n)$ time.

In this paper, we make a statistical study of 21 Earth directed CMEs,\nexploring in particular the relationship between CME initial speeds and transit\ntimes. The initial speed of a CME is obtained by fitting the CME with the\nGraduated Cylindrical Shell model and is thus free of projection effects. We\nthen use the drag force model to fit results of the transit time versus the\ninitial speed. By adopting different drag regimes, i.e., the viscous,\naerodynamics, and hybrid regimes, we get similar results, with the least mean\nestimation error of the hybrid model of 12.9 hours. CMEs with a propagation\nangle (the angle between the propagation direction and the Sun-Earth line)\nlarger than its half angular width arrive at the Earth with an angular\ndeviation caused by factors other than the radial solar wind drag. The drag\nforce model cannot be well applied to such events. If we exclude these events\nin the sample, the prediction accuracy can be improved, i.e., the estimation\nerror reduces to 6.8 hours.

Some cosmic ray protons (CRp) and electrons must be contained in the\nwinds, which are likely formed by physical processes such as magnetic\nreconnection. We have performed MHD simulations to study the spatial\ndistribution of CRp, considering the advection and diffusion of CRp in the\npresence of magnetic field. We find that a permeated zone is formed just\noutside of the contact discontinuity between winds and ISM, where the\ncollisions between CRp and thermal nuclei mainly occur. The decay of neutral\npions generated in the collisions, combined with the inverse Compton scattering\nof background soft photons by the secondary leptons generated in the collisions\nand primary CR electrons can well explain the observed gamma-ray spectral\nenergy distribution. Other features such as the uniform surface brightness\nalong the latitude and the boundary width of the bubbles are also explained.\nThe advantage of this accretion wind model is that the adopted wind properties\ncome from the detailed small scale MHD numerical simulation of accretion flows\nand the value of mass accretion rate has independent observational evidences.\nThe success of the model suggests that we may seriously consider the\npossibility that cavities and bubbles observed in other contexts such as galaxy\nclusters may be formed by winds rather than jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 06:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 09:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

In particular,\nthere is an inadequate understanding of author-based self-archiving awareness,\npractice, and inhibitors. This article reports an exploratory study of the\nawareness of self-archiving, the practice of self-archiving, and the inhibitors\nof self-archiving among authors in an Italian computer science faculty.\nForty-nine individuals among interns, PhD students, researchers, and professors\nwere recruited in a questionnaire (response rate of 72.8%). The quantitative\nand qualitative responses suggested that there is still work needed in terms of\nadvocating green open access to computer science authors who seldom\nself-archive and when they do, they often infringe the copyright transfer\nagreements (CTAs) of the publishers. In addition, tools from the open-source\ncommunity are needed to facilitate author-based self-archiving, which should\ncomprise of an automatic check of the CTAs. The study identified nine factors\ninhibiting the act of self-archiving among computer scientists. As a first\nstep, this study proposes several propositions regarding author-based\nself-archiving in computer science that can be further investigated.\nRecommendations to foster self-archiving in computer science, based on the\nresults, are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 08:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

Common algorithms to construct the\nconvex hull on a finite set of n points (x,y) range from O(nlogn) time to O(n)\ntime. However, it is often the case that a heuristic procedure is applied to\nreduce the original set of n points to a set of s < n points which contains the\nhull and so accelerates the final hull finding procedure. We present an\nalgorithm to precondition data before building a 2D convex hull with integer\ncoordinates, with three distinct advantages. First, for all practical purposes,\nit is linear; second, no explicit sorting of data is required and third, the\nreduced set of s points is constructed such that it forms an ordered set that\ncan be directly pipelined into an O(n) time convex hull algorithm. Under these\ncriteria a fast (or O(n)) pre-conditioner in principle creates a fast convex\nhull (approximately O(n)) for an arbitrary set of points. The paper empirically\nevaluates and quantifies the acceleration generated by the method against the\nmost common convex hull algorithms. An extra acceleration of at least four\ntimes when compared to previous existing preconditioning methods is found from\nexperiments on a dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 08:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

The third construction\nprovides longer MSR codes with three parities, which are not access-optimal,\nand do not necessarily attain the sub-packetization bound.\n  In addition to a minimum storage in a node, all three constructions allow the\nentire data to be recovered from a minimal number of storage nodes.

Over the last years it has been commonly adopted\nto manage some services running on top of UDP, e.g., public DNS resolvers,\nmulticast rendez-vous points, etc. However, recently the Internet have\nwitnessed the growth of new Anycast-enabled Content Delivery Networks (A-CDNs)\nsuch as CloudFlare and EdgeCast, which provide their web services (i.e., TCP\ntraffic) entirely through anycast.\n  To the best of our knowledge, little is known in the literature about the\nnature and the dynamic of such traffic. For instance, since anycast depends on\nthe routing, the question is how stable are the paths toward the nearest\nserver. To bring some light on this question, in this work we provide a first\nlook at A-CDNs traffic by combining active and passive measurements. In\nparticular, building upon our previous work, we use active measurements to\nidentify and geolocate A-CDNs caches starting from a large set of IP addresses\nrelated to the top-100k Alexa websites. We then look at the traffic of those\ncaches in the wild using a large passive dataset collected from a European ISP.\n  We find that several A-CDN servers are encountered on a daily basis when\nbrowsing the Internet. Routes to A-CDN servers are very stable, with few\nchanges that are observed on a monthly-basis (in contrast to more the dynamic\ntraffic policies of traditional CDNs). Overall, A-CDNs are a reality worth\nfurther investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 10:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 16:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 09:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Tidal evolution is strongest for the\nexactly prograde and weakest for the exactly retrograde orbit. In the prograde\ncase the stellar component forms a strong bar and remains prolate until the end\nof the simulation, while its rotation is very quickly replaced by random\nmotions of the stars. In the retrograde case the dwarf remains oblate, does not\nform a bar and loses rotation very slowly. In the two cases of intermediate\norientation of the disk, the evolution is between the two extremes, suggesting\na monotonic dependence on the inclination. We interpret the results in terms of\nthe resonance between the angular velocity of the stars in the dwarf and its\norbital motion by comparing the measurements from simulations to semi-analytic\npredictions.

This paper aim to provide the ergodic capacity characterization of\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) FSO systems over atmospheric\nturbulence-induced fading channels. The fluctuations of the irradiance of\noptical channels distorted by atmospheric conditions is usually described by a\ngamma-gamma ($\\Gamma \\Gamma$) distribution, and the distribution of the sum of\n$\\Gamma \\Gamma$ random variables (RVs) is required to model the MIMO optical\nlinks.

In it, agents obtain information about their (common) environment by\nthe perception of messages of other agents, which is determined by an\ninteraction probability (the structure of the population). For an agent to\nunderstand another agent's messages, the former must either know the identity\nof the latter, or the code producing the messages must be universally\ninterpretable. A universal code, however, introduces a vulnerability: a\nparasitic entity can take advantage of it. Here, we investigate this problem.\nIn our specific setting, we consider a parasite to be an agent that tries to\ninflict as much damage as possible in the mutual understanding of the\npopulation (i.e. the parasite acts as a disinformation agent). We show that,\nafter introducing a parasite in the population, the former adopts a code such\nthat it captures the information about the environment that is missing in the\npopulation. Such agent would be of great value, but only if the rest of the\npopulation could understand its messages. However, it is of little use here,\nsince the parasite utilises the most common messages in the population to\nexpress different concepts. Now we let the population respond by updating their\ncodes such that, in this arms race, they again maximise their mutual\nunderstanding. As a result, there is a code drift in the population where the\nutilisation of the messages of the parasite is avoided. A consequence of this\nis that the information that the parasite possesses but the agents lack becomes\nunderstandable and readily available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 11:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 17:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Continuing the approach taken in the paper [A. Connes\nand H. Moscovici, http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3500] we extend the study of the\ncurvature to twisted Dirac spectral triples constructed out of Heisenberg\nbimodules that implement the Morita equivalence of the $C^*$-algebra $A_\\theta\n= C(T^2_\\theta)$ with other toric algebras $A_{\\theta'}$. In the enlarged\ncontext the conformal metric on $T^2_\\theta$ is exchanged with an arbitrary\nHermitian metric on the Heisenberg $(A_\\theta, A_{\\theta'})$-bimodule $E'$ for\nwhich ${\\rm End}_{A_{\\theta'}}(E') = A_\\theta $. We prove that the Ray-Singer\nlog-determinant of the corresponding Laplacian, viewed as a functional on the\nspace of all Hermitian metrics on $E'$, attains its extremum at the unique\nHermitian metric whose corresponding connection has constant curvature. The\ngradient of the log-determinant functional gives rise to a noncommutative\nanalogue of the Gaussian curvature. The genuinely new outcome of this paper is\nthat the latter is shown to be independent of any Heisenberg bimodule $E'$ such\nthat $A_\\theta = {\\rm End}_{A_{\\theta'}}(E')$, and in this sense it is Morita\ninvariant. To prove the above results we extend Connes' pseudodifferential\ncalculus to Heisenberg modules.

However, the above-mentioned requests are almost contradictory\nusing the traditional techniques. To overcome this challenge, here we propose\ntime-domain spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) as the carrier of signals.\nBy designing a special plasmonic waveguide constructed by printing two narrow\ncorrugated metallic strips on the top and bottom surfaces of a dielectric\nsubstrate with mirror symmetry, we show that spoof SPPs are supported from very\nlow frequency to the cutoff frequency with strong subwavelength effects, which\ncan be converted to the time-domain SPPs. When two such plasmonic waveguides\nare tightly packed with deep-subwavelength separation, which commonly happens\nin the integrated circuits and wireless communications due to limited space, we\ndemonstrate theoretically and experimentally that SPP signals on such two\nplasmonic waveguides have better propagation performance and much less mutual\ncoupling than the conventional signals on two traditional microstrip lines with\nthe same size and separation. Hence the proposed method can achieve significant\ninterference suppression in very compact space, providing a potential solution\nto break the challenge of signal integrity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 12:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

Nevertheless, more\nobservational parameters are needed because some radiation mechanisms present\nin neutrons stars or black holes are still unclear. Polarization measurements\nwill play a key role in discrimination between different X-ray emission models.\nSuch a capability becomes a mandatory requirement for the next generation of\nhigh-energy space proposals. We have developed a CdTe-based fine-pitch imaging\nspectrometer, Caliste, able to respond to these new requirements. With a\n580-micron pitch and 1 keV energy resolution at 60 keV, we are able to\naccurately reconstruct the polarization angle and polarization fraction of an\nimpinging flux of photons which are scattered by 90{\\deg} after Compton\ndiffusion within the crystal. Thanks to its high performance in both imaging\nand spectrometry, Caliste turns out to be a powerful device for high-energy\npolarimetry. In this paper, we present the principles and the results obtained\nfor this kind of measurements: on one hand, we describe the simulation tool we\nhave developed to predict the polarization performances in the 50-300 keV\nenergy range. On the other hand, we compare simulation results with\nexperimental data taken at ESRF ID15A (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility)\nusing a mono-energetic polarized beam tuned between 35 and 300 keV. We show\nthat it is possible with this detector to determine with high precision the\npolarization parameters (direction and fraction) for different irradiation\nconditions. Applying a judicious energy selection to our data set, we reach a\nremarkable sensitivity level characterized by an optimum Quality Factor of 0.78\nin the 200-300 keV range. We also evaluate the sensitivity of our device at 70\nkeV, where hard X-ray mirrors are already available; the measured Q factor is\n0.64 at 70 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 13:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

An exact expression for the form of the IGW is derived here in\nthe case of a linear shear and used to examine this interaction in detail. This\nexpression recovers the classical values of the transmission and reflection\ncoefficients $|T|=\\exp(-\\pi \\mu )$ and $|R|=0$, where $\\mu^2=J(1+\\nu^2)-1/4$,\n$J$ is the Richardson number and $\\nu$ the ratio between the horizontal\ntransverse and along-shear wavenumbers.\n  For large $J$, a WKB analysis provides an interpretation of this result in\nterm of tunnelling: an IGW incident to the lower inertial level becomes\nevanescent between the inertial levels, returning to an oscillatory behaviour\nabove the upper inertial level. The amplitude of the transmitted wave is\ndirectly related to the decay of the evanescent solution between the inertial\nlevels. In the immediate vicinity of the critical level, the evanescent IGW is\nwell represented by the quasi-geostrophic approximation, so that the process\ncan be interpreted as resulting from the coupling between balanced and\nunbalanced motion.\n  The exact and WKB solutions describe the so-called valve effect, a dependence\nof the behaviour in the region between the inertial levels on the direction of\nwave propagation. For $J < 1$ this is shown to lead to an amplification of the\nwave between the inertial levels. Since the flow is inertially unstable for\n$J<1$, this establishes a correspondence between the inertial-level interaction\nand the condition for inertial instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 14:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

We developed a\ncode that follows the evolution and emission of electrons in the shocked pulsar\nwind based on inputs from a relativistic hydrodynamical simulation.

In this simulation, we have shown how, in the\npresence of MHD turbulence, a time-steady transition can be achieved between an\ninner disk region aligned with the equatorial plane of the central mass's spin\nand an outer region orbiting in a different plane. The position of the\nequilibrium orientation transition is determined by a balance between\ngravitomagnetic torque and warp-induced inward mixing of misaligned angular\nmomentum from the outer disk. If the mixing is interpreted in terms of\ndiffusive transport, the implied diffusion coefficient is\n~(0.6--0.8)c_s^2/Omega for sound speed c_s and orbital frequency Omega. This\ncalibration permits estimation of the orientation transition's equilibrium\nlocation given the central mass, its spin parameter, and the disk's surface\ndensity and scaleheight profiles. However, the alignment front overshoots\nbefore settling into an equilibrium, signaling that a diffusive model does not\nfully represent the time-dependent properties of alignment fronts under these\nconditions. Because the precessional torque on the disk at the alignment front\nis always comparable to the rate at which misaligned angular momentum is\nbrought inward to the front by warp-driven radial motions, no break forms\nbetween the inner and outer portions of the disk in our simulation. Our results\nalso raise questions about the applicability to MHD warped disks of the\ntraditional distinction between \"bending wave\" and \"diffusive\" regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 15:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

We will begin with a brief\nintroduction to the criticality and phase transitions phenomena e then we will\ndescribe the Landau theory for second order phase transitions. After that, we\nwill introduce the Ginzburg-Landau theory and the time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau theory. As an application of this last one, we will study two\nmesoscopic systems. One of them a homogeneous sample and the other one a sample\nwith surface defects. We show that the defects strongly influences the vortex\ndynamics of the system.

The reason is that the non-polarizable force fields that\nare mostly used to describe proteins and other biological molecules are\nincompatible with more sophisticated modern polarizable models of water. The\nissue is electronic polarizability: in liquid state, in protein, and in vacuum\nthe water molecule is polarized differently, and therefore has different\nproperties; thus the only way to describe all these different media with the\nsame model is to use a polarizable water model. However, to be compatible with\nthe force field of the rest of the system, e.g. a protein, the latter should be\npolarizable as well. Here we describe a novel model of water that is in effect\npolarizable, and yet compatible with the standard non-polarizable force fields\nsuch as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, OPLS, etc. Thus the model resolves the\noutstanding problem of incompatibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 08:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-07"}
