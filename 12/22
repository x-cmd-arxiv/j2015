With the near-future implementation of (interplanetary) transponder\nlaser ranging, these effects will become increasingly important, requiring a\nre-evaluation of the common data analysis practice of using a priori time\nephemerides, which is the goal of this paper.\n  We develop a framework for the simultaneous estimation of the initial\ntranslational state and the initial proper time of an observer, with the goal\nof facilitating robust tracking data analysis from next-generation space\nmissions carrying highly accurate clocks and tracking equipment. Using our\napproach, the influence of physical parameters on both translational and time\ndynamics are considered at the same level in the analysis, and mutual\ncorrelations between the signatures of the two are automatically identified.

We find that i) a\nsingle source model is not enough to explain the radial evolution of the night\nsky brightness, despite the predominance of Madrid in size and population, and\nii) that the orography of the region should be taken into account when deriving\ngeo-specific models from general first-principles models. We show the tight\nrelationship between these two luminance measures.

We include an\nexplicit treatment of the grain temperatures, governed both by the visual\nextinction of the cloud and the size of each individual grain-size population.\nWe find that the temperature difference plays a significant role in determining\nthe total bulk ice composition across the grain-size distribution, while the\neffects of geometrical differences between size populations appear marginal. We\nalso consider collapse from a diffuse to a dark cloud, allowing dust\ntemperatures to fall. Under the initial diffuse conditions, small grains are\ntoo warm to promote grain-mantle build-up, with most ices forming on the\nmid-sized grains. As collapse proceeds, the more abundant, smallest grains cool\nand become the dominant ice carriers; the large population of small grains\nmeans that this ice is distributed across many grains, with perhaps no more\nthan 40 monolayers of ice each (versus several hundred assuming a single grain\nsize).

To\nperform such tests, the renormalization group (RG) running has to be performed\nwith sufficient accuracy. In supersymmetric (SUSY) theories, the one-loop\nthreshold corrections (TC) are of particular importance and, since they affect\nthe quark-lepton mass relations, link a given GUT flavour model to the\nsparticle spectrum. To accurately study such predictions, we extend and\ngeneralize various formulas in the literature which are needed for a precision\nanalysis of SUSY flavour GUT models.

We present here the first attempt at\ndescribing a physical mechanism for the formation of the $^{13}$C reservoir,\nstudying the mass circulation induced by magnetic buoyancy and without adding\nnew free parameters to those already involved in stellar modelling. Our\napproach represents the application, to the stellar layers relevant for\n$s$-processing, of recent exact, analytical 2D and 3D models for\nmagneto-hydrodynamic processes at the base of convective envelopes in evolved\nstars in order to promote downflows of envelope material for mass conservation,\nduring the occurrence of a dredge-up phenomenon. We find that the proton\npenetration is characterized by small concentrations, but extended over a large\nfractional mass of the He-layers, thus producing $^{13}$C reservoirs of several\n$10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The ensuing $^{13}$C-enriched zone has an almost flat\nprofile, while only a limited production of $^{14}$N occurs. In order to verify\nthe effects of our new findings we show how the abundances of the main\n$s$-component nuclei can be accounted for in solar proportions and how our\nlarge $^{13}$C-reservoir allows us to solve a few so far unexplained features\nin the abundance distribution of post-AGB objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 19:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The\nproblem of nuclear saturation therefore persists leading to the necessity of an\nanalysis of the way the nuclear saturation properties are obtained from\nexperimental data. We clarify the role of short-range correlations and review\nresults for nuclear saturation when such ingredients are completely taken into\naccount using the Green's function method. The role of long-range correlations\nis then analyzed with special emphasis on the importance of attractive\npion-dominated excitation modes which inevitably lead to higher saturation\ndensities than observed. Because such modes have no counterpart in finite\nnuclear systems, it is therefore argued that they should not be considered when\ncalculating nuclear matter properties.

If this function is sufficiently closely\napproximable by a polynomial or a rational function, then the semi-infinite\nprogram can be reformulated as an equivalent semidefinite program. Solving this\nsemidefinite program is challenging if the polynomials involved are of high\ndegree, due to numerical difficulties and bad scaling arising both from the\npolynomial approximations and from the fact that the semidefinite programming\nconstraints coming from the sum-of-squares representation of nonnegative\npolynomials are badly scaled. We combine rational function approximation\ntechniques and polynomial programming to overcome these numerical difficulties,\nusing sum-of-squares interpolants. Specifically, it is shown that the\nconditioning of the reformulations using sum-of-squares interpolants does not\ndeteriorate with increasing degrees, and problems involving sum-of-squares\ninterpolants of hundreds of degrees can be handled without difficulty.

The DOM, conceived by Claude Mahaux,\nprovides a unified description of both elastic nucleon scattering and structure\ninformation related to single-particle properties below the Fermi energy. We\nhave recently introduced a nonlocal dispersive optical potential for both the\nreal and imaginary part. Nonlocal absorptive potentials yield equivalent\nelastic differential cross sections for ${}^{40}$Ca as compared to local ones\nbut change the $\\ell$-dependent absorption profile suggesting important\nconsequences for the analysis of nuclear reactions.

In any single pulsar, a stochastic gravitational wave signal appears as\nan additional source of timing noise that can be absorbed by the noise model,\nand so it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of\npulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays.

Second, we evaluate the IR-resummation of the dark matter\npower spectrum in redshift space. This requires us to identify a controlled\napproximation that makes the numerical evaluation straightforward and\nefficient. Third, we compare the predictions of the theory at one loop with the\npower spectrum from numerical simulations up to $\\ell=6$. We find that the\nIR-resummation allows us to correctly reproduce the BAO peak. The $k$-reach, or\nequivalently the precision for a given $k$, depends on additional counterterms\nthat need to be matched to simulations. Since the non-linear scale for the\nvelocity is expected to be longer than the one for the overdensity, we consider\na minimal and a non-minimal set of counterterms.

The\nself-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $EB$ and $TB$\ncross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model, so any\ndetected $EB$ and $TB$ signals must be due to systematic errors.

A possible explanations for these arcs is that they could show the\nouter edges of asymmetric stellar wind bubbles. We use two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within HII regions around\nindividual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust within\nthe HII region. We assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled and\nthat dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the HII\nregion as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. We\npost-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared\nwavebands using the TORUS code. We find that the outer edge of a wind bubble\nemits brightly at 24um through starlight absorbed by dust grains and\nre-radiated thermally in the infrared. This produces a bright arc of emission\nfor slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where\nthere is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.\nThe 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing\ndistance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.\nThe size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but\nnot qualitative effects on our results. Despite the simplifications of our\nmodel, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the HII region\nRCW120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences.\nOur model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arc\naround CD -38 11636 in RCW120, and with comparable brightness. This suggests\nthat infrared arcs around O stars in HII regions may be revealing the extent of\nstellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

Methods that either match filter after coaddition, or\nperform PSF homogenization prior to coaddition will result in loss of\nsensitivity. We argue that our method provides an increase of between a few and\n25 percent in the survey speed of deep ground-based imaging surveys compared\nwith weighted coaddition techniques.

However,\nat the moment there remain key gaps in our theoretical understanding. The vast\nmajority of transition discs are accreting onto their central stars, indicating\nthat - at least close to the star - dust has been depleted from the gas by a\nvery large amount. In this review, we discuss evidence for two distinct\npopulations of transition discs: mm-faint - those with low mm-fluxes, small\nholes ($\\lesssim$10AU) and low accretion rates (~1e-10-1e-9 Msun/yr) and\nmm-bright - discs with large mm-fluxes, large holes ($\\gtrsim$20 AU) and high\naccretion rates ~1e-8 Msun/yr. MM-faint transition discs are consistent with\nwhat would naively be expected from a disc undergoing dispersal; however,\nmm-bright discs are not, and are likely to be rare and long-lived objects. We\ndiscuss the two commonly proposed mechanisms for creating transition discs:\nphotoevaporation and planet-disc interactions, with a particular emphasis on\nhow they would evolve in these models, comparing these predictions to the\nobserved population. More theoretical work on explaining the lack of optically\nthick, non-accreting transition discs is required in both the photoevaporation\nand planetary hypothesis, before we can start to use transition discs to\nconstrain models of planet formation. Finally, we suggest that the few discs\nwith primordial looking SEDs, but serendipitously imaged, showing large\ncavities in the mm (e.g. MWC758 & WSB 60) may represent a hidden population of\nassociated objects. Characterising and understanding how these objects fit into\nthe overall paradigm may allow us to unravel the mystery of transition discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 21:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This\ncoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the\nmaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the\nimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of\nequal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations.

Health economic evaluations of interventions against infectious\ndiseases are commonly based on the predictions of ordinary differential\nequation (ODE) systems or Markov models (MMs). Standard MMs are static, whereas\nODE systems are usually dynamic and account for herd immunity which is crucial\nto prevent overestimation of infection prevalence.

We present a dynamic MM under a Bayesian framework. We extend a\nstatic MM by incorporating the force of infection into the state allocation\nalgorithm.

In\neach iteration of SDA, a dual variable is updated by a carefully chosen point\nin a subspace spanned by the columns of a random matrix drawn independently\nfrom a fixed distribution. The distribution plays the role of a parameter of\nthe method. Our complexity results hold for a wide family of distributions of\nrandom matrices, which opens the possibility to fine-tune the stochasticity of\nthe method to particular applications. We prove that primal iterates associated\nwith the dual process converge to the projection exponentially fast in\nexpectation, and give a formula and an insightful lower bound for the\nconvergence rate. We also prove that the same rate applies to dual function\nvalues, primal function values and the duality gap. Unlike traditional\niterative methods, SDA converges under no additional assumptions on the system\n(e.g., rank, diagonal dominance) beyond consistency. In fact, our lower bound\nimproves as the rank of the system matrix drops. Many existing randomized\nmethods for linear systems arise as special cases of SDA, including randomized\nKaczmarz, randomized Newton, randomized coordinate descent, Gaussian descent,\nand their variants. In special cases where our method specializes to a known\nalgorithm, we either recover the best known rates, or improve upon them.\nFinally, we show that the framework can be applied to the distributed average\nconsensus problem to obtain an array of new algorithms. The randomized gossip\nalgorithm arises as a special case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 22:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 06:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

We study different IM-SRG generators that achieve the desired\ndecoupling, and how they affect the details of the IM-SRG flow. Based on\ncalculations of closed-shell nuclei, we assess possible truncations for closing\nthe system of flow equations in practical applications, as well as choices of\nthe reference state. We discuss the issue of center-of-mass factorization and\ndemonstrate that the IM-SRG ground-state wave function exhibits an approximate\ndecoupling of intrinsic and center-of-mass degrees of freedom, similar to\nCoupled Cluster (CC) wave functions.

Informally,\nidentities are used for tackling two of the fundamental difficulties that\nareinherent to deterministic distributed computing, namely: (1) symmetry\nbreaking, and (2) topological information gathering. In the context of local\ncomputation, i.e., when nodes can gather information only from nodes at bounded\ndistances, some insight regarding the role of identities has been established.\nFor instance, it was shown that, for large classes of construction problems,\nthe role of the identities can be rather small. However, for theidentities to\nplay no role, some other kinds of mechanisms for breaking symmetry must be\nemployed, such as edge-labeling or sense of direction. When it comes to local\ndistributed decision problems, the specification of the decision task does not\nseem to involve symmetry breaking. Therefore, it is expected that, assuming\nnodes can gather sufficient information about their neighborhood, one could get\nrid of the identities, without employing extra mechanisms for breaking\nsymmetry. We tackle this question in the framework of the $\\local$ model. Let\n$\\LD$ be the class of all problems that can be decided in a constant number of\nrounds in the $\\local$ model. Similarly, let $\\LD^*$ be the class of all\nproblems that can be decided at constant cost in the anonymous variant of the\n$\\local$ model, in which nodes have no identities, but each node can get access\nto the (anonymous) ball of radius $t$ around it, for any $t$, at a cost of $t$.\nIt is clear that $\\LD^*\\subseteq \\LD$. We conjecture that $\\LD^*=\\LD$. In this\npaper, we give several evidences supporting this conjecture. In particular, we\nshow that it holds for hereditary problems, as well as when the nodes know an\narbitrary upper bound on the total number of nodes. Moreover, we prove that the\nconjecture holds in the context of non-deterministic local decision, where\nnodes are given certificates (independent of the identities, if they exist),\nand the decision consists in verifying these certificates. In short, we prove\nthat $\\NLD^*=\\NLD$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 09:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

In this context, transport by internal\ngravity waves can play a role and could explain discrepancies between theory\nand observations. The efficiency of the transport of angular momentum by waves\ndepends on their driving mechanism. While excitation by turbulence throughout\nthe convective zone has already been investigated, we know that penetrative\nconvection into the stably stratified radiative zone can also generate internal\ngravity waves. Therefore, we aim at developing a semianalytical model to\nestimate the generation of IGW by penetrative plumes below an upper convective\nenvelope. We derive the wave amplitude considering the pressure exerted by an\nensemble of plumes on the interface between the radiative and convective zones\nas source term in the equation of momentum. We consider the effect of a thermal\ntransition from a convective gradient to a radiative one on the transmission of\nthe wave into the radiative zone. The plume-induced wave energy flux at the top\nof the radiative zone is computed for a solar model and is compared to the\nturbulence-induced one. We show that, for the solar case, penetrative\nconvection generates waves more efficiently than turbulence and that\nplume-induced waves can modify the internal rotation rate on shorter time\nscales. We also show that a smooth thermal transition significatively enhances\nthe wave transmission compared to the case of a steep transition. We conclude\nthat driving by penetrative convection must be taken into account as much as\nturbulence-induced waves for the transport of internal angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 10:52:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Archival C array data were processed and added\nto the new observations. To investigate the 3D structure of the atomic gas\ndisk, we made different 3D models for which we produced model HI data cubes.\nThe main ingredients of our best-fit model are (i) a thin disk inclined by 80\ndegrees; (ii) a crude approximation of a spiral and/or bar structure by an\nelliptical surface density distribution of the gas disk; (iii) a slight warp in\ninclination; (iv) an exponential flare; and (v) a low surface-density gas ring.\nThe slope of NGC 2683's flare is comparable, but somewhat steeper than those of\nother spiral galaxies. NGC 2683's maximum height of the flare is also\ncomparable to those of other galaxies. On the other hand, a saturation of the\nflare is only observed in NGC 2683. Based on the comparison between the high\nresolution model and observations, we exclude the existence of an extended\natomic gas halo around the optical and thin gas disk. Under the assumption of\nvertical hydrostatic equilibrium we derive the vertical velocity dispersion of\nthe gas. The high turbulent velocity dispersion in the flare can be explained\nby energy injection by (i) supernovae, (ii) magneto-rotational instabilities,\n(iii) ISM stirring by dark matter substructure, or (iv) external gas accretion.\nThe existence of the complex large-scale warping and asymmetries favors\nexternal gas accretion as one of the major energy sources that drives\nturbulence in the outer gas disk. We propose a scenario where this external\naccretion leads to turbulent adiabatic compression that enhances the turbulent\nvelocity dispersion and might quench star formation in the outer gas disk of\nNGC 2683.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 12:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

One important ingredient for many applications of nuclear physics\nto astrophysics, nuclear energy, and stockpile stewardship are cross sections\nfor reactions of neutrons with rare isotopes. Since direct measurements are\noften not feasible, indirect methods, e.g. (d,p) reactions, should be used.\nThose (d,p) reactions may be viewed as three-body reactions and described with\nFaddeev techniques. Purpose. Faddeev equations in momentum space have a long\ntradition of utilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of\ncoupled integral equations in one variable. Optical potentials representing the\neffective interactions in the neutron (proton) nucleus subsystem are usually\nnon-Hermitian as well as energy-dependent. Potential matrix elements as well as\ntransition matrix elements calculated with them must fulfill the reciprocity\ntheorem. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a separable,\nenergy-dependent representation of complex, energy-dependent optical potentials\nthat fulfill reciprocity exactly. Results. Starting from a separable,\nenergy-independent representation of global optical potentials based on a\ngeneralization of the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme, a further\ngeneralization is needed to take into account the energy dependence.\nApplications to n$+^{48}$Ca, n$+^{208}$Pb, and p$+^{208}$Pb are investigated\nfor energies from 0 to 50~MeV with special emphasis on fulfilling reciprocity.\nConclusions.

Among thousands of asteroids with diameters\nlarger than ~300 m, only a handful of asteroids are known to rotate faster than\n2.0 h, all are in the sub-km range (<=0.6 km). Here we present photometric\nmeasurements suggesting that (60716) 2000 GD65, an S-complex, inner-main belt\nasteroid with a relatively large diameter of 2.3 +0.6-0.7 km, completes one\nrotation in 1.9529+-0.0002 h. Its unique diameter and rotation period allow us\nto examine scenarios about asteroid internal structure and evolution: a rubble\npile bound only by gravity; a rubble-pile with strong cohesion; a monolithic\nstructure; an asteroid experiencing mass shedding; an asteroid experiencing\nYORP spin-up/down; and an asteroid with a unique octahedron shape results with\na four-peak lightcurve and a 3.9 h period. We find that the most likely\nscenario includes a lunar-like cohesion that can prevent (60716) 2000 GD65 from\ndisrupting without requiring a monolithic structure or a unique shape. Due to\nthe uniqueness of (60716) 2000 GD65, we suggest that most asteroids typically\nhave smaller cohesion than that of lunar regolith.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 14:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This direct comparison validates the\nfeature latitudes assigned to the K2 light curve periods based on Neptune's\nzonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. Although\nNeptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,\na single large discrete storm seen in Keck imaging dominates the K2 and Hubble\nlight curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-term\nbrightness variability.

In some cases a quasi-stationary situation is achieved after the\nrelaxation phase, characterized by the excitation of standing vertical\noscillations. These oscillations show a strong attenuation with time produced\nby the mechanism of continuum damping due to the inhomogeneous transition\nbetween the prominence and solar corona. The characteristic period of the\nvertical oscillations does not depend strongly on the twist of the flux rope.\nNonlinearity is the responsible for triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nassociated to the vertical oscillations and that eventually produces horizontal\nstructures. Contrary to other configurations in which the longitudinal axis of\nthe prominence is permeated by a perpendicular magnetic field, like in\nunsheared arcades, the orientation of the prominence along the flux rope axis\nprevents the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and therefore the\nappearance of vertical structuring along this axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 14:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Defining a semantics for such an\nalgebra, so to derive Continuous Time Markov Chains from system specifications,\nrequires dealing with transitions labeled by rates. With respect to standard\nprocess algebra semantics this poses a problem: we have to take into account\nthe multiplicity of several identical transitions (with the same rate). Several\ntechniques addressing this problem have been introduced in the literature, but\nthey can only be used for semantic definitions that do not exploit a structural\ncongruence relation on terms while inferring transitions.

In contrast to closed wires where the voltage is\ndetermined by the time variance of magnetic field and enclosed area, in an open\nwire we have to integrate the electric field along the wire. It is found that\nthe longitudinal electric field contributes with 1/3 and the transverse field\nwith 2/3 to the induced voltage. In order to find the electric fields the\nsources of the magnetic fields are necessary to know. The representation of a\nhomogeneous and time-varying magnetic field implies unavoidably a certain\nsymmetry point or symmetry line which depend on the geometry of the source. As\na consequence the induced voltage of an open wire is found to be the area\ncovered with respect to this symmetry line or point perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field. This in turn allows to find the symmetry points of a magnetic\nfield source by measuring the voltage of an open wire placed with different\nangles in the magnetic field. We present exactly solvable models for a symmetry\npoint and for a symmetry line, respectively.

At the same time, fire plays a vital role in restoring\necological balance in many ecosystems. Fuel management, or treatment planning\nby way of planned burning, is an important tool used in many countries where\nfire is a major ecosystem process. In this paper, we propose an approach to\nreduce the spatial connectivity of fuel hazards while still considering the\necological fire requirements of the ecosystem. A mixed integer programming\n(MIP) model is formulated in such a way that it breaks the connectivity of\nhigh-risk regions as a means to reduce fuel hazards in the landscape. This\nmulti-period model tracks the age of each vegetation type and determines the\noptimal time and locations to conduct fuel treatments. The minimum and maximum\nTolerable Fire Intervals (TFI), which define the ages at which certain\nvegetation type can be treated for ecological reasons, are taken into account\nby the model. Previous work has been limited to using single vegetation types\nimplemented within rectangular grids. In this paper, we significantly extend\nprevious work by modelling multiple vegetation types implemented within a\npolygon-based network. Thereby a more realistic representation of the landscape\nis achieved. An analysis of the proposed approach was conducted for a fuel\ntreatment area comprising 711 treatment units in the Barwon-Otway district of\nVictoria, Australia.

Due to these results, it can be considered plausible that, for such a\nvector field, there exists in the neighborhood of any point $X\\in \\mathrm{V}$ a\nchart $\\chi $ that is $v$-adapted and \"nice\", i.e., such that the mapping\n$\\bar{\\chi }: l\\mapsto {\\bf x}$ is injective --- unless $v$ has some\n\"pathological\" character. This leads us to define a notion of \"normal\" vector\nfield. For any such vector field, the mappings $\\bar{\\chi }$ build an atlas of\ncharts, thus providing $\\mathrm{N}\\_v$ with a canonical structure of\ndifferentiable manifold (when the topology defined on $\\mathrm{N}\\_v$ is\nHausdorff, for which we give a sufficient condition met in important physical\nsituations). Previously, a local space manifold $\\mathrm{M}\\_\\mathrm{F}$ had\nbeen associated with any \"reference frame\" $\\mathrm{F}$, defined as an\nequivalence class of charts. We show that, if $\\mathrm{F}$ is made of nice\n$v$-adapted charts, $\\mathrm{M}\\_\\mathrm{F}$ is naturally identified with an\nopen subset of the global space manifold $\\mathrm{N}\\_v$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 14:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

I could list the following\nreasons to address that question: (a) Leaves are natural composite structures,\nduring millions of years of evolution, they have adapted themselves to their\nsurrounding environment and their design is optimized, one can apply the\nknowledge gained from studying the fracture mechanism of leaves to the\ndevelopment of new composite materials; (b) Other soft tissues like skin and\nblood vessel have similar structure at some scales and may possess the same\nfracture mechanism. The gained knowledge can also be applied to these\nmaterials; (c) Global need for food is skyrocketing. There are few countries,\nincluding the United States, that have all the potentials (i.e. water, soil,\nsunlight, and manpower) to play a major role in the future world food supplying\nmarket. If we can increase the output of our farms and forests, by means of\nprotecting them against herbivores [Beck 1965], pathogens [Campbell et al.\n1980], and other physical damages, our share of the future market will be\nhigher. It will also enforce our national food security because we will not be\ndependent on food import.

The Stefan-Boltzmann law, total energy density,\nnumber density of photons, Helmholtz free energy density, internal energy\ndensity, enthalpy density, entropy density, heat capacity at constant volume,\npressure, and normal total emissivity are calculated using experimental data\nfor the frequency dependence of the normal spectral emissivity of liquid and\nsolid uranium and plutonium carbides in the visible-near infrared range.

The first part\nof the method is to create a database of measurements (arms length, hip\nbreadth, etc.). From these data, a model of accessibility is proposed.

First, the accessibility areas of forty adult\nsubjects, which may correspond to the distance of reachability of products,\nwere evaluated by performing an accessibility task comprising 168 reach points.\nSecond, anthropometric characteristics of participants were recorded and used\nto perform the reach assessment by a numerical method, and then by a CAD-based\nanalysis, where the reach was predicted using the software's maximum\nreach-envelope generation.
