An important\ntype of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where\nidentical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence\n$AGTC\\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from\n$AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$. In this work, we investigate\nthe possibility of generating a large number of sequences from a \\textit{seed},\ni.e.\\ a small initial string, by tandem duplications of bounded length. We\nstudy the capacity of such a system, a notion that quantifies the system's\ngenerating power. Our results include \\textit{exact capacity} values for\ncertain tandem duplication string systems. In addition, motivated by the role\nof DNA sequences in expressing proteins via RNA and the genetic code, we define\nthe notion of the \\textit{expressiveness} of a tandem duplication system as the\ncapability of expressing arbitrary substrings. We then \\textit{completely}\ncharacterize the expressiveness of tandem duplication systems for general\nalphabet sizes and duplication lengths. In particular, based on a celebrated\nresult by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary\nsquare-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded\ntandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication\nlength, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as\nsubstrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular\ninterest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we\nalso show that these systems do not have full capacity. In general, our results\nillustrate that duplication lengths play a more significant role than the seed\nin generating a large number of sequences for these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 17:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

There are scenarios,\nhowever, that have received little or no attention at all, despite its\nrelevance and applicability. One of such scenarios is early text\nclassification, where one needs to know the category of a document by using\npartial information only. A document is processed as a sequence of terms, and\nthe goal is to devise a method that can make predictions as fast as possible.\nThe importance of this variant of the text classification problem is evident in\ndomains like sexual predator detection, where one wants to identify an offender\nas early as possible. This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naive\nBayes classifier for approaching this problem. Specifically, we assess its\nperformance when classifying documents after seeing an increasingly number of\nterms. A simple modification to the standard naive Bayes implementation allows\nus to make predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge\nnaive Bayes has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive\nexperimental evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early\ntext classification. What is more, we show that this simple solution is very\ncompetitive when compared with state of the art methodologies that are more\nelaborated. We foresee our work will pave the way for the development of more\neffective early text classification techniques based in the naive Bayes\nformulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 21:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

However, there is still an unaddressed challenge:\nthe application-specific dependability in terms of sensor fault detection and\ntolerance. The dependability is also affected by a reduction on the quality of\nmonitoring when mitigating WSN constrains (e.g., limited energy, narrow\nbandwidth). We address these by designing a dependable distributed WSN\nframework for SHM (called DependSHM) and then examining its ability to cope\nwith sensor faults and constraints. We find evidence that faulty sensors can\ncorrupt results of a health event (e.g., damage) in a structural system without\nbeing detected. More specifically, we bring attention to an undiscovered yet\ninteresting fact, i.e., the real measured signals introduced by one or more\nfaulty sensors may cause an undamaged location to be identified as damaged\n(false positive) or a damaged location as undamaged (false negative) diagnosis.\nThis can be caused by faults in sensor bonding, precision degradation,\namplification gain, bias, drift, noise, and so forth. In DependSHM, we present\na distributed automated algorithm to detect such types of faults, and we offer\nan online signal reconstruction algorithm to recover from the wrong diagnosis.\nThrough comprehensive simulations and a WSN prototype system implementation, we\nevaluate the effectiveness of DependSHM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2015 22:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

When models are realistic and are stepped through thousands\nof machine cycles, these terms can grow quite large and the cost of simplifying\nthem on each step grows. In this paper we describe an ACL2 book that uses HIDE\nand metafunctions to facilitate the management of large terms representing such\nstates. Because the metafunctions for each state component updater are solely\nresponsible for creating state expressions (i.e., \"writing\") and the\nmetafunctions for each state component accessor are solely responsible for\nextracting values (i.e., \"reading\") from such state expressions, they can\nmaintain their own normal form, use HIDE to prevent other parts of ACL2 from\ninspecting them, and use honsing to uniquely represent state expressions. The\nlast feature makes it possible to memoize the metafunctions, which can improve\nproof performance in some machine models. This paper describes a\ngeneral-purpose ACL2 book modeling a byte-addressed memory supporting \"mixed\"\nreads and writes. By \"mixed\" we mean that reads need not correspond (in address\nor number of bytes) with writes. Verified metafunctions simplify such\n\"read-over-write\" expressions while hiding the potentially large state\nexpression. A key utility is a function that determines an upper bound on the\nvalue of a symbolic arithmetic expression, which plays a role in resolving\nwrites to addresses given by symbolic expressions.

The simulations start with Jupiter and Saturn locked in the mutual 3:2\nmean motion resonance plus 3 Neptune-mass planets in a compact orbital\nconfiguration. Mutual planetary interactions during migration led one of the\nNeptunes to be ejected in less than 10 Myr of evolution, causing Jupiter to\njump by about 0.3 au in semi-major axis.

The nontrivial task to\nincorporate color into the model is tackled by considering RGB images as\nthree-dimensional arrays, where the transport in the RGB direction is performed\nin a periodic way. Following the approach of Papadakis et al. [35] for\ngray-value images we propose two discrete variational models, a constrained and\na penalized one which can also handle unbalanced transport. We show that a\nminimizer of our discrete model exists, but it is not unique for some special\ninitial/final images. For minimizing the resulting functionals we apply a\nprimal-dual algorithm.

We present the first observations of spectroscopic variability of\nbrown dwarfs covering the 0.99 $\\mu$m FeH feature. We observed the spatially\nresolved very nearby brown dwarf binary WISE J104915.57-531906.1 (Luhman 16AB),\na late-L and early-T dwarf, with HST/WFC3 in the G102 grism at 0.8-1.15 $\\mu$m.\nWe find significant variability at all wavelengths for both brown dwarfs, with\npeak-to-valley amplitudes of 9.3% for Luhman 16B and 4.5% for Luhman 16A.

We\nestimate a rotational period between 4.5 and 5.5 h, very similar to Luhman 16B.\nVariability in both components complicates the interpretation of spatially\nunresolved observations. The probability for finding large amplitude\nvariability in any two brown dwarfs is less than 10%.

However, the drawback of\nthis attractive feature is a high sensitivity to pointing errors, which\ndegrades the performance of the coronagraph. We propose a tip-tilt retrieval\ntechnique based on the analysis of the final coronagraphic image, hereafter\ncalled Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for Tip-tilt Sensing (QACITS).\nUnder the assumption of small phase aberrations, we show that the behaviour of\nthe vortex phase mask can be simply described from the entrance pupil to the\nLyot stop plane by Zernike polynomials. This convenient formalism is used to\nestablish the theoretical basis of the QACITS technique. Simulations have been\nperformed to demonstrate the validity and limits of the technique, including\nthe case of a centrally obstructed pupil. The QACITS technique principle is\nfurther validated by experimental results in the case of an unobstructed\ncircular aperture. The typical configuration of the Keck telescope (24% central\nobstruction) has been simulated with additional high order aberrations. In\nthese conditions, our simulations show that the QACITS technique is still\nadapted to centrally obstructed pupils and performs tip-tilt retrieval with a\nprecision of $5 \\times 10^{-2}$ {\\lambda}/D when wavefront errors amount to\n{\\lambda}/14 rms and $10^{-2}$ {\\lambda}/D for {\\lambda}/70 rms errors (with\n{\\lambda} the wavelength and D the pupil diameter). The implementation of the\nQACITS technique is based on the analysis of the scientific image and does not\nrequire any modification of the original setup. Current facilities equipped\nwith a vortex phase mask can thus directly benefit from this technique to\nimprove the contrast performance close to the axis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 09:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

For an insulator with mainly donor\ntype defects, the low-resistivity state is characterized by a negatively\ncharged insulator due to convex band bending, and the high-resistivity state by\na positively charged insulator due to concave band bending; vice versa for\ninsulators with mainly acceptor type defects.

Going beyond the\ncommonly portrayed weak field limit (i.e, the externally applied electric field\nis over-weighed by the surface-induced electrical potential, towards charge\ndistribution in an electrified wall-adhering layer) for electroosmotic\ntransport, we numerically solve the coupled full set of Poisson-Nernst-Planck\n(PNP) and Navier-Stokes equations, in a semi-infinite domain, bounded at the\nbottom by a charged wall. Further, in an effort to obtain deeper physical\ninsight, we solve the simplified forms of the relevant governing equations for\nlow surface potential in two separate asymptotic limits: (i) a regular\nperturbation solution for Low Ionic Peclet number (Pe), where Pe is employed as\nthe gauge function and (ii) a matched asymptotic solution for O(1) Pe in the\nThin Electric Double Layer (EDL) limit. We demonstrate that reasonably good\nagreement is observed between the analytical and numerical solutions. Our\nanalysis reveals that the primary effect of Pe on the flow is to slow down the\n\"free stream velocity\", adding to the periodicity of the flow, while it also\ninduces significant changes in the overall potential. We further show that the\nelectrical double layer thickness strongly dictates the \"free stream velocity\",\nand a simple Smoluchowski type of slip boundary condition cannot be used, if\nthe effect of advection is taken into account.

It is\nknown that relaxation of the supply and demand constraints in the cell-based\nformulations of the DTA problem results in a linear program.

This work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings from the\nmixed-mode spacings, in order to open the way to a fully automated analysis of\nlarge data sets. An analytical development of the mixed-mode asymptotic\nexpansion is used to derive the period spacing between two consecutive mixed\nmodes.

As shown by\nKibble, the Goldstone theorem applies, there is a massless derivatively coupled\nNambu-Goldstone boson (NGB). Proof of all-loop-orders renormalizability and\nunitarity is tricky because the BRST-invariant Lagrangian is not U(1)\nsymmetric. Nevertheless, Slavnov-Taylor identities guarantee that on-shell\nT-matrix elements of physical states are independent of anomaly-free gauge\ntransformations. We observe that they are therefore also independent of the\nusual anomaly-free U(1) global transformations. It follows that the associated\nglobal current, is exactly conserved for amplitudes of physical states. We\nidentify corresponding Ward-Takahashi identities (WTI). In Lorenz gauge, two\ntowers of \"1-soft-pion\" global WTI govern the scalar-sector, and represent a\nnew global U(1)xBRST symmetry not of the Lagrangian but of the physics.

Our complexity analysis bounds the absolute error to\nwhich the coefficients of $F$ have to be provided, the total number of\niterations, and the overall bit complexity.

All these changes happen at approximately the same\ntransition scale and therefore can be seen as manifest signatures of the\ntransition from weak to strong wave turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 09:05:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 00:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The bloated\ncompanions in BWP systems exert small torques on the system causing the orbit\nto change on small but measurable time scales. Because adding parameters to a\ntiming model reduces sensitivity to a gravitational wave (GW) signal, the need\nto fit many orbital frequency derivatives to the timing data is potentially\nproblematic for using BWPs to detect GWs with pulsar timing arrays. Using\nsimulated data with up to four orbital frequency derivatives, we show that\nfitting for orbital frequency derivatives absorbs less than 5% of the low\nfrequency spectrum expected from a stochastic gravitational wave background\nsignal. Furthermore, this result does not change with orbital period.\nTherefore, we suggest that if timing systematics can be accounted for by\nmodeling orbital frequency derivatives and is not caused by spin frequency\nnoise, pulsar timing array experiments should include BWPs in their arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 15:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

The mechanical response of such\nmembranes is studied by minimizing the Gibbs free energy which penalizes\nperturbations of the changes of areal stretch and their gradients only [1]. As\nmaterial instabilities arise whenever areal stretches characterizing\nhomogeneous configurations lie inside the spinoidal zone of the free energy\ndensity, bifurcations from such configurations are shown to occur as\noscillatory perturbations of the in-plane displacement. Experimental\nobservations [2] show a power-law in-plane viscous behavior of lipid structures\nallowing for an effective viscoelastic behavior of lipid membranes [3], which\nfalls in the framework of Fractional Hereditariness.

Separation of variables allows for\nshowing how Fractional Hereditariness owes bifurcated modes with a larger\nnumber of spatial oscillations than the corresponding elastic analog. Indeed,\nthe available range of areal stresses for material instabilities is found to\nincrease with respect to the purely elastic case.
