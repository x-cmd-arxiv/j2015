In multi-planet systems,\nconvergent amassing of orbits inevitably leads to encounters with rational\nperiod ratios, which may result in establishment of mean motion resonances. The\nsuccess or failure of resonant capture yields exceedingly different subsequent\nevolutions, and thus plays a central role in determining the ensuing orbital\narchitecture of planetary systems. In this work, we employ an integrable\nHamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances that allows both\nsecondary bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and construct a\ncomprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions\nunder which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a\ngeneralized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure\nfor calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain.\nSubsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the\nevolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate\nthe origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian\nextrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the commonly observed extrasolar\norbital structure can be understood if planet pairs encounter mean motion\ncommensurabilities on slightly eccentric (e~0.02) orbits. Accordingly, we\nspeculate that resonant capture among low-mass planets is typically rendered\nunsuccessful due to subtle axial asymmetries inherent to the global structure\nof protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 17:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}

This work was\nconducted in the context of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (eBOSS), which will use ~200 000 emission line galaxies (ELGs) at\n0.6<zspec<1.0 to obtain a precise baryon acoustic oscillation measurement. Our\nproposed selection technique is based on optical and near-infrared broad-band\nfilter photometry. We used a training sample to define a quantity, the Fisher\ndiscriminant (linear combination of colours), which correlates best with the\ndesired properties of the target: redshift and [OII] flux. The proposed\nselections are simply done by applying a cut on magnitudes and this Fisher\ndiscriminant. We used public data and dedicated SDSS spectroscopy to quantify\nthe redshift distribution and [OII] flux of our ELG target selections. We\ndemonstrate that two of our selections fulfil the initial eBOSS/ELG redshift\nrequirements: for a target density of 180 deg^2, ~70% of the selected objects\nhave 0.6<zspec<1.0 and only ~1% of those galaxies in the range 0.6<zspec<1.0\nare expected to have a catastrophic zspec estimate. Additionally, the stacked\nspectra and stacked deep images for those two selections show characteristic\nfeatures of star-forming galaxies. The proposed approach using the Fisher\ndiscriminant could, however, be used to efficiently select other galaxy\npopulations, based on multi-band photometry, providing that spectroscopic\ninformation is available. This technique could thus be useful for other future\nmassive spectroscopic surveys such as PFS, DESI, and 4MOST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 18:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

These extended features, called magnetic tongues,\nare interpreted as a consequence of the azimuthal component of the magnetic\nflux in the toroidal flux-tubes that form ARs. We develop a new systematic and\nuser-independent method to identify AR tongues. Our method is based on\ndetermining and analyzing the evolution of the AR main polarity inversion line\n(PIL). The effect of the tongues is quantified by measuring the acute angle [\ntau] between the orientation of the PIL and the direction orthogonal to the AR\nmain bipolar axis. We apply a simple model to simulate the emergence of a\nbipolar AR. This model lets us interpret the effect of magnetic tongues on\nparameters that characterize ARs ( e.g. the PIL inclination and the tilt\nangles, and their evolution). In this idealized kinematic emergence model, tau\nis a monotonically increasing function of the twist and has the same sign as\nthe magnetic helicity. We systematically apply our procedure to a set of\nbipolar ARs that were observed emerging in line-of-sight magnetograms over\neight years. For most of the cases studied, the tongues only have a small\ninfluence on the AR tilt angle since tongues have a much lower magnetic flux\nthan the more concentrated main polarities. From the observed evolution of tau,\ncorrected for the temporal evolution of the tilt angle and its final value when\nthe AR is fully emerged, we estimate the average number of turns in the\nsubphotospherically emerging flux-rope. These values for the 41 observed ARs\nare below unity, except for one. This indicates that subphotospheric flux-ropes\ntypically have a low amount of twist, i.e. highly twisted flux-tubes are rare.\nOur results demonstrate that the evolution of the PIL is a robust indicator of\nthe presence of tongues and constrains the amount of twist in emerging\nflux-tubes\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 18:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which models sequence\ndynamics, has attracted increasing attention on visual interpretation. However,\nmost existing approaches generate a word locally with given previous words and\nthe visual content, while the relationship between sentence semantics and\nvisual content is not holistically exploited. As a result, the generated\nsentences may be contextually correct but the semantics (e.g., subjects, verbs\nor objects) are not true.\n  This paper presents a novel unified framework, named Long Short-Term Memory\nwith visual-semantic Embedding (LSTM-E), which can simultaneously explore the\nlearning of LSTM and visual-semantic embedding. The former aims to locally\nmaximize the probability of generating the next word given previous words and\nvisual content, while the latter is to create a visual-semantic embedding space\nfor enforcing the relationship between the semantics of the entire sentence and\nvisual content. Our proposed LSTM-E consists of three components: a 2-D and/or\n3-D deep convolutional neural networks for learning powerful video\nrepresentation, a deep RNN for generating sentences, and a joint embedding\nmodel for exploring the relationships between visual content and sentence\nsemantics. The experiments on YouTube2Text dataset show that our proposed\nLSTM-E achieves to-date the best reported performance in generating natural\nsentences: 45.3% and 31.0% in terms of BLEU@4 and METEOR, respectively. We also\ndemonstrate that LSTM-E is superior in predicting Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)\ntriplets to several state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 20:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 10:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 07:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

However, one unresolved problem is the\nevidence in several neutron stars for an extra energy source, located at\nshallow depth in the crust, that is not accounted for by standard heating\nmodels. Its origin remains puzzling, and it is currently unclear whether this\nadditional heating occurs in all neutron stars, and if the magnitude is always\nthe same.

The temperature of the\nneutron star was elevated during the first two months following its ~8 week\naccretion episode, but had decayed to the pre-outburst level within ~100 days.\nInterpreting this as rapid cooling of the accretion-heated crust, we model the\nobserved temperature curve with a thermal evolution code. We find that there is\nno need to invoke shallow heating for this neutron star, although an extra\nenergy release up to ~1.4 MeV/nucleon is allowed by the current data (2-sigma\nconfidence). We also present two new data points on the crust cooling curve of\nthe 11-Hz X-ray pulsar IGR J17480-2446 in Terzan 5, which was active in 2010.\nThe temperature of this neutron star remained significantly above its\npre-outburst level, but we detect no temperature change since the previous\nmeasurements of 2013 February.

In this context we have made a comprehensive study\nof the young LOA open cluster NGC 2302, which includes a UBVRI photometric\nanalysis and determination of its kinematic properties - proper motion and\nradial velocity - and of its orbital parameters. We determined the mean PM of\nNGC 2302 relative to the local field of disk stars, and, through a comparison\nwith the UCAC4 catalog, we transformed this relative PM into an absolute one.\nUsing medium-resolution spectroscopy of 26 stars in the field of NGC 2302, we\nderived its mean RV. Isochrone fits to the photometric diagrams allowed us to\ndetermine the fundamental parameters of NGC 2302, including reddening,\ndistance, and age. The kinematic data and derived distance allowed us to\ndetermine the space motion of NGC 2302. This was done by adopting a\ntime-independent, axisymmetric, and fully analytic gravitational potential for\nthe MW. We obtained an absolute PM for NGC 2302 of ($\\mu_{\\alpha}\n\\cos\\delta,\\mu_{\\delta}) = (-2.09,-2.11)$ mas/yr, with standard errors of 0.410\nand 0.400 mas/yr. The mean RV of NGC 2302 turned out to be 31.2 km/sec with a\nstandard error of 0.7 km/sec. Isochrone fits displaced for this reddening and\nfor a distance modulus of (m-M)o = 10.69 indicate an age of log(t) = 7.90-8.00\nwith a slight tendency toward the younger age. Inspection of the shape of the\norbit of NGC 2302 and the resulting orbital parameters indicate that it is a\ntypical population I object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 21:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The intention was to guide the compilation flow and\ndefine instrumentation strategies using the Aspect-Oriented Approach provided\nby LARA. This allows a separation of the original target application and the\ninstrumentation secondary concerns.\n  One of the goals of this work was the development of a source-to-source C\ncompiler that modifies code according to an input strategy. These modifications\ncould provide code transformations that target performance and instrumentation\nfor debugging, but in this work they are used to inject code that collects\ninformation about the values that certain variables take during runtime. This\ncompiler is supported by an AOP approach that enables the definition of\ninstrumentation strategies. We decided to extend an existing source-to-source\ncompiler, Cetus, and couple it with LARA, an AOP language that is partially\nabstracted from the target programming language.\n  We propose and evaluate an approach to detect faults in C programs by\nmonitoring the range values of variables. We consider various monitoring\nstrategies and use two real-life applications, the GZIP file compressor and\nABS, a program provided by an industrial partner. The different strategies were\nspecified in LARA and automatically applied using MANET. The experimental\nresults show that our approach has potential but is hindered by not accounting\nfor values in arrays and control variables.

Assuming only an isotropic, homogeneous and flat\nuniverse, in this work we introduce a model-independent method to reconstruct\ndirectly the deceleration function via a piecewise function. Including a\npenalty factor, we are able to vary continuously the complexity of the\ndeceleration function from a linear case to an arbitrary $(n+1)$-knots spline\ninterpolation. We carry out a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis to determine the best\npenalty factor, evaluating the bias-variance trade-off, given the uncertainties\nof the SDSS-II and SNLS supernova combined sample (JLA), compilations of baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) and $H(z)$ data. The bias-variance analysis is done\nfor three fiducial models with different features in the deceleration curve.\nFor each fiducial model, we test different reconstructions using, in each case,\nmore than $10^4$ catalogs in a total of about $5\\times 10^5$. This\ninvestigation proved to be essential in determining the best reconstruction to\nstudy these data. We show that, evaluating a single fiducial model, the\nconclusions about the bias-variance ratio are misleading. We determine the\nreconstruction method in which the bias represents at most $10\\%$ of the total\nuncertainty. Finally, we apply the Ensemble Sampler Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(ESMCMC) method to explore the posterior of the deceleration function up to\nredshift $1.3$ (using only JLA) and $2.3$ (JLA+BAO+$H(z)$).

The reduced equations governing the instability are revisited and the\ngenerated solutions are examined using both the previously assumed separable\nforms and an improved non-separable solution form that is herewith introduced.\nAnalyzing the reduced equations using the separable form shows that, while the\nlow-order body modes have converged eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (as both the\nvertical boundaries of the atmosphere are extended and with increased radial\nresolution), it is also confirmed that the corresponding high-order body modes\nand the surface modes do indeed show unbounded growth rates. However, the\nenergy contained in both the higher-order body modes and surface modes\ndiminishes precipitously due to the disk's Gaussian density profile. Most of\nthe energy of the instability is contained in the low-order modes. An\ninseparable solution form is introduced which filters out the inconsequential\nsurface modes leaving only body modes (both low and high-order ones). The\nanalysis predicts a fastest growing mode with a specific radial length scale.\nThe growth rates associated with the fundamental corrugation and breathing\nmodes matches the growth and length scales observed in previous nonlinear\nstudies of the instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 23:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 11:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

None of these solutions are ideal; multi-reference\ncoupled cluster is not black box, including higher-body cluster operators is\ncomputationally demanding, and allowing symmetry breaking leads to the loss of\ngood quantum numbers.

It has been studied extensively due to its immense practical\nimportance in a variety of fields. The underlying goal is to identify the\nimpulse response of an unknown system. This is accomplished by placing a known\nsystem in parallel and feeding both systems with the same input. Due to initial\ndisparity in their impulse responses, an error is generated between their\noutputs. This error is set to tune the impulse response of known system in a\nway that every change in impulse response reduces the magnitude of prospective\nerror. This process is repeated until the error becomes negligible and the\nresponses of both systems match. To specifically minimize the error, numerous\nadaptive algorithms are available. They are noteworthy either for their low\ncomputational complexity or high convergence speed. Recently, a method, known\nas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), has gained much attention due to its\nremarkably low computational complexity.

After introducing AR its theoretical properties are studied in\nthe particular case of orthogonal linear regression. For the non-orthogonal\ncase extensive simulations are performed to assess the performance of AR.

We show that\nit is possible to address this problem by relying on a system-inversion-based\nfault estimation filter that is parameterized using identified Markov\nparameters. Our novel data-driven approach improves estimation performance by\navoiding the propagation of model reduction errors originating from\nidentification of the state-space plant model into the designed filter.\nFurthermore, it allows additional design freedom to stabilize the obtained\nfilter under the same stabilizability condition as the existing model-based\nsystem inversion.

The statistical physics of this process\nhas a long history, and is commonly described in term of the Poland-Scheraga\n(PS) model. Crucial to this model is the configurational entropy for a melted\nregion (compared to the entropy of an intact region of the same size),\nquantified by the loop factor. In this study we investigate how confinement\naffects the DNA melting transition, by using the loop factor for an ideal\nGaussian chain. By subsequent numerical solutions of the PS model, we\ndemonstrate that the melting temperature depends on the persistence lengths of\nsingle-stranded and double-stranded DNA. For realistic values of the\npersistence lengths the melting temperature is predicted to decrease with\ndecreasing channel diameter.

If this occurs at trans-Planckian energies, it\nshould be well described by general relativity. Furthermore, if there exist\nhidden extra dimensions, the fundamental Planck mass may well be of the order\nof the TeV and thus achievable with current or future particle accelerators. By\nmodeling the colliding particles as Aichelburg-Sexl shock waves on a flat,\n$D$-dimensional background, we devise a perturbative framework to compute the\nspace-time metric in the future of the collision. Then, a generalisation of\nBondi's formalism is employed to extract the gravitational radiation and\ncompute the inelasticity of the collision: the percentage of the initial\ncentre-of-mass energy that is radiated away. Using the axial symmetry of the\nproblem, we show that this information is encoded in a single function of the\ntransverse metric components - the news function. We then unveil a hidden\nconformal symmetry which exists at each order in perturbation theory and thus\nmakes the problem effectively two-dimensional. Moreover, it allows for the\nfactorisation of the angular dependence of the news function, i.e. the\nradiation pattern at null infinity, and clarifies the correspondence between\nthe perturbative series of the metric and an angular expansion off the\ncollision axis. The first-order estimate, or isotropic term, is computed\nanalytically and yields a remarkable simple formula for the inelasticity for\nany $D$. Higher-order terms, however, require the use of a computer for\nnumerical integration. We study the integration domain and compute,\nnumerically, the Green's functions and the sources, thus paving the way for the\ncomputation of the inelasticity in a future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2015 10:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-11"}

In particular, we treat admissible viscosity\nsolutions of elliptic branches of the equation, where the nonlinearity need not\nbe monotone on all of the space of symmetric N by N matrices. An elliptic\nbranch (in the sense of Krylov, 1995) of the equation is encoded by a set\nvalued map from the coordinate domain into the elliptic subsets of the\nsymmetric matrices (an elliptic map). The nonlinearity will be monotone along\nthis map and the degenerate elliptic PDE is replaced by the a differential\ninclusion. Weak solutions to such differential inclusions are defined by using\nthe notion given by Harvey-Lawson (2009) in a pointwise manner. If the elliptic\nmap is uniformly upper semicontinuous, we show that the comparison principle\nholds for these weak solutions and that Perron's method yields a unique\ncontinuous solution to the associated abstract Dirichlet problem provided that\nthe boundary is suitably convex with respect to the elliptic mapand its dual in\nthe sense of Harvey and Lawson. When the map encodes an elliptic branch of a\ngiven PDE, these soluitions are shown to be admissible viscosity solutions of\nthe PDE problem. Various applications are described in terms of structural\nconditions which ensure the existence of the needed elliptic map.

This suggests\nindirectly the possible dominance of the hard-scattering process over\nessentially the whole $p_T$ region at central rapidity in high-energy $pp$ and\n$p \\bar p$ collisions.

This paper tackles the problem of channel estimation and\nits impact on downlink transmissions in an underlay cognitive radio scenario.\nWe consider primary and cognitive base stations, each equipped with multiple\nantennas and serving multiple users. Primary networks often suffer from the\ncognitive interference, which can be mitigated by deploying beamforming at the\ncognitive systems to spatially direct the transmissions away from the primary\nreceivers. The accuracy of the estimated channel state information (CSI) plays\nan important role in designing accurate beamformers that can regulate the\namount of interference. However, channel estimate is affected by interference.\nTherefore, we propose different channel estimation and pilot allocation\ntechniques to deal with the channel estimation at the cognitive systems, and to\nreduce the impact of contamination at the primary and cognitive systems. In an\neffort to tackle the contamination problem in primary and cognitive systems, we\nexploit the information embedded in the covariance matrices to successfully\nseparate the channel estimate from other users' channels in correlated\ncognitive single input multiple input (SIMO) channels.

The analyses of\ndata obtained with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the SOHO mission\nare therefore useful for the identification of solar surface magnetic features\nto be used in solar irradiance reconstruction models. However, there is still a\nneed for automated technologies that would enable the identification of solar\nactivity features from large databases.

In this paper, we study the challenges\nof cross-session throughput prediction, develop an accurate throughput\npredictor called DDA, and evaluate the performance of the predictor with\nreal-world datasets.

A\nmassive variant was likewise derived in the late 1960s by Freund, Maheshwari\nand Schonberg, and thought to be unique. How broad is universal coupling? In\nthe last decade four $1$-parameter families of massive spin-$2$ theories\n(contravariant, covariant, tetrad, and cotetrad of almost any density weights)\nhave been derived using universal coupling. The (co)tetrad derivations included\n2 of the 3 pure spin-$2$ theories due to de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolley; those\ntwo theories first appeared in the $2$-parameter Ogievetsky-Polubarinov family\n(1965), which developed the symmetric square root of the metric as a nonlinear\ngroup realization. One of the two theories was identified as pure spin-$2$ by\nMaheshwari in 1971-2, thus evading the Boulware-Deser-Tyutin-Fradkin ghost by\nthe time it was announced. Unlike the previous 4 families, this paper permits\n_nonlinear_ field redefinitions to build the effective metric.

One might have hoped to use universal coupling as a\ntie-breaking criterion for choosing among theories that are equally\nsatisfactory on more crucial grounds (such as lacking ghosts and having a\nsmooth massless limit).

The ability\nto generate greater force per power input would be highly desirable, but, as\ndemonstrated in this paper, such a device would be able to operate as a\nperpetual motion machine of the first kind. Since applying a constant force\nresults in a constant acceleration, the kinetic energy of a mass driven by such\na device increases quadratically with time, while the energy input increases\nonly linearly with time. Thus, at some point, the kinetic energy of the\ndevice-driven mass exceeds the energy input, and if this energy is collected\nvia decelerating the mass (via regenerative electromagnetic braking, for\nexample), then there would be a net gain in energy.
