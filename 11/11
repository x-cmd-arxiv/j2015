Research\non this topic has been driven by the \\v{C}ern\\'y conjecture, one of the oldest\nand most famous problems in automata theory, according to which a synchronizing\n$n$-state automaton has a reset word of length at most $(n-1)^2$. The\ntransitions of an automaton generate a transformation monoid on the set of\nstates, and so an automaton can be regarded as a transformation monoid with a\nprescribed set of generators. In this setting, an automaton is synchronizing if\nthe transitions generate a constant map. A permutation group $G$ on a set\n$\\Omega$ is said to synchronize a map $f$ if the monoid $\\langle G,f\\rangle$\ngenerated by $G$ and $f$ is synchronizing in the above sense; we say $G$ is\nsynchronizing if it synchronizes every non-permutation.\n  The classes of synchronizing groups and friends form an hierarchy of natural\nand elegant classes of groups lying strictly between the classes of primitive\nand $2$-homogeneous groups. These classes have been floating around for some\nyears and it is now time to provide a unified reference on them. The study of\nall these classes has been prompted by the \\v{C}ern\\'y conjecture, but it is of\nindependent interest since it involves a rich mix of group theory,\ncombinatorics, graph endomorphisms, semigroup theory, finite geometry, and\nrepresentation theory, and has interesting computational aspects as well. So as\nto make the paper self-contained, we have provided background material on these\ntopics. Our purpose here is to present results that show the connections\nbetween the various areas of mathematics mentioned above, we include a new\nresult on the \\v{C}ern\\'y conjecture, some challenges to finite geometers, some\nthoughts about infinite analogues, and a long list of open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 17:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-31"}

Di-hadron fragmentation functions can be extracted from\nsemi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data. They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation. At subleading twist, the same chiral-odd\ndi-hadron fragmentation function provides the cleanest access to the poorly\nknown twist-3 parton distribution $e(x)$, which is intimately related to the\nmechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When sensitive to\ndetails of transverse momentum dynamics of partons, the di-hadron fragmentation\nfunctions for a longitudinally polarized quark can be connected to the\nlongitudinal jet handedness to explore possible effects due to $CP-$violation\nof the QCD vacuum. In this review, we outline the formalism of di-hadron\nfragmentation functions, we discuss different observables where they appear and\nwe present measurements and future worldwide plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 18:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

However, the tribopolymer which forms due\nto the mechanical load to the surface contacts affects the conductivity between\nthe contacts dramatically. This is one of the challenging problems that prevent\nwidespread practical use of these otherwise promising devices. Here, we use\ndensity functional theory (DFT) to investigate the mechanisms of tribopolymer\nformation, including normal mechanical loading, the catalytic effect, as well\nas the electrochemical effect of the metal contacts. We select benzene select\nas the background gas, because it is one of the most common and severe\nhydrocarbon contaminants. Two adsorption cases are considered: one is benzene\non the reactive metal surface, Pt(111), and the other is benzene on the noble\nmetal, Au(111). We demonstrate that the formation of tribopolymer is induced\nboth by the mechanical load and by the catalytic effect of the contact. First,\nbenzene molecules are adsorbed on the Pt surfaces. Then, due to the closure of\nthe Pt contacts, stress is applied to the adsorbates, making the C-H bonds more\nfragile. As the stress increases further, H atoms are pressed close to the Pt\nsubstrate and begin to bond with Pt atoms. Thus Pt acts as a catalyst,\naccelerating the dehydrogenation process. When there is voltage applied across\nthe contacts, the catalytic effect is enhanced by electrochemistry. Finally,\ndue to the loss of H atoms, C atoms become more reactive and link together or\npile up to form tribopolymer. By understanding these mechanisms, we provide\nguidance on design strategies for suppressing tribopolymer formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 19:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 16:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

Multiple customers can be\nplaced for simultaneous service into one server, subject to general packing\nconstraints. Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately,\neither into an occupied server, as long as packing constraints are not\nviolated, or into an empty server. After service completion, each customer\nleaves its server and the system. The basic objective is to minimize the number\nof occupied servers in steady state. We study a Greedy-Random (GRAND) placement\n(packing) algorithm, introduced in [23]. This is a simple online algorithm,\nwhich places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the\nalready occupied servers that can still fit the customer, or one of the\nso-called zero-servers, which are empty servers designated to be available to\nnew arrivals. In [23], a version of the algorithm, labeled GRAND($aZ$), was\nconsidered, where the number of zero servers is $aZ$, with $Z$ being the\ncurrent total number of customers in the system, and $a>0$ being an algorithm\nparameter. GRAND($aZ$) was shown in [23] to be asymptotically optimal in the\nfollowing sense: (a) the steady-state optimality gap grows linearly in the\nsystem scale $r$ (the mean total number of customers in service), i.e. as $c(a)\nr$ for some $c(a)> 0$; and (b) $c(a) \\to 0$ as $a\\to 0$.

In this paper, we\npoint to an important effect that has been ignored or considered insignificant\nwhile interpreting these new high-frequency radio data, namely the\ncontamination due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect that changes the\nobserved synchrotron flux. Even though the radio relics reside in the cluster\noutskirts, the shock-driven pressure boost increases the SZ signal locally by\nroughly an order of magnitude. The resulting flux contamination for some\nwell-known relics are non-negligible already at 10 GHz, and at 30 GHz the\nobserved synchrotron fluxes can be diminished by a factor of several from their\ntrue values. Interferometric observations are not immune to this contamination,\nsince the change in the SZ signal occurs roughly at the same length scale as\nthe synchrotron emission, although there the flux loss is less severe than\nsingle-dish observations. We present a simple analytical approximation for the\nsynchrotron-to-SZ flux ratio, based on a theoretical radio relic model that\nconnects the non-thermal emission to the thermal gas properties, and show that\nby measuring this ratio one can potentially estimate the relic magnetic fields\nor the particle acceleration efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 18:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

Explicit and rather easy to use bounds on the remainder are given.\nPossible extensions to multi-index summation are suggested. Applications to\nsumming possibly divergent series are presented. It is shown that the Alt\nformula will in most cases outperform, or greatly outperform, the EM formula in\nterms of the execution time and memory use. One of the advantages of the Alt\ncalculations is that, in contrast with the EM ones, they can be almost\ncompletely parallelized. Illustrative examples are given. In one of the\nexamples, where an array of values of the Hurwitz generalized zeta function is\ncomputed with high accuracy, it is shown that both our implementation of the EM\nformula and, especially, the Alt formula perform much faster than the built-in\nMathematica command HurwitzZeta[].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 18:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 17:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 00:58:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 21:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 16:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 19:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Most state-of-the-art supervised hashing\napproaches employ batch-learners. Unfortunately, batch-learning strategies can\nbe inefficient when confronted with large training datasets. Moreover, with\nbatch-learners, it is unclear how to adapt the hash functions as a dataset\ncontinues to grow and diversify over time. Yet, in many practical scenarios the\ndataset grows and diversifies; thus, both the hash functions and the indexing\nmust swiftly accommodate these changes. To address these issues, we propose an\nonline hashing method that is amenable to changes and expansions of the\ndatasets. Since it is an online algorithm, our approach offers linear\ncomplexity with the dataset size. Our solution is supervised, in that we\nincorporate available label information to preserve the semantic neighborhood.\nSuch an adaptive hashing method is attractive; but it requires recomputing the\nhash table as the hash functions are updated. If the frequency of update is\nhigh, then recomputing the hash table entries may cause inefficiencies in the\nsystem, especially for large indexes. Thus, we also propose a framework to\nreduce hash table updates.

In\nour analysis we impose all available experimental and observational constraints\non sterile neutrinos and we further discuss the prospect of probing this\nscenario at low and high energy experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 17:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

We examine one widely discussed mechanism whereby the AGN\ninduces subsonic turbulence in the ambient medium, the dissipation of which\nprovides the ICM heat source. Through controlled inviscid 3-d hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we verify that explosive AGN-like events can launch gravity waves\n(g-modes) into the ambient ICM which in turn decay to volume-filling\nturbulence. In our model, however, this process is found to be inefficient,\nwith less than 1% of the energy injected by the AGN activity actually ending up\nin the turbulence of the ambient ICM. This efficiency is an order of magnitude\nor more too small to explain the observations of AGN-feedback in galaxy\nclusters and groups with short central cooling times. Atmospheres in which the\ng-modes are strongly trapped/confined have an even lower efficiency since, in\nthese models, excitation of turbulence relies on the g-modes' ability to escape\nfrom the center of the cluster into the bulk ICM.

High-resolution radio\ninterferometer imaging offers a promising method to identify a large and\nuniform sample of binary AGNs, because it probes a generic feature of nuclear\nactivity and is free from dust obscuration. Our previous search yielded 52\nstrong candidates of kpc-scale binaries over the 92 deg$^2$ of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 area with 2\"-resolution Very Large Array\n(VLA) images.

The host galaxy properties\nand the Eddington-scaled accretion rates broadly correlate with the excitation\nstate, similar to the general radio-AGN population at low redshifts. Our\nestimated binary AGN fraction indicates that simultaneous accretion occurs\n$>23^{+15}_{-8}$% of the time when a kpc-scale galaxy pair is detectable as a\nradio-AGN.

In this model, spatially segregated dynamically active\nsignaling cells of a common small radius $\\epsilon\\ll 1$ are coupled through a\npassive bulk diffusion field. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is\nused to construct steady-state solutions and to formulate a spectral problem\nthat characterizes the linear stability properties of these solutions, with the\naim of predicting whether temporal oscillations can be triggered by the\ncell-bulk coupling. Phase diagrams in parameter space where such collective\noscillations can occur are illustrated for two specific choices of the\nintracellular kinetics. In the limit of very large bulk diffusion, it is shown\nthat the ODE-PDE system can be approximated by a finite-dimensional dynamical\nsystem, which is studied both analytically and numerically. For one\nillustrative example of the theory it is shown that when the number of cells\nexceeds some critical number, the bulk diffusion field can trigger oscillations\nthat would otherwise not occur without the coupling.

This approach is thwarted by the failure of currently available\nEFFs in describing the size-dependent dimensionality and diverse geometries\nexhibited by Au clusters (e.g., planar, hollow cages, pyramids). Owing to their\nability to account for bond directionality, bond-order based EFFs, such as the\nTersoff-type Bond Order Potential (BOP), are well suited for such a\ndescription. Nevertheless, the predictive power of existing BOP parameters is\nseverely limited in the nm length scale owing to the predominance of bulk Au\nproperties used to train them.

We investigate a\nformation scenario of chondrules that involves planetesimal collisions and the\nresultant impact jetting. Planetesimal collisions are the main agent to\nregulate planetary accretion that corresponds to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets and cores of gas giants. The key component of this scenario is that\nejected materials can melt when the impact velocity between colliding\nplanetesimals exceeds about 2.5 km s$^{-1}$. The previous simulations show that\nthe process is efficient enough to reproduce the primordial abundance of\nchondrules. We examine this scenario carefully by performing semi-analytical\ncalculations that are developed based on the results of direct $N$-body\nsimulations. As found by the previous work, we confirm that planetesimal\ncollisions that occur during planetary accretion can play an important role in\nforming chondrules. This arises because protoplanet-planetesimal collisions can\nachieve the impact velocity of about 2.5 km s$^{-1}$ or higher, as protoplanets\napproach the isolation mass ($M_{p,iso}$). Assuming that the ejected mass is a\nfraction ($F_{ch}$) of colliding planetesimals' mass, we show that the\nresultant abundance of chondrules is formulated well by $F_{ch}M_{p,iso}$, as\nlong as the formation of protoplanets is completed within a given disk\nlifetime. We perform a parameter study and examine how the abundance of\nchondrules and their formation timing change.

The approach predicts candidate global minimizers, with a\nrecovery guarantee, that are sometimes exact, and often within a few percent of\nthe optimum energy (under appropriate normalization of the energy). The\nprocedure relies on a convex relaxation of the pairwise energy that exploits\ntranslational symmetry, followed by a recovery procedure that minimizes a\nrelative entropy. Numerical discretizations of the convex relaxation yield a\nlinear programming problem over convex cones that can be solved using\nwell-known methods. One advantage of the approach is that it provides\nsufficient conditions for global minimizers to a non-convex quadratic\nvariational problem, in the form of a linear, convex, optimization problem for\nthe auto-correlation of the probability density. We demonstrate the approach in\na periodic domain for examples arising from models in materials, social\nphenomena and flocking.

Our model relates these series to minimal unitary models of the\nVirasoro and superVirasoro algebra and is based on $SL(2, {\\bf C})$\nChern-Simons theory in Euclidean space or $SL(2,{\\bf R})\\times SL(2,{\\bf R})$\nChern-Simons theory in Minkowski space. This theory, which has also been\nproposed as a soluble model for 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity, and its N=1\nsupersymmetric cousin, provide effective descriptions of FQHE. The principal\nseries corresponds to quantized levels for the two $SL(2,{\\bf R})$'s such that\nthe diagonal $SL(2,{\\bf R})$ has level $ 1$.

We also turn our attention to the erroneous use of a pre-optimization\nlower bound in the original algorithm and give an example to confirm its usage\nis incorrect. In order to provide numerical results on correct solutions, we\nuse planar equilateral points to quickly compute this lower bound, even in\ndimensions higher than two. Finally, we describe planar twin trees, identical\ntrees yielded by different topologies, whose generalization to higher\ndimensions could open a new way of building Steiner trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 07:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 07:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2017 10:56:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 11:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

A framework is proposed to deal with the nonzero\nreconfiguration delay. The proposed approach constructs an adaptive variant of\nany given scheduling policy. It is shown that if a scheduling policy guarantees\nits schedules to have schedule weights close to the MaxWeight schedule (and\nthus is throughput optimal in the zero reconfiguration regime), then the\nthroughput optimality is inherited by its adaptive variant (in any nonzero\nreconfiguration delay regime). As a corollary, a class of adaptive variants of\nthe well known MaxWeight policy is shown to achieve throughput optimality\nwithout prior knowledge of the traffic load. Further- more, through numerical\nsimulations, the simplest such policy, namely the Adaptive MaxWeight (AMW), is\nshown to exhibit better delay performance than all prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 08:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

A systematic investigation of the near-infrared (NIR), 2MASS JHKs,\nphotometry for the group of CP stars has never been performed. Nowadays, there\nis a great deal of data available in the NIR that reach very large distances.\nIt is therefore very important for CP stars to be unambiguously detected in the\nNIR region and for these detections to be used to derive astrophysical\nparameters (age and mass) by applying isochrone fitting. Furthermore, we\ninvestigated whether the CP stars behave in a different way to normal-type\nstars in the various photometric diagrams. For our analysis, we carefully\ncompiled a sample of CP and apparently normal (non-peculiar) type stars. Only\nstars for which high-quality (i.e. with low error levels), astrometric, and\nphotometric data are available were chosen. In total, 639 normal and 622 CP\nstars were selected and further analysed. All stars were dereddened and\ncalibrated in terms of the effective temperature and absolute magnitude\n(luminosity). Finally, isochrone fitting was applied. No differences in the\nastrophysical parameters derived from 2MASS and Johnson UBV photometry were\nfound. Furthermore, no statistical significant deviations from the normal type\nstars within several colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams were\ndiscovered. Therefore, it is not possible to detect new CP stars with the help\nof the photometric 2MASS colours only. A new effective temperature calibration,\nvalid for all CP stars, using the (V-Ks)0 colour was derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 09:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

For this reason, the\nchemistry of extremely metal-poor stars closely reflects the nucleosynthetic\nyields of supernovae from massive Population III stars. Here we collate\ndetailed abundances of 53 extremely metal-poor stars from the literature and\ninfer the masses of their Population III progenitors.

The reality of\npossible paths in the principle of least action is examined from the\nperspectives of the contemporary metaphysics of modality and Leibniz's concept\nof essences or possibles striving for existence. I elaborate a modal\ninterpretation of the principle of least action that replaces a classical\nrepresentation of a system's motion along a single history in the actual\nmodality by simultaneous motions along an infinite set of all possible\nhistories in the possible modality. This model is based on an intuition that\ndeep ontological connections exist between the possible paths in the principle\nof least action and possible quantum histories in the Feynman path integral. I\ninterpret the action as a physical measure of the essence of every possible\nhistory. Therefore only one actual history has the highest degree of the\nessence and minimal action. To address the issue of necessity, I assume that\nthe principle of least action has a general physical necessity and lies between\nthe laws of motion with a limited physical necessity and certain laws with a\nmetaphysical necessity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 09:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 19:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-28"}

Strong dust settling and missing disk\nflaring have similar effects on continuum observations, but opposite effects on\nfar-IR gas emission lines.

The remaining chapters discuss star formation over a\nvariety of scales, starting with the galactic scale and working down to the\nscales of individual stars and their disks. The book concludes with a brief\ndiscussion of the clearing of disks and the transition to planet formation.

In this work, the VAR is restricted by a scheme that modifies the\nrecently developed method of backward-in-time selection (BTS) of the lagged\nvariables and the CGCI is combined with BTS.

Incorporating temporal structure with deep\nConvNets for video representation becomes a fundamental problem for video\ncontent analysis. In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely Hierarchical\nRecurrent Neural Encoder (HRNE), to exploit temporal information of videos.\nCompared to recent video representation inference approaches, this paper makes\nthe following three contributions. First, our HRNE is able to efficiently\nexploit video temporal structure in a longer range by reducing the length of\ninput information flow, and compositing multiple consecutive inputs at a higher\nlevel. Second, computation operations are significantly lessened while\nattaining more non-linearity. Third, HRNE is able to uncover temporal\ntransitions between frame chunks with different granularities, i.e., it can\nmodel the temporal transitions between frames as well as the transitions\nbetween segments. We apply the new method to video captioning where temporal\ninformation plays a crucial role. Experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art on video captioning benchmarks. Notably, even\nusing a single network with only RGB stream as input, HRNE beats all the recent\nsystems which combine multiple inputs, such as RGB ConvNet plus 3D ConvNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 12:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

It is found that all HJs exhibit a brittle behaviour\nexcept the one with {\\alpha}-GY, which however shows a hardening process due to\nthe formation of triple carbon rings. Such hardening process has greatly\ndeferred the failure of the structure.

By varying the\nlocations of graphene (either in the middle or at the two ends of the HJs),\nsimilar mechanical properties have been obtained, suggesting insignificant\nimpacts from location of graphene allotropes.

Such wide vortices can excite strong\ndensity waves in the disc and therefore migrate inwards rapidly. However, when\ndisc self-gravity is also considered in simulations, self-gravity plays a more\nprominent role on the vortex structure. We confirm that when the disc Toomre Q\nparameter is smaller than pi/(2h), where h is the disc's aspect ratio, the\nvortices are significantly weakened and their inward migration slows down\ndramatically. Most importantly, when the disc is massive enough (e.g. Q~3), we\nfind that the lopsided gas structure orbits around the star at a speed\nsignificantly slower than the local Keplerian speed. This sub-Keplerian pattern\nspeed can lead to the concentration of dust particles at a radius beyond the\nlopsided gas structure (as shown in Paper II).

We obtain maximum shift angles of about 25 degrees. Gas self-gravity\naccentuates the concentration differences between small and large grains. At\nlow to moderate disc masses, the larger the grains, the farther they are\ntrapped ahead of the vortex. Shift angles up to 90 degrees are reached for 10\ncm-sized grains, and we show that such large offsets can produce a\ndouble-peaked continuum emission observable at mm/cm wavelengths. This\nbehaviour comes about because the large grains undergo horseshoe U-turns\nrelative to the vortex due to the vortex's gravity. At large disc masses, since\nthe vortex's pattern frequency becomes increasingly slower than Keplerian,\nsmall grains concentrate slightly beyond the vortex and large grains form\ngenerally non-axisymmetric ring-like structures around the vortex's radial\nlocation. Gas self-gravity therefore imparts distinct trapping locations for\nsmall and large dust grains which may be probed by current and future\nobservations, and which suggest that the formation of planetesimals in vortices\nmight be more difficult than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 13:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The consideration is confined to finite\nsystems of categorical random variables, which allows us to focus on the basics\nof the theory without using full-scale measure-theoretic language.\nContextuality-by-Default is a theory of random variables identified by their\ncontents and their contexts, so that two variables have a joint distribution if\nand only if they share a context. Intuitively, the content of a random variable\nis the entity the random variable measures or responds to, while the context is\nformed by the conditions under which these measurements or responses are\nobtained. A system of random variables consists of stochastically unrelated\n\"bunches,\" each of which is a set of jointly distributed random variables\nsharing a context. The variables that have the same content in different\ncontexts form \"connections\" between the bunches. A probabilistic coupling of\nthis system is a set of random variables obtained by imposing a joint\ndistribution on the stochastically unrelated bunches. A system is considered\nnoncontextual or contextual according to whether it can or cannot be coupled so\nthat the joint distributions imposed on its connections possess a certain\nproperty (in the present version of the theory, \"maximality\"). We present a\ncriterion of contextuality for a special class of systems of random variables,\ncalled cyclic systems. We also introduce a general measure of contextuality\nthat makes use of (quasi-)couplings whose distributions may involve negative\nnumbers or numbers greater than 1 in place of probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 14:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 21:35:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 23:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 01:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 01:27:29 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 07:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-30"}

These St\\\"uckelbergs\nact as qubits that account for a certain fraction of quantum information. Their\ninformation capacity is measured by the ratio of the inverse St\\\"uckelberg\nenergy gap to the size of the system. Systems with the smallest gap are\nmaximally holographic. For massless gauge systems this information measure is\nuniversally equal to the inverse coupling evaluated at the systems' length\nscale. In this language it becomes very transparent why the St\\\"uckelberg\ninformation capacity of black holes saturates the Bekenstein bound and accounts\nfor the entire information of the system. The physical reason is that the\nstrength of quantum interaction is bounded from below by the gravitational\ncoupling, which scales as area. Observing the striking similarity between the\nscalings of the energy gap of the boundary St\\\"uckelberg modes and the\nBogoliubov modes of critical many-body systems, we establish a connection\nbetween holography and quantum criticality through the correspondence between\nthese modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 15:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

For this problem,\nultra-wideband (UWB) technology can provide the most accurate range estimates,\nwhich are required for range-based positioning. However, UWB still faces a\nproblem with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) measurements, in which the range\nestimates based on time-of-arrival (TOA) will typically be positively biased.\nThere are many techniques that address this problem, mainly based on NLOS\nidentification and NLOS error mitigation algorithms. However, these techniques\ndo not exploit all available information in the UWB channel impulse response.\nKernel-based machine learning methods, such as Gaussian Process Regression\n(GPR), are able to make use of all information, but they may be too complex in\ntheir original form. In this paper, we propose novel ranging methods based on\nkernel principal component analysis (kPCA), in which the selected channel\nparameters are projected onto a nonlinear orthogonal high-dimensional space,\nand a subset of these projections is then used as an input for ranging. We\nevaluate the proposed methods using real UWB measurements obtained in a\nbasement tunnel, and found that one of the proposed methods is able to\noutperform state-of-the-art, even if little training samples are available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 16:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

Typically, ePDEs must be solved\nnumerically, which sets an ever growing demand for efficient and highly\nparallel algorithms to tackle their computational solution. The Scheduled\nRelaxation Jacobi (SRJ) is a promising class of methods, atypical for combining\nsimplicity and efficiency, that has been recently introduced for solving linear\nPoisson-like ePDEs. The SRJ methodology relies on computing the appropriate\nparameters of a multilevel approach with the goal of minimizing the number of\niterations needed to cut down the residuals below specified tolerances. The\nefficiency in the reduction of the residual increases with the number of levels\nemployed in the algorithm. Applying the original methodology to compute the\nalgorithm parameters with more than 5 levels notably hinders obtaining optimal\nSRJ schemes, as the mixed (non-linear) algebraic-differential equations from\nwhich they result become notably stiff. Here we present a new methodology for\nobtaining the parameters of SRJ schemes that overcomes the limitations of the\noriginal algorithm and provide parameters for SRJ schemes with up to 15 levels\nand resolutions of up to $2^{15}$ points per dimension, allowing for\nacceleration factors larger than several hundreds with respect to the Jacobi\nmethod for typical resolutions and, in some high resolution cases, close to\n1000. Furthermore, we extend the original algorithm to apply it to certain\nsystems of non-linear ePDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 08:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
