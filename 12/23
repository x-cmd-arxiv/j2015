It is generally known that fitness functions play\na key role in developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms. The\nmonotonicity of fitness functions can guarantee the validity of heuristic\nattribute reduction algorithms. In probabilistic rough set model, distribution\nreducts can ensure the decision rules derived from the reducts are compatible\nwith those derived from the original decision table. However, there are few\nstudies on developing heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for finding\ndistribution reducts.

In our\nattempts to solve this mystery we have first tried to define reasonable limits\nto the positrons produced in our own galaxy by nuclear interactions of cosmic\nrays. This is best done by using the secondary B/C ratio produced by these same\ncosmic rays in order to define the amount of matter traversed by galactic\ncosmic ray nuclei. Using new values of the B/C ratio together with earlier\ncalculations of positron production by Moskalenko and Strong, 1998, we find\nthat at 10 GeV this galactic production is from 70% to almost 100% of the\npositrons observed by the above experiments. At 100 GeV these fractions are\nstill from 20 to 33% of the positrons observed.

If these positrons are coming to\nus from a uniform source distribution in and beyond the disk of the galaxy with\na source spectrum that is E-2.0, a spectral steepening caused by synchrotron\nand inverse Compton losses, which are largest near the galactic plane, will\nproduce a spectrum E-2.75 at the Earth.

In the present paper, we investigate if time-dependent semiclassical\ninitial value methods, with propagators expressed as integrals over phase space\nusing classical trajectories, is suitable to describe interacting bosons,\nconcentrating on a single mode. Despite the nonlinear contribution from the\nself-interaction, the corresponding classical dynamics allows for a largely\nanalytical treatment of the semiclassical propagator. We find that the\nHerman-Kluk (HK) propagator conserves unitarity in the semiclassical limit\n($n\\to\\infty$), but a decay of the norm is seen for low $n$. The frozen\nGaussian approximation (FGA, i.e. HK with unit prefactor) is explicitly shown\nto violate unitarity in the present system for non-vanishing interaction\nstrength, even in the semiclassical limit. Furthermore, we show by evaluating\nthe phase space integral in steepest descent approximation, that the HK\npropagator reproduces the exact spectrum correctly in the limit $n\\to \\infty$.\nAn error is, however, incurred in next-to-next-to-leading order (small\nparameter $1/n$), as seen upon numerical evaluation of the integral or by\nconsidering finite $n$ corrections to steepest descent. The FGA, in contrast,\nis only accurate to lowest order, and an erroneous next-to-leading order term\nin the energy spectrum was found analytically. Finally, as an example\napplication, we study the dynamics of wave packets by computing the time\nevolution of the Wigner function. While the often-used truncated Wigner\napproximation cannot capture any interferences present in the exact quantum\nmechanical solution (known analytically), we find that the HK approach, despite\nalso using classical information only, reproduces the salient features of the\nexact solution correctly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 18:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 15:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-14"}

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water\ndistribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and\nouter relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water\nabundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K. Assuming a canonical gas-to-dust ratio\nof 100, as well as coupled gas and dust temperatures $T_{\\rm gas}=T_{\\rm\ndust}$, the best-fit inner water abundances become implausibly high (0.01-1.0\n${\\rm H_{2}}^{-1}$).

This\nis experiment, E-989, is located at Fermilab and will measure the spin\nprecession rate of positive muons in a 14-m diameter storage ring using decay\npositrons. The goal of the experiment is to reduce the current experimental\nuncertainty by a factor of three. The experiment is currently being constructed\nand aims to start taking data in 2017. An alternative, and very complementary,\nexperiment is being planned at J-PARC in Japan. This experiment, E-34, will\nutilize low energy, ultra-cold muons in a much smaller storage ring. This\nexperiment aims for a similar precision to the Fermilab experiment and aims to\nbegin data taking on a similar timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 19:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

We argue that those\nperturbative coefficient functions can, {\\it a priori}, acquire quite different\nyet Lorentz-invariant forms in various frames. This somewhat surprising\ndifference can be traced back to a general dependence of the perturbative\ncoefficient functions on lightcone vectors which are introduced by the twist-3\nfactorization formulae and which are frame-dependent. One can remove this\nspurious frame dependence by invoking so-called Lorentz invariance relations\n(LIRs) between twist-3 parton correlation functions. Some of those relations\nfor twist-3 distribution functions were discussed in the literature before. In\nthis paper we derive the corresponding LIRs for twist-3 fragmentation\nfunctions. We explicitly demonstrate that these LIRs remove the lightcone\nvector dependence by considering transverse spin observables in the\nsingle-inclusive production of hadrons in lepton-nucleon collisions, $\\ell N\\to\nhX$. With the LIRs in hand, we also show that twist-3 observables in general\ncan be written solely in terms of three-parton correlation functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 20:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 11:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In each\ncase, we show how to construct a multi-spinon basis of the chiral CFT spectra.\nThe multi-spinon states are labelled by a collection $\\{ n_j \\}$ of (discrete)\nmomenta. The state-content for given choice of $\\{ n_j \\}$ is determined\nthrough a generalised exclusion principle, similar to Haldane's `motif' rules\nfor the $SU(n)_1$ theories. In the simplest case, which is the ${\\cal N}=2$\nsuperconformal theory with central charge $c=1$, we develop an algebraic\nframework similar to the Yangian symmetry of the $SU(2)_1$ theory.

Among the pairwise configurations in these\ncontexts, the demand-technological capabilities (C-E) provided the strongest\nlink, followed by the supply-demand (D-C) and the supply-technological\ncapabilities (D-E) channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 20:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 13:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-17"}

The\nsocial signal for a product is given by its current market share raised to\npower r (or equivalently the number of purchases raised to the power of r). The\npaper shows that, when r is strictly between 0 and 1, and a static position\nassignment (e.g., a quality ranking) is used, the market converges to a unique\nequilibrium where the market shares depend only on product quality, not their\ninitial appeals or the early dynamics. When r is greater than 1, the market\nbecomes unpredictable. In many cases, the market goes to a monopoly for some\nproduct: Which product becomes a monopoly depends on the initial conditions of\nthe market. These theoretical results are complemented by an agent-based\nsimulation which indicates that convergence is fast when r is between 0 and 1,\nand that the quality ranking dominates the well-known popularity ranking in\nterms of market efficiency. These results shed a new light on the role of\nsocial influence which is often blamed for unpredictability, inequalities, and\ninefficiencies in markets. In contrast, this paper shows that, with a proper\nsocial signal and position assignment for the products, the market becomes\npredictable, and inequalities and inefficiencies can be controlled\nappropriately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 20:59:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 13:47:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2017 01:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 04:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}

In this situation currency fluctuations clearly introduce a\nsource of risk on CDS spreads. For emerging markets, but in some cases even in\nwell developed markets, the risk of dramatic Foreign Exchange (FX) rate\ndevaluation in conjunction with default events is relevant. We address this\nissue by proposing and implementing a model that considers the risk of foreign\ncurrency devaluation that is synchronous with default of the reference entity.\n  Preliminary results indicate that perceived risks of devaluation can induce a\nsignificant basis across domestic and foreign CDS quotes. For the Republic of\nItaly, a USD CDS spread quote of 440 bps can translate into a EUR quote of 350\nbps in the middle of the Euro-debt crisis in the first week of May 2012. More\nrecently, from June 2013, the basis spreads between the EUR quotes and the USD\nquotes are in the range around 40 bps.\n  We explain in detail the sources for such discrepancies. Our modeling\napproach is based on the reduced form framework for credit risk, where the\ndefault time is modeled in a Cox process setting with explicit diffusion\ndynamics for default intensity/hazard rate and exponential jump to default. For\nthe FX part, we include an explicit default-driven jump in the FX dynamics. As\nour results show, such a mechanism provides a further and more effective way to\nmodel credit / FX dependency than the instantaneous correlation that can be\nimposed among the driving Brownian motions of default intensity and FX rates,\nas it is not possible to explain the observed basis spreads during the\nEuro-debt crisis by using the latter mechanism alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 21:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2018 15:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

In this way we identify more than 60000 M dwarfs, which is\nby far the largest sample of low-mass stars observed in a transit survey to\ndate. We present several planet candidates around M dwarfs and hotter stars\nthat are currently being followed up. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we\ncalculate the detection efficiency of the Pan-Planets survey for different\nstellar and planetary populations. We expect to find $3.0^{+3.3}_{-1.6}$ hot\nJupiters around F, G, and K dwarfs with periods lower than 10 days based on the\nplanet occurrence rates derived in previous surveys. For M dwarfs, the\npercentage of stars with a hot Jupiter is under debate. Theoretical models\nexpect a lower occurrence rate than for larger main sequence stars. However,\nradial velocity surveys find upper limits of about 1\\% due to their small\nsample, while the Kepler survey finds a occurrence rate that we estimate to be\nat least $0.17(^{+0.67}_{-0.04})$%, making it even higher than the determined\nfraction from OGLE-III for F, G and K stellar types,\n$0.14(^{+0.15}_{-0.076})\\%$.

Our primary interest is when there are\npossibly millions of data points referenced over different variables,\ngeographic regions, and times. This problem requires extensive methodological\nadvancements, as jointly modeling correlated data of this size leads to the\nso-called \"big n problem.\" The computational complexity of prediction in this\nsetting is further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are\nnaturally non-Gaussian. Thus, we develop a new computationally efficient\ndistribution theory for this setting. In particular, we introduce a\nmultivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial theoretical\ndevelopment including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal\ndistributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal\ndistribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To\nincorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a\nmultivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. The results in\nthis manuscript are extremely general, and can be used for data that exhibit\nfewer sources of dependency than what we consider (e.g., multivariate,\nspatial-only, or spatio-temporal-only data). Hence, the implications of our\nmodeling framework may have a large impact on the general problem of jointly\nmodeling correlated count-valued data.

In establishing the result, several different ranges\nof $N_c$ need to be considered separately. The lower and upper bounds for these\nranges of $N_c$ are derived, and are shown to be tight. The achievability\ntechniques developed rely on a variety of signaling, beamforming, and alignment\ntechniques which vary according to the (relative) number of antennas at each\nterminal and whether the s.d.o.f. is integer valued. Specifically, it is shown\nthat, whenever the s.d.o.f. is integer valued, Gaussian signaling for both\ntransmission and cooperative jamming, linear precoding at the transmitter and\nthe cooperative jammer, and linear processing at the legitimate receiver, are\nsufficient for achieving the s.d.o.f. of the channel. By contrast, when the\ns.d.o.f. is not an integer, the achievable schemes need to rely on structured\nsignaling at the transmitter and the cooperative jammer, and joint signal space\nand signal scale alignment. The converse is established by combining an upper\nbound which allows for full cooperation between the transmitter and the\ncooperative jammer, with another upper bound which exploits the secrecy and\nreliability constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 22:40:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

Aliasing takes the\nform of a sum over images, each of them corresponding to the Fourier content\ndisplaced by increasing multiples of the sampling frequency of the grid. These\nspurious contributions limit the accuracy in the estimation of Fourier-space\nstatistics, and are typically ameliorated by simultaneously increasing grid\nsize and discarding high-frequency modes.

Each task can\nparticipate in a phaser as a signaler, a waiter, or both. The participants in a\nphaser may change over time as dynamic tasks are added and deleted. In this\nposter, we present a highly concurrent and scalable design of phasers for a\ndistributed memory environment that is suitable for use with asynchronous\npartitioned global address space programming models. Our design for a\ndistributed phaser employs a pair of skip lists augmented with the ability to\ncollect and propagate synchronization signals. To enable a high degree of\nconcurrency, addition and deletion of participant tasks are performed in two\nphases: a \"fast single-link-modify\" step followed by multiple hand-overhand\n\"lazy multi-link-modify\" steps. We show that the cost of synchronization and\nstructural operations on a distributed phaser scales logarithmically, even in\nthe presence of concurrent structural modifications. To verify the correctness\nof our design for distributed phasers, we employ the SPIN model checker. To\naddress this issue of state space explosion, we describe how we decompose the\nstate space to separately verify correct handling for different kinds of\nmessages, which enables complete model checking of our phaser design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 23:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 22:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

Electromotive force was\nfor the most part measured in units of the predominant Daniell cell. Each\ncompany had their own resistance standard. In 1862 the British Association for\nthe Advancement of Science formed a committee to address this situation. By\n1873 they had given definition to the electromagnetic system of units (emu) and\ndefined the practical units of the ohm as ${10}^9$ emu units of resistance and\nthe volt as ${10}^8$ emu units of electromotive force. These recommendations\nwere ratified and expanded upon in a series of international congresses held\nbetween 1881 and 1904. A proposal by Giovanni Giorgi in 1901 took advantage of\na coincidence between the conversion of the units of energy in the emu system\n(the erg) and in the practical system (the joule) in that the same conversion\nfactor existed between the cgs based emu system and a theretofore undefined MKS\nsystem. By introducing another unit, X (where X could be any of the practical\nelectrical units), Giorgi demonstrated that a self consistent MKSX system was\ntenable without the need for multiplying factors. Ultimately the ampere was\nselected as the fourth unit. It took nearly 60 years, but in 1960 Giorgi's\nproposal was incorporated as the core of the newly inaugurated International\nSystem of Units (SI). This article surveys the physics, physicists and events\nthat contributed to those developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 23:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

Here we study the behavior of groups of uninformed\nindividuals subject to the departure and stop of a trained conspecific within\nsmall-sized groups. We find that the groups reach an effective consensus:\neither all uninformed individuals follow the trained one (and collective motion\noccurs) or none does it.

A further anticipated benefit is\nthat such spectrographs would be free of `modal noise', a phenomenon that\noccurs in high-resolution multimode fibre-fed spectrographs due to the coherent\nnature of the telescope point-spread-function (PSF). We address these aspects\nby integrating a multicore fibre photonic lantern with an ultrafast laser\ninscribed three-dimensional waveguide interconnect to spatially reformat the\nmodes within the PSF into a diffraction-limited pseudo-slit.

However, the existing\nheuristics provide imbalance coverage of the targets--some targets are covered\n$k$ times while others are left totally uncovered or singly covered. The\ncoverage imbalance is more serious in under-provisioned networks where there do\nnot exist enough sensors to cover all the targets $k$ times.

Due to the dramatic growth of\nvolume and complexity of data, several new challenges have emerged and cannot\nbe effectively addressed by existing LVMs: (1) How to capture long-tail\npatterns that carry crucial information when the popularity of patterns is\ndistributed in a power-law fashion? (2) How to reduce model complexity and\ncomputational cost without compromising the modeling power of LVMs? (3) How to\nimprove the interpretability and reduce the redundancy of discovered patterns?\nTo addresses the three challenges discussed above, we develop a novel\nregularization technique for LVMs, which controls the geometry of the latent\nspace during learning to enable the learned latent components of LVMs to be\ndiverse in the sense that they are favored to be mutually different from each\nother, to accomplish long-tail coverage, low redundancy, and better\ninterpretability.

The fair value of the swap is obtained\nby applying to swap's net cash flows a discount rate switching to\ncounterparty's bond curve if the swap is a local asset or one's own curve if a\nliability, and the total valuation adjustment is the present value of cost of\nfunding the risk-free price discounted at the same switching rate. FVA is\nredefined as a liquidity or funding basis component of total valuation\nadjustment, coherent with CVA, the default risk component. A Longstaff-Schwartz\nstyle least-square regression and simulation is introduced to compute the\nrecursive fair value and adjustments. A separately developed finite difference\nscheme is used to test and find regression necessary to decouple the discount\nrate switch. Preliminary results show the impact of counterparty risk to swap\nhedge ratios, swap bid/ask spreads, and valuation adjustments, and considerable\nerrors of calculating CVA by discounting cash flow or potential future\nexposure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 02:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Two types of double-shell BPNTs, which are\nobtained by curling the rectangular SLBP along its armchair/pucker direction\nand zigzag direction (in-plane normal) respectively, are involved in\nsimulation. At finite temperature, a bond on the outer shell of tube is under\ntension due to both of curvature of tube and serious thermal vibration of\natoms. As the length of a bond with such elongation approaches its critical\nvalue, i.e., 0.279 nm, or the smallest distance between two nonbonding\nphosphorus atoms is over 0.389nm caused by great variation of bond angle, the\ntube fails quickly. The critical stable states of either an armchair or a\nzigzag BPNT at finite temperature are calculated and compared. To achieve a\nstable BPNT with high robustness, the curvature of the tube should be reduced\nor the tube should work at a lower temperature.

The first strategy\ndetermines voltage scales for each processor after scheduling (Static DVS),\nwhich ensures all tasks meet the timing requirements on synchronization.

The combination of frequency pre-allocation and\ntask-splitting makes it possible to maximize energy savings with DVS.\nSimulation results show that it is possible to achieve significant energy\nsavings with DVS while preserving the schedulability requirements of real-time\nschedulers for multi-core processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 04:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

This\naccidental Dirac semimetal state mediates the topological quantum phase\ntransition between the two distinct weak and strong topological insulator\nphases in HfTe5. Our work not only provides the first evidence of a\ntemperature-induced critical topological phase transition in HfTe5, but also\ngives a reasonable explanation on the long-lasting question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 05:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

Recently, it has been pointed out that the presence of the\nvan Hove singularities (vHs) around the Fermi level is crucial. However, while\nthere have been quantitative estimates of Tc based on the Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory, the energy dependence of the density of states (DOS) has been neglected\nto simplify the Eliashberg equation. In this study, we go beyond the constant\nDOS approximation and explicitly consider the electronic structure over 40eV\naround the Fermi level. In contrast with the previous conventional\ncalculations, this approach with a sufficiently large number of Matsubara\nfrequencies enables us to calculate Tc without introducing the empirical pseudo\nCoulomb potential. We show that while H3S has much higher Tc than H2S for which\nthe vHs is absent, the constant DOS approximation employed so far seriously\noverestimates (underestimates) Tc by ~ 60K (~ 10K) for H3S (H2S). We then\ndiscuss the impact of the strong electron-phonon coupling on the electronic\nstructure with and without the vHs and how it affects the superconductivity.\nEspecially, we focus on (1) the feedback effect in the self-consistent\ncalculation of the self-energy, (2) the effect of the energy shift due to the\nzero-point motion, and (3) the effect of the changes in the phonon frequencies\ndue to strong anharmonicity. We show that the effect of (1)-(3) on Tc is about\n10-30K for both H3S and H2S. Eventually, Tc is estimated to be 181K for H3S at\n250GPa and 34K for H2S at 140GPa, which explains the pressure dependence of Tc\nobserved in the experiment. In addition, we evaluate the lowest order vertex\ncorrection beyond the Migdal-Eliashberg theory and discuss the validity of the\nMigdal approximation for sulfur hydrides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 06:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 08:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 06:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

Similar results are found for the locally estimated Hurst exponent for\nthe high-frequency fluctuations, and it is therefore natural to interpret these\nfindings as so-called \"critical slowing down\" signatures, i.e. early-warning\nsigns of tipping points. The observed \"slowing down\" is found to be similar\n(and perhaps even stronger) in the Younger Dryas, suggesting that there are\nsome similarities between mechanisms of the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition\nand the onsets of the Greenland interstadials.

It is commonly believed that the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) in our universe are fully ionized today, however the reionizing\nprocess remains to be mysterious. A simple instantaneous reionization process\nis usually adopted in modern cosmology without direct observational evidence.\nHowever, the history of ionization fraction, $x_e(z)$ will influence cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) observables and constraints on optical depth $\\tau$.\nWith the mocked future data sets based on featured reionization model, we find\nthe bias on $\\tau$ introduced by instantaneous model can not be neglected. In\nthis paper, we study the cosmic reionization history in a model independent\nway, the so called principle component analysis (PCA) method, and reconstruct\n$x_e (z)$ at different redshift $z$ with the data sets of Planck, WMAP 9 years\ntemperature and polarization power spectra, combining with the baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) from galaxy survey and type Ia supernovae (SN) Union 2.1\nsample respectively. The results show that reconstructed $x_e(z)$ is consistent\nwith instantaneous behavior, however, there exists slight deviation from this\nbehavior at some epoch. With PCA method, after abandoning the noisy modes, we\nget stronger constraints, and the hints for featured $x_e(z)$ evolution could\nbecome a little more obvious.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 08:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Tsirelson (1980) proved that Bell states, shared among two\nparties, when measured suitably, achieve the maximum non-local correlations\nallowed by quantum mechanics. Conversely, Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013)\nshowed that observing the maximal correlation value over a sequence of repeated\nmeasurements, implies that the underlying quantum state is close to a tensor\nproduct of maximally entangled states and, moreover, that it is measured\naccording to an ideal strategy. However, this strong rigidity result comes at a\nhigh price, requiring a large number of entangled pairs to be tested. In this\npaper, we present a significant improvement in terms of the overhead by instead\nconsidering quantum steering where the device of the one side is trusted. We\nfirst demonstrate a robust one-sided device-independent version of\nself-testing, which characterises the shared state and measurement operators of\ntwo parties up to a certain bound. We show that this bound is optimal up to\nconstant factors and we generalise the results for the most general attacks.\nThis leads us to a rigidity theorem for maximal steering correlations. As a key\napplication we give a one-sided device-independent protocol for verifiable\ndelegated quantum computation, and compare it to other existing protocols, to\nhighlight the cost of trust assumptions. Finally, we show that under reasonable\nassumptions, the states shared in order to run a certain type of verification\nprotocol must be unitarily equivalent to perfect Bell states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 09:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 17:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 09:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2017 13:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

The minimum energy\ncondition leads to a representation of the mass and radius of the charged\nobjects with minimum mass/radius ratio in terms of the charge and vacuum energy\nonly. As applied to the electron in the four-dimensional case, this procedure\nallows one to re-obtain the classical electron radius from purely general\nrelativistic considerations.

Evaluating this limit numerically,\nwe obtain again the correct order of magnitude value for the charge/mass ratio\nof the electron, as required by the stability conditions. This suggests that,\nif the electron were either less massive (with the same charge) or if its\ncharge were any higher (for fixed mass), a combination of electrostatic and\ndark energy repulsion would destabilize the Compton radius.

The medium is transparent, which\nallows for the direct visualization of the invasion pattern during flow, and is\ninitially saturated with a viscous liquid (a dyed glycerol-water mix). As the\npressure in the liquid is gradually reduced, air penetrates from an open inlet,\ndisplacing the liquid which leaves the system from an outlet on the opposite\nside.

It is known since long that in this case an\nambiguity arises: there are several ways of writing down diffusion equations\ncontaining space dependence within their parameters. These ways are all\npotentially valid but not equivalent, meaning that the different diffusion\nequations yield different solutions for the same data. The ambiguity can only\nbe resolved at the microscopic level: a model for the stochastic dynamics of\nthe individual molecules must be provided, and a well-defined diffusion\nequation then arises as the long-wavelength limit of this dynamics. In this\nwork we introduce and employ the integro-differential Master Equation (ME) as a\ntool for describing the microscopic dynamics. We show that is possible to\nprovide a parameterized version of the ME, in terms of a single numerical\nparameter (alpha), such that the different expressions for the diffusive fluxes\nare recovered at different values of alpha.

Our approach is based on two reduction rules--the chain\nreduction and the subtree reduction--that are widely used in computing TBR and\nSPR distances.

On the\nother hand, the scattering (and extinction) cross-section of a non-absorbing\ndielectric particle is always the sum of the cross-sections of all mode\nnumbers; and this rules out any such Fano type interference between two\ndifferent mode numbers. So delectric particles exhibit an interference\nstructure in their extinction spectra only if it manifests in the individual\nmodes describing the scattered field of the particle. We show that in a\nall-dielectric core-shell particle such strong interferences in multiple mode\nnumbers can be attained, and notably even as a spectral region of transparency\nand directional scattering of incident light. Here interference between the\ncomplementary normal modes of the nanoshell and core regions can be realized\nfor each mode number, resulting in a sharp interference structure in the\nextinction of the particle. This manifests as spectral regions of\nminimal/maximal interaction with the incident electromagnetic field. Such\nspectral properties are significant for many applications where the\nnon-radiative losses of plasmonic structures are a liability. Note that this\nbehaviour is useful for optical antennas, cloaking materials and a quantum\nmechanical interpretation of this classical effect may be signicant for\nsingle-photon based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 13:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

In this review we show that the nilpotent property is not valid in\ngeneral, under the assumption of a microscopic (ultraviolet) description of the\ntheory with linear supermultiplets. Sometimes only weaker versions of the\nnilpotent relation are true such as $\\Phi^3=0$ or $\\Phi^4=0$ ($\\Phi^2\\not=0$)\nin the infrared (far below the UV scale) under the further requirement of\ndecoupling all additional scalars (coupling to sgoldstino), something not\nalways possible (e.g. if light scalars exist). In such cases the weaker\nnilpotent property is not specific to the goldstino superfield anymore. We\nreview the restrictions for the Kahler curvature tensor and superpotential $W$\nunder which $\\Phi^2=0$ remains true in infrared, assuming linear\nsupermultiplets in the microscopic description.

The Graph Edit Distance\n(GED) is a flexible measure of dissimilarity between graphs which arises in\nerror-tolerant graph matching. It is defined from an optimal sequence of edit\noperations (edit path) transforming one graph into an other. Unfortunately, the\nexact computation of this measure is NP-hard. In the last decade, several\napproaches have been proposed to approximate the GED in polynomial time, mainly\nby solving linear programming problems. Among them, the bipartite GED has\nreceived much attention. It is deduced from a linear sum assignment of the\nnodes of the two graphs, which can be efficiently computed by Hungarian-type\nalgorithms. However, edit operations on nodes and edges are not handled\nsimultaneously, which limits the accuracy of the approximation. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose to extend the linear assignment model to a\nquadratic one, for directed or undirected graphs having labelized nodes and\nedges. This is realized through the definition of a family of edit paths\ninduced by assignments between nodes. We formally show that the GED, restricted\nto the paths in this family, is equivalent to a quadratic assignment problem.\nSince this problem is NP-hard, we propose to compute an approximate solution by\nan adaptation of the Integer Projected Fixed Point method. Experiments show\nthat the proposed approach is generally able to reach a more accurate\napproximation of the optimal GED than the bipartite GED, with a computational\ncost that is still affordable for graphs of non trivial sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 14:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

In this work, we present a complete framework for\nboth single shot-based 6D object pose estimation and next-best-view prediction\nbased on Hough Forests, the state of the art object pose estimator that\nperforms classification and regression jointly. Rather than using manually\ndesigned features we a) propose an unsupervised feature learnt from\ndepth-invariant patches using a Sparse Autoencoder and b) offer an extensive\nevaluation of various state of the art features. Furthermore, taking advantage\nof the clustering performed in the leaf nodes of Hough Forests, we learn to\nestimate the reduction of uncertainty in other views, formulating the problem\nof selecting the next-best-view. To further improve pose estimation, we propose\nan improved joint registration and hypotheses verification module as a final\nrefinement step to reject false detections. We provide two additional\nchallenging datasets inspired from realistic scenarios to extensively evaluate\nthe state of the art and our framework.

The compact radio and near-infrared (NIR) source Sagittarius A* (Sgr\nA*) associated with the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center was\nobserved at 7 mm in the context of a NIR triggered global Very Long Baseline\nArray (VLBA) campaign. Aims. Sgr A* shows variable flux densities ranging from\nradio through X-rays. These variations sometimes appear in spontaneous\noutbursts that are referred to as flares. Multi-frequency observations of Sgr\nA* provide access to easily observable parameters that can test the currently\naccepted models that try to explain these intensity outbursts. Methods. On May\n16-18, 2012 Sgr A* has been observed with the VLBA at 7 mm (43 GHz) for 6 hours\neach day during a global multi-wavelength campaign. These observations were\ntriggered by a NIR flare observed at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Accurate\nflux densities and source morphologies were acquired. Results. The total 7 mm\nflux of Sgr A* shows only minor variations during its quiescent states on a\ndaily basis of 0.06 Jy.

The control task is to enforce the system state\nto follow a prescribed desired trajectory as closely as possible. The concept\nof so-called exactly realizable trajectories is proposed. For exactly\nrealizable desired trajectories exists a control signal which enforces the\nstate to exactly follow the desired trajectory. For a given affine control\nsystem, these trajectories are characterized by the so-called constraint\nequation. This approach does not only yield an explicit expression for the\ncontrol signal in terms of the desired trajectory, but also identifies a\nparticularly simple class of nonlinear control systems. Based on that insight,\nthe regularization parameter is used as the small parameter for a perturbation\nexpansion. This results in a reinterpretation of affine optimal control\nproblems with small regularization term as singularly perturbed differential\nequations. The small parameter originates from the formulation of the control\nproblem and does not involve simplifying assumptions about the system dynamics.\nCombining this approach with the linearizing assumption, approximate and partly\nlinear equations for the optimal trajectory tracking of arbitrary desired\ntrajectories are derived. For vanishing regularization parameter, the state\ntrajectory becomes discontinuous and the control signal diverges. On the other\nhand, the analytical treatment becomes exact and the solutions are exclusively\ngoverned by linear differential equations. Thus, the possibility of linear\nstructures underlying nonlinear optimal control is revealed. This fact enables\nthe derivation of exact analytical solutions to an entire class of nonlinear\ntrajectory tracking problems with affine controls. This class comprises\nmechanical control systems in one spatial dimension and the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 13:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}
