For any normal polarized variety\n(or, more generally, polarized pair in the sense of the Minimal Model Program),\nwe introduce and study the non-Archimedean analogues of certain classical\nfunctionals in K\\\"ahler geometry. These functionals are defined on the space of\ntest configurations, and the Donaldson-Futaki invariant is in particular\ninterpreted as the non-Archimedean version of the Mabuchi functional, up to an\nexplicit error term. Finally, we study in detail the relation between uniform\nK-stability and singularities of pairs, reproving and strengthening Y. Odaka's\nresults in our formalism. This provides various examples of uniformly K-stable\nvarieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 17:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 05:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 13:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

This technique is known as digital backpropagation. Typical\ndigital backpropagation algorithms are based on split-step Fourier methods in\nwhich the signal has to be discretized in time and space. The need to\ndiscretize in both time and space however makes the real-time implementation of\ndigital backpropagation a challenging problem. In this paper, a new fast\nalgorithm for digital backpropagation based on nonlinear Fourier transforms is\npresented. Aiming at a proof of concept, the main emphasis will be put on\nfibers with normal dispersion in order to avoid the issue of solitonic\ncomponents in the signal. However, it is demonstrated that the algorithm also\nworks for anomalous dispersion if the signal power is low enough. Since the\nspatial evolution of a signal governed by the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\ncan be reverted analytically in the nonlinear Fourier domain through simple\nphase-shifts, there is no need to discretize the spatial domain. The proposed\nalgorithm requires only $\\mathcal{O}(D\\log^{2}D)$ floating point operations to\nbackpropagate a signal given by $D$ samples, independently of the fiber's\nlength, and is therefore highly promising for real-time implementations.

By considering the first order\nself$-$energy corrections to the spin wave spectrum, magnon decay rate,\nbimagnon interactions within the ladder approximation Bethe-Salpeter scheme,\nand the effect of three-magnon contributions up to 1/S- order we find that the\nRIXS spectra is non-trivially affected. For a purely isotropic triangular\nlattice model, the peak splitting mechanism and the appearance of a multipeak\nRIXS structure is primarily dictated by the damping of magnon modes. At a\nscattering wavevector corresponding to the zone center \\Gamma point and at the\nroton point q=M, where the magnon decay rate is zero, a stable single peak\nforms. At the $\\Gamma$ point, the contribution is purely trimagnon at the 1/S\nlevel and occurs approximately at the trimagnon energy of 6JS. The roton peak\noccurs at a lower energy of 4JS. The K-edge single peak RIXS spectra at the\nroton momentum can be utilized as an experimental signature to detect the\npresence of roton excitations. A unique feature of the triangular lattice\nK-edge RIXS spectra is the nonvanishing RIXS intensity at both the zone center\n$\\Gamma$ point and the antiferromagnetic wavevector K point. This result is in\nsharp contrast to the vanishing K-edge RIXS intensity of the collinear magnetic\nphases on the square lattice. We find that including XXZ anisotropy leads to\nadditional peak splitting, including at the roton scattering wavevector where\nthe single peak destabilizes towards a two-peak structure. The observed\nsplitting is consistent with our earlier theoretical prediction of the effects\nof spatial anisotropy on the RIXS spectra of a frustrated quantum magnet [Luo,\nDatta, and Yao, Phys.

Conventional explanations based on either shock\nacceleration of charged particles or particle acceleration due to magnetic\nreconnection at interplanetary current sheets are not persuasive. We suggest\ninstead that recurrent magnetic reconnection occurs at the HCS and smaller\ncurrent sheets in the solar wind (Zharkova & Khabarova 2012), of which a\nconsequence is particle energization by the dynamically evolving secondary\ncurrent sheets and magnetic islands (Zank et al. 2014; Drake et al. 2006a).

Most of them steadily spin\ndown and display a highly repetitive pulse shape. But some pulsars experience\ntiming irregularities such as nulling, intermittency, mode changing and timing\nnoise. As changes in the pulse shape are often correlated with timing\nirregularities, precession is a possible cause of these phenomena. Whereas\npulsar magnetospheres are filled with plasma, most pulsar precession studies\nwere carried out within the vacuum approximation and neglected the effects of\nmagnetospheric currents and charges. Recent numerical simulations of\nplasma-filled pulsar magnetospheres provide us with a detailed quantitative\ndescription of magnetospheric torques exerted on the pulsar surface. In this\npaper, we present the study of neutron star evolution using these new torque\nexpressions. We show that they lead to (1) much slower long-term evolution of\npulsar parameters and (2) much less extreme solutions for these parameters than\nthe vacuum magnetosphere models. To facilitate the interpretation of observed\npulsar timing residuals, we derive an analytic model that (1) describes the\ntime evolution of non-spherical pulsars and (2) translates the observed pulsar\ntiming residuals into the geometrical parameters of the pulsar. We apply this\nmodel to two pulsars with very different temporal behaviours. For the pulsar\nB1828-11, we demonstrate that the timing residual curves allow two pulsar\ngeometries: one with stellar deformation pointing along the magnetic axis and\none along the rotational axis. For the Crab pulsar, we use the model show that\nthe recent observation of its magnetic and rotational axes moving away from\neach other can be explained by precession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 20:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

We believe that the idealized system of single\nprocessor powered by single battery (SPSB) can be viewed as a generic case for\nthe modeling effort. This paper introduces a dynamic model for multiple\naperiodic tasks on a SPSB system under a scheduling algorithm that resembles\nthe rate monotonic scheduling (RMS) within finite time windows. The model\ncontains two major modules. The first module is an online battery capacity\nmodel based on the Rakhmatov-Vrudhula-Wallach (RVW) model. This module provides\npredictions of remaining battery capacity based on the knowledge of the battery\ndischarging current. The second module is a dynamical scheduling model that can\npredict the scheduled behavior of tasks within any finite time window, without\nthe need to store all past information about each task before the starting time\nof the finite time window. The module provides a complete analytical\ndescription of the relationship among tasks and it delineates all possible\nmodes of the processor utilization as square-wave functions of time. The two\nmodules i.e. the scheduling model and the battery model are integrated to\nobtain a hybrid scheduling model that describes the dynamic behaviors of the\nSPSB system. Our effort may have demonstrated that through dynamic modeling,\ndifferent components of CPS may be integrated under a unified theoretical\nframework centered around hybrid systems theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 23:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

This poor throughput owes largely to the considerable\ncompositional space that needs to be accounted for to fully comprehend complex\nmaterial/performance relationship.

Using this approach, we identified a\nthree-element doping/co-doping strategy that significantly improves the\nmaterial performance. The composition was uncovered by simultaneously screening\nfor a beneficial co-dopant ion among the alkaline earth metal family and by\noptimizing its concentration and that of Tl+ and Eu2+ ions.

The late-time spectra are strikingly\nsimilar to SN IIb 1993J, which is the only previous example clearly showing the\nsame transition.

The problem is difficult due to many factors such as intra-class\nvariations, local deformations, articulations, viewpoint changes and missed and\nextraneous contour portions due to errors in shape extraction. While small\nlocal deformations has been handled in the literature by allowing some leeway\nin the matching of individual contour points via methods such as Chamfer\ndistance and Hausdorff distance, handling more severe deformations and\narticulations has been done by applying local geometric corrections such as\nsimilarity or affine. However, determining which portions of the shape should\nbe used for the geometric corrections is very hard, although some methods have\nbeen tried. In this paper, we address this problem by an efficient search for\nthe group of contour segments to be clustered together for a geometric\ncorrection using Dynamic Programming by essentially searching for the\nsegmentations of two shapes that lead to the best matching between them. At the\nsame time, we allow portions of the contours to remain unmatched to handle\nmissing and extraneous contour portions.

The parameters are\nchosen such that the dynamics on an isolated patch have a periodic attractor\nwith all four species present as well as an attractor where the prey that is\npreferred by the top predator dies out. The stability measure used here is\nrobustness, which is the average proportion of surviving species in the system,\nand which shows a complex dependence on the migration rate.

For surfaces of constant width we show\nthat $ \\rho_0(P)+ \\rho_1(Q)=w$ where the $\\rho_i$ are the principal curvatures,\n$P$ and $Q$ are opposite points, and $w>0$ is the width. Moreover, an ovoid is\na surface of constant width $w>0$ if and only if $\\rho_{{\\rm\nmean}}(P)+\\rho_{{\\rm mean}}(Q) = w$ where $\\rho_{{\\rm mean}}(P)$ is the average\nradius of curvature at point $P$. Finally, we provide a Fourier series-based\nconstruction that produces arbitrarily many new surfaces of constant width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2015 14:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

Cache is a precious resource: Tenants\nwho get to use cache can see two orders of magnitude performance improvement.\nCache is also a limited and hence shared resource: Unlike a resource like a CPU\ncore which can be used by only one tenant at a time, a cached data item can be\naccessed by multiple tenants at the same time.

We study the low-energy phenomenology of the trinification model in\norder to compare its predictions to experiment. To this end, we construct a\nlow-energy effective field theory, thereby reducing the number of particles and\nfree parameters that need to be studied. We constrain the model parameters\nusing limits from new-particle searches as well as precision measurements. The\nscalar sector of the model allows for various phenomenological scenarios, such\nas the presence of a light fermiophobic scalar in addition to a\nStandard-Model-like Higgs, or a degenerate (twin) Higgs state at 126 GeV. We\nshow how a measurement of the Higgs couplings can be used to distinguish such\nscenarios from the Standard Model. We find that the trinification model\npredicts that several new scalar particles have masses in the\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(100\\text{ GeV}\\right)$ range. Moreover, large regions of the\nparameter space lead to measurable deviations from Standard-Model predictions\nof the Higgs couplings.

This is due to the fact that engineers\nedit code separately, and loosely coordinate their work via a source control or\na software configuration management system (SCM). This work proposes to\neliminate almost all the need to manually merge a recent change, by proposing a\nCollaborative Real Time Coding approach. In this approach, valid changes to the\ncode are seen by others in real time, but intermediate changes (that cause the\ncode not to compile) result in blocking other engineers from making changes\nrelated to the entity (e.g. method) being modified, while allowing them to work\non most of the system.
