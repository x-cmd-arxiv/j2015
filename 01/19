In addition it will be shown, that the two-hole excitations do not\ncomplicate more the determination of the neutrino mass compared to the\nsituation with one-hole states only. At the Q value the highest one-hole\nresonance is dominant. Under the assumption of a Lorentzian line shape one has\nto fit after inclusion of the experimental spectral function of the detector\nfour quantities to the data: (1) The neutrino mass, (2) the energy distance of\nthe dominant resonance to the Q value, (3) the line witdth and (4) the strength\nof the resonance. Compared to Robertson this work includes major improvements\nand it shows, that a determination of the neutrino mass is difficult but not\nimpossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 19:22:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 14:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

Our data-driven framework for\nmathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large\nnumber of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign\npartial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely\nlocations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural\nlanguage processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we\nconvert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series\nof numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions\nto uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect\nsolutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages\ngeneric clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third,\nwe automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions\nbased on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster.\nAs a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep\nsolution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions,\nwhich enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners.

One example is a segment of skyrmion line\ninside a crystal, where a monopole and antimonopole pair is connected by the\nemergent magnetic flux line. This is a realization of Dirac string-like\nexcitations. Here we study the dynamics of monopoles in chiral magnets under an\nelectric current. We show that in the process of creation of skyrmion lines,\nskyrmion line segments are first created via the proliferation of monopoles and\nantimonopoles. Then these line segments join and span the whole system through\nthe annihilation of monopoles. The skyrmion lines are destroyed via the\nproliferation of monopoles and antimonopoles at high currents, resulting in a\nchiral liquid phase. We also propose to create the monopoles in a controlled\nway by applying an inhomogenous current to a crystal. Remarkably, an electric\nfield component in the magnetic field direction proportional to the current\nsquared in the low current region is induced by the motion of distorted\nskyrmion lines, in addition to the Hall and longitudinal voltage.

For\narea-preserving maps, transport is impeded by curves formed from invariant\nmanifolds that form partial barriers, e.g., stable and unstable manifolds\nbounding a resonance zone or cantori, the remnants of destroyed invariant tori.\nWhen the map is exact volume preserving, a Lagrangian differential form can be\nused to reduce the computation of fluxes to finding a difference between the\naction of certain key orbits, such as homoclinic orbits to a saddle or to a\ncantorus.

Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics\nsimulation of the tidal debris motion, we track such a system until ~80% of the\nstellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion flow. Shocks\nnear the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most\ntightly-bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make the\ncharacteristic radius comparable to the semi-major axis of the most-bound\nmaterial, not the tidal radius as previously thought. The outer shocks are\ncaused by post-Newtonian effects, both on the stellar orbit during its\ndisruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion\nflow is non-monotonic and slow, requiring ~3--10x the orbital period of the\nmost tightly-bound tidal streams, while the inflow time for most of the mass\nmay be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deflection by\nshocks does, however, remove enough angular momentum and energy from some mass\nfor it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the\naccretion flow. Although the accretion rate rises sharply and then decays\nroughly as a power-law, its maximum is ~0.1x the previous expectation, and the\nduration of the peak is ~5x longer than previously predicted.

However, inference tasks such as action\nrecognition require high quality features which implies reconstructing the\noriginal video data. Much work in compressive sensing (CS) theory is geared\ntowards solving the reconstruction problem, where state-of-the-art methods are\ncomputationally intensive and provide low-quality results at high compression\nrates. Thus, reconstruction-free methods for inference are much desired. In\nthis paper, we propose reconstruction-free methods for action recognition from\ncompressive cameras at high compression ratios of 100 and above. Recognizing\nactions directly from CS measurements requires features which are mostly\nnonlinear and thus not easily applicable. This leads us to search for such\nproperties that are preserved in compressive measurements. To this end, we\npropose the use of spatio-temporal smashed filters, which are compressive\ndomain versions of pixel-domain matched filters.

As such, IC 1459 and NGC 1052\noffer opportunities to study the details of the pc-scale radio sources as well\nas the environments that the radio sources inhabit, across the electromagnetic\nspectrum.

Our VLBI images of PKS 2254-367 show that the previously identified\nsimilarities between IC 1459 and NGC 1052 continue onto the pc-scale. Both\ncompact radio sources appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the same\nluminosity, much lower than typically noted in compact double GPS sources.\nSimilarities between PKS 2254-367 and NGC 1052, and differences with respect to\nother GPS galaxies, lead us to speculate that a sub-class of GPS radio sources,\nwith low luminosity and with jet-dominated morphologies, exists and would be\nlargely absent from radio source surveys with ~1 Jy flux density cutoffs. We\nsuggest that this possible low-luminosity, jet-dominated population of GPS\nsources could be an analog of the FR-I radio galaxies, with the higher\nluminosity lobe-dominated GPS sources being the analog of the FR-II radio\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 05:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The phase velocity of the sausage and kink waves increases marginally\n(by a few percent) due to the compressibility of the medium in both ideal as\nwell as Hall diffusion dominated regimes.

A tremendous amount of expression profiles are generated and stored in\nthe public domain and information integration by meta-analysis to detect\ndifferentially expressed (DE) genes has become popular to obtain increased\nstatistical power and validated findings. Methods that aggregate transformed\n$p$-value evidence have been widely used in genomic settings, among which\nFisher's and Stouffer's methods are the most popular ones. In practice, raw\ndata and $p$-values of DE evidence are often not available in genomic studies\nthat are to be combined. Instead, only the detected DE gene lists under a\ncertain $p$-value threshold (e.g., DE genes with $p$-value${}<0.001$) are\nreported in journal publications. The truncated $p$-value information makes the\naforementioned meta-analysis methods inapplicable and researchers are forced to\napply a less efficient vote counting method or na\\\"{i}vely drop the studies\nwith incomplete information. The purpose of this paper is to develop effective\nmeta-analysis methods for such situations with partially censored $p$-values.\nWe developed and compared three imputation methods - mean imputation, single\nrandom imputation and multiple imputation - for a general class of evidence\naggregation methods of which Fisher's and Stouffer's methods are special\nexamples. The null distribution of each method was analytically derived and\nsubsequent inference and genomic analysis frameworks were established.\nSimulations were performed to investigate the type I error, power and the\ncontrol of false discovery rate (FDR) for (correlated) gene expression data.\nThe proposed methods were applied to several genomic applications in colorectal\ncancer, pain and liquid association analysis of major depressive disorder\n(MDD). The results showed that imputation methods outperformed existing\nna\\\"{i}ve approaches. Mean imputation and multiple imputation methods performed\nthe best and are recommended for future applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 08:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

This wealth of information is buried under Galactic\nand extragalactic foregrounds, which must be removed accurately and precisely\nin order to reveal the cosmological signal. This problem has been addressed\nalready for the previous generation of radio telescopes, but the application to\nSKA is different in many aspects.\n  In this chapter we summarise the contributions to the field of foreground\nremoval in the context of high redshift and high sensitivity 21-cm\nmeasurements. We use a state-of-the-art simulation of the SKA Phase 1\nobservations complete with cosmological signal, foregrounds and\nfrequency-dependent instrumental effects to test both parametric and\nnon-parametric foreground removal methods. We compare the recovered\ncosmological signal using several different statistics and explore one of the\nmost exciting possibilities with the SKA --- imaging of the ionized bubbles.\n  We find that with current methods it is possible to remove the foregrounds\nwith great accuracy and to get impressive power spectra and images of the\ncosmological signal. The frequency-dependent PSF of the instrument complicates\nthis recovery, so we resort to splitting the observation bandwidth into smaller\nsegments, each of a common resolution.\n  If the foregrounds are allowed a random variation from the smooth power law\nalong the line of sight, methods exploiting the smoothness of foregrounds or a\nparametrization of their behaviour are challenged much more than non-parametric\nones. However, we show that correction techniques can be implemented to restore\nthe performances of parametric approaches, as long as the first-order\napproximation of a power law stands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 09:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

Selfish agents with\nprivate information are each associated with exactly one strategic mediator,\nand can interact with the mechanism exclusively through that mediator. Each\nmediator aims to optimize the combined utility of his agents, while the\nmechanism aims to optimize the combined utility of all agents. We focus on the\nproblem of facility location on a metric induced by a publicly known tree. With\nnon-strategic mediators, there is a dominant strategy mechanism that is\noptimal. We show that when both agents and mediators act strategically, there\nis no dominant strategy mechanism that achieves any approximation. We, thus,\nslightly relax the incentive constraints, and define the notion of a two-sided\nincentive compatible mechanism. We show that the $3$-competitive deterministic\nmechanism suggested by Procaccia and Tennenholtz (2013) and Dekel et al. (2010)\nfor lines extends naturally to trees, and is still $3$-competitive as well as\ntwo-sided incentive compatible. This is essentially the best possible. We then\nshow that by allowing randomization one can construct a $2$-competitive\nrandomized mechanism that is two-sided incentive compatible, and this is also\nessentially tight. This result also closes a gap left in the work of Procaccia\nand Tennenholtz (2013) and Lu et al. (2009) for the simpler problem of\ndesigning strategy-proof mechanisms for weighted agents with no mediators on a\nline, while extending to the more general model of trees.

The model consists of a common message for all\nthree receivers, a private common message for only two receivers and two\nadditional private messages for these two receivers, such that each receiver is\nonly interested in one message, while being fully cognizant of the other one.\nFirst, this model is investigated without any secrecy constraints, where the\ncapacity region is established, showing that the straightforward extension of\nthe K\\\"orner and Marton inner bound to the investigated scenario is optimal. In\nparticular, this agrees with Nair and Wang's result, which states that the idea\nof indirect decoding - introduced to improve the K\\\"orner and Marton inner\nbound - does not provide a better region for this scenario. Further, some\nsecrecy constraints are introduced by letting the private messages to be\nconfidential ones. Two different secrecy criteria are considered: joint secrecy\nand individual secrecy. For both criteria, a general achievable rate region is\nprovided. Moreover, the joint and individual secrecy capacity regions are\nestablished, if the two legitimate receivers are more capable than the\neavesdropper. The established capacity regions indicate that the individual\nsecrecy criterion can provide a larger capacity region as compared to the joint\none, because each cognizant message can be used as a secret key for the other\nindividual message. Further, the joint secrecy capacity is established for a\nmore general class of more capable channels, where only one of the two\nlegitimate receivers is more capable than the eavesdropper. This was done by\nshowing that principle of indirect decoding introduced by Nair and El Gamal is\noptimal for this class of channels.

In this paper we\npresent further observations of this region (194 hours in total over ~250\ndeg^2), both in intensity and in polarization. They span four frequency\nchannels between 10 and 20 GHz, and were gathered with QUIJOTE, a new CMB\nexperiment with the goal of measuring the polarization of the CMB and Galactic\nforegrounds. When combined with other publicly-available intensity data, we\nachieve the most precise spectrum of the AME measured to date, with 13\nindependent data points being dominated by this emission. The four QUIJOTE data\npoints provide the first independent confirmation of the downturn of the AME\nspectrum at low frequencies, initially unveiled by the COSMOSOMAS experiment in\nthis region. We accomplish an accurate fit of these data using models based on\nelectric dipole emission from spinning dust grains, and also fit some of the\nparameters on which these models depend.\n  We also present polarization maps with an angular resolution of ~1 deg and a\nsensitivity of ~25 muK/beam.

These constraints are compatible with\ntheoretical predictions of the polarization fraction from electric dipole\nemission originating from spinning dust grains. At the same time, they rule out\nseveral models based on magnetic dipole emission from dust grains ordered in a\nsingle magnetic domain, which predict higher polarization levels.

However the\noffline training is time-consuming and the learned generic representation may\nbe less discriminative for tracking specific objects. In this paper we present\nthat, even without offline training with a large amount of auxiliary data,\nsimple two-layer convolutional networks can be powerful enough to develop a\nrobust representation for visual tracking. In the first frame, we employ the\nk-means algorithm to extract a set of normalized patches from the target region\nas fixed filters, which integrate a series of adaptive contextual filters\nsurrounding the target to define a set of feature maps in the subsequent\nframes. These maps measure similarities between each filter and the useful\nlocal intensity patterns across the target, thereby encoding its local\nstructural information. Furthermore, all the maps form together a global\nrepresentation, which is built on mid-level features, thereby remaining close\nto image-level information, and hence the inner geometric layout of the target\nis also well preserved. A simple soft shrinkage method with an adaptive\nthreshold is employed to de-noise the global representation, resulting in a\nrobust sparse representation. The representation is updated via a simple and\neffective online strategy, allowing it to robustly adapt to target appearance\nvariations.

Many of these invaluable probes of\ngeometry around the black hole are expected, but none have been found in close\norbits so far, possibly as result of strong scattering. The magnetar PSR\nJ1745-2900 discovered in 2013 at a separation of < 3 arcsec is not the optimal\ntype of pulsar for studies of general relativity, but it can be used to\ninvestigate the scattering properties so that search strategies can be adapted\naccordingly. This contribution presents an observation of this magnetar using\nshort baselines between VLBI stations in Europe in a non-standard\ninterferometry mode. The most important goal is determining the distance of the\nscattering screen, or the distribution of scattering material if not confined\nto one screen. The analysis is based on phase-binned visibilities that allow\nmeasuring the shape of the scattering disk and how it grows with increasing\ndelay over the scattering tail of the pulse profile. Narrow rings growing with\nthe square root of delay are expected for a single thin scattering screen and\nthe preliminary results are indeed consistent with this expectation. This means\nthat most of the angular and temporal broadening is caused by the same and\nrelatively thin scattering screen and that, in contrast to standard models of\nthe interstellar scattering behaviour near the Galactic centre, this screen is\nlocated about halfway between the centre and us.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 15:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

In this paper we show that in strong curved magnetic fields a\nsignificant fraction of the energy of relativistic electrons can be radiated\naway in the intermediate, the so-called synchro-curvature regime. Because of\nthe persistent change of the trajectory curvature, the radiation varies with\nthe frequency of particle gyration. While this effect can be ignored in the\nsynchrotron and curvature regimes, the variability plays a key role in the\nformation of the synchro-curvature radiation. Using the Hamiltonian formalism,\nwe find that the particle trajectory has the form of a helix wound around the\ndrift trajectory. This allows us to calculate analytically the intensity and\nenergy distribution of prompt radiation in the general case of magnetic\nbremsstrahlung in the curved magnetic field. We show that the transition to the\nlimit of the synchrotron and curvature radiation regimes is determined by the\nrelation between the drift velocity and the component of the particle velocity\nperpendicular to the drift trajectory. The detailed numerical calculations,\nwhich take into account the energy losses of particles, confirm the principal\nconclusions based on the simplified analytical treatment of the problem, and\nallow us to analyze quantitatively the transition between different radiation\nregimes for a broad range of initial pitch angles. We argue that in the case of\nrealization of specific configurations of the electric and magnetic fields, the\ngamma-ray emission of the pulsar magnetospheres can be dominated by the\ncomponent radiated in the synchro-curvature regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 13:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

The cross-section increment is\nsignificantly higher for liquid than for solid targets. We propose that the\nsame two-body correlation entropy used in evaluating the metal melting entropy\nexplains the large liquid-solid difference of the effective screening potential\nthat parameterizes the cross-section increment. This approach is applied to the\nspecific case of the $^6$Li(d,$\\alpha$)$^4$He reaction, whose measured\nscreening potential liquid-solid difference is $(235 \\pm 63)$ eV. Cross\nsections in the two metals with the highest two-body correlation entropy (In\nand Hg) have not yet been measured: increments of the cross sections in liquid\nrelative to the ones in solid metals are estimated with the same procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 12:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

It\nis a generalization of both pseudo-steady-state and transient interporosity\nflow double porosity models.

The said signature is a 3D motif in the form of an irregular\ntetrahedron whose vertices represent the backbone or side-chain centroids of\nthe amino acid residues at the binding site that physically interact with the\nbound ligand atoms. The motif is determined from a set of solved training\nstructures, all of which bind the ligand. Just as alignment of linear amino\nacid sequences enables one to determine consensus sequences in proteins, the\npresent method allows the determination of three-dimensional consensus\nstructures or \"motifs\" in folded proteins. Although such is accomplished by the\npresent method not by alignment of 3D protein structures or parts thereof\n(e.g., alignment of ligand atoms from different structures) but by\nnearest-neighbor analysis of ligand atoms in protein-bound forms, the same\neffect, and thus the same goal, is achieved. We have applied our method to the\nprediction of GTP- and ATP-binding protein families, namely, the small Ras-type\nG-protein and ser/thr protein kinase families. Validation tests reveal that the\nspecificity of our method is nearly 100% for both protein families, and a\nsensitivity of greater than 60% for the ser/thr protein kinase family and\napprox. 93% for the small, Ras-type G-protein family. Further tests reveal that\nour algorithm can distinguish effectively between GTP and GTP-like ligands, and\nbetween ATP- and ATP-like ligands.
