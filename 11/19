The volcano has a large caldera with several active\ngeothermal areas. A peculiar cluster of long-period seismic events started on\nKatla's south flank in July 2011, during an unrest episode in the caldera that\nculminated in a glacier outburst. The seismic events were tightly clustered at\nshallow depth in the Gvendarfell area, 4 km south of the caldera, under a small\nglacier stream on the southern margin of M\\'yrdalsj\\\"okull. No seismic events\nwere known to have occurred in this area before. The most striking feature of\nthis seismic cluster is its temporal pattern, characterized by regular\nintervals between repeating seismic events, modulated by a seasonal variation.\nRemarkable is also the stability of both the time and waveform features over a\nlong time period, around 3.5 years. No comparable examples have been found in\nthe literature. Both volcanic and glacial processes can produce similar\nwaveforms and therefore have to be considered as potential seismic sources.\nDiscerning between these two causes is critical for monitoring glacier-clad\nvolcanoes and has been controversial at Katla. For this new seismic cluster on\nthe south flank we regard volcano-related processes as more likely than glacial\nones for the following reasons: 1) the seismic activity started during an\nunrest episode involving sudden melting of the glacier and a j\\\"okulhlaup; 2)\nthe glacier stream is small and stagnant; 3) the seismicity remains regular and\nstable for years; 4) there is no apparent correlation with short-term weather\nchanges, such as rain storms. We suggest that a small, shallow hydrothermal\nsystem was activated on Katla's south flank in 2011, either by a minor magmatic\ninjection or by changes of permeability in a local crack system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 16:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

We created a set of galaxy group catalogues based on the 2MRS and\nSDSS DR12 galaxy samples using a friends-of-friends based group finder\nalgorithm. The algorithm was carefully calibrated and optimised on a new set of\nwide-angle mock catalogues from the Millennium simulation, in order to provide\naccurate total mass estimates of the galaxy groups taking into account the\nrelevant observational biases in 2MRS and SDSS.\n  Results. We provide four different catalogues (i) a 2MRS based group\ncatalogue; (ii) an SDSS DR12 based group catalogue reaching out to a redshift z\n= 0.11 with stellar mass estimates for 70% of the galaxies; (iii) a catalogue\nproviding additional fundamental plane distances for all groups of the SDSS\ncatalogue that host elliptical galaxies; (iv) a catalogue of the mass\ndistribution in the local Universe based on a combination of our 2MRS and SDSS\ncatalogues.\n  Conclusions.

A simple quantitative transformation of the input patterns which\nconsiders the total number of bits in the input string allows us to map the\nrespective input combinations to the correct outputs patterns of the full adder\ncircuit, reducing the circuit combinations from a 2:1 mapping to a 1:1 mapping.\nThe mapping of inputs to outputs also shows an incremental linear progression,\nsuggesting its implementation in a range of physical systems. We demonstrate an\nexample implementation, first in simulation, inspired by self-oscillatory\ndynamics of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We then assess the\npotential implementation using plasmodium of slime mould itself. This simple\ntransformation may enrich the potential for using unconventional computing\nsubstrates to implement digital circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 16:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}

The turbulent flow contains much more energy than the\nsurface waves. In order to focus on the surface wave, the deformations induced\nby the turbulent flow are removed. This is done by performing a coherent phase\naveraging. For wavelengths smaller than the forcing lengthscale, we observe a\nsignificant increase of the wavelength of the propagating wave that has not\nbeen reported before. We suggest that it can be explained by the random\ndeflection of the wave induced by the velocity gradient of the turbulent flow.\nUnder this assumption, the wavelength shift is an estimate of the fluctuations\nof deflection angle. The local measurements of the wave frequency far from the\nwavemaker do not reveal such systematic behavior, although a small shift is\nmeasured. Finally we quantify the damping enhancement induced by the turbulent\nflow. We review various theoretical scaling laws proposed previously. Most of\nthem propose a damping that increases as the square of Froude number. In\ncontrast, our experimental results show a turbulent damping increasing linearly\nwith the Froude number. We interpret this linear behaviour as a balance between\nthe time spent by a wave to cross a turbulent structure with the turbulent\nmixing time. The larger is the ratio of these 2 times, the more energy is\nextracted from the progressive wave. Finally, mechanisms of energy exchange and\nopen issues are discussed and further studies are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 18:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}

We\nobserve 70 or 100 and 160 $\\mu$m excess emission around 9 confirmed Lambda Boo\nstars with the Herschel Space Observatory, to differentiate whether the dust\nemission is from a debris disk or an ISM bow wave.

To explain\nthis given our observations, we explore Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag as a\nmechanism of accretion from a debris disk but find it insufficient.

Called\n\"subgiants\" by Str\\\"omberg, these 90 stars defined the group at the time. The\nposition of the Mt Wilson subgiants in the HR diagram caused difficulties in\ncomparisons of high weight trigonometric parallaxes being measured and with\nRussell's prevailing evolution proposal, and critics questioned the reality of\nthe Mt Wilson subgiants. We compare, star-by-star, the Mt Wilson spectroscopic\nabsolute magnitudes of the 90 stars defining their sample against those\nabsolute magnitudes derived from Hipparcos (HIP) trigonometric parallaxes. We\naddress concerns over biases in the Mt Wilson calibration sample and biases\ncreated by the adopted methodology for calibration. Historically, these\nconcerns were sufficient to discredit the discovery of subgiants in the Mt\nWilson sample. However, as shown here, the majority of the Mount Wilson stars\nidentified as subgiants that also have reliable HIP trigonometric parallaxes do\nlie among the subgiant sequence in the HIP HR diagram. Moreover, no significant\noffset is seen between the M(V) brightnesses derived from the Mt Wilson\nspectroscopic parallaxes and the M(V) values derived from Hipparcos\ntrigonometric parallaxes with a fractional error of 10%, which confirms in an\nimpressive manner the efficacy of the original Mt Wilson assessments. The\nexistence of subgiants proved that Russell's contraction proposal for stellar\nevolution from giants to the main sequence was incorrect. Instead, Gamow's 1944\nunpublished conjecture that subgiants are post main-sequence stars just having\nleft the main sequence was very nearly correct but was a decade before its\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 20:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

One potential type of detectable\ngravitational wave is short-duration gravitational-wave bursts, whose waveforms\ncan be difficult to predict. We present the framework for a new detection\nalgorithm for such burst events -- \\textit{oLIB} -- that can be used in\nlow-latency to identify gravitational-wave transients independently of other\nsearch algorithms. This algorithm consists of 1) an excess-power event\ngenerator based on the Q-transform -- \\textit{Omicron} --, 2) coincidence of\nthese events across a detector network, and 3) an analysis of the coincident\nevents using a Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian evidence calculator --\n\\textit{LALInferenceBurst}. These steps compress the full data streams into a\nset of Bayes factors for each event; through this process, we use elements from\ninformation theory to minimize the amount of information regarding the\nsignal-versus-noise hypothesis that is lost.

Resurgence connects local perturbative data with global topological\nstructure. In quantum mechanical systems, this program provides a constructive\nrelation between different saddles. For example, in certain cases it has been\nshown that all information around the instanton saddle is encoded in\nperturbation theory around the perturbative saddle. In quantum field theory,\nsuch as sigma models compactified on a circle, neutral bions provide a\nsemi-classical interpretation of the elusive IR-renormalon, and fractional kink\ninstantons lead to the non-perturbatively induced gap, of order of the strong\nscale. In the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, saddles must be\nfound by solving the holomorphic Newton's equation in the inverted\n(holomorphized) potential. Some saddles are complex, multi-valued, and even\nsingular, but of finite action, and their inclusion is strictly necessary to\nprevent inconsistencies. The multi-valued saddles enter either via resurgent\ncancellations, or their phase is tied with a hidden topological angle. We\nemphasize the importance of the destructive/constructive interference effects\nbetween equally dominant saddles in the Lefschetz thimble decomposition.

We\npresent a semi-analytical model for the thermal history of the IGM that follows\nthe photoheating history of primordial gas. Our model adopts a multizone\napproach that, compared to previous models, more accurately captures the\ninhomogeneous heating and cooling of the IGM during patchy reionization. We\ncompare our model with recent temperature measurements spanning z = 1.6-4.8,\nfinding that these measurements are consistent with scenarios in which the He\nII was reionized at z = 3-4 by quasars. Significantly longer duration or higher\nredshift He II reionization scenarios are ruled out by the measurements. For\nhydrogen reionization, we find that only low-redshift and high-temperature\nscenarios are excluded. For example, a model in which the IGM was heated to 30\n000 K when an ionization front passed, and with hydrogen reionization occurring\nover 6 < z < 9, is ruled out. Finally, we place constraints on how much heating\ncould owe to TeV blazars, cosmic rays, and other non-standard mechanisms. We\nfind that by z = 2, a maximum of 1 eV of additional heat could be injected per\nbaryon over standard photoheating-only models, with this limit becoming <~0.5\neV at z > 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 21:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 00:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

The rigidity that emerges in\ncrystals and glassy liquids is of the same fundamental origin. In both cases,\nit corresponds with a breaking of the translational symmetry; analogies with\nfreezing transitions in spin systems can also be made. The common aspect of\nthese seemingly distinct phenomena is a spontaneous emergence of the molecular\nfield, a venerable and well-understood concept. In crucial distinction from\nperiodic crystallisation, the free energy landscape of a glassy liquid is\nvastly degenerate, which gives rise to new length and time scales while\nrendering the emergence of rigidity gradual. We obviate the standard notion\nthat to be mechanically stable a structure must be essentially unique; instead,\nwe show that bulk degeneracy is perfectly allowed but should not exceed a\ncertain value. The present microscopic description thus explains both\ncrystallisation and the emergence of the landscape regime followed by\nvitrification in a unified, thermodynamics-rooted fashion. The article contains\na self-contained exposition of the basics of the classical density functional\ntheory and liquid theory, which are subsequently used to quantitatively\nestimate, without using adjustable parameters, the key attributes of glassy\nliquids, viz., the relaxation barriers, glass transition temperature, and\ncooperativity size.

The corresponding HI dispersion is 11.7 $\\pm$ 2.3\nkm/s, yielding a mean HI/CO dispersion ratio of 1.4 $\\pm$ 0.2, independent of\nradius. We find that the CO velocity dispersion increases towards lower peak\nfluxes. This is consistent with previous work where we showed that when using\nspectra averaged (\"stacked\") over large areas, larger values for the CO\ndispersion are found, and a lower dispersion ratio: 1.0 $\\pm$ 0.2. The stacking\nmethod is more sensitive to low-level diffuse emission, whereas individual\nprofiles trace narrow-line, GMC-dominated, bright emission. These results\nprovide further evidence that disk galaxies contain not only a thin, low\nvelocity dispersion, high density CO disk that is dominated by GMCs, but also a\nfainter, higher dispersion, diffuse disk component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 22:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

A widely used\nproxy for jet power is the extended radio luminosity. A number of empirical\nmethods have been used to calibrate a scaling relationship between jet power\n(Q) and radio luminosity (L) of the form log(Q) = beta_L * log(L) + C. The\nregression slope has typically been found to be beta_L ~ 0.7 - 0.8. Here we\nshow that the previously reported scaling relations are strongly affected by\nthe confounding variable, distance. We find that in a sample of FRI X-ray\ncavity systems, after accounting for the mutual distance dependence, the jet\npower and radio luminosity are only weakly correlated, with slope beta_L ~ 0.3:\nsignificantly flatter than previously reported. We also find that in previously\nused samples of high-power sources, no evidence for an intrinsic correlation is\npresent when the effect of distance is accounted for. Using a simple model we\nshow that beta_L is expected to be significantly lower in samples of FRI radio\ngalaxies than it is for FRIIs, due to the differing dynamics for these two\nclasses of radio source. For FRI X-ray cavity systems the model predicts beta_L\n(FRI) ~ 0.5 in contrast to FRII radio galaxies, for which beta_L(FRII) ~ 0.8.\nWe discuss the implications of our finding for studies of radio mode feedback,\nand radio galaxy physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 22:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This is done by combining\nmeasurements of the vertical velocity dispersion of the disc with the disc\nscale height. The vertical velocity dispersion of the discs is measured from\nabsorption lines (near the V-band) of near-face-on spiral galaxies, with the\nlight coming from a mixed population of giants of all ages. However, the scale\nheights for these galaxies are estimated statistically from near-IR surface\nphotometry of edge-on galaxies. The scale height estimate is therefore\ndominated by a population of older (> 2 Gyr) red giants. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the importance of measuring the velocity dispersion for the same\nolder population of stars that is used to estimate the vertical scale height.\nWe present an analysis of the vertical kinematics of K-giants in the solar\nvicinity. We find the vertical velocity distribution best fit by two components\nwith dispersions of 9.6 +/- 0.5 km/s and 18.6 +/- 1.0 km/s, which we interpret\nas the dispersions of the young and old disc populations respectively.\nCombining the (single) measured velocity dispersion of the total young + old\ndisc population (13.0 +/- 0.1 km/s) with the scale height estimated for the\nolder population would underestimate the disc surface density by a factor of ~\n2. Such a disc would have a peak rotational velocity that is only 70% of that\nfor the maximal disc, thus making it appear submaximal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 02:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

However, the investigation on its theoretical insight is\nstill a blank. To this issue, this study attempts to provide some new\ntheoretical understanding under the SPL scheme.

A critical issue for forming SMSs is stellar UV feedback, which may\nlimit the stellar mass growth via accretion. In this paper we study the\nevolution of an accreting SMS and its UV emissivity under conditions of\nrealistic variable accretion from a self-gravitating circumstellar disc. First\nwe conduct a 2D hydrodynamical simulation to follow the long-term protostellar\naccretion until the stellar mass exceeds $10^4~M_\\odot$. The disc fragments due\nto gravitational instability, creating a number of small clumps that rapidly\nmigrate inward to fall onto the star. The resulting accretion history is thus\nhighly time-dependent: short episodic accretion bursts are followed by longer,\nrelative quiescent phases. We show that the circumstellar disc for the\nso-called direct collapse model is more unstable and generates greater\nvariability over shorter timescales than normal Pop III cases. We conduct a\npost-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretion\nhistory. Our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of the\naccretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almost\nconstant effective temperature at $T_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 5000$ K as the stellar\nmass increases. The resulting UV feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretion\ndue to the low flux of stellar UV photons, thus verifying our implicit\nassumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations. The\ninsensitivity of stellar evolution to variable accretion is attributed to the\nfact that typical timescales of variability, $\\lesssim 10^3$ years, are too\nshort to affect the stellar structure. We argue that this evolution will\ncontinue until the SMS eventually collapses to produce a massive black hole by\nthe general relativistic instability after the stellar mass reaches $\\gtrsim\n10^5~M_\\odot$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 07:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In this paper, we consider passive localization of multiple\ntargets with one transmitter and several receivers based on time of arrival\n(TOA) measurements. Existing studies assume that positions of receivers are\nperfectly known. However, in practice, receivers' positions might be\ninaccurate, which leads to localization error of targets. We propose factor\ngraph (FG)-based belief propagation (BP) algorithms to locate the passive\ntargets and improve the position accuracy of receivers simultaneously. Due to\nthe nonlinearity of the likelihood function, messages on the FG cannot be\nderived in closed form. We propose both sample-based and parametric methods to\nsolve this problem. In the sample-based BP algorithm, particle swarm\noptimization is employed to reduce the number of particles required to\nrepresent messages. In parametric BP algorithm, the nonlinear terms in messages\nare linearized, which results in closed-form Gaussian message passing on FG.\nThe Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) for passive targets localization with\nuncertain receivers is derived to evaluate the performance of the proposed\nalgorithms. Simulation results show that both the sample-based and parametric\nBP algorithms outperform the conventional method and attain the proposed BCRB.\nReceivers' positions can also be improved via the proposed BP algorithms.\nAlthough the parametric BP algorithm performs slightly worse than the\nsample-based BP method, it could be more attractive in practical applications\ndue to the significantly lower computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 10:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

The ($\\small 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{3}$) phase of silicene on\nAg(111) was used in this study since it can be formed homogeneously across the\nentire surface of the Ag substrate. Low energy electron diffraction and\nscanning tunneling microscopy data clearly show that hydrogenation changes the\nstructure of silicene on Ag(111) resulting in a (1 $\\times$ 1) periodicity with\nrespect to the silicene lattice. The hydrogenated silicene also exhibits a\nquasi-regular ($\\small 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{3}$)-like arrangement of\nvacancies. Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy revealed two dispersive\nbands which can be unambiguously assigned to silicane. The common top of these\nbands is located at $\\small \\backsim$ 0.9 eV below the Fermi level. We find\nthat the experimental bands are closely reproduced by the theoretical band\nstructure of free standing silicane with H adsorbed on the upper hexagonal\nsub-lattice of silicene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 13:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 09:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

In order to\novercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,\nwe present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods to\nextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only\nthat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion\nresults generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but we\nalso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with\na spatial resolution of $\\Delta r=0.001R$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharp\ndiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (Deheuvels et al. 2014). The\nresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity of\nabout $\\langle\\Omega_c/2\\pi\\rangle=748\\pm18$~nHz and provide evidence for an\nangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part of\nthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize the\nrotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The\nangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burning\nshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching\nan average value in the convective envelope of\n$\\langle\\Omega_s/2\\pi\\rangle=68\\pm22$~nHz. Hence, the core in KIC~4448777 is\nrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.\nWe conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficient\nto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense\ncore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative\nregion and in the convective envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 13:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The luminosity functions show significant and rapid\nluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02<z<0.2$, with L$_{IR}^*\n\\propto (1+z)^{6.0\\pm0.4}$ and $\\Phi_{IR}^* \\propto (1+z)^{-2.1\\pm0.4}$,\nL$_{250}^* \\propto (1+z)^{5.3\\pm0.2}$ and $\\Phi_{250}^* \\propto\n(1+z)^{-0.6\\pm0.4}$ estimated using the IR bolometric and the 250$\\,\\mu$m LFs\nrespectively.

Thus, the manifold assumption is replaced by a more\ngeneral measure-based assumption.\n  The measure-based diffusion kernel incorporates two separate independent\nrepresentations. The first determines a measure that correlates with a density\nthat represents normal behaviors and patterns in the data. The second consists\nof the analyzed multidimensional data points.\n  In this paper, we present a representation framework for data analysis of\ndatasets that is based on a closed-form decomposition of the measure-based\nkernel. The proposed representation preserves pairwise diffusion distances that\ndoes not depend on the data size while being invariant to scale. For a\nstationary data, no out-of-sample extension is needed for embedding newly\narrived data points in the representation space. Several aspects of the\npresented methodology are demonstrated on analytically generated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 15:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

In this paper, we present a method that maximizes the effectiveness\nof newly trained relation extractors at a minimal annotation cost. Manual\nlabeling can be significantly reduced by Distant Supervision, which is a method\nto construct training data automatically by aligning a large text corpus with\nan existing knowledge base of known facts. For example, all sentences\nmentioning both 'Barack Obama' and 'US' may serve as positive training\ninstances for the relation born_in(subject,object). However, distant\nsupervision typically results in a highly noisy training set: many training\nsentences do not really express the intended relation. We propose to combine\ndistant supervision with minimal manual supervision in a technique called\nfeature labeling, to eliminate noise from the large and noisy initial training\nset, resulting in a significant increase of precision. We further improve on\nthis approach by introducing the Semantic Label Propagation method, which uses\nthe similarity between low-dimensional representations of candidate training\ninstances, to extend the training set in order to increase recall while\nmaintaining high precision. Our proposed strategy for generating training data\nis studied and evaluated on an established test collection designed for\nknowledge base population tasks.

The surveys investigated the students'\nexperiences at the university, particularly in the Mathematics Department. In\naddition, this paper explores an alternative way to structure math classes,\nspecifically assignment scheduling, in order to help students develop healthy\nstudy habits. The scores for the alternative-scheduled assignments are\nstatistically analyzed and compared to scores of the typical-scheduled\nassignments currently implemented at the University of Waterloo. Finally, this\npaper briefly discusses the importance of socialization, specifically for young\nmathematicians and scientists, and potential consequences of reduced social\nexposure in the Digital Age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 02:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

We derive a macroscopic\nmodel described by a parameter taking nine possible values corresponding to the\npossible minimal microscopic patterns and modulated phases of the chiral\nmolecules. We describe the overall behaviour by means of an interaction energy\nof perimeter type between such phases. This energy is a crystalline perimeter\nenergy, highlighting preferred directions for the interfaces between ensembles\nof molecules labelled by different values of the parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 21:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

First, this proposed approach performs the\nPart-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using\nBigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous\nword at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those\ndictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which\nare associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact\nsense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus\nfor Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed\napproach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal\nexecution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we\nhave found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is\nfound for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 11:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}
