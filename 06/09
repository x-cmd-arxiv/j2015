As a consequence, TINnoTS is optimal from a\ngeneralized Degrees of Freedom (gDoF) perspective for all channel gains except\nfor a subset of zero measure. TINnoTS with Gaussian inputs is known to be\noptimal to within 1/2 bit for a subset of the weak interference regime.\nSurprisingly, this paper shows that TINnoTS is gDoG optimal in all parameter\nregimes, even in the strong and very strong interference regimes where joint\ndecoding of Gaussian inputs is optimal. For approximate optimality of TINnoTS\nin all parameter regimes it is critical to use non-Gaussian inputs. This work\nthus proposes to use mixed inputs as channel inputs where a mixed input is the\nsum of a discrete and a Gaussian random variable. Interestingly, compared to\nthe Han-Kobayashi inner bound, the discrete part of a mixed input is shown to\neffectively act as a common message in the sense that, although treated as\nnoise, its effect on the achievable rate region is as if it were jointly\ndecoded together with the desired messages at a non-intended receiver. The\npractical implication is that a discrete interfering input is a 'friend', while\na Gaussian interfering input is in general a 'foe'. Since TINnoTS requires\nneither joint decoding nor time sharing, the results of this paper are\napplicable to a variety of oblivions or asynchronous channels, such as the\nblock asynchronous G-IC (which is not an information stable) and the G-IC with\npartial codebook knowledge at one or more receivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 17:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that\nthe added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability. The\napproach, can also be interpreted as a slightly generalized renormalization\nprocedure for massless QCD, which seems able to incorporate the mass generating\nproperties for the quarks of the NJL model, in a renormalizable way.

Yet the practice of data\nanalysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and\nhypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters\nare tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused.\nAn investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in\n(Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating\nexpectations of adaptively chosen functions.\n  In this paper, we give a simple and practical method for reusing a holdout\n(or testing) set to validate the accuracy of hypotheses produced by a learning\nalgorithm operating on a training set. Reusing a holdout set adaptively\nmultiple times can easily lead to overfitting to the holdout set itself. We\ngive an algorithm that enables the validation of a large number of adaptively\nchosen hypotheses, while provably avoiding overfitting. We illustrate the\nadvantages of our algorithm over the standard use of the holdout set via a\nsimple synthetic experiment.\n  We also formalize and address the general problem of data reuse in adaptive\ndata analysis. We show how the differential-privacy based approach given in\n(Dwork et al., 2014) is applicable much more broadly to adaptive data analysis.\nWe then show that a simple approach based on description length can also be\nused to give guarantees of statistical validity in adaptive settings.

Poznanski (2013) has recently\nsuggested an observational correlation between the ejecta velocities and the\ninferred masses of the red supergiant progenitors of type II-P explosions,\nwhich implies that the kinetic energy of the ejecta ($E_{\\textrm{kin}}$)\nincreases with the mass of the progenitor. I point out that the same conclusion\ncan be reached from the model-free observed correlation between the ejected\n$^{56}$Ni masses ($M_{\\textrm{Ni}}$) and the luminosities of the progenitors\nfor type II supernovae, which was reported by Fraser et al. (2011). This\ncorrelation is in an agreement with the predictions of the collapse-induced\nthermonuclear explosions (CITE) for CCSNe and in a possible contradiction with\nthe predictions of the neutrino mechanism. I show that a correlation between\n$M_{\\textrm{Ni}}$ and $E_{\\textrm{kin}}$ holds for all types of CCSNe\n(including type Ibc). This correlation suggests a common mechanism for all\nCCSNe, which is predicted for CITE, but is not produced by current simulations\nof the neutrino mechanism. Furthermore, the typical values of\n$E_{\\textrm{kin}}$ and $M_{\\textrm{Ni}}$ for type Ibc explosions are larger by\nan order of a magnitude than the typical values for II-P explosions, a fact\nwhich disfavors progenitors with the same initial mass range for these\nexplosions. Instead, the progenitors of type Ibc explosions could be massive\nWolf-Rayet stars, which are predicted to yield strong explosions with low\nejecta masses (as observed) according to CITE. In this case, there is no\ndeficit of high mass progenitors for CCSNe, which was suggested under the\nassumption of a similar mass range for the progenitors of types II-P and Ibc\nsupernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

We argue that\nsubstructure variables cannot use HCAL information to access the microscopic\nnature of jets much narrower than the hadronic shower size, which we call\nsuperboosted massive jets. It implies that roughly 15% of their transverse\nenergy profile remains inaccessible due to the presence of long-lived neutral\nhadrons. This part of the jet substructure is also subject to order-one\nfluctuations. We demonstrate that the effects of the fluctuations are not\nreduced when a global correction to jet variables is applied. The above leads\nto fundamental limitations in the ability to extract intrinsic information from\njets in the superboosted regime. The neutral fraction of a jet is correlated\nwith its flavor. This leads to an interesting and possibly useful difference\nbetween superboosted W/Z/h/t jets and their corresponding backgrounds.

Using strongly\ncomplementary observables, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for\nMermin non-locality in abstract process theories. We show that the existence of\nmore phases than classical points (aka eigenstates) is not sufficient, and that\nthe key to Mermin non-locality lies in the presence of certain algebraically\nnon-trivial phases. This allows us to show that fRel, a favourite toy model for\ncategorical quantum mechanics, is Mermin local. We show Mermin non-locality to\nbe the key resource ensuring the device-independent security of the HBB CQ\n(N,N) family of Quantum Secret Sharing protocols. Finally, we challenge the\nunspoken assumption that the measurements involved in Mermin-type scenarios\nshould be complementary (like the pair X,Y), opening the doors to a much wider\nclass of potential experimental setups than currently employed. In short, we\ngive conditions for Mermin non-locality tests on any number of systems, where\neach party has an arbitrary number of measurement choices, where each\nmeasurement has an arbitrary number of outcomes and further, that works in any\nabstract process theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 20:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 12:48:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 01:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-06"}

For oblate modes under a\nhomologous flow, a monatomic gas is governed by the Schwarzschild criterion for\nbuoyant stability. Under buoyantly unstable conditions, fluctuations experience\npower-law growth in time, with a growth rate that depends upon mean flow\ngradients and is independent of mode number. If the flow accelerates throughout\nthe implosion, oblate modes amplify by a factor (2C)^(|N0| ti)$, where C is the\nconvergence ratio of the implosion, N0 is the initial buoyancy frequency and ti\nis the implosion time scale. If, instead, the implosion consists of a coasting\nphase followed by stagnation, oblate modes amplify by a factor exp(pi |N0| ts),\nwhere N0 is the buoyancy frequency at stagnation and ts is the stagnation time\nscale. Even under stable conditions, vorticity fluctuations grow due to the\nconservation of angular momentum as the gas is compressed. For non-monatomic\ngases, this results in weak oscillatory growth under conditions that would\notherwise be buoyantly stable; this over-stability is consistent with the\nconservation of wave action in the fluid frame. By evolving the complete set of\nlinear equations, it is demonstrated that oblate modes are the fastest-growing\nmodes and that high mode numbers are required to reach this limit (Legendre\nmode l > 100 for spherical flows). Finally, comparisons are made with a\nLagrangian hydrodynamics code, and it is found that a numerical resolution of\n~30 zones per wavelength is required to capture these solutions accurately.\nThis translates to an angular resolution of ~(12/l) degrees, or < 0.1 degree to\nresolve the fastest-growing modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 20:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

We then used these splittings to\nestimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and\nby applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory (Goupil et al.\n2013).

This\ninvolves the Loewner--Nirenberg-type problem of finding on the interior a\nmetric that is both conformally compact and of constant scalar curvature. Our\nfirst result is an asymptotic solution to all orders. This involves log terms.\nWe show that the coefficient of the first of these is a new hypersurface\nconformal invariant which generalises to higher dimensions the important\nWillmore invariant of embedded surfaces. We call this the obstruction density.\nFor even dimensional hypersurfaces it is a fundamental curvature invariant. We\nmake the latter notion precise and show that the obstruction density and the\ntrace-free second fundamental form are, in a suitable sense, the only such\ninvariants. We also show that this obstruction to smoothness is a scalar\ndensity analog of the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor for Poincare-Einstein\nmetrics; in part this is achieved by exploiting Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand\nmachinery. The solution to the constant scalar curvature problem provides a\nsmooth hypersurface defining density determined canonically by the embedding up\nto the order of the obstruction. We give two key applications: the construction\nof conformal hypersurface invariants and the construction of conformal\ndifferential operators. In particular we present an infinite family of\nconformal powers of the Laplacian determined canonically by the conformal\nembedding. In general these depend non-trivially on the embedding and, in\ncontrast to Graham-Jennes-Mason-Sparling operators intrinsic to even\ndimensional hypersurfaces, exist to all orders.

It is shown that there are\nimportant differences between relativistic and non-relativistic scattering\nconcerning long-range. In particular, it is proved that the electric potential\ncan be recovered without assuming the knowledge of the long-range part of the\nmagnetic potential, which has to be supposed in the non-relativistic case.

Over evolutionary timescales, these\nconstraints feed back onto smaller molecular subnetworks comprising the\norganism. The evolution of biological networks is studied by considering a\nnetwork of a few nodes embedded in a larger context. Taking into account this\nfact that any network under study is actually embedded in a larger context, we\ndefine network architecture, not on the basis of physical interactions alone,\nbut rather as a specification of the manner in which constraints are placed\nupon the states of its nodes. We show that such network architectures\npossessing cycles in their topology, in contrast to those that do not, may be\nsubjected to unsatisfiable constraints. This may be a significant factor\nleading to selection biased against those network architectures where such\ninconsistent constraints are more likely to arise. We proceed to quantify the\nlikelihood of inconsistency arising as a function of network architecture\nfinding that, in the absence of sampling bias over the space of possible\nconstraints and for a given network size, networks with a larger number of\ncycles are more likely to have unsatisfiable constraints placed upon them. Our\nresults identify a constraint that, at least in isolation, would contribute to\na bias in the evolutionary process toward more hierarchical-modular versus\ncompletely connected network architectures.

In\nthe case of delay sensitive applications, a large delay might not be acceptable\nand a solution to properly manage congestion events while maintaining a low\nend-to-end delay is required. Delay-based congestion algorithms are a viable\nsolution as they target to limit the experienced end-to-end delay.\nUnfortunately, they do not perform well when sharing the bandwidth with\ncongestion control algorithms not regulated by delay constraints (e.g.,\nloss-based algorithms). Our target is to fill this gap, proposing a novel\ncongestion control algorithm for delay-constrained communication over best\neffort packet switched networks. The proposed algorithm is able to maintain a\nbounded queueing delay when competing with other delay-based flows, and avoid\nstarvation when competing with loss-based flows. We adopt the well-known\nprice-based distributed mechanism as congestion control, but: 1) we introduce a\nnovel non-linear mapping between the experienced delay and the price function\nand 2) we combine both delay and loss information into a single price term\nbased on packet interarrival measurements. We then provide a stability analysis\nfor our novel algorithm and we show its performance in the simulation results\ncarried out in the NS3 framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm is able to: achieve good intra-protocol fairness properties,\ncontrol efficiently the end-to-end delay, and finally, protect the flow from\nstarvation when other flows cause the queuing delay to grow excessively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 07:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 12:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 11:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

The\nclass of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces carries\nclose ties to the property of complete integrability, as manifested by the\nexistence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws and associated linear\nproblems. As such, it contains many important known examples of integrable\nequations, like the sine-Gordon, Liouville and KdV equations. It also gives\nrise to many new families of integrable equations. The question we address in\nthis paper concerns the local isometric immersion of pseudo-spherical surfaces\nin ${\\bf E}^{3}$ from the perspective of the differential equations that give\nrise to the metrics. Indeed, a classical theorem in the differential geometry\nof surfaces states that any pseudo-spherical surface can be locally\nisometrically immersed in ${\\bf E}^{3}$. In the case of the sine-Gordon\nequation, one can derive an expression for the second fundamental form of the\nimmersion that depends only on a jet of finite order of the solution of the\npde. A natural question is to know if this remarkable property extends to\nequations other than the sine-Gordon equation within the class of differential\nequations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces. In an earlier paper [11], we\nhave shown that this property fails to hold for all other second order\nequations, except for those belonging to a very special class of evolution\nequations. In the present paper, we consider a class of evolution equations for\n$u(x,t)$ of order $k\\geq 3$ describing pseudo-spherical surfaces. We show that\nwhenever an isometric immersion in ${\\bf E}^3$ exists, depending on a jet of\nfinite order of $u$, then the coefficients of the second fundamental forms are\nfunctions of the independent variables $x$ and $t$ only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 07:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

Previous results indicate that one can expect\nsubstantial reductions in variance if these groups are formed so to contain\nexactly as many units as treatment conditions. This approach can be contrasted\nto threshold blocking which, instead of specifying a fixed size, requires that\nthe groups contain a minimum number of units. In this paper, I investigate the\nadvantages of respective method. In particular, I show that threshold blocking\nis superior to fixed-sized blocking in the sense that it always finds a weakly\nbetter grouping for any objective and sample. However, this does not\nnecessarily hold when the objective function of the blocking problem is\nunknown, and a fixed-sized design can perform better in that case. I\nspecifically examine the factors that govern how the methods perform in the\ncommon situation where the objective is to reduce the estimator's variance, but\nwhere groups are constructed based on covariates. This reveals that the\nrelative performance of threshold blocking improves when the covariates become\nmore predictive of the outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 08:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 15:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-31"}

A phenomenological study of the experimental data\nfor $R_{AA}(p_{T})$ is performed to constrain the two parameters with\nsimultaneous $\\chi^2/{\\rm d.o.f}$ fits to RHIC as well as LHC data. We obtain\nfor energetic quarks $\\hat q_{0}\\approx 1.1 \\pm 0.2$ GeV$^2$/fm and\n$\\lambda_{0}\\approx 0.4 \\pm 0.03$ fm in central $Au+Au$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, while $\\hat q_{0}\\approx 1.7 \\pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm, and\n$\\lambda_{0}\\approx 0.5 \\pm 0.05$ fm in central $Pb+Pb$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. Numerical analysis shows that the best fit favors a\nmultiple scattering picture for the energetic jets propagating through the bulk\nmedium, with a moderate averaged number of gluon emissions. Based on the best\nconstraints for $\\lambda_{0}$ and $\\tau_0$, the estimated value for the\nmean-squared transverse momentum broadening is moderate which implies that the\nhard jets go through the medium with small reflection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 09:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 10:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 09:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Recent papers have presented\nconstructions which increase the coefficient of the lower bound to be at or\njust below 3/8, but only for sparse sets of degree d related to primes of\nspecific congruence classes. By applying results from number theory these\nconstructions can be extended to be valid for every degree above some\nthreshold, establishing an improved asymptotic lower bound approaching 3/8. The\nconstructions use the direct product of the multiplicative and additive\nsubgroups of a Galois field and a specific coprime cyclic group.

To cope with this issue, a common\ncountermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect\nsuspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve\nthe effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly\naffected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain\nalarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is\nuncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is\ncommon when the area to be secured is wide such as in border patrolling and\nfair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first\nPatrolling Security Game model where a Defender is supported by a spatially\nuncertain alarm system which non-deterministically generates signals once a\ntarget is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy in arbitrary\ngraphs is APX-hard even in zero-sum games and we provide two (exponential time)\nexact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms.\nFurthermore, we analyse what happens in environments with special topologies,\nshowing that in linear and cycle graphs the optimal patrolling strategy can be\nfound in polynomial time, de facto allowing our algorithms to be used in\nreal-life scenarios, while in trees the problem is NP-hard. Finally, we show\nthat without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling\nstrategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at\nbest. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates,\nwhich, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our\nmethods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 10:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

Recent studies showed that IFRS are\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts >=2. This work explores\nthe far-infrared emission of IFRS, providing crucial information on the star\nforming and AGN activity of IFRS and on the potential link between IFRS and\nhigh-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs). A sample of six IFRS was observed with\nthe Herschel Space Observatory between 100 um and 500 um. Using these results,\nwe constrained the nature of IFRS by modelling their broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution (SED). Furthermore, we set an upper limit on their infrared SED\nand decomposed their emission into contributions from an AGN and from star\nforming activity. All six observed IFRS were undetected in all five Herschel\nfar-infrared channels (stacking limits: sigma = 0.74 mJy at 100 um, sigma =\n3.45 mJy at 500 um). Based on our SED modelling, we find that the IFRS analysed\nin this work can only be explained by objects that fulfil the selection\ncriteria of HzRGs. More precisely, IFRS could be (a) known HzRGs at very high\nredshifts (z >= 10.5), (b) low-luminosity siblings of HzRGs with additional\ndust obscuration at lower redshifts, (c) scaled or unscaled versions of Cygnus\nA at any redshift, and (d) scaled and dust-obscured radio-loud quasars or\ncompact steep spectrum sources.

Much work has focused on the\nrole of spin-orbit coupling at heavy metal/ferromagnet interfaces in generating\ncurrent-induced spin-orbit torques. However, the strong influence of the\nspin-orbit-derived Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on spin textures in\nthese materials is now becoming apparent. Recent reports suggest DMI-stabilized\nhomochiral domain walls (DWs) can be driven with high efficiency by spin torque\nfrom the spin Hall effect. However, the influence of the DMI on the\ncurrent-induced magnetization switching has not been explored nor is yet\nwell-understood, due in part to the difficulty of disentangling spin torques\nand spin textures in nano-sized confined samples.

However, this single principle takes very different mathematical\nforms, with very different behaviors, depending on how one treats perturbed\nmotion. Furthermore, any description of perturbed motion can be altered by a\ngauge transformation. In this paper, I clarify the relationship between two\ntreatments of perturbed motion and the gauge freedom in each. I first show\nexplicitly how one common treatment, called the Gralla-Wald approximation, can\nbe derived from a second, called the self-consistent approximation. I next\npresent a general treatment of smooth gauge transformations in both\napproximations, in which I emphasise that the approximations' governing\nequations can be formulated in an invariant manner. All of these analyses are\ncarried through second perturbative order, but the methods are general enough\nto go to any order. Furthermore, the tools I develop, and many of the results,\nshould have broad applicability to any description of perturbed motion,\nincluding osculating-geodesic and two-timescale descriptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 13:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2015 16:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

Since\nquantum entanglement in a system evolves in time and is continuously subjected\nto environmental degradation, a nonequilibrium description by way of open\nquantum systems is called for. To identify the key issues and the contributing\nfactors that may permit `hot entanglement' to exist, or the lack thereof, we\ncarry out a model study of two spatially-separated, coupled oscillators in a\nshared bath depicted by a finite-temperature scalar field. From the Langevin\nequations we derived for the normal modes and the entanglement measure\nconstructed from the covariance matrix we examine the interplay between direct\ncoupling, field-induced interaction and finite separation on the structure of\nlate-time entanglement. We show that the coupling between oscillators plays a\ncrucial role in sustaining entanglement at intermediate temperatures and over\nfinite separations. In contrast, the field-induced interaction between the\noscillators which is a non-Markovian effect, becomes very ineffective at high\ntemperature. We determine the critical temperature above which entanglement\ndisappears to be bounded in the leading order by the inverse frequency of the\ncenter-of-mass mode of the reduced oscillator system, a result not unexpected,\nwhich rules out hot entanglement in such settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 14:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

However, we report three stars\npresenting abnormal lithium behavior in the CoRoT fields. These parameters\nallow us to properly characterize the intrinsic properties of the stars in\nthese fields. Our results reveal important differences in the distributions of\nmetallicity, $T_{\\rm eff}$, and evolutionary status for stars belonging to\ndifferent CoRoT fields, in agreement with results obtained independently from\nground-based photometric surveys. Conclusions: Our spectroscopic catalog, by\nproviding much-needed spectroscopic information for a large sample of CoRoT\ntargets, will be of key importance for the successful accomplishment of several\ndifferent programs related to the CoRoT mission, thus it will help further\nboost the scientific return associated with this space mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 15:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The stochastic forces are obtained for a rotor\nblade element using full field turbulence simulated wind data input and\ncompared with the classical BEM and dynamic stall models for identical\nconditions. The comparison shows that the stochastic model generates additional\nextended dynamic response in terms of local force fluctuations.

Based on operator splitting, finite volume adaptive\nmultiresolution and high order time integrators with specific stability\nproperties for each operator, this strategy yields high computational\nefficiency for large multidimensional computations on standard architectures\nsuch as powerful workstations. However, the data structure of the original\nimplementation, based on trees of pointers, provides limited opportunities for\nefficiency enhancements, while posing serious challenges in terms of parallel\nprogramming and load balancing.

This method is only capable of unambiguously measuring range within\nan interval of length equal to the wavelength of the signal. To address this\nproblem signals of multiple different wavelengths can be transmitted. The range\ncan then be measured within an interval of length equal to the least common\nmultiple of these wavelengths. Estimation of the range requires solution of a\nproblem from computational number theory called the closest lattice point\nproblem. Algorithms to solve this problem require a basis for this lattice.\nConstructing a basis is non-trivial and an explicit construction has only been\ngiven in the case that the wavelengths can be scaled to pairwise relatively\nprime integers. In this paper we present an explicit construction of a basis\nwithout this assumption on the wavelengths. This is important because the\naccuracy of the range estimator depends upon the wavelengths. Simulations\nindicate that significant improvement in accuracy can be achieved by using\nwavelengths that cannot be scaled to pairwise relatively prime integers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 07:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}
