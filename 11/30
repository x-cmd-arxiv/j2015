Yet current ecological and evolutionary theory addressing HT is\nlimited. We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of two populations\nthat compete for resources and exchange horizontally (transfer) an otherwise\nvertically inherited trait. Competition influences individual demographics,\naffecting population size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. We\ncapture this feedback with a stochastic individual-based model, from which we\nderive a deterministic approximation for large populations. The interaction\nbetween horizontal transfer and competition makes possible the stable (or\nbi-stable) polymorphic maintenance of deleterious traits (including costly\nplasmids). When transfer rates are of a general density-dependent form,\ntransfer stochasticity contributes strongly to population fluctuations. For an\ninitially rare trait, we describe the probabilistic dynamics of invasion and\nfixation. Acceleration of fixation by HT is faster when competition is weak in\nthe resident population. Thus, HT can have a major impact on the distribution\nof mutational effects that are fixed, and our model provides a basis for a\ngeneral theory of the influence of HT on eco-evolutionary dynamics and\nadaptation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2015 18:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

Building upon Carleial-Hellman's secrecy coding, Wyner's\nsecrecy coding, the frameworks of superposition coding and Marton's coding\ntogether with techniques such as rate splitting and indirect decoding,\nachievable rate regions are developed. The proposed regions are compared with\nthose satisfying joint secrecy and without secrecy constraints, and the\nindividual secrecy capacity regions for special cases are characterized. In\nparticular, capacity region for the deterministic case is established, and for\nthe Gaussian model, a constant gap (i.e., 0.5 bits within the individual\nsecrecy capacity region) result is obtained. Overall, when compared with the\njoint secrecy constraint, the results allow for trading-off secrecy level and\nthroughput in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2015 19:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

Also of course precision\nstudies at low energy facilities can be useful for detecting new phenomena. For\ndirect production of new particles over 5-10 TeV a new high energy collider\nperhaps at 100 TeV is highly desirable. Indeed, a very strong physics case can\nbe made for such a machine. It can be used to significantly improve many bounds\nas well as allow a multitude of direct searches in many channels without\nrelying on specific models. Naturalness can be tested by another factor of\nabout 50 past LHC to O($10^{-4}$), a valuable achievement in itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2015 21:01:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

To assess\nits basic characteristics we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations\nof supersonic SLs in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription for\ncooling. We demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base of\nthe SL inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large scale\nacoustic modes governing the evolution of the SL. These modes dominate the\ntransport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot be\ncharacterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g.\n$\\alpha$-viscosity). The global nature of the wave-driven transport should have\nimportant implications for triggering Type I X-ray bursts in low mass X-ray\nbinaries. The nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks drives\neffective re-arrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical properties\nof the flow) and deceleration of the SL, which ultimately becomes transonic and\nsusceptible to regular Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We interpret this\nevolution in terms of the global structure of the SL and suggest that mixing of\nthe SL material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective only\nat intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow has\ndecelerated appreciably. In the near-equatorial regions the transport is\ndominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient.

Observing Jupiter's synchrotron emission from the Earth remains\ntoday the sole method to scrutinize the distribution and dynamical behavior of\nthe ultra energetic electrons magnetically trapped around the planet (because\nin-situ particle data are limited in the inner magnetosphere). Aims. We perform\nthe first resolved and low-frequency imaging of the synchrotron emission with\nLOFAR at 127 MHz. The radiation comes from low energy electrons (~1-30 MeV)\nwhich map a broad region of Jupiter's inner magnetosphere. Methods (see article\nfor complete abstract) Results. The first resolved images of Jupiter's\nradiation belts at 127-172 MHz are obtained along with total integrated flux\ndensities. They are compared with previous observations at higher frequencies\nand show a larger extent of the synchrotron emission source (>=4 $R_J$).

However, we are not aware of real-time systems that\ncompute coresets in a rate of dozens of frames per second. In this paper we\nsuggest a framework to turn theorems to such systems using coresets. We begin\nwith a proof of independent interest, that any set of $n$ matrices in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ whose sum is $S$, has a positively weighted subset\nwhose sum has the same center of mass (mean) and orientation (left+right\nsingular vectors) as $S$, and consists of $O(dr)$ matrices (independent of\n$n$), where $r\\leq d$ is the rank of $S$. We provide an algorithm that computes\nthis (core) set in one pass over possibly infinite stream of matrices in\n$d^{O(1)}$ time per matrix insertion. By maintaining such a coreset for\nkinematic (moving) set of $n$ points, we can run pose-estimation algorithms,\nsuch as Kabsch or PnP, on the small coresets, instead of the $n$ points, in\nreal-time using weak devices, while obtaining the same results.

For each subsample we measure\nboth the projected cross-correlation function ($w_{p}(r_{p})$) relative to a\nreference galaxy sample, and an average mass of the host dark matter halos\n($M_{halo}$) . For comparison we have also estimated the $w_{p}(r_{p})$ for the\nfull galaxy population and the subset of satellite galaxies.

The full\ngalaxy population and the subset of satellites show similar clustering\nproperties in all cases. However, they are similar to the centrals only at high\nmasses ($M_{\\star} \\geq 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$).

Here we\ninvestigate FRB121102, detected at Arecibo telescope and remarkable for its\nunusually large spectral index. After extensive study we conclude that the\nspectral index is caused by a nebula with free-free absorption. We find that\nputative nebula must lie beyond the Milky Way. We conclude that FRBs are of\nextra-galactic origin and that they arise in dense star-forming regions. The\nchallenge with extra-galactic models is the the high volumetric rate of FRBs.\nThis high rate allows us to eliminate all models of catastrophic stellar\ndeaths. Hyper-giant flares from young magnetars emerge as the most likely\nprogenitors. Some of the consequences are: (i) Intergalactic FRB models can be\nsafely ignored. (ii) The rich ISM environment of young magnetars can result in\nsignificant contribution to DM, Rotation Measure (RM) and in some cases to\nsignificant free-free optical depth. (iii) The star-forming regions in the host\ngalaxies can contribute significantly to the DM. Including this contribution\nreduces the inferred distances to FRBs and correspondingly increases the\nvolumetric rate of FRBs (and, in turn, may require that giant flares can also\nproduce FRBs). (iv) FRBs are likely to be suppressed at lower frequencies.\nConversely, searching for FRBs at higher frequencies (2-5 GHz) would be\nattractive. (v) The blast wave which produces the radio emission can undergo\nrapid deceleration if the circum-burst medium is dense (as maybe the case for\nFRB121102), leading to X-ray, radio and possibly gamma-ray emission. (vi)\nGalaxies with high star formation rate host will have a higher FRB rate.\nHowever, such FRBs will have differing DMs owing to differing local\ncontributions. (vi) The DM and RM of FRBs will prove to be noisy probes of the\nintergalactic medium (density, magnetic field) and cosmography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 02:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

Following a brief review of the methods used to\nisolate excitations of the nucleon in lattice QCD, and drawing on recent\nadvances, we'll see how a consensus on the low-lying spectrum has emerged among\nmany different lattice groups. To provide insight into the nature of these\nstates we'll review the wave functions and electromagnetic form factors that\nare available for a few of these states. Consistent with the Luscher formalism\nfor extracting phase shifts from finite volume spectra, the Hamiltonian\napproach to effective field theory in finite volume can provide guidance on the\nmanner in which physical quantities manifest themselves in the finite volume of\nthe lattice.

Variations in lighting\nconditions, environment and pose changes across camera views make\nre-identification a challenging problem. Previous methods address these\nchallenges by designing specific features or by learning a distance function.\nWe propose a hierarchical feature learning framework that learns invariant\nrepresentations from labeled image pairs. A mapping is learned such that the\nextracted features are invariant for images belonging to same individual across\nviews. To learn robust representations and to achieve better generalization to\nunseen data, the system has to be trained with a large amount of data.\nCritically, most of the person re-identification datasets are small. Manually\naugmenting the dataset by partial corruption of input data introduces\nadditional computational burden as it requires several training epochs to\nconverge. We propose a hierarchical network which incorporates a\nmarginalization technique that can reap the benefits of training on large\ndatasets without explicit augmentation.

The intertwining of the two\non the microscopic level, independent of lattice excitations, is especially\npronounced in heavy fermion compounds, rare earth cuprates, and iron pnictides.\nHere we point out that for a helical arrangement of localized spins, a variable\nmagnetic pitch length provides a unique tuning process from ferromagnetic to\nantiferromagnetic ground state in the long and short wavelength limits,\nrespectively. Such chemical or pressure adjustable helical order naturally\nprovides the possibility for continuous tuning between ferromagnetically and\nantiferromagnetically mediated superconductivity. At the same time, phonon\nmediated superconductivity is suppressed because of the local ferromagnetic\nspin configuration. We employ synchrotron-based magnetic x-ray diffraction\ntechniques to test these ideas in the recently discovered superconductor, MnP.\nThis sensitive probe directly reveals a reduced-moment, helical spin order at\nhigh pressure proximate to the superconducting state, with a tightened pitch in\ncomparison to that at ambient pressure where superconductivity is absent. The\ncorrelation between magnetic pitch length and superconducting transition\ntemperature in the (Cr/Mn/Fe)(P/As) family suggests a strategy for using spiral\nmagnets as interlocutors for spin fluctuation mediated superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 04:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-02"}

In the PA model, species are treated as\nstochastic binary variables that can either be present or absent in a\ncommunity: species can immigrate into the community from a regional species\npool and can go extinct due to competition and stochasticity.

However, due to the lack of\neffective quantum transport method to do disorder average, the important\neffects of disorders remain largely un-explored or poorly understood. Here, we\nreport a generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction method with coherent\npotential approximation for the non-equilibrium quantum transport simulation of\ndisordered nanoelectronics. In this method, the disorder average of various\nGreen's functions are computed by a generalized coherent potential\napproximation. A generalized non-equilibrium vertex correction algorithm is\nthen developed to calculate disorder average of the product of any two real\ntime single-particle Green's functions. We obtain nine non-equilibrium vertex\ncorrections and find they can be solved by a set of simple linear equations. As\na result, the averaged non-equilibrium density matrix and various important\ntransport properties, including averaged current, disordered induced current\nfluctuation and the averaged shot noise, can all be efficiently computed in a\nunified simple scheme. Moreover, the relationship between the non-equilibrium\nvertex correction method and the non-equilibrium coherent potential\napproximation theory is clarified, and we prove the non-equilibrium coherent\npotential equals the non-equilibrium vertex correction and this equivalence is\nguaranteed by the Keldysh's formulas. In addition, a generalized form of\nconditionally averaged non-equilibrium Green's function is derived to\nincorporate with density functional theory to enable first-principles quantum\ntransport simulation. Our approach provides a unified, efficient and\nself-consistent method for simulating non-equilibrium quantum transport through\ndisordered nanoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 07:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

While there are hundreds of known T-type brown dwarfs, the\nfirst generation of directly-imaged exoplanets were all L-type. Recently,\nKuzuhara et al. (2013) announced the discovery of GJ 504 b, the first T dwarf\nexoplanet. GJ 504 b provides a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a\nnew type of exoplanet with a ~500 K temperature that bridges the gap between\nthe first directly imaged planets (~1000 K) and our own Solar System's Jupiter\n(~130 K). We observed GJ 504 b in three narrow L-band filters (3.71, 3.88, and\n4.00 microns), spanning the red end of the broad methane fundamental absorption\nfeature (3.3 microns) as part of the LEECH exoplanet imaging survey. By\ncomparing our new photometry and literature photometry to a grid of custom\nmodel atmospheres, we were able to fit GJ 504 b's unusual spectral energy\ndistribution for the first time. We find that GJ 504 b is well-fit by models\nwith the following parameters: T_eff=544+/-10 K, g<600 m/s^2,\n[M/H]=0.60+/-0.12, cloud opacity parameter of f_sed=2-5, R=0.96+/-0.07 R_Jup,\nand log(L)=-6.13+/-0.03 L_Sun, implying a hot start mass of 3-30 M_jup for a\nconservative age range of 0.1-6.5 Gyr.

Successively the\nstrength of the potentials are varied in order to explore energy regions in\nwhich the two-body scattering lengths are close to the unitary limit. This\nstudy is motivated by the fact that in the nuclear system the singlet and\ntriplet scattering lengths are both large with respect to the range of the\ninteraction. Accordingly we expect evidence of universal behavior in the three-\nand four-nucleon systems that can be observed from the study of correlations\nbetween observables. In particular we concentrate in the behavior of the first\nexcited state of the three-nucleon system as the system moves away from the\nunitary limit.

We study large\nrandom economies within the GET framework, as templates of complex economies,\nand we find that a non-trivial phase transition occurs: the economy freezes in\na state where all production processes collapse when either the number of\nprimary goods or the number of available technologies fall below a critical\nthreshold. As in other examples of phase transitions in large random systems,\nthis is an unintended consequence of the growth in complexity. Our findings\nsuggest that the Industrial Revolution can be regarded as a sharp transition\nbetween different phases, but also imply that well developed economies can\ncollapse if too many intermediate goods are introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 22:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 22:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 07:38:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The assignment is\nconventionally based on the classification of the plasma species by the ratio\nof the transport to the local destruction frequencies. We show that the\nclassification is not exact due to the role of the time-dependent local\nproduction, and a measure is necessary to confirm the validity of the\nassignment. The main goal of this study is to evaluate a measure on the\nquasi-steady state assumptions of these models. Inspired by a chemical\nreduction technique called Intrinsic Low Dimensional Manifolds [2, 3], an\nestimate local source is provided at the transport time-scale. This source is a\ndeviation from the quasi-steady state for the particle and its value is\nassigned as an error of the quasi-steady state assumption. The propagation of\nthis error on the derived quantities is formulated in the Collisional Radiative\nModels. Based on the error a novel technique is proposed to discriminate the\nquasi-steady states. The developed analysis is applied to mercury and argon\nfluorescent lamps separately and the corresponding errors are presented.

A convective mass transfer establishes across the drop-film\ninterface and the tracer in the drop diffuses into the film flow. The Peclet\nnumber for the tracer in the film is large. The Peclet number Pe_d in the drop\nvaries from 0.01 to 1. The characteristic transport time in the drop is much\nlarger than in the film. We model the mass transfer of the tracer from the drop\nbulk into the film using an empirical model based on Newton's law of cooling.\nThis model is supported by a theoretical model solving the quasi-steady 2D\nadvection-diffusion equation in the film coupled with a time-dependent 1D\ndiffusion equation in the drop. We find excellent agreement between our\nexperimental data and the 2 models, which predict an exponential decrease in\ntime of the tracer concentration in the drop. The results are valid for all\ndrop and film Peclet numbers studied. The transport characteristic time is\nrelated to the drop diffusion time scale, as diffusion within the drop is the\nlimiting process.

Here we use discrete element method (DEM) simulations with\nsupporting qualitative experiments to explore the effect of the tumbler wall\nroughness on the segregation pattern, modeling the tumbler walls as either a\nclosely packed monolayer of fixed particles resulting in a rough wall, or as a\ngeometrically smooth wall. Even though the tumbler wall is in contact with the\nflowing layer only at its periphery, the impact of wall roughness is profound.\nSmooth walls tend toward a small-large-small (SLS) band pattern at the\npole-equator-pole at all but the highest fill fractions; rough walls tend\ntoward a large-small-large (LSL) band pattern at all but the lowest fill\nfractions. This comes about because smooth walls induce poleward axial drift of\nsmall particles and an equator-directed drift for large particles, resulting in\nan SLS band pattern. On the other hand, rough walls result in both sizes of\nparticles moving poleward at the surface of the flow, but due to radial\nsegregation, small particles percolate lower in the flowing layer where there\nis a return drift toward the equator while large particles remain at the\nsurface near the pole, resulting in an LSL band pattern. The tendency toward\neither of the two band patterns depends on the fill level in the tumbler and\nthe roughness of the tumbler's bounding wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 11:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Secondly, big data applications call for highly scalable feature\nselection algorithms in an online manner such that each feature can be\nprocessed in a sequential scan. We present SAOLA, a Scalable and Accurate\nOnLine Approach for feature selection in this paper. With a theoretical\nanalysis on bounds of the pairwise correlations between features, SAOLA employs\nnovel pairwise comparison techniques and maintain a parsimonious model over\ntime in an online manner. Furthermore, to deal with upcoming features that\narrive by groups, we extend the SAOLA algorithm, and then propose a new\ngroup-SAOLA algorithm for online group feature selection. The group-SAOLA\nalgorithm can online maintain a set of feature groups that is sparse at the\nlevels of both groups and individual features simultaneously.

Usually, MPTCP is combined with flow-based Equal-Cost Multi-Path\nRouting (ECMP), which uses random hashing to split the MPTCP subflows over\ndifferent paths. However, random hashing can be suboptimal as distinct subflows\nmay end up using the same paths, while other available paths remain unutilized.\nIn this paper, we explore an MPTCP-aware SDN controller that facilitates an\nalternative routing mechanism for the MPTCP subflows. The controller uses\npacket inspection to provide deterministic subflow assignment to paths. Using\nthe controller, we show that MPTCP can deliver significantly improved\nperformance when connections are not limited by the access links of hosts. To\nlessen the effect of throughput limitation due to access links, we also\ninvestigate the usage of multiple interfaces at the hosts.

The impact probability distribution of\n69 potentially threatening NEOs from these lists that produce 261 dynamically\ndistinct impact instances, or Virtual Impactors (VIs), were calculated using\nthe Asteroid Risk Mitigation and Optimization Research (ARMOR) tool in\nconjunction with OrbFit. ARMOR projected the impact probability of each VI onto\nthe surface of the Earth as a spatial probability distribution. The projection\nconsiders orbit solution accuracy and the global impact probability. The method\nof ARMOR is introduced and the tool is validated against two asteroid-Earth\ncollision cases with objects 2008 TC3 and 2014 AA. In the analysis, the natural\ndistribution of impact corridors is contrasted against the impact probability\ndistribution to evaluate the distributions conformity with the uniform impact\ndistribution assumption. The distribution of impact corridors is based on the\nNEO population and orbital mechanics. The analysis shows that the distribution\nof impact corridors matches the common assumption of uniform impact\ndistribution and the result extends the evidence base for the uniform\nassumption from qualitative analysis of historic impact events into the future\nin a quantitative way. This finding is confirmed in a parallel analysis of\nimpact points belonging to a synthetic population of 10006 VIs. Taking into\naccount the impact probabilities introduced significant variation into the\nresults and the impact probability distribution, consequently, deviates\nmarkedly from uniformity. The concept of impact probabilities is a product of\nthe asteroid observation and orbit determination technique and, thus,\nrepresents a man-made component that is largely disconnected from natural\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 13:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

This\npaper presents evidence for magnetoreception in three additional species, red\ndrum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and sea catfish\n(Ariopsis felis), by employing experiments to test whether fish respond\ndifferently to bait on a magnetic hook than on a control. In red drum, the\ncontrol hook outcaught the magnetic hook by 32 - 18 for chi-squared = 3.92 and\na P-value of 0.048. Black drum showed a significant attraction for the magnetic\nhook, which prevailed over the control hook by 11 - 3 for chi-squared = 4.57\nand a P-value of 0.033.

Modelling using integrodifference\nequations suggests that, when long distance contacts are represented by a\nfat-tailed dispersal kernel, an accelerating wave of advance can ensue.\nInvasions spreading in this manner could have particularly dramatic effects.\nRecently, various authors have suggested that demographic stochasticity\ndisrupts wave acceleration. Integrodifference models have been widely used in\nmovement ecology, and as such a clearer understanding of stochastic effects is\nneeded. Here, we present a stochastic non-linear one-dimensional lattice model\nin which demographic stochasticity and the dispersal regime can be\nsystematically varied. Extensive simulations show that stochasticity has a\nprofound effect on model behaviour, and usually breaks acceleration for\nfat-tailed kernels. Exceptions are seen for some power law kernels, $K(l)\n\\propto |l|^{-\\beta}$ with $\\beta < 3$, for which acceleration persists despite\nstochasticity. Such kernels lack a second moment and are important in\n`accelerating' phenomena such as L\\'{e}vy flights. Furthermore, for long-range\nkernels the approach to the continuum limit behaviour as stochasticity is\nreduced is generally slow. Given that real-world populations are finite,\nstochastic models may give better predictive power when long-range dispersal is\nimportant. Insights from mean-field models such as integrodifference equations\nshould be applied with caution in such circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 15:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

The influence of the\nintermediate variable on the outcome is often explored using structural\nequation models (SEMs), with model coefficients interpreted as possible\neffects. While there has been significant research on the topic in recent\nyears, little work has been done on mediation analysis when the intermediate\nvariable (mediator) is a high-dimensional vector. In this work we present a new\nmethod for exploratory mediation analysis in this setting called the directions\nof mediation (DMs). The first DM is defined as the linear combination of the\nelements of a high-dimensional vector of potential mediators that maximizes the\nlikelihood of the SEM. The subsequent DMs are defined as linear combinations of\nthe elements of the high-dimensional vector that are orthonormal to the\nprevious DMs and maximize the likelihood of the SEM. We provide an estimation\nalgorithm and establish the asymptotic properties of the obtained estimators.\nThis method is well suited for cases when many potential mediators are\nmeasured. Examples of high-dimensional potential mediators are brain images\ncomposed of hundreds of thousands of voxels, genetic variation measured at\nmillions of SNPs, or vectors of thousands of variables in large-scale\nepidemiological studies.

However, the stochastic and\nnonlinear dynamics of electric water heaters, makes it challenging to harness\ntheir flexibility. Driven by this challenge, this paper formulates the\nunderlying sequential decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and\nuses techniques from reinforcement learning. Specifically, we apply an\nauto-encoder network to find a compact feature representation of the sensor\nmeasurements, which helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. A wellknown\nbatch reinforcement learning technique, fitted Q-iteration, is used to find a\ncontrol policy, given this feature representation.

In the\nnon-hydrostatic case a constraint in the vertical operators appears (called C1)\nthat does not allow to reduce the set of semi-implicit linear equations to a\nsingle equation in one variable as in the analytic case. Recently vertical\nfinite elements based in B-splines have been used with an iterative method to\nrelax the C1 constraint. In this paper we want to develop properly some\nrepresentations of vertical operators in terms of B-splines in order to keep\nthe C1-constraint. An invertibility relation between integral and derivative\noperators between vertical velocity and vertical divergence is also presented.\nThe final scope of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework of\ndevelopment of finite element vertical operators to be implemented in the\nALADIN-HIRLAM nwp system\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 12:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 12:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}
