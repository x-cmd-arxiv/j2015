Compared\nto previous studies we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models\nif IA is ignored in the analysis; the amplitude and significance of these\nbiases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical\nuncertainties), luminosity function, and IA scenario: Due to its small\nstatistical errors and relatively shallow observing strategy Euclid is\nsignificantly impacted by IA. LSST and WFIRST benefit from their increased\nsurvey depth, while the larger statistical errors for DES decrease IA's\nrelative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme\nremoves parameter biases due to IA for DES, LSST, and WFIRST even if the shape\nof the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for\nEuclid requires more prior information.

A scalable signal processing\nframework is therefore highly desirable, which, as recently demonstrated in\n\\cite{Dai_TWireless}, could be established based on the concept of virtual\ncell.\n  In a virtual-cell based DAS, each user chooses a few closest base-station\n(BS) antennas to form its virtual cell, that is, its own serving BS antenna\nset. In this paper, we focus on a downlink DAS with a large number of users and\nBS antennas uniformly distributed in a certain area, and aim to study the\neffect of the virtual cell size on the average user rate. Specifically, by\nassuming that maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is adopted in each user's\nvirtual cell, the achievable ergodic rate of each user is derived as an\nexplicit function of the large-scale fading coefficients from all the users to\ntheir virtual cells, and an upper-bound of the average user rate is\nestablished, based on which a rule of thumb is developed for determining the\noptimal virtual cell size to maximize the average user rate. The analysis is\nfurther extended to consider multiple users grouped together and jointly served\nby their virtual cells using zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). In contrast to\nthe no-grouping case where a small virtual cell size is preferred, it is shown\nthat by grouping users with overlapped virtual cells, the average user rate can\nbe significantly improved by increasing the virtual cell size, though at the\ncost of a higher signal processing complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 16:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

The scale at\nwhich energy is supplied greatly differs from the scale at which energy is\ndissipated, the more so as the turbulent intensity (the Reynolds number) is\nlarger. The resulting energy flux over the range of scales, intermediate\nbetween energy injection and dissipation, acts as a source of time\nirreversibility. As it is now possible to follow accurately fluid particles in\na turbulent flow field, both from laboratory experiments and from numerical\nsimulations, a natural question arises: how do we detect time irreversibility\nfrom these Lagrangian data? Here we discuss recent results concerning this\nproblem. For Lagrangian statistics involving more than one fluid particle, the\ndistance between fluid particles introduces an intrinsic length scale into the\nproblem. The evolution of quantities dependent on the relative motion between\nthese fluid particles, including the kinetic energy in the relative motion, or\nthe configuration of an initially isotropic structure can be related to the\nequal-time correlation functions of the velocity field, and is therefore\nsensitive to the energy flux through scales, hence to the irreversibility of\nthe flow. In contrast, for single-particle Lagrangian statistics, the most\noften studied velocity structure functions cannot distinguish the \"arrow of\ntime.\" Recent observations from experimental and numerical simulation data,\nhowever, show that the change of kinetic energy following the particle motion,\nis sensitive to time-reversal.

Among the findings here is that this\ninvariance is maintained even after splitting the separability probabilities\ninto those parts arising from the determinantal inequality $|\\rho^{PT}|\n>|\\rho|$ and those from $|\\rho| > |\\rho^{PT}| >0$, where the partial transpose\nis indicated. The nine-dimensional set of generic two-re[al]bit states endowed\nwith Hilbert-Schmidt measure is also examined, with similar $r$-invariance\nconclusions. Contrastingly, two-qubit separability probabilities based on the\nBures (minimal monotone) measure {\\it diminish} with $r$. Moreover, we study\nthe forms that the separability probabilities take as joint (bivariate)\nfunctions of the radii ($r_A, r_B$) of the Bloch balls of {\\it both}\nsingle-qubit subsystems. Here, a form of Bloch radii {\\it repulsion} for\nseparable two-qubit systems emerges in {\\it all} our several analyses.\nSeparability probabilities tend to be smaller when the lengths of the two radii\nare closer. In Appendix A, we report certain companion analytic results for the\nmuch-investigated, more amenable (7-dimensional) $X$-states model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 17:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 18:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 21:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 18:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

We introduce a simple and label-efficient algorithm\ncalled S2 for this task. At each step, S2 selects the vertex to be labeled\nbased on the structure of the graph and all previously gathered labels.\nSpecifically, S2 queries for the label of the vertex that bisects the *shortest\nshortest* path between any pair of oppositely labeled vertices. We present a\ntheoretical estimate of the number of queries S2 needs in terms of a novel\nparametrization of the complexity of binary functions on graphs. We also\npresent experimental results demonstrating the performance of S2 on both real\nand synthetic data. While other graph-based active learning algorithms have\nshown promise in practice, our algorithm is the first with both good\nperformance and theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate the\nimplications of the S2 algorithm to the theory of nonparametric active\nlearning. In particular, we show that S2 achieves near minimax optimal excess\nrisk for an important class of nonparametric classification problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 18:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Here we report for the first time on the observation of a\nRaman-induced soliton self-frequency shift for a microresonator soliton. The\nRaman effect manifests itself in amorphous SiN microresonator based single\nsoliton states by a spectrum that is hyperbolic secant in shape, but whose\ncenter is spectrally red-shifted (i.e. offset) from the continuous wave pump\nlaser. The Raman induced spectral red-shift is found to be tunable via the pump\nlaser detuning and grows linearly with peak power. The shift is theoretically\ndescribed by the first order shock term of the material's Raman response, and\nwe infer a Raman shock time of 20 fs for amorphous SiN. Moreover, we observe\nthat the Raman induced frequency shift can lead to a cancellation or\novercompensation of the soliton recoil caused by the formation of a (coherent)\ndispersive wave. The observations are in excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulations based on the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) with a Raman shock\nterm. Our results contribute to the understanding of Kerr frequency combs in\nthe soliton regime, enable to substantially improve the accuracy of modeling\nand are relevant to the fundamental timing jitter of microresonator solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 18:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-09"}

However, there is\noften little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori.\nEven if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite\nsample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore,\nwhen directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a $N\n\\times N$ Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of\n$N$ instances. The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct\napplication of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes kernel learning\nespecially difficult.

BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral distribution of\nrandom frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to large\ndatasets.

Using this method we study quasi-bound states of a square-well potential\nin three dimensions subject to an axial driving force. In the nonperturbative\nregime we show how eigenfunctions develop an asymptotic dressing of different\npartial waves, accompanied by large periodic oscillations in the angular\nmomentum and a nonmonotonous dependence of the decay rate on the drive\nstrength. We extend these results to the strong driving regime near a resonant\nintersection of the quasi-energy surfaces of two bound states of different\nsymmetry.

The mass of disc gas, M$_{\\rm gas}$, depends upon a galaxy halo's\nspin and virial mass, but not upon stellar feedback. Halos with low spin have\nhigh star formation efficiency and lower disc gas mass. Similarly, lower\nstellar feedback leads to more star formation so the gas mass ends up nearly\nthe same irregardless of stellar feedback strength. Even considering spin, the\nM$_{\\rm gas}$ relation with halo mass, M$_{200}$ only shows a factor of 3\nscatter. The M$_{\\rm gas}$--M$_{200}$ relation show a break at\nM$_{200}$=$2\\times10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ that corresponds to an observed break in\nthe M$_{\\rm gas}$--M$_\\star$ relation. The constant disc mass stems from a\nshared halo gas density profile in all the simulated galaxies. In their outer\nregions, the profiles are isothermal. Where the profile rises above $n=10^{-3}$\ncm$^{-3}$, the gas readily cools and the profile steepens. Inside the disc,\nrotation supports gas with a flatter density profile except where supernova\nexplosions disrupt the disc. Energy injection from stellar feedback also\nprovides pressure support to the halo gas to prevent runaway cooling flows. The\nresulting constant gas mass makes simpler models for galaxy formation possible,\neither using a \"bathtub\" model for star formation rates or when modeling\nchemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 19:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Noble gas NMR is driven by\nspin-exchange collisions with the oscillating electron spins. On resonance, the\ntime-average torque from the oscillating spin-exchange field produced by the\nalkali spins is zero.

Although precession\ndue to extended gravitational potential from the inner Pluto-Charon binary\nquench such secular evolution up to $a_{crit}\\sim0.0035$ AU ($\\sim0.09$\n$R_{Hill}$ the Hill radius; including all of the currently known satellites),\nouter orbits can be significantly altered. In particular, we find that\n\\emph{co-planar} rings and satellites should not exist beyond $a_{crit}$;\nrather, satellites and dust particles in these regions secularly evolve on\ntimescales ranging between $10^{4}-10^{6}$ yrs, and quasi-periodically change\ntheir inclinations and eccentricities through secular evolution (Lidov-Kozai\noscillations). Such oscillations can lead to high inclinations and\neccentricities, constraining the range where such satellites (and dust\nparticles) can exist without crossing the orbits of the inner satellites, or\ncrossing the outer Hill stability range. Outer satellites, if such exist are\ntherefore likely to be \\emph{irregular} satellites, with orbits limited to be\nnon-circular and/or highly inclined.

However,\nit is important for modelling molecular outflows. For example, the mass of\nH$_{2}$ outflowing with velocities $> 50 \\, \\rm{km} \\, \\rm{s}^{-1}$ is enhanced\nby a factor $\\sim 20$ in non-equilibrium. We also compute the observable line\nemission from CII and CO. Both are stronger at higher metallicity, while CII\nand CO emission are higher for stronger and weaker radiation fields\nrespectively. We find that CII is generally unaffected by non-equilibrium\nchemistry. However, emission from CO varies by a factor of $\\sim 2 - 4$. This\nhas implications for the mean $X_{\\rm{CO}}$ conversion factor between CO\nemission and H$_{2}$ column density, which we find is lowered by up to a factor\n$\\sim 2.3$ in non-equilibrium, and for the fraction of CO-dark molecular gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 20:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 19:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Such encounters can also dramatically modify\nthe orbital parameters of binaries, exchange partners in and out of binaries,\nand are a primary contributor to the rate of physical stellar collisions in\nstar clusters. Often, these encounters are studied under the approximation that\nthey happen quickly enough and within a small enough volume to be considered\nisolated from the rest of the cluster. In this paper, we study the validity of\nthis assumption through the analysis of a large grid of single - binary and\nbinary - binary scattering experiments. For each encounter we evaluate the\nencounter duration, and compare this with the expected time until another\nsingle or binary star will join the encounter. We find that for lower-mass\nclusters, similar to typical open clusters in our Galaxy, the percent of\nencounters that will be \"interrupted\" by an interloping star or binary may be\n20-40% (or higher) in the core, though for typical globular clusters we expect\n<1% of encounters to be interrupted. Thus, the assumption that strong\nencounters occur in relative isolation breaks down for certain clusters.\nInstead, many strong encounters develop into more complex \"mini-clusters\",\nwhich must be accounted for in studying, for example, the internal dynamics of\nstar clusters, and the physical stellar collision rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 20:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

As a first step,\nwe present the mass functions of compact clusters younger than 10 Myr in seven\nstar-forming galaxies of diverse masses, sizes, and morphologies: the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds, NGC 4214, NGC 4449, M83, M51, and the Antennae. These\ncluster mass functions (CMFs) are well represented by power laws, dN/dM~M^b,\nwith similar exponents b=-1.92+/-0.27, but with amplitudes that differ by\nfactors up to ~10^3, corresponding to vast differences in the sizes of the\ncluster populations in these galaxies. We then normalize these CMFs by the SFRs\nin the galaxies, derived from dust-corrected H-alpha luminosities, and find\nthat the spread in the amplitudes collapses, with a remaining rms deviation of\nonly sigma_(logA)= 0.2. This is close to the expected dispersion from random\nuncertainties in the CMFs and SFRs. Thus, the data presented here are\nconsistent with exact proportionality between the formation rates of stars and\nclusters. However, the data also permit weak deviations from proportionality,\nat the factor of two level, within the statistical uncertainties. We find the\nsame spread in amplitudes when we normalize the mass functions of much older\nclusters, with ages in the range 100 to 400 Myr, by the current SFR. This is\nanother indication of the general similarity among the cluster populations of\ndifferent galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 20:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

With the\nhelp of a spectroscopic information about the source star obtained during the\nhigh-magnification state by Bensby et al., we find that the lens system is\nlocated at 1.3^{+0.6}_{-0.8} kpc from us, and consists of an M dwarf\n(0.34^{+0.12}_{-0.20} M_sun) orbited by a Saturn-mass planet\n(0.39^{+0.14}_{-0.23} M_Jup) at the projected separation of\n0.74^{+0.26}_{-0.42} AU (close model) or 4.3^{+1.5}_{-2.5} AU (wide model).

Moreover, the\ngrowth direction of the lamellae often markedly differs from the direction of\nthe temperature gradient (the lamellae are tilted with respect to the main\ngrowth direction). Both of these effects cannot be explained either by the\nstandard theory or the available numerical models of eutectic growth, which all\nassume the interfaces to be isotropic. We have developed a phase-field model in\nwhich the anisotropy of each interface (solid-liquid and solid-solid) can be\nseparately controlled, and we have investigated the effect of interface\nanisotropy on the growth dynamics.

In the\nidle time slots, the relay transmits the packet at the head of its queue, while\nin the busy one, the relay decides either to transmit simultaneously with the\nsource terminal or to listen to the source transmission. The SBC scheme is a\nnovel paradigm that utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than the other\ncooperative schemes because the relay not only exploits the idle time slots,\nbut also has the capability to mildly interfere with the source terminal.

Although VSIDS was proposed nearly fifteen years ago, and many\nother branching heuristics for SAT solving have since been proposed, VSIDS\nremains one of the most effective branching heuristics.\n  In this paper, we advance our understanding of VSIDS by answering the\nfollowing key questions. The first question we pose is \"what is special about\nthe class of variables that VSIDS chooses to additively bump?\" In answering\nthis question we showed that VSIDS overwhelmingly picks, bumps, and learns\nbridge variables, defined as the variables that connect distinct communities in\nthe community structure of SAT instances. This is surprising since VSIDS was\ninvented more than a decade before the link between community structure and SAT\nsolver performance was discovered. Additionally, we show that VSIDS viewed as a\nranking function correlates strongly with temporal graph centrality measures.\nPutting these two findings together, we conclude that VSIDS picks\nhigh-centrality bridge variables. The second question we pose is \"what role\ndoes multiplicative decay play in making VSIDS so effective?\" We show that the\nmultiplicative decay behaves like an exponential moving average (EMA) that\nfavors variables that persistently occur in conflicts (the signal) over\nvariables that occur intermittently (the noise). The third question we pose is\n\"whether VSIDS is temporally and spatially focused.\" We show that VSIDS\ndisproportionately picks variables from a few communities unlike, say, the\nrandom branching heuristic. We put these findings together to invent a new\nadaptive VSIDS branching heuristic that solves more instances than one of the\nbest-known VSIDS variants over the SAT Competition 2013 benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 00:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 02:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 23:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

This\nsparsity is driven by the low dimensionality of the observation distributions\n(which is intuitive) as well as by specific structural interrelations among\nthem (which is less intuitive). We use a matrix factorization approach to\nuncover the potential low dimensionality hidden in high-dimensional beliefs and\nreconstruct the beliefs using a diagnostic statistic in lower dimension. For\ncommon univariate distributions, e.g., normal, binomial, and Poisson, the\nbelief reconstruction is exact, and the optimal policies can be efficiently\ncomputed for a large number of classes. We also characterize the structure of\nthe optimal policy in the reduced dimension. For multivariate distributions, we\npropose a low-rank matrix approximation scheme that works well when the beliefs\nare near the low-dimensional manifolds.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\". We would like to show that practically\nany aspect of the cosmological evolution is tightly bound to the deceleration\nparameter. It is the second part of the report.

Also there were shown that the spectral width decreases with\nincreasing perturbation strength. The growing up of the cluster size as it was\nsupposed by G.A. Alvarez and D.

The growing up of cluster size\nstill goes on but the width of MQ spectrum becomes stable because of different\ndecay rate of MQ-spectral components in dependence on theirs location in\nspectrum. Here we are calculating the widths of MQ spectra in dependence on the\ntime of \"preparation\" for different values of the perturbation strength and by\nthis way we get the dependence of stabilized amount of MQ-spectrum width on\nmentioned strength. So, the excellent compliance obtains with the analogues\nexperimental relation observed in Ref. [Phys. Rev.

First, Dirac electrons in graphene exhibit a giant global proximity\nspin-orbit coupling, without compromising the semimetallic character of the\nwhole system at zero field. Remarkably, these spin-orbit effects can be very\naccurately described by a simple effective Hamiltonian.

These outflows have a speed\ngreater than $\\sim 8000$ km\\,s$^{-1}$ near the AGN, and travel out to a half\nMpc with $\\sim 3000$ km\\,s$^{-1}$. These outflows remove the remaining gas\n($\\sim 3$ per cent of baryons) and significant amounts of metals ($\\sim 2$ per\ncent of total produced metals) from the host galaxy, chemically enriching the\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intergalactic medium (IGM). 17.6 per cent\nof metals from this galaxy, and 18.4 per cent of total produced metals in the\nsimulation, end up in the CGM and IGM, respectively.

We evaluate\nself-consistently both the mass transfer rate from the donor, as determined by\nGW emission and interaction with the binary companion, and the thermal response\nof the accretor to mass deposition. We find that, after the onset of mass\ntransfer, all the considered systems undergo a strong non-dynamical He-flash.\nHowever, due to the compactness of these systems, the expanding accretors fill\ntheir Roche lobe very soon, thus preventing the efficient heating of the\nexternal layers of the accreted CO WDs. Moreover, due to the loss of matter\nfrom the systems, the orbital separations enlarge and mass transfer comes to a\nhalt. The further evolution depends on the value of $\\dot{M}$, after the donors\nfill again their lobe. On one hand, if the accretion rate, as determined by the\nactual value of (M$_{don}$,M$_{acc}$), is high enough, the accretors experience\nseveral He-flashes of decreasing strength and then quiescent He-burning sets\nin. Later on, since the mass transfer rate in IDD is a permanently decreasing\nfunction of time, accretors experience several recurrent strong flashes. On the\nother hand, for intermediate and low values of $\\dot{M}$, the accretors enter\nthe strong flashes accretion regime. As expected, in all the considered systems\nthe last He-flash is the strongest one, even if a dynamical event never occurs.\nWhen the mass accretion rate decreases below (2-3)$\\times 10^{-8} M_\\odot\nyr^{-1}$, the compressional heating of the He-shell becomes less efficient than\nthe neutrino cooling, so that all the accretors in the considered systems\nevolve into massive degenerate objects.

In many natural\nmaterials, toughness is achieved through a combination of multiple mechanisms\noperating at different length scales but such structures have been extremely\ndifficult to replicate. Building upon such biological structures, we\ndemonstrate a simple approach that yields bulk ceramics characterized by a\nunique combination of high strength (470 MPa), high toughness (22 MPa.m1/2),\nand high stiffness (290 GPa) without the assistance of a ductile phase.

In\naddition, in order to reduce the payload cost and complexity, this on-board\nprocessing is assumed to be constant and the same for forward and return link\ntransmissions. To meet all these requirements a novel robust minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) optimization is conceived. The benefits of the considered\nscheme are evaluated with respect to the current approaches both analytically\nand numerically. Indeed, we show that with the DVB-RCS and DVB-S2 standards,\nour proposal allows to increase the total throughput within a range between 6\\%\nand 15\\% with respect to other on-board processing techniques in the return and\nforward link, respectively.

We aim to obtain, for the first time, a high resolution infrared\nspectrum deep enough to set significant constraints on the continuum emission\nbetween the lines in the H-band. Methods During the second commissioning run of\nthe GIANO high-resolution infrared spectrograph at La Palma Observatory, we\npointed the instrument directly to the sky and obtained a deep spectrum that\nextends from 0.97 to 2.4 micron. Results The spectrum shows about 1500 emission\nlines, a factor of two more than in previous works. Of these, 80% are\nidentified as OH transitions; half of these are from highly excited molecules\n(hot-OH component) that are not included in the OH airglow emission models\nnormally used for astronomical applications. The other lines are attributable\nto O2 or unidentified. Several of the faint lines are in spectral regions that\nwere previously believed to be free of line emission. The continuum in the\nH-band is marginally detected at a level of about 300\nphotons/m^2/s/arcsec^2/micron, equivalent to 20.1 AB-mag/arcsec^2. The observed\nspectrum and the list of observed sky-lines are published in electronic format.\nConclusions Our measurements indicate that the sky continuum in the H-band\ncould be even darker than previously believed. However, the myriad of airglow\nemission lines severely limits the spectral ranges where very low background\ncan be effectively achieved with low/medium resolution spectrographs. We\nidentify a few spectral bands that could still remain quite dark at the\nresolving power foreseen for VLT-MOONS (R ~6,600).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 09:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

This kinked state, which is not\nwell-described by the worm-like chain model, allows the duplex to more easily\nbe sharply bent. It is not completely flexible, however, due to constraints\narising from the connectivity of both DNA backbones. We also perform a detailed\ncomparison to recent experiments on a \"molecular vice\" that probes highly bent\nDNA. Close agreement between simulations and experiments strengthens the\nhypothesis that localised bending via kinking occurs in the molecular vice and\ncauses enhanced flexibility of duplex DNA. Our calculations therefore suggests\nthat the cost of kinking implied by this experiment is consistent with the\nknown thermodynamic and mechanical properties of DNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 09:32:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Firstly, we upper-bound the sum\nrate loss incurred by each scheme relative to Zero-Forcing Beamforming (ZFBF)\nwith perfect CSIT. Secondly, we show that, to maintain a constant sum rate\nloss, RS-S scheme enables a feedback overhead reduction over ZFBF with\nquantized CSIT. Such reduction scales logarithmically with the constant rate\nloss at high Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR). We also find that, compared to RS-S\nscheme, RS-ST scheme offers a further feedback overhead reduction that scales\nwith the discrepancy between the feedback overhead employed by the two\nreceivers when there are alternating receiver-specific feedback qualities.\nFinally, simulation results show that both schemes offer a significant SNR gain\nover conventional single-user/multiuser mode switching when the feedback\noverhead is fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 10:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

The model includes the mixing of heavy elements (metals)\nejected by the supernova and their contribution to radiative losses. The\ninteraction of the supernova envelope with the cloudy phase of the interstellar\nmedium leads to nonsimultaneous, and on average earlier, onsets of the\nradiative phase in different parts of the supernova envelope. Growth in the\nvolume filling factor $f$ leads to a decrease in the time for the transition of\nthe envelope to the radiative phase and a decrease in the envelope's mean\nradius, due to the increased energy losses by the envelope in the cloudy\nmedium. When the development of hydrodynamical instabilities in the supernova\nenvelope is efficient, the thermal energy falls as $E_t\\sim t^{-2.3}$, for the\npropagation of the supernova remnant through either a homogeneous or a cloudy\nmedium.

Metals ejected by the supernova are also enclosed in the\ncentral region of the remnant, where the initial (high) metallicity is\nessentially preserved. Thus, the interaction of the supernova envelope with the\ncloudy interstellar medium appreciably changes the dynamics and structure of\nthe distribution of the gas in the remnant. This affects the observational\ncharacteristics of the remnant, in particularly, leading to substantial\nfluctuations of the emission measure of the gas with $T>10^5$~K and the\nvelocity dispersion of the ionized gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 11:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The production of radiogenic 22Ne from the decay of 22Na in the He\nshell might solve the puzzle of the Ne-E(L) component in low-density graphite\ngrains. This scenario is attractive for the SiC grains of type AB with 14N/15N\nratios lower than solar, and provides an alternative solution for SiC grains\noriginally classified as nova grains. Finally, this process may contribute to\nthe production of 14N and 15N in the Galaxy, helping to produce the 14N/15N\nratio in the solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 12:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The purpose of this note is didactic, to explain\nthe cause of the problem and the easy and elegant solution. The solution is to\nuse maximum likelihood instead of chi-square. The essential difference between\nthe two approaches is that maximum likelihood uses the normalization of each\nterm in the chi-square assuming it is a normal distribution, 1/sqrt(2 pi\nsigma-square). In addition, the normalization is applied to the theoretical\nexpectation not to the data. In the present note we illustrate what goes wrong\nand how maximum likelihood fixes the problem in a very simple toy example which\nillustrates the problem clearly and is the appropriate physics model for event\nhistograms.

In the case of equilibrium plasmas, the well-known\nformula of collisional energy loss is reproduced.

The formalism considers both the center of mass and\ninternal degrees of freedom of the atom, and all properties of the field:\nfrequency, angular spectrum, and polarization. General features of recoil\neffects for internal forbidden transitions are discussed. A comparative\nanalysis of different structured light sources is explicitly worked out. It\nincludes spherical waves, Gaussian beams, Laguerre-Gaussian beams, and\npropagation invariant beams with closed analytical expressions. It is shown\nthat increments in the order of magnitude of the transition rates for Gaussian\nand Laguerre-Gaussian beams, with respect to those obtained in the paraxial\nlimit, requires waists of the order of the wavelength, while propagation\ninvariant modes may considerably enhance transition rates under more favorable\nconditions. For transitions that can be naturally described as modifications of\nthe atomic angular momentum, this enhancement is maximal (within propagation\ninvariant beams) for Bessel modes, Mathieu modes can be used to entangle the\ninternal and center of mass involved states, and Weber beams suppress this kind\nof transitions unless they have a significant component of odd modes. However,\nif a recoil effect of the transition with an adequate symmetry is allowed, the\nglobal transition rate (center of mass and internal motion) can also be\nenhanced using Weber modes. The global analysis presented reinforces the idea\nthat a better control of the transitions between internal atomic states\nrequires both a proper control of the available states of the atomic center of\nmass, and shaping of the background electromagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 14:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Recently it has been shown that quantum coherence can, in\nprinciple, enhance the efficiency of a solar cell, working like a quantum heat\nengine (QHE). Here, we propose a biological quantum heat engine (BQHE)\nmotivated by Photosystem {\\rm II} reaction center (PS{\\rm II} RC) to describe\nthe charge separation. Our model mainly considers two charge-separation\npathways more than that in the published literature. The two pathways can\ninterfere via cross-couplings and work together to enhance the\ncharge-separation yields. We explore how these cross-couplings increase the\ncurrent and voltage of the charge separation and discuss the advantages of\nmultiple pathways in terms of current and power. The robustness of the BQHE\nagainst the charge recombination in natural PS{\\rm II} RC and dephasing induced\nby environments is also explored, and extension from two pathways to multiple\npathways is made. These results suggest that nature-mimicking architectures\nwith engineered multiple pathways for charge separations might be better for\nartificial solar energy devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 21:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

Is there, as\nmainstream economic theory asserts it, an homogeneous labor market with\nmechanisms which govern supply and demand for work, producing an equilibrium\nwith its remarkable properties?

To perform this analysis,\nwe suggest using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM, Kohonen algorithm) with specific\nstructure based on planar graphs, with disconnected components (called D-SOM),\nespecially interesting for clustering. We compare the results to those obtained\nwith a classical SOM grid and a star-shaped map (called SOS). Each component of\nD-SOM takes the form of a string and corresponds to an organized cluster. From\nthis clustering, we study the trajectories of the individuals among the classes\nby using the transition probability matrices for each period and the\ncorresponding stationary distributions. As a matter of fact, we find clear\nevidence of heterogeneous parts, each one with high homo-geneity, representing\nsituations well identified in terms of activity and wage levels and in degree\nof stability in the workplace. These results and their interpretation in\neconomic terms contribute to the debate about flexibility which is commonly\nseen as a way to obtain a better level of equilibrium on the labor market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 06:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}
