Our central results provide information on how Ramsey's\ntheorem behaves under product, parallelization and jumps. From these results we\ncan derive a number of important properties of Ramsey's theorem. For one, the\nparallelization of Ramsey's theorem for cardinality $n\\geq1$ and an arbitrary\nfinite number of colors $k\\geq2$ is equivalent to the $n$--th jump of weak\nK\\H{o}nig's lemma. In particular, Ramsey's theorem for cardinality $n\\geq1$ is\n$\\Sigma^0_{n+2}$--measurable in the effective Borel hierarchy, but not\n$\\Sigma^0_{n+1}$--measurable. Secondly, we obtain interesting lower bounds, for\ninstance the $n$--th jump of weak K\\H{o}nig's lemma is Weihrauch reducible to\n(the stable version of) Ramsey's theorem of cardinality $n+2$ for $n\\geq2$. We\nprove that with strictly increasing numbers of colors Ramsey's theorem forms a\nstrictly increasing chain in the Weihrauch lattice. Our study of jumps also\nshows that certain uniform variants of Ramsey's theorem that are\nindistinguishable from a non-uniform perspective play an important role. For\ninstance, the colored version of Ramsey's theorem explicitly includes the color\nof the homogeneous set as output information, and the jump of this problem (but\nnot the uncolored variant) is equivalent to the stable version of Ramsey's\ntheorem of the next greater cardinality. Finally, we briefly discuss the\nparticular case of Ramsey's theorem for pairs, and we provide some new\nseparation techniques for problems that involve jumps in this context. In\nparticular, we study uniform results regarding the relation of boundedness and\ninduction problems to Ramsey's theorem, and we show that there are some\nsignificant differences with the non-uniform situation in reverse mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 16:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 15:09:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 17:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 19:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 14:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

The transformation takes place during virus maturation process which\nrenders virus infectious. The theory is illustrated on the example of the HK97\nbacteriophage and viruses with similar morphological changes in the protective\nprotein shell. The transformation is shown to be a structural phase transition\ndriven by two order parameters. The first order parameter describes the\nisotropic expansion of the protein shell while the second one is responsible\nfor the shape symmetry breaking and the resulting shell faceting. The group\ntheory analysis and the resulting thermodynamic model make it possible to\nchoose the parameter which discriminates between the icosahedral shell faceting\noften observed in viral capsids and the dodecahedral one observed in viruses of\nthe Parvovirus family. Calculated phase diagram illustrates the discontinuous\ncharacter of the virus morphological transformation and shows two qualitatively\ndifferent paths of the transformation in a function of two main external\nthermodynamic parameters of the in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 18:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

We argue that, for carrier\nconcentrations exceeding that of the mobility edge, the superconductivity of\ndoped SrTiO3 is mediated by interaction of electrons with several longitudinal\n(LO) optical polar phonons. The electronic spectrum of SrTiO3 consists at low\ntemperatures of three conduction bands which are successively doped. Each band\ncontributes to the Cooper instability and exhibits a superconducting gap in the\nenergy spectrum. The theory presented below predicts maxima in dependence of\nTc(n)-the transition temperature on n, the number of electrons owing to the\nfollowing mechanism. Doping by electrons increases density of states at the\nFermi surface and Tc initially grows up. At the same time, screening on the\npart of accumulating charges tends to reduce amplitude of the electrical fields\ninherent in LO phonon modes and at larger concentrations the matrix element of\ninteraction between electrons and LO phonons decreases. The compromise between\nthe two tendencies leads to maxima in the Tc(n)-dependence providing\ninterpretation to one of the most intriguing experimental findings in Xiao Lin\net al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 207002 (2014)]. Having reached a maximum in the\nthird band, the superconducting transition finally decreases, rounding out the\nTc(n)-dome, the three maxima in Tc(n)with accompanying superconducting gaps\nemerging consecutively as electrons fill successive bands. This arises from\nattributes of the LO optical phonon pairing mechanism. More generally, the\nmechanism opens prospect of increasing temperature of the superconducting\ntransition in transition-metals oxides and other polar crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 18:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 22:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Utilizing optical\nspectra obtained with the 4m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory\nand the 6.5m MMT, we have compiled a sample of embedded SSCs that are likely\nundergoing this short-lived evolutionary phase and in which we confirm the\npresence of Wolf-Rayet stars.

We also show that\nstrong blending with metal features (those of Ti II, Fe II, Co II) makes the\ndirect analysis of the broad spectral features very difficult, and this may be\ntrue for all SNe Iax. We find two alternative spectrum models that both\ndescribe the observed spectra adequately, but their photospheric velocities\ndiffer by at least 3,000 km/s.

A large number\nof experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to uncovering\nthe molecular description of these phenomena, but many aspects of the\nmechanisms of protein search for the targets on DNA remain not well understood.\nOne of the most intriguing problems is the role of multiple targets in protein\nsearch dynamics. Using a recently developed theoretical framework we analyze\nthis question in detail. Our method is based on a discrete-state stochastic\napproach that takes into account most relevant physical-chemical processes and\nleads to fully analytical description of all dynamic properties. Specifically,\nsystems with two and three targets have been explicitly investigated. It is\nfound that multiple targets in most cases accelerate the search in comparison\nwith a single target situation. However, the acceleration is not always\nproportional to the number of targets. Surprisingly, there are even situations\nwhen it takes longer to find one of the multiple targets in comparison with the\nsingle target. It depends on the spatial position of the targets, distances\nbetween them, average scanning lengths of protein molecules on DNA, and the\ntotal DNA lengths.

Theoretical\nmodels can help by focusing experimental studies and by providing the framework\nfor interpreting measurements. To that end, \"vertex models\" have introduced an\napproximation of epithelial cell mechanics based on a polygonal tiling\nrepresentation of planar tissue. Here we formulate and analyze an Active\nTension Network (ATN) model, which is based on the same polygonal\nrepresentation of epithelial tissue geometry, but in addition i) assumes that\nmechanical balance is dominated by cortical tension and ii) introduces tension\ndependent local remodeling of the cortex, representing the active nature of\ncytoskeletal mechanics. The tension-dominance assumption has immediate\nimplications for the geometry of cells, which we demonstrate to hold in certain\ntypes of Drosophila epithelial tissues. We demonstrate that stationary\nconfigurations of an ATN form a manifold with one degree of freedom per cell,\ncorresponding to \"isogonal\" - i.e. angle preserving - deformations of cells,\nwhich dominate the dynamic response to perturbations. We show that isogonal\nmodes account for approximately 90% of experimentally observed deformation of\ncells during the process of ventral furrow formation in Drosophila. Other\ninteresting properties of our model include the exponential screening of\nmechanical stress and a negative Poisson ratio response to external uniaxial\nstress.

We employ a fractional power-law attenuation\nkernel and spatially temper it, to make the model physically valid and\nmathematically consistent. The spatial dispersion relation is derived, but it\nturns out to be difficult to solve, both analytically and numerically.\nConsequently, we use numerical techniques to extract the real and imaginary\nparts of the complex wavenumber for a wide range of frequency values. From the\ndispersion plots, it is found that the phase velocity dispersion of elastic\nwaves in the tempered nonlocal elastic bar is similar to that from the\ntime-fractional Zener model.

In a future experimental realization\nthis might lead to measurement of weak forces caused, for example, by small\nhorizontal gradients in the gravitational potential - with a resolution of\nseveral micrometers given essentially by the size of the solitons. Our\nnumerical simulations are based on the rigorously proved effective potential\napproach developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010403 (2009) and Phys. Rev. Lett.\n103, 210402 (2009)]. We choose our parameters such that the prerequisite of the\nproof (that the solitons cannot break apart, for energetic reasons) is always\nfulfilled, thus exploring a parameter regime inaccessible to the mean-field\ndescription via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation due to Schrodinger-cat states\noccurring in the many-particle quantum dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 04:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 04:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 07:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

The most highlighted dynamic\nevent, transition into an eruptive phase, occurs as a natural con- sequence of\nthe self-consistent evolution of a prominence plasma interacting with a\nmagnetic field, which is obtained by seamlessly reproducing dynamic processes\ninvolved in the forma- tion and eruption of an active prominence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 06:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Above this threshold,\nadditional individuals do not increase the probability of capturing the prey.\nRecent direct observations of wolves in Yellowstone Park show that the group\nsize threshold when hunting its most formidable prey, bison, is nearly three\ntimes greater than when hunting elk, a prey that is considerably less\nchallenging to capture than bison. These observations provide empirical support\nto a computational particle model of group hunting which was previously shown\nto be effective in explaining why hunting success peaks at apparently small\npack sizes when hunting elk. The model is based on considering two critical\ndistances between wolves and prey: the minimal safe distance at which wolves\nstand from the prey, and the avoidance distance at which wolves move away from\neach other when they approach the prey. The minimal safe distance is longer\nwhen the prey is more dangerous to hunt. We show that the model explains\neffectively that the group size threshold is greater when the minimal safe\ndistance is longer. Although both distances are longer when the prey is more\ndangerous, they contribute oppositely to the value of the group size threshold:\nthe group size threshold is smaller when the avoidance distance is longer. This\nunexpected mechanism gives rise to a global increase of the group size\nthreshold when considering bison with respect to elk, but other prey more\ndangerous than elk can lead to specific critical distances that can give rise\nto the same group size threshold. Our results show that the computational model\ncan guide further research on group size effects, suggesting that more\nexperimental observations should be obtained for other kind of prey as e.g.\nmoose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 07:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

It is known\nthat this problem relates to the ring of matrix semi-invariants.

Our theory\nis based on the concept of nonlinear Gamow vectors, i.e., power dependent\ngeneralizations of the counter-intuitive and hereto elusive exponentially\ndecaying states in Hamiltonian systems. We theoretically show that nonlinear\nGamow vectors play a fundamental role in nonlinear Schroedinger models: they\nmay be used as a generalized basis for describing the dynamics of the shock\nwaves, and affect the degree of irreversibility of wave-breaking phenomena.\nGamow vectors allow to analytically calculate the amount of breaking of\ntime-reversal with a quantitative agreement with numerical solutions. We also\nshow that a nonlocal nonlinear optical medium may act as a simulator for the\nexperimental investigation of quantum irreversible models, as the reversed\nharmonic oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 08:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

In this paper, we set to explore the latter by using greedy walks\nas probes of temporal network structure. Given a temporal network (a sequence\nof contacts), greedy walks proceed from node to node by always following the\nfirst available contact. Because of this, their structure is particularly\nsensitive to temporal-topological patterns involving repeated contacts between\nsets of nodes. This becomes evident in their small coverage per step as\ncompared to a temporal reference model -- in empirical temporal networks,\ngreedy walks often get stuck within small sets of nodes because of correlated\ncontact patterns. While this may also happen in static networks that have\npronounced community structure, the use of the temporal reference model takes\nthe underlying static network structure out of the equation and indicates that\nthere is a purely temporal reason for the observations. Further analysis of the\nstructure of greedy walks indicates that burst trains, sequences of repeated\ncontacts between node pairs, are the dominant factor. However, there are larger\npatterns too, as shown with non-backtracking greedy walks. We proceed further\nto study the entropy rates of greedy walks, and show that the sequences of\nvisited nodes are more structured and predictable in original data as compared\nto temporally uncorrelated references. Taken together, these results indicate a\nrichness of correlated temporal-topological patterns in temporal networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 08:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 08:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The study was conducted mainly\nin three successive surveys: 1) open-ended questions looking for students'\nideas and common misconceptions, 2) combined multiple-choice and open-ended\nquestions seeking to explore student reasoning and to improve concept questions\nfor clickers, and 3) a finalized version of the concept questions used to\ninvestigate the strength of each misconception among the students in\nintroductory astronomy courses. This study reports on the procedures and the\ndevelopment of the concept questions with the investigated common\nmisconceptions about galaxies and spectra. We also provide the set of developed\nquestions for teachers and instructors seeking to implement in their classes\nfor the purpose of formative assessment with the use of classroom response\nsystems. These questions would help them recognize the gap between their\nteaching and students' understanding, and ultimately improve teaching of the\nconcepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 09:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

In the k-mismatch problem we must compute the Hamming distance\nbetween a pattern of length m and every m-length substring of a text of length\nn, as long as that Hamming distance is at most k. Where the Hamming distance is\ngreater than k at some alignment of the pattern and text, we simply output\n\"No\".\n  We study this problem in both the standard offline setting and also as a\nstreaming problem. In the streaming k-mismatch problem the text arrives one\nsymbol at a time and we must give an output before processing any future\nsymbols. Our main results are as follows:\n  1) Our first result is a deterministic $O(n k^2\\log{k} / m+n \\text{polylog}\nm)$ time offline algorithm for k-mismatch on a text of length n. This is a\nfactor of k improvement over the fastest previous result of this form from SODA\n2000 by Amihood Amir et al.\n  2) We then give a randomised and online algorithm which runs in the same time\ncomplexity but requires only $O(k^2\\text{polylog} {m})$ space in total.\n  3) Next we give a randomised $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the\nstreaming k-mismatch problem which uses $O(k^2\\text{polylog} m / \\epsilon^2)$\nspace and runs in $O(\\text{polylog} m / \\epsilon^2)$ worst-case time per\narriving symbol.\n  4) Finally we combine our new results to derive a randomised\n$O(k^2\\text{polylog} {m})$ space algorithm for the streaming k-mismatch problem\nwhich runs in $O(\\sqrt{k}\\log{k} + \\text{polylog} {m})$ worst-case time per\narriving symbol. This improves the best previous space complexity for streaming\nk-mismatch from FOCS 2009 by Benny Porat and Ely Porat by a factor of k.

This physical mechanism helps to explain two observed phenomena:\nthe size dependence of the heating rate (HR) in GNPs and reduced heat\nproduction in aggregated GNPs. The argumentation proceeds within the\none-electron approximation, taking into account the discretenesses of energies\nand momenta of both electrons and LAVMs. The heating of GNPs is thought to\nconsist of two consecutive processes: first, the Fermi electron absorbs\nsimultaneously the RF photon and the LAVM available in the GNP; hereafter the\nexcited electron gets relaxed within the GNP's boundary, exciting a LAVM with\nthe energy higher than that of the previously absorbed LAVM. GNPs containing\nthe Ta and/or Fe impurities are proposed for the RF hyperthermia as promising\nheaters with enhanced HRs, and GNPs with rare-earth impurity atoms are also\nbrought into consideration.

Radiation therapy is a local treatment aimed at cells in and around\na tumor. The goal of this study is to develop an algorithmic solution for\npredicting the position of a target in 3D in real time, aiming for the short\nfixed calibration time for each patient at the beginning of the procedure.\nAccurate predictions of lung tumor motion are expected to improve the precision\nof radiation treatment by controlling the position of a couch or a beam in\norder to compensate for respiratory motion during radiation treatment.\n  Methods. For developing the algorithmic solution, data mining techniques are\nused. A model form from the family of exponential smoothing is assumed, and the\nmodel parameters are fitted by minimizing the absolute disposition error, and\nthe fluctuations of the prediction signal (jitter). The predictive performance\nis evaluated retrospectively on clinical datasets capturing different behavior\n(being quiet, talking, laughing), and validated in real-time on a prototype\nsystem with respiratory motion imitation.\n  Results. An algorithmic solution for respiratory motion prediction (called\nExSmi) is designed. ExSmi achieves good accuracy of prediction (error $4-9$\nmm/s) with acceptable jitter values (5-7 mm/s), as tested on out-of-sample\ndata. The datasets, the code for algorithms and the experiments are openly\navailable for research purposes on a dedicated website.\n  Conclusions.

We consider the\nentanglement entropy of spherical regions of vacuum, which is known to contain\nuniversal contributions. After perturbing the CFT with a relevant scalar\noperator, also the first order change of this quantity gives a universal term\nwhich only depends on a discrete set of basic CFT parameters. We show that in\ngravity this statement corresponds to the uniqueness of the ghost-free graviton\npropagator on an AdS background geometry. While the gravitational dynamics in\nthis context contains little information about the structure of the bulk\ntheory, there is a discrete set of dimensionless parameters of the theory which\ndetermines the entanglement entropy. We argue that for every (not necessarily\nholographic) CFT, any reasonable gravity model can be used to compute this\nparticular entanglement entropy.

Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that the position, presence, and intensity of peaks associated with\ncatechol's HOMO, intermolecular OH$-$O bonds, and interfacial hydrogen bonds to\nthe surface bridging O atoms (O$_{br}$H$-$C and O$_{br}$H$-$O) may be used to\nfingerprint deprotonation of catechol's OH anchoring groups.

We start this review article with the minimal\nmodel that captures the essence of such topological materials. The central part\nof this article is devoted to the superfluid $^3$He, which serves as a rich\nrepository of novel topological quantum phenomena originating from the\nintertwining of symmetries and topologies. In particular, it is emphasized that\nthe quantum fluid confined to nanofabricated geometries possesses multiple\nsuperfluid phases composed of the symmetry-protected topological superfluid\nB-phase, the A-phase as a Weyl superfluid, the nodal planar and polar phases,\nand the crystalline ordered stripe phase. All these phases generate noteworthy\ntopological phenomena, including topological phase transitions concomitant with\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, Majorana fermions, Weyl superfluidity, emergent\nsupersymmetry, spontaneous edge mass and spin currents, topological Fermi arcs,\nand exotic quasiparticles bound to topological defects. In relation to the mass\ncurrent carried by gapless edge states, we also briefly review a longstanding\nissue on the intrinsic angular momentum paradox in $^3$He-A. Moreover, we share\nthe current status of our knowledge on the topological aspects of\nunconventional superconductors, such as the heavy-fermion superconductor\nUPt$_3$ and superconducting doped topological insulators, in connection with\nthe superfluid $^3$He.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 14:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 14:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

At the same time it\nresolves the conceptual and computational problems due to the use of imaginary\ndata. Namely, (i) it dispenses with the need to select and average across all\npossible minimal imaginary samples, and (ii) it diminishes the effect that the\nimaginary data have upon the posterior distribution. These attributes allow for\nlarge sample approximations, when needed, in order to reduce the computational\nburden under more complex models. In this work we generalize the applicability\nof the PEP methodology, focusing on the framework of generalized linear models\n(GLMs), by introducing two new PEP definitions which are in effect applicable\nto any general model setting. Hyper-prior extensions for the power parameter\nthat regulates the contribution of the imaginary data are introduced. We\nfurther study the validity of the predictive matching and of the model\nselection consistency, providing analytical proofs for the former and empirical\nevidence supporting the latter.

In order\nto maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the system subject to the\ntransmitted power constraint, the design problem is to find the pre-coding\nmatrices at BTS and the decoding matrices at MSs. However, such a design\nproblem is typically a nonlinear and nonconvex optimization and, thus, it is\nquite hard to obtain the analytical solutions. To tackle with the mathematical\ndifficulties, we propose an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm to\noptimize the transceiver matrices. Specifically, we utilize the linear minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) Wiener filters at MSs. Then, we introduce the\nconstrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to jointly optimize the\nprecoding and decoding matrices. Numerical experiments are exhibited to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence,\ncomputational complexity and total WSR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 02:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The aim of\nthe proposed rank minimization IA schemes is to find the precoding and receiver\nsubspace matrices to align interference and wiretapped signals into the lowest\ndimension subspaces while keeping the desired signal subspace spanning full\navailable spatial dimensions. To deal with the nonconvexity of the rank\nfunction, we present two convex relaxations of the RCRM problem, namely nuclear\nnorm (NN) and reweighted nuclear norm (RNN), and transform the rank constraints\nto equivalent and tractable ones. We then derive a coordinate decent approach\nto obtain the solutions for IA schemes. The simulation results show that our\nproposed IA designs outperform the conventional IA design in terms of average\nsecrecy sum rate. On the other hand, our proposed designs perform the same or\nbetter than other secure IA schemes which account for low interference and\nwiretapped signal power rather than for low dimensions of interference and\nwiretapped signal matrices in the systems which achieve the perfect IA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 02:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The statistical properties of this random process and length of\nthe fragments are critical as they affect the information that can be\nsubsequently extracted, i.e., density of successfully inferred DNA fragment\nreads. The ensemble of overlapping DNA fragment reads are then used to\ncomputationally reconstruct the much longer target genome sequence, e.g,\nranging from hundreds of thousands to billions of base pairs. The success of\nthe reconstruction in turn depends on having a sufficiently large ensemble of\nDNA fragments that are sufficiently long. In this paper using stochastic\ngeometry we model and optimize the end-to-end process linking and partially\ncontrolling the statistics of the physical processes to the success of the\ncomputational step. This provides, for the first time, a framework capturing\nsalient features of such sequencing platforms that can be used to study cost,\nperformance or sensitivity of the sequencing process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 13:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-13"}
