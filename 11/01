The noise may have two kinds of effects: loss of atoms from the trap,\nand random shifts in the relative phase or number difference between the two\nwells. The effects of phase noise are mitigated by atom-atom interactions and\ntunneling, such that the dephasing rate may be reduced to half its single-atom\nvalue. Decoherence due to number noise (which induces fluctuations in the\nrelative atom number between the wells) is considerably enhanced by the\ninteractions. A similar scenario is predicted for the case of atom loss, even\nif the loss rates from the two sites are equal.

Incentive equilibria generalise well-studied solution concepts such as\nNash equilibria and leader equilibria (also known as Stackelberg equilibria).\nRecall that a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can improve\nhis payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally. In the setting of incentive\nand leader equilibria, there is a distinguished player called the leader who\ncan assign strategies to all other players, referred to as her followers. A\nstrategy profile is a leader strategy profile if no player, except for the\nleader, can improve his payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally, and a\nleader equilibrium is a leader strategy profile with a maximal return for the\nleader. In the proposed case of incentive equilibria, the leader can\nadditionally influence the behaviour of her followers by transferring parts of\nher payoff to her followers. The ability to incentivise her followers provides\nthe leader with more freedom in selecting strategy profiles, and we show that\nthis can indeed improve the payoff for the leader in such games. The key\nfundamental result of the paper is the existence of incentive equilibria in\nmean-payoff games. We further show that the decision problem related to\nconstructing incentive equilibria is NP-complete. On a positive note, we show\nthat, when the number of players is fixed, the complexity of the problem falls\nin the same class as two-player mean-payoff games. We also present an\nimplementation of the proposed algorithms, and discuss experimental results\nthat demonstrate the feasibility of the analysis of medium sized games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 23:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

By defining the crystal lattice point, at which more than one atom\nfall in the Wigner-Seitz cell of the lattice point, for the location of\ninterstitial atoms (LSIA), three types of events were identified for LSIA\nmigration: the jump remaining in one <112_0> direction (ILJ), the jump from one\n<112_0> to another <112_0> direction in the same basal plane (OLJ) and the jump\nfrom one basal plane to an adjacent basal plane (OPJ).

ILJ was found to be the\ndominant event in the temperature range (300K to 1200K), but the occurrence\nfrequencies of OLJ and OPJ increased with increasing temperature.

The accuracy of this\nestimation, obtained by finite difference methods, is often problem-dependent\nthat may lead to premature convergence of the algorithm.\n  In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative to L-BFGS, the limited memory\nCovariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (LM-CMA) proposed by Loshchilov\n(2014). The LM-CMA is a stochastic derivative-free algorithm for numerical\noptimization of non-linear, non-convex optimization problems. Inspired by the\nL-BFGS, the LM-CMA samples candidate solutions according to a covariance matrix\nreproduced from $m$ direction vectors selected during the optimization process.\nThe decomposition of the covariance matrix into Cholesky factors allows to\nreduce the memory complexity to $O(mn)$, where $n$ is the number of decision\nvariables.

In this work, we first perform a theoretical\nanalysis of the two schemes in the finite volume framework by comparing their\nnumerical flux evaluations. It is found that the effects of collision term are\nconsidered in the reconstructions of the cell-interface distribution function\nin both schemes, which explains why they can overcome the time step restriction\nand can give accurate results even as the time step is much larger than the\ncollision time. The difference between the two schemes lies in the treatment of\nthe integral of the collision term, in which the Bardow's scheme uses the\nrectangular rule while the DUGKS uses the trapezoidal rule. The performance of\nthe two schemes, i.e., accuracy, stability, and efficiency are then compared by\nsimulating several two dimensional flows, including the unsteady Taylor-Green\nvortex flow, the steady lid-driven cavity flow, and the laminar boundary layer\nproblem.

The sliding token problem is one of the\nreconfiguration problems that attract the attention from the viewpoint of\ntheoretical computer science. The reconfiguration problems tend to be\nPSPACE-complete in general, and some polynomial time algorithms are shown in\nrestricted cases. Recently, the problems that aim at finding a shortest\nreconfiguration sequence are investigated. For the 3SAT problem, a trichotomy\nfor the complexity of finding the shortest sequence has been shown, that is, it\nis in P, NP-complete, or PSPACE-complete in certain conditions. In general,\neven if it is polynomial time solvable to decide whether two instances are\nreconfigured with each other, it can be NP-complete to find a shortest sequence\nbetween them. Namely, finding a shortest sequence between two independent sets\ncan be more difficult than the decision problem of reconfigurability between\nthem.

Our model spectra at\n1000d take non-local radiative transfer into account, and find that this has a\ncrucial impact on the spectral formation. Although rapid cooling of the ejecta\nto a few 100 K occurs also in these models, the late-time optical/NIR flux is\nbrighter by 1-2 magnitudes due to redistribution of UV emissivity, resulting\nfrom non-thermal excitation and ionization. This effect brings models into\nbetter agreement with late-time observations of SN 2011fe and other Type Ia\nsupernovae, and offers a solution to the long standing discrepancy between\nmodels and observations. The models show that spectral formation shifts from Fe\nII and Fe III at 300d to Fe I at 1000d, which explains the apparent wavelength\nshifts seen in SN2011fe.

In this formalism, the derivation of the entropy of a black\nhole on bifurcation surface, as a quasi-local conserved charge is problematic.\nIn this paper we overcome to these problems by considering the concept of total\nvariation and the Lorentz-Lie derivative. We firstly find an expression for the\nADT conserved current in the context of the CSLTG which is based on the concept\nof the Killing vector fields. Then, we generalize it to be conserved for all\ndiffeomorphism generators. Thus, we can extract an off-shell conserved charge\nfor any vector field which generates a diffeomorphism. The formalism presented\nhere is based on the concept of quasi-local conserved charges which are\noff-shell. The charges can be calculated on any codimension two space-like\nsurface surrounding a black hole and the results are independent of the chosen\nsurface. By using the off-shell quasi-local conserved charge, we investigate\nthe Virasoro algebra and find a formula to calculate the central extension\nterm. We apply the formalism to the BTZ black hole solution in the context of\nthe Einstein gravity and the Generalized massive gravity, then we find the\neigenvalues of their Virasoro generators as well as the corresponding central\ncharges. Eventually, we calculate the entropy of the BTZ black hole by the\nCardy formula and we show that the result exactly matches with the one obtained\nby the concept of the off-shell conserved charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2015 06:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 14:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}
