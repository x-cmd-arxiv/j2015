Hartigan consistency has been used extensively\nas a framework to analyze such clustering algorithms from a statistical point\nof view.

Moreover,\nHartigan consistency is a limit property and does not directly quantify\ndifference between trees.\n  In this paper we identify two limit properties, separation and minimality,\nwhich address both over-segmentation and improper nesting and together imply\n(but are not implied by) Hartigan consistency. We proceed to introduce a merge\ndistortion metric between hierarchical clusterings and show that convergence in\nour distance implies both separation and minimality.

The\nnorthern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5\nkpc (1.5 Coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence). Everywhere along\nthe front, the temperature discontinuity is narrower than 4-8 kpc and the\nmetallicity gradient is narrower than 6 kpc, indicating that diffusion,\nconduction and mixing are suppressed across the interface. Such transport\nprocesses can be naturally suppressed by magnetic fields aligned with the cold\nfront. Interestingly, comparison to magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicates\nthat in order to maintain the observed sharp density and temperature\ndiscontinuities, conduction must also be suppressed along the magnetic field\nlines. However, the northwestern part of the cold front is observed to have a\nnon-zero width. While other explanations are possible, the broadening is\nconsistent with the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) on\nlength-scales of a few kpc. Based on comparison with simulations, the presence\nof KHI would imply that the effective viscosity of the intracluster medium is\nsuppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect to the isotropic\nSpitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity. Underneath the cold front, we\nobserve quasi-linear features that are ~10 per cent brighter than the\nsurrounding gas and are separated by ~15 kpc from each other in projection.\nComparison to tailored numerical simulations suggests that the observed\nphenomena may be due to the amplification of magnetic fields by gas sloshing in\nwide layers below the cold front, where the magnetic pressure reaches ~5-10 per\ncent of the thermal pressure, reducing the gas density between the bright\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 00:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 23:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

The computed creep modulus is\nfound to be independent of the shear stress applied and is in excellent\nagreement with nanoindentation measurements, as extrapolated to zero porosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 01:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For $\\mathcal{L}=10~\\text{ab}^{-1}$, the signal\nsignificance can be greater than 5 for $\\sqrt{s}=350~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and 3.9 for\n$\\sqrt{s}=500~\\mathrm{GeV}$ with the CP phase $\\xi\\in[\\pi/2,3\\pi/5]$. Besides\nthe cross section enhancement, the CP-violating $h\\bar{t}t$ coupling will\ninduce the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ which is absent in the SM and is\na clear signal of new CP violation. Compared with the $A_{FB}$ in the Higgs\ndecay $h\\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}\\gamma$, the $A_{FB}$ can be greatly enhanced in\nthe production process. For example $A_{FB}$ can reach 0.5 for $\\cos\\xi\\simeq\n0.7$ and $\\sqrt{s}=500~\\mathrm{GeV}$. Due to the large backgrounds, the\nsignificance of the expected $A_{FB}$ can only be observed at $1.7\\sigma$ with\n$\\mathcal{L}=10~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ and $\\sqrt{s}=500~\\mathrm{GeV}$. It is\nessential to trigger the single photon in the final state to separate the\nbottom jets arising from scalar or vector bosons, in order to isolate the\nsignal from the backgrounds more efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 03:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 07:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 12:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

Such a framework enables also the\nsystematic discovery of new learning rules and exploration of relationships\nbetween learning rules and group symmetries. We study polynomial local learning\nrules stratified by their degree and analyze their behavior and capabilities in\nboth linear and non-linear units and networks. Stacking local learning rules in\ndeep feedforward networks leads to deep local learning. While deep local\nlearning can learn interesting representations, it cannot learn complex\ninput-output functions, even when targets are available for the top layer.\nLearning complex input-output functions requires local deep learning where\ntarget information is communicated to the deep layers through a backward\nlearning channel. The nature of the communicated information about the targets\nand the structure of the learning channel partition the space of learning\nalgorithms. We estimate the learning channel capacity associated with several\nalgorithms and show that backpropagation outperforms them by simultaneously\nmaximizing the information rate and minimizing the computational cost, even in\nrecurrent networks. The theory clarifies the concept of Hebbian learning,\nestablishes the power and limitations of local learning rules, introduces the\nlearning channel which enables a formal analysis of the optimality of\nbackpropagation, and explains the sparsity of the space of learning rules\ndiscovered so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 05:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 23:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Our investigation is centred\naround two environmental conditions in particular: the cosmic ray ionisation\nrate (CRIR) and the strength of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Since\nboth these properties of the interstellar medium have their origins in massive\nstars, we make the assumption in this paper that both the strength of the ISRF\nand the CRIR scale linearly with the local star formation rate (SFR). The cloud\nmodelling in this study first involves running numerical simulations that\ncapture the cloud dynamics, as well as the time-dependent chemistry, and ISM\nheating and cooling.

If\nsuch planets exist, the question remains as to whether they could be identified\nvia spectral signatures of biomarkers. Such planets may be exposed to extreme\nintensities of cosmic rays that could perturb their atmospheric photochemistry.\nHere, we consider stellar activity of M-dwarfs ranging from quiet up to strong\nflaring conditions and investigate one particular effect upon biomarkers,\nnamely, the ability of secondary electrons caused by stellar cosmic rays to\nbreak up atmospheric molecular nitrogen (N2), which leads to production of\nnitrogen oxides in the planetary atmosphere, hence affecting biomarkers such as\nozone. We apply a stationary model, that is, without a time-dependence, hence\nwe are calculating the limiting case where the atmospheric chemistry response\ntime of the biomarkers is assumed to be slow and remains constant compared with\nrapid forcing by the impinging stellar flares. This point should be further\nexplored in future work with time-dependent models. For the flaring case O3 is\nmainly destroyed via direct titration with nitrogen oxides and not via the\nfamiliar catalytic cycle photochemistry, which occurs on Earth. For scenarios\nwith low O3, Rayleigh scattering by the main atmospheric gases became more\nimportant for shielding the planetary surface from ultra-violet radiation. A\nmajor result of this work is that the biomarker O3 survived all the\nstellar-activity scenarios considered except for the strong case, whereas the\nbiomarker nitrous oxide could survive in the planetary atmosphere under all\nconditions of stellar activity considered here, which clearly has important\nimplications for missions that aim to detect spectroscopic biomarkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 08:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In the context of general\n0-dimensional systems, Bratteli--Vershik systems are homeomorphisms that have\nKakutani--Rohlin refinements. Bratteli diagram has a strong power to analyze\nsuch systems. Besides this approach, general graph covers can be used to\nrepresent any 0-dimensional system. Indeed, all 0-dimensional systems can be\ndescribed as a certain kind of sequences of graph covers that may not be\nbrought about by the Kakutani--Rohlin partitions. In this paper, we follow the\ncontext of general graph covers to analyze the relations between ergodic\nmeasures and circuits of graph covers. First, we formalize the condition for a\nsequence of graph covers to represent minimal Cantor systems. In constructing\ninvariant measures, we deal with general compact metrizable 0-dimensional\nsystems. In the context of Bratteli diagrams with finite rank, it has\npreviously been mentioned that all ergodic measures should be limits of some\ncombinations of towers of Kakutani--Rohlin refinements. We demonstrate this for\ngeneral 0-dimensional case, and develop a theorem that expresses the\ncoincidence of the time average and the space average for ergodic measures.\nAdditionally, we formulate a theorem that signifies the old relation between\nuniform convergence and unique ergodicity in the context of graph circuits for\ngeneral 0-dimensional systems. Unlike previous studies, in our case of general\ngraph covers, there arise a possibility of linear dependence of circuits. We\ngive a condition for a full circuit system to be linearly independent.

The pair structure in the amorphous state is computed\nfrom a potential of the Stillinger Weber form. The transferability of the\nparameters during the quench is investigated using two parametrizations: from\nsolid state data, as usual, and from a new parametrization on the liquid\nstructure. When the adjustment is made on the pair structure of the liquid, a\nsatisfactory transferability is found between the pure components and their\nalloys. The liquid structure predicted in this way agrees well with experiment,\nin contrast with the one obtained using the adjustment on the solid. The final\nstructure, after quenches down to the amorphous state, determined with the new\nset of parameters is shown to be very close to the ab-initio one, the latter\nbeing in excellent agreement with recent X-rays diffraction experiments. The\ncorresponding critical temperature of the glass transition is estimated from\nthe behavior of the heat capacity.

Analyzing its complexity has been a very fruitful research\ndirection, especially for fixed template CSPs, denoted $CSP({\\bf \\Gamma})$, in\nwhich the right side structure ${\\bf \\Gamma}$ is fixed and the left side\nstructure ${\\bf R}$ is unconstrained.\n  Recently, the hybrid setting, written $CSP_{\\mathcal{H}}({\\bf \\Gamma})$,\nwhere both sides are restricted simultaneously, attracted some attention. It\nassumes that ${\\bf R}$ is taken from a class of relational structures\n$\\mathcal{H}$ that additionally is closed under inverse homomorphisms.

Under frequency dependent\nselection, the average fitness of the population may increase or decrease based\non interactions between individuals within the population. This should be\nreflected in fluctuations of the population size even in constant environments.\nHere, we propose a stochastic model, which naturally combines these two\nevolutionary ingredients by assuming frequency dependent competition between\ndifferent types in an individual-based model. In contrast to previous game\ntheoretic models, the carrying capacity of the population and thus the\npopulation size is determined by pairwise competition of individuals mediated\nby evolutionary games and demographic stochasticity. In the limit of infinite\npopulation size, the averaged stochastic dynamics is captured by the\ndeterministic competitive Lotka-Volterra equations. In small populations,\ndemographic stochasticity may instead lead to the extinction of the entire\npopulation. As the population size is driven by the fitness in evolutionary\ngames, a population of cooperators is less prone to go extinct than a\npopulation of defectors, whereas in the usual systems of fixed size, the\npopulation would thrive regardless of its average payoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 12:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This paper investigates the impact of node speed on\nthe throughput of WCS overlaid mobile networks when packet transmissions are\nconstrained by the energy status of each node. The energy provision for each\nnode depends on its moving speed. A slow-moving node outside the charging\nregion is unable to receive energy from WCSs for a long time, while one inside\nthe charging region consistently recharges the battery. Reflecting on these\nphenomena, we design a two-dimensional Markov chain, where the states\nrespectively represent the remaining energy and the distance to the nearest\nWCS. Solving this enables the following theoretic insights. Firstly, the\nthroughput is a non-decreasing function of node speed. With faster node speed,\nthe throughput converges to that of the independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) mobility model where nodes can move anywhere without being restricted\nby their previous positions. Secondly, if the battery capacity of each node is\ninfinite, the throughput is equivalent to that of the i.i.d. mobility model\nregardless of node speed.

This challenge has been chiefly addressed through\nlarge-scale numerical simulations. Alternatively, researchers have formulated\nmean-field theories to gain insight into macroscopic states of large neuronal\nnetworks in terms of the collective firing activity of the neurons, or the\nfiring rate. However, these theories have not succeeded in establishing an\nexact correspondence between the firing rate of the network and the underlying\nmicroscopic state of the spiking neurons. This has largely constrained the\nrange of applicability of such macroscopic descriptions, particularly when\ntrying to describe neuronal synchronization. Here we provide the derivation of\na set of exact macroscopic equations for a network of spiking neurons. Our\nresults reveal that the spike generation mechanism of individual neurons\nintroduces an effective coupling between two biophysically relevant macroscopic\nquantities, the firing rate and the mean membrane potential, which together\ngovern the evolution of the neuronal network. The resulting equations exactly\ndescribe all possible macroscopic dynamical states of the network, including\nstates of synchronous spiking activity.

We begin by exploring the fundamental theory of cofinite directed\ngraphs in full generality. The general theory turns out to be almost completely\nanalogous to that of cofinite groups. For instance, every cofinite directed\ngraph has a unique completion which is a com- pact cofinite direct graph.\nMoreover, compact cofinite directed graphs are precisely the profinite directed\ngraphs, i.e., projective limits of finite discrete topological directed graphs.\nWe then apply the general theory to directed graphs with additional structure\nsuch as graphs (in the sense of Serre) and groupoids, thus leading to the\nnotions of cofinite graphs and cofinite groupoids. Cofinite groupoids with only\nfinitely many identities behave much the same as cofinite groups, which are the\nsame thing as cofinite groupoids with a single identity. However the situation\nfor cofinite groupoids with infinitely many identities is more complicated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 14:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 22:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

In this paper, we develop a novel machine\nlearning method called nonparametric Bayesian double articulation analyzer\n(NPB-DAA) that can directly acquire language and acoustic models from observed\ncontinuous speech signals. For this purpose, we propose an integrative\ngenerative model that combines a language model and an acoustic model into a\nsingle generative model called the \"hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden\nlanguage model\" (HDP-HLM). The HDP-HLM is obtained by extending the\nhierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semi-Markov model (HDP-HSMM) proposed by\nJohnson et al. An inference procedure for the HDP-HLM is derived using the\nblocked Gibbs sampler originally proposed for the HDP-HSMM. This procedure\nenables the simultaneous and direct inference of language and acoustic models\nfrom continuous speech signals. Based on the HDP-HLM and its inference\nprocedure, we developed a novel double articulation analyzer. By assuming\nHDP-HLM as a generative model of observed time series data, and by inferring\nlatent variables of the model, the method can analyze latent double\narticulation structure, i.e., hierarchically organized latent words and\nphonemes, of the data in an unsupervised manner. The novel unsupervised double\narticulation analyzer is called NPB-DAA.\n  The NPB-DAA can automatically estimate double articulation structure embedded\nin speech signals. We also carried out two evaluation experiments using\nsynthetic data and actual human continuous speech signals representing Japanese\nvowel sequences. In the word acquisition and phoneme categorization tasks, the\nNPB-DAA outperformed a conventional double articulation analyzer (DAA) and\nbaseline automatic speech recognition system whose acoustic model was trained\nin a supervised manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 15:21:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 15:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}

Four new iterative batch BSS\nalgorithms are presented dealing with the multimodulus (MM) and alphabet\nmatched (AM) criteria. For the optimization of these cost functions, iterative\nmethods of Givens and hyperbolic rotations are used. A pre-whitening operation\nis also utilized to reduce the complexity of design problem. It is noticed that\nthe designed algorithms using Givens rotations gives satisfactory performance\nonly for large number of samples.

Comparison with RRL templates verifies the recovery of the free-free\nemission along the Galactic plane. Comparison of the high-latitude Halpha\nemission with our free-free map shows residuals that correlate with dust\noptical depth, consistent with a fraction (~30%) of Halpha having been\nscattered by high-latitude dust. We highlight a number of diffuse spinning dust\nmorphological features at high latitude. There is substantial spatial variation\nin the spinning dust spectrum, with the emission peak ranging from below 20GHz\nto more than 50GHz. There is a strong tendency for the spinning dust component\nnear many prominent HII regions to have a higher peak frequency, suggesting\nthat this increase in peak frequency is associated with dust in the\nphotodissociation regions around the nebulae. The emissivity of spinning dust\nin these diffuse regions is of the same order as previous detections in the\nliterature. Over the entire sky, the commander solution finds more anomalous\nmicrowave emission than the WMAP component maps, at the expense of synchrotron\nand free-free emission. This can be explained by the difficulty in separating\nmultiple broadband components with a limited number of frequency maps. Future\nsurveys (5-20GHz), will greatly improve the separation by constraining the\nsynchrotron spectrum. We combine Planck/WMAP data to make the highest S/N ratio\nmaps yet of the intensity of the all-sky polarized synchrotron emission at\nfrequencies above a few GHz.

We propose\nto enhance single model quality assessment with a functionality evaluation\nphase for proteins whose quantitative functional characteristics are known. In\nparticular, this idea can be applied to evaluation of structural models of ion\nchannels, whose main function - conducting ions - can be quantitatively\nmeasured with the patch-clamp technique providing the current-voltage\ncharacteristics. The study was performed on a set of KcsA channel models\nobtained from complete and incomplete contact maps. A fast continuous\nelectrodiffusion model was used for calculating the current-voltage\ncharacteristics of structural models. We found that the computed charge\nselectivity and total current were sensitive to structural and electrostatic\nquality of models. In practical terms, we show that evaluating predicted\nconductance values is an appropriate method to eliminate modes with an occluded\npore or with multiple erroneously created pores. Moreover, filtering models on\nthe basis of their predicted charge selectivity results in a substantial\nenrichment of the candidate set in highly accurate models. In addition to being\na proof of the concept, our function-oriented single model quality assessment\ntool can be directly applied for evaluation of structural models of\nstrongly-selective protein channels. Finally, our work raises an important\nquestion whether a computational validation of functionality should not be\nincluded in the evaluation process of structural models, whenever possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 15:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}
