The extra-dimension strongly enhances the trapping\ntimes inducing plateaus and distinct algebraic and exponential decays in the\nRTS plots. The combined analysis of the RTS with the classification of ordered\nand chaotic regimes and scaling properties, allows us to describe the intricate\nway trajectories penetrate the before impenetrable regular islands from the\nuncoupled case. Essentially the plateaus found in the RTS are related to\ntrajectories that stay long times inside trapping tubes, not allowing\nrecurrences, and then penetrates diffusively the islands (from the uncoupled\ncase) by a diffusive motion along such tubes in the extra-dimension. All\nasymptotic exponential decays for the RTS are related to an ordered regime\n(quasi-regular motion) and a mixing dynamics is conjectured for the model.\nThese results are compared to the RTS of the standard map with dissipation or\nnoise, showing the peculiarities obtained by using three-dimensional VPS.

These relations can be encoded in\ngraphical way via a structured dynamic network, referred to as \"sparse plus\nlow-rank (S+L) network\" hereafter. The problem of finding the S+L network as\nwell as the dynamic model can be posed as a system identification problem.

However, rigorous evaluation of this\nkind of functions often implies a very high computational cost, unacceptable in\nreal-time applications. To alleviate this problem, functions are commonly\napproximated by simpler piecewise-polynomial representations. Following this\nidea, we propose a novel, efficient, and practical technique to evaluate\ncomplex and continuous functions using a nearly optimal design of two types of\npiecewise linear approximations in the case of a large budget of evaluation\nsubintervals. To this end, we develop a thorough error analysis that yields\nasymptotically tight bounds to accurately quantify the approximation\nperformance of both representations. It provides an improvement upon previous\nerror estimates and allows the user to control the trade-off between the\napproximation error and the number of evaluation subintervals. To guarantee\nreal-time operation, the method is suitable for, but not limited to, an\nefficient implementation in modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), where it\noutperforms previous alternative approaches by exploiting the fixed-function\ninterpolation routines present in their texture units. The proposed technique\nis a perfect match for any application requiring the evaluation of continuous\nfunctions, we have measured in detail its quality and efficiency on several\nfunctions, and, in particular, the Gaussian function because it is extensively\nused in many areas of computer vision and cybernetics, and it is expensive to\nevaluate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 20:49:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

Appropriately scaled families of DiPerna-Lions-(Mischler) renormalized\nsolutions with Maxwell reflection boundary conditions are shown to have\nfluctuations that converge as the Knudsen number goes to zero. Every limit\npoint is a weak solution to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with different\ntypes of boundary conditions depending on the ratio between the accommodation\ncoefficient and the Knudsen number. The main new result of the paper is that\nthis convergence is strong in the case of Dirichlet boundary condition. Indeed,\nwe prove that the acoustic waves are damped immediately, namely they are damped\nin a boundary layer in time. This damping is due to the presence of viscous and\nkinetic boundary layers in space.

The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that\nevolves observable functions of the state-space of a dynamical system [Koopman\n1931, PNAS]. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed\nusing dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the\nstate variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too\nrestrictive for nonlinear systems [Williams et al. 2015, JNLS]. Choosing\nnonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is\npossible to obtain linear models, especially those that are useful for control,\nis an open challenge.\n  Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis\nthat enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems.\nFirst, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the\nobservable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible\nwhen there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed\npoints or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate\nto a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a\nfinite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then\npresent a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for\nKoopman analysis using a new algorithm to determine terms in a dynamical system\nby sparse regression of the data in a nonlinear function space [Brunton et al.\n2015, arxiv]; we show how this algorithm is related to DMD.

Given the\ngeometry of the lampshade and a target grayscale image, our method computes a\ndistribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of\nthe light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse\nsurface. Our objective is to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial\ndetail of the target image, to the extent possible within the constraints of\nthe fabrication process.\n  To ensure structural integrity, there are lower bounds on the thickness of\nthe shell, the radii of the holes, and the minimal distances between adjacent\nholes. Thus, the holes are realized as thin tubes distributed over the\nlampshade surface. The amount of light passing through a single tube may be\ncontrolled by the tube's radius and by its direction (tilt angle). The core of\nour technique thus consists of determining a suitable configuration of the\ntubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well\nas the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by\ncomputing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined\ndensity function, and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of\neach tessellation cell. The density function for a particular target image is\nderived from a series of simulated images, each corresponding to a different\nuniform density tube pattern on the lampshade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2015 08:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

We argue that this is a reasonable model for highly dynamic\nwireless network transmissions. We demonstrate that in this setup prior network\nerror-correcting schemes can be arbitrarily far from achieving the optimal\nnetwork throughput. A new transform metric for errors under the considered\nmodel is proposed. Using this metric, we replicate many of the classical\nresults from coding theory. Specifically, we prove new Hamming-type,\nPlotkin-type, and Elias-Bassalygo-type upper bounds on the network capacity. A\ncommensurate lower bound is shown based on Gilbert-Varshamov-type codes for\nerror-correction. The GV codes used to attain the lower bound can be\nnon-coherent, that is, they do not require prior knowledge of the network\ntopology. We also propose a computationally-efficient concatenation scheme. The\nrate achieved by our concatenated codes is characterized by a Zyablov-type\nlower bound. We provide a generalized minimum-distance decoding algorithm which\ndecodes up to half the minimum distance of the concatenated codes. The\nend-to-end nature of our design enables our codes to be overlaid on the\nclassical distributed random linear network codes [1]. Furthermore, the\npotentially intensive computation at internal nodes for the link-by-link\nerror-correction is un-necessary based on our design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2015 15:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

On the basis of multi-wavelength data from mid-infrared\nto millimeter collected using $Spitzer$, $Herschel$, and ground based radio\ntelescopes, the physical status of interstellar medium and star formation in\nthese regions have been revealed. In a relatively large infrared dust bubble,\nactive star formation is undergoing and the shell is still expanding. Signs of\ncompressed gas and triggered star formation have been tentatively detected in a\nrelatively small bubble. The dense cores in the Rosette Molecular Complex\ndetected at 1.1 mm using SMA have been speculated to have a likely triggered\norigin according to their spatial distribution. Although some observational\nresults have been obtained, more efforts are necessary to reach trustworthy\nconclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2015 02:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}
