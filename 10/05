In such structures, the\nboron nitride acts as a tunnel barrier, which weakly couples states in the\ngraphene, to form mini-bands . In un-doped nanoribbons, the mini bands are\nsymmetrically positioned relative to the Fermi energy and do not enhance\nthermoelectric performance significantly. In contrast, when the ribbons are\ndoped by electron donating or electron accepting adsorbates, the thermopower S\nand electronic figure of merit are enhanced and either positive or negative\nthermopowers can be obtained. In the most favourable case, doping with the\nelectron donor tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) increases the room-temperature\nthermopower to -284 {\\mu}v/K and doping by the electron acceptor\ntetracyanoethylene (TCNE) increases S to 210 {\\mu}v/K.

However prediction of protein function and dynamics from its\nsequence and structure is still a fundamental challenge in molecular biology.\nProtein classification, which is typically done through measuring the\nsimilarity be- tween proteins based on protein sequence or physical\ninformation, serves as a crucial step toward the understanding of protein\nfunction and dynamics. Persistent homology is a new branch of algebraic\ntopology that has found its success in the topological data analysis in a\nvariety of disciplines, including molecular biology. The present work explores\nthe potential of using persistent homology as an indepen- dent tool for protein\nclassification. To this end, we propose a molecular topological fingerprint\nbased support vector machine (MTF-SVM) classifier. Specifically, we construct\nmachine learning feature vectors solely from protein topological fingerprints,\nwhich are topological invariants generated during the filtration process. To\nvalidate the present MTF-SVM approach, we consider four types of problems.\nFirst, we study protein-drug binding by using the M2 channel protein of\ninfluenza A virus. We achieve 96% accuracy in discriminating drug bound and\nunbound M2 channels. Additionally, we examine the use of MTF-SVM for the\nclassification of hemoglobin molecules in their relaxed and taut forms and\nobtain about 80% accuracy. The identification of all alpha, all beta, and\nalpha-beta protein domains is carried out in our next study using 900 proteins.\nWe have found a 85% success in this identifica- tion. Finally, we apply the\npresent technique to 55 classification tasks of protein superfamilies over 1357\nsamples. An average accuracy of 82% is attained. The present study establishes\ncomputational topology as an independent and effective alternative for protein\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 17:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

Locating the CO snow line, where the CO gas column density is\nexpected to drop substantially, based solely on CO emission profiles is\nchallenging. This has prompted an exploration of chemical signatures of CO\nfreeze-out. We present ALMA Cycle 1 observations of the N2H+ J=3-2 and DCO+\nJ=4-3 emission lines toward the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD~163296 at\n~0.5\" (60 AU) resolution, and evaluate their utility as tracers of the CO snow\nline location. The N2H+ emission is distributed in a ring with an inner radius\nat 90 AU, corresponding to a midplane temperature of 25 K. This result is\nconsistent with a new analysis of optically thin C18O data, which implies a\nsharp drop in CO abundance at 90 AU. Thus N2H+ appears to be a robust tracer of\nthe midplane CO snow line. The DCO+ emission also has a ring morphology, but\nneither the inner nor the outer radius coincides with the CO snow line location\nof 90 AU, indicative of a complex relationship between DCO+ emission and CO\nfreeze-out in the disk midplane. Compared to TW Hya, CO freezes out at a higher\ntemperature in the disk around HD 163296 (25 vs. 17 K in the TW Hya disk),\nperhaps due to different ice compositions. This highlights the importance of\nactually measuring the CO snow line location, rather than assuming a constant\nCO freeze-out temperature for all disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 19:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

These ubiquitous\nperturbations are observed to undergo strong damping as they propagate. Using\n3D numerical simulations of footpoint-driven transverse waves propagating in a\ncoronal plasma with a cylindrical density structure, in combination with\nanalytical modelling, it is demonstrated that the observed velocity\nperturbations can be understood in terms of coupling of different wave modes in\nthe inhomogeneous boundaries of the loops. Mode coupling in the inhomogeneous\nboundary layers of the loops leads to the coupling of the transversal (kink)\nmode to the azimuthal (Alfven) mode, observed as the decay of the transverse\nkink oscillations. Both the numerical and analytical results show the spatial\nprofile of the damped wave has a Gaussian shape to begin with, before switching\nto exponential decay at large heights.

In recent years, a method based on algebraic geometry has\nallowed us to analyze the accuracy of predicting observable variables when\nusing Bayesian estimation. However, how to analyze latent variables has not\nbeen sufficiently studied, even though one of the main issues in unsupervised\nlearning is to determine how accurately the latent variable is estimated. A\nprevious study proposed a method that can be used when the range of the latent\nvariable is redundant compared with the model generating data.

We investigate the influence of different masks\nemployed in the analysis of CMB angular distribution, in particular in the\nexcess of power in the Southeastern quadrant (SEQ) and the lack of power in the\nNortheastern quadrant (NEQ). We compare the two-point correlation function\n(TPCF) computed for each quadrant of the CMB foreground-cleaned temperature\nmaps to 1000 simulations generated assuming the LCDM best-fit power spectrum\nusing four different masks. In addition to the quadrants, we computed the TPCF\nfor circular regions in the map where the excess and lack of power are present.\nWe also compare the effect of Galactic cuts in the TPCF calculations as\ncompared to the simulations.

The results indicate that the excess of\npower in the SEQ tends to vanish as the portion of the sky covered by the mask\nincreases and the lack of power in the NEQ remains virtually unchanged. When\nUT78 mask is applied, the NEQ becomes no longer anomalous and the excess of\npower in the SEQ becomes the most significant one among the masks.\nNevertheless, the asymmetry between the SEQ and NEQ is independent of the mask\nand it is in disagreement with the isotropic model with at least 95% C.L.

If one requires the effective action\nwhich underlies the QCD Lagrangian to remain conformally invariant and extends\nthe formalism of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan to light-front Hamiltonian\ntheory, then a unique, color-confining potential with a mass parameter $\\kappa$\nemerges. The actual value of the parameter $\\kappa$ is not set by the model -\nonly ratios of hadron masses and other hadronic mass scales are predicted. The\nresult is a nonperturbative, relativistic light-front quantum mechanical wave\nequation, the Light-Front Schr\\\"odinger Equation which incorporates color\nconfinement and other essential spectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron\nphysics, including a massless pion for zero quark mass and linear Regge\ntrajectories with the identical slope in the radial quantum number $n$ and\norbital angular momentum $L$. The same light-front equations for mesons with\nspin $J$ also can be derived from the holographic mapping to QCD (3+1) at fixed\nlight-front time from the soft-wall model modification of AdS$_5$ space with a\nspecific dilaton profile. Light-front holography thus provides a precise\nrelation between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of AdS space\nand the boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the internal\nstructure of hadrons in physical space-time. One can also extend the analysis\nto baryons using superconformal algebra - $2 \\times 2$ supersymmetric\nrepresentations of the conformal group. The resulting fermionic LF bound-state\nequations predict striking similarities between the meson and baryon spectra.\nIn fact, the holographic QCD light-front Hamiltonians for the states on the\nmeson and baryon trajectories are identical if one shifts the internal\nangular...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 01:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Via the\ndynamical invariant condition, the results demonstrate that this dynamical\ninvariant exists under the circumstances of emergence of decoherence free\nsubspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 06:19:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 02:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

However,\nthey have largely ignored the fact that individuals make decisions on whether\nto create links to other individuals based on cost and benefit of linking, and\nthe fact that individuals may use perception of the network in their decision\nmaking. In this paper, we study the evolution of social networks in terms of\nperception-based strategic link formation. Here each individual has her own\nperception of the actual network, and uses it to decide whether to create a\nlink to another individual. An individual with the least perception accuracy\ncan benefit from updating her perception using that of the most accurate\nindividual via a new link. This benefit is compared to the cost of linking in\ndecision making. Once a new link is created, it affects the accuracies of other\nindividuals' perceptions, leading to a further evolution of the actual network.\nAs for initial actual networks, we consider homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncases. The homogeneous initial actual network is modeled by Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\n(ER) random networks, while we take a star network for the heterogeneous case.\nIn any cases, individual perceptions of the actual network are modeled by ER\nrandom networks with controllable linking probability. Then the stable link\ndensity of the actual network is found to show discontinuous transitions or\njumps according to the cost of linking. As the number of jumps is the\nconsequence of the dynamical complexity, we discuss the effect of initial\nconditions on the number of jumps to find that the dynamical complexity\nstrongly depends on how much individuals initially overestimate or\nunderestimate the link density of the actual network. For the heterogeneous\ncase, the role of the highly connected individual as an information spreader is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 06:19:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 05:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 12:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

In order to use these properties efficiently, we propose a new family of\nnon-convex losses named $\\gamma$-robust losses.

In general the absorption in the typical studied materials can be\nneglected and this technique is limited to the measurement of the reflectivity\nonly. In the case of strongly absorbing nuclei the number of neutrons is not\nconserved and the absorption can be directly measured by using the\nneutron-induced fluorescence technique which exploits the prompt particle\nemission of absorbing isotopes. This technique is emerging from soft matter and\nbiology where highly absorbing nuclei, generally in very small quantities, are\nused as a label for buried layers. Nowadays the importance of highly absorbing\nlayers is rapidly increasing, partially because of their application in neutron\ndetection; a field that has become more and more active also due to the\n3He-shortage. In this manuscript we extend the neutron-induced fluorescence\ntechnique to the study of thick layers of highly absorbing materials; in\nparticular 10B4C. The theory of neutron reflectometry is a commonly studied\ntopic, however the subtle relationship between the reflection and the\nabsorption of neutrons is not widely known, in particular when a strong\nabsorption is present. The theory for a general stack of absorbing layers has\nbeen developed and compared to measurements. This new technique has potential\nas a tool for characterization of highly absorbing layers.

These tracts linked hippocampus to septum, and amygdala to BNST.\nSeptal and BNST axons passed by anteromedial thalamic nucleus to MHb, which\nprojected to pineal gland. Question is what is the MHb doing and why it\nreceives information from hippocampus via septum? This study explores the MHb\nconnectivity, predicts its functional role and how it is linked to memory.\nCombination of known findings about the septum and MHb connectivity and\nfunction led to this circuit-based idea that posterior septum activates MHb,\nMHb activates IPN,and IPN stimulates MRN and its serotonin release. Proposed\nidea is that this MHb-IPN-MRN circuit promotes slow wave sleep (SWS), high\nserotonin and low acetylcholine state. My prediction is that this SWS-promoting\ncircuit reciprocally suppresses the theta oscillations promoting circuit,\nlinked to high acetylcholine levels in brain, and formed by supramamillary area\nprojections to the medial septum (MS) that induces theta rhythm in hippocampus\nand other theta-coupled regions. The MHb-IPN-MRN pathway likely inhibits,\npossibly reciprocally,some regions that have stimulating input to the\ntheta-generating SUM and MS, such as the wake promoting nucleus incertus,\nposterior and lateral hypothalamus and LDT, but also the REM sleep inducing\nneurons in LDT and PnO. Thus, proposed SWS- promoting circuit attenuates the\noutput of theta-promoting regions, both the active wake-on and REM-on regions.\nThe theta rhythm in wake state is linked to recording and binding information\nwith their spatio-temporal and relational context by hippocampus, while the SWS\nsupports rest and replay of hippocampaly stored information and their cortical\nreactivations, e. g. in retrosplenial cortex linked to autobiographic memory or\nin prefrontal cortex that can combine information from any source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 11:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2015 16:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 18:53:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 14:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 12:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

The spectroscopic time\nseries for SN 2012ca is essentially unchanged over 1.5 years, and appear to be\ndominated at all epochs by signatures of interaction with a dense circumstellar\nmedium rather than the underlying supernova (SN). At late phases, we see a near\ninfrared excess in flux which is possibly associated with dust formation,\nalthough without any signs of accompanying line shifts. SN 2012ca is a member\nof the set of type of the ambiguous IIn/Ia-CSM SNe, the nature of which have\nbeen debated extensively in the literature. The two leading scenarios are\neither a type Ia SN exploding within a dense CSM from a non-degenerate, evolved\ncompanion, or a core-collapse SN from a massive star. While some members of the\npopulation have been unequivocally associated with type Ia SNe, in other cases\nthe association is less certain. While it is possible that SN 2012ca does arise\nfrom a thermonuclear SN, this would require a relatively high (between 20 and\n70 per cent) efficiency in converting kinetic energy to optical luminosity, and\na massive (~2.3-2.6 Msun) circumstellar medium. On the basis of energetics, and\nthe results of simple modelling, we suggest that SN 2012ca is more likely\nassociated with a core-collapse SN. This would imply that the observed set of\nsimilar SNe to SN 2012ca is in fact originated by two populations, and while\nthese are drawn from physically distinct channels, they can have\nobservationally similar properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 11:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 09:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Based on the law of reflection/refraction and the\nwell-known integrability condition, we derive a general condition for the\nsurface and ray mapping for a collimated input beam. It is shown that in a\nsmall-angle approximation a proper mapping can be calculated via optimal mass\ntransport. We show that the surface can be constructed by solving a linear\nadvection equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The results imply that\nthe optimal mass transport mapping is approximately integrable over a wide\nrange of distances between the freeform and the target plane and offer an\nefficient way to construct the surface by solving standard integrals.

This work\naims at selecting and studying a sample of radio sources with high RM, thus to\nstudy their physical conditions and their status with respect to their\nsurrounding medium. We want to understand if any connection is present between\nthe AGN hosting galaxy medium with some evolutionary track and/or some\nrestarting phase of the AGN itself. Multifrequency single-dish observations\nwere performed with the 100-m Effelsberg telescope to define the initial\nsample, to characterise the SED of the final sample (30 targets) and to\ndetermine their RM in the 11 to 2 cm wavelength range. From the observations,\nthe SED together with polarisation information, i.e. the fractional\npolarisation and the polarisation angle, have been determined. Three different\nobject types were revealed from the SEDs analysis: Older, GPS-like and Mixed.\nFor each of the targets, the rotation measure has been found and the\ndepolarisation has been modelled. No significant correlation have been found\nbetween the depolarisation behaviours and the SEDs, while a correlation has\nbeen found between sources with mixed SED (with an old component at low\nfrequency and compact components at high frequencies) and high values of the\nrotation measure (with values in the rest frame larger than 1000 rad/m^2). This\nwork helps us to define and identify a sample of sources with high RM.

While monotone systems\nhave a characterization in terms of their vector fields (i.e. Kamke-Muller\ncondition), eventually monotone systems have not been characterized in such an\nexplicit manner. In order to provide a characterization, we drew inspiration\nfrom the results for linear systems, where eventually monotone (positive)\nsystems are studied using the spectral properties of the system (i.e.\nPerron-Frobenius property).

While an adiabatic approach is often\nsufficient to get information on the stellar equilibrium structures it is not\nsufficient to get a full understanding of the physics of the oscillation.\nIndeed, it does not permit one to answer some fundamental questions about the\noscillations, such as: What are the physical mechanisms responsible for the\npulsations inside stars? What determines the amplitudes? To what extent the\nadiabatic approximation is valid? All these questions can only be addressed by\nconsidering the energy exchanges between the oscillations and the surrounding\nmedium.\n  This lecture therefore aims at considering the energetical aspects of stellar\npulsations with particular emphasis on the driving and damping mechanisms. To\nthis end, the full non-adiabatic equations are introduced and thoroughly\ndiscussed. Two types of pulsation are distinguished, namely the self-excited\noscillations that result from an instability and the solar-like oscillations\nthat result from a balance between driving and damping by turbulent convection.\nFor each type, the main physical principles are presented and illustrated using\nrecent observations obtained with the ultra-high precision photometry\nspace-borne missions (MOST, CoRoT and Kepler). Finally, we consider in detail\nthe physics of scaling relations, which relates the seismic global indices with\nthe global stellar parameters and gave birth to the development of statistical\n(or ensemble) asteroseismology.

For strong\ninteractions, the spectra reveal multiplon physics, i.e., relevant final states\nare characterized by two (doublon), three (triplon), four (quadruplon) and more\nholes, potentially forming stable compound objects or resonances with finite\nlifetime. These give rise to several satellites in the spectra with largely\ndifferent spectral weights as well as to different continua. The complex\nmultiplon phenomenology is analyzed by interpreting not only local and\nk-resolved two-hole spectra but also three- and four-hole spectra for the\nHubbard model and by referring to effective low-energy models. In addition, a\nfilter-operator technique is presented which allows to extract specific\ninformation on the final states at a given excitation energy. While multiplons\ncomposed of an odd number of holes do neither form stable compounds nor\nwell-defined resonances unless a nearest-neighbor density interaction V is\nadded to the Hamiltonian, the doublon and the quadruplon are well-defined\nresonances. The k-resolved four-hole spectrum at n=2 represents an interesting\nspecial case where a completely stable quadruplon turns into a resonance by\nmerging with the doublon-doublon continuum at a critical wave vector. For all\nfillings with n > 1, the doublon lifetime is strongly k-dependent and is even\ninfinite at the Brillouin zone edges as demonstrated by k-resolved two-hole\nspectra.

For each integrable\nnonlinear evolution equation (NLEE) in the hierarchy, dual integrable\nstructures are characterized by the fact that the zero-curvature representation\nof the NLEE can be realized by two Hamiltonian formulations stemming from two\ndistinct choices of the configuration space, yielding two inequivalent Poisson\nstructures on the corresponding phase space and two distinct Hamiltonians. This\nis fundamentally different from the standard bi-Hamiltonian or generally\nmultitime structure. The first formulation chooses purely space-dependent\nfields as configuration space; it yields the standard Poisson structure for\nNLS. The other one is new: it chooses purely time-dependent fields as\nconfiguration space and yields a different Poisson structure at each level of\nthe hierarchy. The corresponding NLEE becomes a {\\it space} evolution equation.\nWe emphasize the role of the Lagrangian formulation as a unifying framework for\nderiving both Poisson structures, using ideas from covariant field theory. One\nof our main results is to show that the two matrices of the Lax pair satisfy\nthe same form of ultralocal Poisson algebra (up to a sign) characterized by an\n$r$-matrix structure, whereas traditionally only one of them is involved in the\nclassical $r$-matrix method. We construct explicit dual hierarchies of\nHamiltonians, and Lax representations of the triggered dynamics, from the\nmonodromy matrices of either Lax matrix.

The weight functions are employed to\ndescribe propagation of a semi-infinite crack beneath the half-plane boundary\nat piecewise constant speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 00:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

In the present work we\nhave presented a new mathematical model of the non-conservative mass transfer\nwith a uniform mass accretion rate in a contact binary system with lower\nangular momentum. The model has been developed under the consideration of\nreverse mass transfer which may occur simultaneously with the original mass\ntransfer as a result of the large scale circulations encircling the entire\ndonor and a significant portion of the gainer. These circulations in contact\nbinaries with lower angular momentum are caused by the overflow of the critical\nequipotential surface by both the components of the binary system making the\ngoverning system more intricate and uncertain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 10:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

Canines have been reported to detect bladder cancer (sensitivity of\n0.63-0.73 and specificity of 0.64-0.92) and prostate cancer (sensitivity of\n0.91-0.99 and specificity of 0.91-0.97) from urine; breast cancer (sensitivity\nof 0.88 and specificity of 0.98) and lung cancer (sensitivity 0.56-0.99 and\nspecificity of 8.30-0.99) on breath and colorectal cancer from stools\n(sensitivity of 0.91-0.97 and specificity of 0.97-0.99). The quoted figures of\nsensitivity and specificity across differing studies demonstrate that in many\ncases results are variable from study to study; this raises questions about the\nreproducibility of methodology and study design which we have identified\nherein. Furthermore in some studies the controls used have resulted in\ndifferentiation of samples which are of limited use for clinical diagnosis.\nThese studies provide some evidence that cancer gives rise to different\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) compared to healthy samples. Whilst canine\ndetection may be unsuitable for clinical implementation they can, at least,\nprovide inspiration for more traditional laboratory investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 15:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}
