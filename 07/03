The first class of the quadrature rules has a polynomial\norder of convergence and the second class has an exponential order of\nconvergence. We first modify the moment-free Filon-type method for the\noscillatory integrals without a singularity or a stationary point to accelerate\ntheir convergence. We then consider the oscillatory integrals without a\nsingularity or a stationary point and then those with singularities and\nstationary points. The composite quadrature rules are developed based on\npartitioning the integration domain according to the wave number and the\nsingularity of the integrand. The integral defined on a subinterval has either\na weak singularity without rapid oscillation or oscillation without a\nsingularity. The classical quadrature rules for weakly singular integrals using\ngraded points are employed for the singular integral without rapid oscillation\nand the modified moment-free Filon-type method is used for the oscillatory\nintegrals without a singularity. Unlike the existing methods, the proposed\nmethods do not have to compute the inverse of the oscillator.

In particular, time-odd and tensor terms in these\nfunctionals are naturally present during the dynamical evolution, while being\nabsent or minimally important for most static calculations. The parameters of\nthese terms are determined by the requirement of Galilean invariance or local\ngauge invariance but their significance for the reaction dynamics have not been\nfully studied. This work addresses this question with emphasis on the tensor\nforce. Method: The full version of the Skyrme force, including terms arising\nonly from the Skyrme tensor force, is applied to the study of collisions within\na completely symmetry-unrestricted TDHF implementation. Results: We examine the\neffect on fusion thresholds with and without the tensor force terms and find an\neffect on the fusion threshold energy of the order several MeV. Details of the\ndistribution of the energy within terms in the energy density functional is\nalso discussed. Conclusions: Terms in the energy density functional linked to\nthe tensor force can play a non-negligible role in dynamic processes in nuclei,\nincluding those in which the terms do not affect ground state properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 16:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

For different values of k, this\nreduces to Maximum Acyclic Subgraph (k=n), and Max-Dicut (k=2). This work\nstudies the approximability of Max-k-Ordering and its generalizations,\nmotivated by their applications to job scheduling with soft precedence\nconstraints. We give an LP rounding based 2-approximation algorithm for\nMax-k-Ordering for any k={2,..., n}, improving on the known\n2k/(k-1)-approximation obtained via random assignment. The tightness of this\nrounding is shown by proving that for any k={2,..., n} and constant\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, Max-k-Ordering has an LP integrality gap of 2 -\n$\\varepsilon$ for $n^{\\Omega\\left(1/\\log\\log k\\right)}$ rounds of the\nSherali-Adams hierarchy.\n  A further generalization of Max-k-Ordering is the restricted maximum acyclic\nsubgraph problem or RMAS, where each vertex v has a finite set of allowable\nlabels $S_v \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}^+$.

General\ncirculation models (GCMs) predict changes in both means and variability;\nhowever, GCM output should not be used directly as simulations for impacts\nassessments because GCMs do not fully reproduce present-day temperature\ndistributions. This paper addresses an ensuing need for simulations of future\ntemperatures that combine both the observational record and GCM projections of\nchanges in means and temporal covariances. Our perspective is that such\nsimulations should be based on transforming observations to account for GCM\nprojected changes, in contrast to methods that transform GCM output to account\nfor discrepancies with observations. Our methodology is designed for simulating\ntransient (non-stationary) climates, which are evolving in response to changes\nin CO$_2$ concentrations (as is the Earth at present). This work builds on\npreviously described methods for simulating equilibrium (stationary) climates.\nSince the proposed simulation relies on GCM projected changes in covariance, we\ndescribe a statistical model for the evolution of temporal covariances in a GCM\nunder future forcing scenarios, and apply this model to an ensemble of runs\nfrom one GCM, CCSM3. We find that, at least in CCSM3, changes in the local\ncovariance structure can be explained as a function of the regional mean change\nin temperature and the rate of change of warming. This feature means that the\nstatistical model can be used to emulate the evolving covariance structure of\nGCM temperatures under scenarios for which the GCM has not been run. When\ncombined with an emulator for mean temperature, our methodology can simulate\nevolving temperatures under such scenarios, in a way that accounts for\nprojections of changes while still retaining fidelity with the observational\nrecord.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 18:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 17:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

To deal effectively with this in weigh restrictions (WR) framework, we\nfirst precisely identify the two potential sources of its origin in the\nnon-radial DEA setting. If the firm under evaluation P is WR-efficient, the\nnon-full-dimensionality of its corresponding P-face-a face of minimum dimension\nthat contains P-is the unique source of origin (problem Type I).

We revisit the question of IR excesses around RGs using higher\nspatial resolution IR data, primarily from WISE. Our goal was to elucidate the\nlink between three unusual RG properties: fast rotation, enriched Li, and IR\nexcess. We have 316 targets thought to be K giants, about 40% of which we take\nto be Li-rich. In 24 cases with previous detections of IR excess at low spatial\nresolution, we believe that source confusion is playing a role, in that either\n(a) the source that is bright in the optical is not responsible for the IR\nflux, or (b) there is more than one source responsible for the IR flux as\nmeasured in IRAS. We looked for IR excesses in the remaining sources,\nidentifying 28 that have significant IR excesses by ~20 um (with possible\nexcesses for 2 additional sources). There appears to be an intriguing\ncorrelation in that the largest IR excesses are all in Li-rich K giants, though\nvery few Li-rich K giants have IR excesses (large or small). These largest IR\nexcesses also tend to be found in the fastest rotators. There is no correlation\nof IR excess with the carbon isotopic ratio, 12C/13C. IR excesses by 20 um,\nthough relatively rare, are at least twice as common among our sample of\nLi-rich K giants. If dust shell production is a common by-product of Li\nenrichment mechanisms, these observations suggest that the IR excess stage is\nvery short-lived, which is supported by theoretical calculations. Conversely,\nthe Li-enrichment mechanism may only occasionally produce dust, and an\nadditional parameter (e.g., rotation) may control whether or not a shell is\nejected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 19:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

This paper is a\nproof-of-concept that groups of two or more RR Lyrae stars reveal MW dwarf\ngalaxies at d > 50 kpc in these unmined regions of parameter space, with only\nmodest contamination from interloper groups when large halo structures are\nexcluded. For example, a friends-of-friends (FOF) search with a linking length\nof 500 pc could reveal dwarf galaxies more luminous than M_V = -3.2 mag and\nwith surface brightnesses as faint as 31 mag arcsec^-2 (or even fainter,\ndepending on RR Lyrae specific frequency). Although existing public RR Lyrae\ncatalogs are highly incomplete at d > 50 kpc and/or include <1% of the MW\nhalo's volume, a FOF search reveals two known dwarfs (Bootes I and Sextans) and\ntwo dwarf candidate groups possibly worthy of follow-up. PanSTARRS 1 (PS1) may\ncatalog RR Lyrae to 100 kpc which would include ~15% of predicted MW dwarf\ngalaxies. Groups of PS1 RR Lyrae should therefore reveal very low surface\nbrightness and low Galactic latitude dwarfs within its footprint, if they\nexist. With sensitivity to RR Lyrae to d >600 kpc, LSST is the only planned\nsurvey that will be both wide-field and deep enough to use RR Lyrae to\ndefinitively measure the Milky Way's dwarf galaxy census to extremely low\nsurface brightnesses, and through the Galactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 20:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2015 17:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Hitherto, it has been commonly accepted that, in the absence of\nlong-range particle-cluster interactions, the trajectories of aggregating\nparticles, carrying the entropic information of the growing medium, are the\nmain elements of the aggregation dynamics that determine the fractality and\nmorphology of the aggregates.

In many cases, users are interested in package\nrecommendations as collections of items. For example, a dietitian may wish to\nderive a dietary plan as a collection of recipes that is nutritionally\nbalanced, and a travel agent may want to produce a vacation package as a\ncoordinated collection of travel and hotel reservations. Recent work has\nexplored extending recommendation systems to support packages of items. These\nsystems need to solve complex combinatorial problems, enforcing various\nproperties and constraints defined on sets of items. Introducing constraints on\npackages makes recommendation queries harder to evaluate, but also harder to\nexpress: Queries that are under-specified produce too many answers, whereas\nqueries that are over-specified frequently miss interesting solutions.\n  In this paper, we study query relaxation techniques that target package\nrecommendation systems. Our work offers three key insights: First, even when\nthe original query result is not empty, relaxing constraints can produce\npreferable solutions. Second, a solution due to relaxation can only be\npreferred if it improves some property specified by the query. Third,\nrelaxation should not treat all constraints as equals: some constraints are\nmore important to the users than others. Our contributions are threefold: (a)\nwe define the problem of deriving package recommendations through query\nrelaxation, (b) we design and experimentally evaluate heuristics that relax\nquery constraints to derive interesting packages, and (c) we present a crowd\nstudy that evaluates the sensitivity of real users to different kinds of\nconstraints and demonstrates that query relaxation is a powerful tool in\ndiversifying package recommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 05:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-06"}

Oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet (WO) stars represent a very rare stage in\nthe evolution of massive stars.

The\nproperties of WO stars can be used to provide unique constraints on the\n(post-)helium burning evolution of massive stars, as well as their remaining\nlifetime and the expected properties of their supernovae.

We use the line-blanketed non-local thermal equilibrium\natmosphere code cmfgen to model the X-Shooter spectra of the WO stars and\ndeduce the atmospheric parameters. We calculate dedicated evolutionary models\nto determine the evolutionary state of the stars. Results. The WO stars have\nextremely high temperatures that range from 150 kK to 210 kK, and very low\nsurface helium mass fractions that range from 44% down to 14%.

Methods: The clear\nperiodicity of the system LSI+61303 allowed observations to be scheduled\ncovering the large radio outburst in March-April 2012. We observed LSI+61303 on\n14 consecutive days at 2.6, 4.85, 8.35, 10.45, 14.3, 23, and 32 GHz with a\ncadence of about 12 hours followed by two additional observations several days\nlater.

Results: During onset, the main flare shows an almost\nflat broad-band spectrum, most prominently seen on March 27, 2012, where - for\nthe first time - a flat spectrum (alpha=0.00+/-0.07, S nu^alpha) is observed up\nto 32 GHz (9 mm wavelength).

We investigate how different star formation histories (SFHs) shape the\nfinal mass distribution of star clusters. We assume that every star cluster\npopulation forms during a formation epoch of length dt at a constant\nstar-formation rate (SFR). The mass distribution of such a population is\ndescribed by the embedded cluster mass function (ECMF), which is a pure power\nlaw extending to an upper limit M_max. Since the SFR determines M_max, the ECMF\nimplicitly depends on the SFR. Starting with different SFHs, each SFH is\ndivided into formation epochs of length dt at different SFRs. The requested\nmass function arises from the superposition of the star clusters of all\nformation epochs. An improved optimal sampling technique is introduced that\nallows generating number and mass distributions, both of which accurately agree\nwith the ECMF. Moreover, for each SFH the distribution function of all involved\nSFRs, F(SFR), is computed. For monotonically decreasing SFHs, F(SFR) always\nfollows a power law. With F(SFR), we develope the theory of the integrated\ngalactic embedded cluster mass function (IGECMF). It describes the distribution\nfunction of birth stellar masses of star clusters that accumulated over a\nformation episode much longer than dt. The IGECMF indeed reproduces the mass\ndistribution of star clusters created according to the superposition principle.\nInterestingly, all considered SFHs lead to a turn-down with increasing star\ncluster mass in their respective IGECMFs. In the past, a turn-down at the\nhigh-mass end has been observed for GC systems in different galaxy clusters and\nin the cluster initial mass function. This behavior can be explained naturally\nif the observed star cluster ensembles are superpositions of several individual\nstar cluster populations that formed at different times at different SFRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 09:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

The\nmeasurements, using a variety of SiPMs, show an excess in signal far beyond the\nphysical limit of the number of SiPM microcells without indication of an\nultimate saturation. In this work I propose a solution to this problem.\nDifferent measurements and theoretical models of avalanche propagation indicate\nthat multiple simultaneous primary avalanches produce an ever narrower and\nfaster signal. This is because of a speed-up of effective avalanche propagation\nprocesses. It means that SiPMs, operated at their saturation regime, should\nbecome faster the more light they detect. Therefore, signal extraction methods\nthat use the amplitude of the signal should see an over saturation effect.\nMeasurements with a commercial SiPM illuminated with bright picosecond pulses\nin the saturation regime demonstrate that indeed the rising edge of the SiPM\nsignal gets faster as the light pulses get brighter. A signal extractor based\non the amplitude shows a nonlinear behavior in comparison to an integrating\ncharge extractor. This supports the proposed solution for the over saturation\neffect. Furthermore I show that this effect can already be seen with a\nbandwidth of 300MHz, which means that it should be taken into account for fast\nsampling experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 10:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-06"}

However, the unique identifiers also\nleak information about the computing environment - in particular, they provide\nsome nodes with information related to the size of the network. It was recently\nproved that in the context of local decision, there are some decision problems\nsuch that (1) they cannot be solved without unique identifiers, and (2) unique\nnode identifiers leak a sufficient amount of information such that the problem\nbecomes solvable (PODC 2013).\n  In this work we give study what is the minimal amount of information that we\nneed to leak from the environment to the nodes in order to solve local decision\nproblems. Our key results are related to scalar oracles $f$ that, for any given\n$n$, provide a multiset $f(n)$ of $n$ labels; then the adversary assigns the\nlabels to the $n$ nodes in the network. This is a direct generalisation of the\nusual assumption of unique node identifiers. We give a complete\ncharacterisation of the weakest oracle that leaks at least as much information\nas the unique identifiers.\n  Our main result is the following dichotomy: we classify scalar oracles as\nlarge and small, depending on their asymptotic behaviour, and show that (1) any\nlarge oracle is at least as powerful as the unique identifiers in the context\nof local decision problems, while (2) for any small oracle there are local\ndecision problems that still benefit from unique identifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 13:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-24"}

The first part is an introduction to classical and\nquantum information theory (CIT, QIT): basic definitions and tools of CIT are\nintroduced, such as the information content of a random variable, the typical\nset, and some principles of data compression. Some concepts and results of QIT\nare then introduced, such as the qubit, the pure and mixed states, the Holevo\ntheorem, the no-cloning theorem, and the quantum complementarity. In the second\npart, two applications of QIT to open problems in theoretical physics are\ndiscussed. The black hole (BH) information paradox is related to the phenomenon\nof the Hawking radiation (HR). Consid- ering a BH starting in a pure state,\nafter its complete evaporation only the Hawking radiation will remain, which is\nshown to be in a mixed state. This either describes a non-unitary evolution of\nan isolated system, contradicting the evolution postulate of quantum mechanics\nand violating the no-cloning theorem, or it implies that the initial\ninformation content can escape the BH, therefore contradicting general\nrelativity. The progress toward the solution of the paradox is discussed. The\nrenormalization group (RG) aims at the extraction of the macroscopic\ndescription of a physical system from its microscopic description. This passage\nfrom microscopic to macroscopic can be described in terms of several steps from\none scale to another, and is therefore formalized as the action of a group. The\nc-theorem proves the existence, under certain conditions, of a function which\nis monotonically decreasing along the group transformations. This result\nsuggests an interpretation of this function as entropy, and its use to study\nthe information flow along the RG transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 15:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 20:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

The\nrelevant ranges for the kinetic mixing parameter are obtained taking into\naccount various existing uncertainties in nuclear and particle physics\nquantities as well as characteristic density and velocity distributions of dark\nmatter in different halo models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 14:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 09:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}
