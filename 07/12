In this work, we\nprovide a detailed comparison of self-consistent calculations within the ADA\nwith the exact results of the Kohn-Sham density-functional theory, and the\nelementary Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation. We demonstrate that the ADA for the\n2D kinetic energy functional works very well under a wide variety of\nconfinement potentials, even for relatively small particle numbers. Remarkably,\nthe TF approximation for the kinetic energy functional, {\\em without any\ngradient corrections}, also yields good agreement with the exact kinetic energy\nfor all confining potentials considered, although at the expense of the spatial\nand kinetic energy densities exhibiting poor point-wise agreement, particularly\nnear the TF radius.

[this fact is\nindependent of regression, so a bit disjointed from first sentence.]\nFurthermore, variance is as important of a contributor as bias towards total\nerror in small samples, and must therefore be factored into the methodological\ndecisions. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for quantifying\nthe combined impact of matching and linear regression on bias and variance of\ntreatment effect estimation. The framework includes expressions for bias and\nvariance in a misspecified linear regression, theorems regarding impact of\nmatching on bias and variance, and a constrained bias estimation approach for\nquantifying misspecification bias and combining it with variance to arrive at\ntotal error. Methodological decisions can thus be based on minimization of this\ntotal error, given the practitioner's assumption/belief about an intuitive\nparameter, which we call `omitted R-squared'.

The\nmethod has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks, including\nrecommender systems (rating matrix of users by items) and document clustering\n(weighting matrix of papers by keywords). However, traditional NMF methods\ntypically assume the number of latent factors (i.e., dimensionality of the\nloading matrices) to be fixed.

This helps\nto drastically reduce the $n\\choose r$ possibilities. We therefore, model the\nattachment of a group for different actors outside this group.

Although many approaches for improving\nthe robustness of SVMs have been studied, two major challenges remain in robust\nSVM learning. First, robust learning algorithms are essentially formulated as\nnon-convex optimization problems. It is thus important to develop a non-convex\noptimization method for robust SVM that can find a good local optimal solution.\nThe second practical issue is how one can tune the hyperparameter that controls\nthe balance between robustness and efficiency. Unfortunately, due to the\nnon-convexity, robust SVM solutions with slightly different hyper-parameter\nvalues can be significantly different, which makes model selection highly\nunstable. In this paper, we address these two issues simultaneously by\nintroducing a novel homotopy approach to non-convex robust SVM learning. Our\nbasic idea is to introduce parametrized formulations of robust SVM which bridge\nthe standard SVM and fully robust SVM via the parameter that represents the\ninfluence of outliers. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions\nof the local optimal solutions of robust SVM, and develop an algorithm that can\ntrace a path of local optimal solutions when the influence of outliers is\ngradually decreased. An advantage of our homotopy approach is that it can be\ninterpreted as simulated annealing, a common approach for finding a good local\noptimal solution in non-convex optimization problems. In addition, our homotopy\nmethod allows stable and efficient model selection based on the path of local\noptimal solutions. Empirical performances of the proposed approach are\ndemonstrated through intensive numerical experiments both on robust\nclassification and regression problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 13:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

CICY three-folds\nand four-folds have been studied extensively in the physics literature. Their\nutility stems from the fact that they can be simply described in terms of a\n`configuration matrix', a matrix of integers from which many of the details of\nthe geometries can be easily extracted. The generalization we present is to\nallow negative integers in the configuration matrices which were previously\ntaken to have positive semi-definite entries. This broadening of the complete\nintersection construction leads to a larger class of Calabi-Yau manifolds than\nthat considered in previous work, which nevertheless enjoys much of the same\ndegree of calculational control. These new Calabi-Yau manifolds are complete\nintersections in (not necessarily Fano) ambient spaces with an effective\nanticanonical class. We find examples with topology distinct from any that has\nappeared in the literature to date. The new manifolds thus obtained have many\ninteresting features. For example, they can have smaller Hodge numbers than\nordinary CICYs and lead to many examples with elliptic and K3-fibration\nstructures relevant to F-theory and string dualities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 14:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

These observations have\nled to the suggestion that this sequence of patterns can serve as an early\nindicator of desertification in some ecosystems. Since parameter values can\ntake on a range of plausible values in the vegetation models, it is important\nto investigate whether the pattern sequence prediction is robust to variation.\nFor a particular model, we find that a quantity calculated via\nbifurcation-theoretic analysis appears to serve as a proxy for the pattern\nsequences that occur in numerical simulations across a range of parameter\nvalues. We find in further analysis that the quantity takes on values\nconsistent with the standard sequence in an ecologically relevant limit of the\nmodel parameter values. This suggests that the standard sequence is a robust\nprediction of the model, and we conclude by proposing a methodology for\nassessing the robustness of the standard sequence in other models and\nformulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 15:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 04:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 13:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-31"}
