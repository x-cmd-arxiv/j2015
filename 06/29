The\ncalibration problem is of considerable interest in mathematical finance and\nbeyond. Calibration of L\\'evy processes is particularly challenging as the jump\ndistribution is given by an arbitrary L\\'evy measure, which form a infinite\ndimensional space. In this work, we follow an approach which is related to the\nmaximum likelihood theory of sieves.\n  The sampling of the L\\'evy process is modelled as independent observations of\nthe stochastic process at some terminal time $T$. We use a generic spline\ndiscretization of the L\\'evy jump measure and select an adequate size of the\nspline basis using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\n  The numerical solution of the L\\'evy calibration problem requires efficient\noptimization of the log likelihood functional in high dimensional parameter\nspaces. We provide this by the optimal control of Kolmogorov's forward equation\nfor the probability density function (Fokker-Planck equation). The first order\noptimality conditions are derived based on the Lagrange multiplier technique in\na functional space. The resulting Partial Integral-Differential Equations\n(PIDE) are discretized, numerically solved and controlled using scheme a\ncomposed of Chang-Cooper, BDF2 and direct quadrature methods. For the numerical\nsolver of the Kolmogorov's forward equation we prove conditions for\nnon-negativity and stability in the $L^1$ norm of the discrete solution.

However, lateral splash of the round tubes under impact loadings\nreduces the energy absorption efficiency and may cause secondary damages.\nTherefore, it is necessary to assemble and fasten round tubes together by\nboundary constraints and/or fasteners between tubes, which increases the time\nand labor cost and affects the mechanical performance of round tubes. In an\neffort to break through this limitation, a novel self-locked energy-absorbing\nsystem has been proposed in this paper. The proposed system is made up of\nthin-walled tubes with dumbbell-shaped cross section, which are specially\ndesigned to interlock with each other and thus provide lateral constraint under\nimpact loadings. Both finite element simulations and impact experiment\ndemonstrated that without boundary constraints or fasteners between tubes, the\nproposed self-locked energy-absorbing system can still effectively attenuate\nimpact loads while the round tube systems fail to carry load due to the lateral\nsplashing of tubes. Furthermore, the optimal geometric design for a single\ndumbbell-shaped tube and the optimal stacking arrangement for the system are\ndiscussed, and a general guideline on the structural design of the proposed\nself-locked energy absorbing system is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 04:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In these approaches, multiscale basis functions are constructed\nusing local snapshot spaces, where a snapshot space is a large space that\nrepresents the solution behavior in a coarse block. In a number of applications\n(e.g., those discussed in the paper), one may have a sparsity in the snapshot\nspace for an appropriate choice of a snapshot space. More precisely, the\nsolution may only involve a portion of the snapshot space. In this case, one\ncan use sparsity techniques to identify multiscale basis functions. In this\npaper, we consider two such sparse local multiscale model reduction approaches.\n  In the first approach (which is used for parameter-dependent multiscale\nPDEs), we use local minimization techniques, such as sparse POD, to identify\nmultiscale basis functions, which are sparse in the snapshot space. These\nminimization techniques use $l_1$ minimization to find local multiscale basis\nfunctions, which are further used for finding the solution. In the second\napproach (which is used for the Helmholtz equation), we directly apply $l_1$\nminimization techniques to solve the underlying PDEs. This approach is more\nexpensive as it involves a large snapshot space; however, in this example, we\ncan not identify a local minimization principle, such as local generalized SVD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 04:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 04:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

We propose three approaches.\n  1) The inherent complexity of phenotypes makes high-throughput phenotype\nprofiling a very difficult and laborious process. We propose a method of\nautomated multi-dimensional profiling which uses gene expression similarity.\nLarge-scale analysis show that our method can provide robust profiling that\nreveals different phenotypic aspects of samples. This profiling technique is\nalso capable of interpolation and extrapolation beyond the phenotype\ninformation given in training data. It can be used in many applications,\nincluding facilitating experimental design and detecting confounding factors.\n  2) Phenotype association analysis problems are complicated by small sample\nsize and high dimensionality. Consequently, phenotype-associated gene subsets\nobtained from training data are very sensitive to selection of training\nsamples, and the constructed sample phenotype classifiers tend to have poor\ngeneralization properties. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a novel\napproach that generates sequences of increasingly discriminative gene cluster\ncombinations. Our experiments on both simulated and real datasets show robust\nand accurate classification performance.\n  3) Many complex phenotypes, such as cancer, are the product of not only gene\nexpression, but also gene interaction. We propose an integrative approach to\nfind gene network modules that activate under different phenotype conditions.\nUsing our method, we discovered cancer subtype-specific network modules, as\nwell as the ways in which these modules coordinate. In particular, we detected\na breast-cancer specific tumor suppressor network module with a hub gene,\nPDGFRL, which may play an important role in this module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 05:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

In this paper we propose a symbolic computation\napproach to derive mean-field PDEs from a lattice-based model. We start with\nthe microscopic equations, which state the probability to find a particle at a\ngiven lattice site. Then the PDEs are formally derived by Taylor expansions of\nthe probability densities and by passing to an appropriate limit as the time\nsteps and the distances between lattice sites tend to zero. We present an\nimplementation in a computer algebra system that performs this transition for a\ngeneral class of models. In order to rewrite the mean-field PDEs in a\nconservative formulation, we adapt and implement symbolic integration methods\nthat can handle unspecified functions in several variables. To illustrate our\napproach, we consider an application in crowd motion analysis where the\ndynamics of bidirectional flows are studied. However, the presented approach\ncan be applied to various transportation processes of multiple species with\nvariable size in any dimension, for example, to confirm several proposed\nmean-field models for cell motility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 07:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 17:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 12:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

The activity of CO ice in comparison to H_20 ice is capable to\ndetach aggregates smaller by approximately one order of magnitude from the\nsurface.

Our model can explain the large grains (ranging from 2 cm to 1 m in\nradius) in the inner coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that have been\nobserved by the OSIRIS camera at heliocentric distances between 3.4 AU and 3.7\nAU. Furthermore, the model predicts the release of decimeter-sized aggregates\n(trail particles) close to the heliocentric distance at which the gas-driven\ndust activity vanishes. However, the gas-driven dust activity cannot explain\nthe presence of particles smaller than ~1 mm in the coma because the high\ntensile strength required to detach these particles from the surface cannot be\nprovided by evaporation of volatile ices. These smaller particles can be\nproduced for instance by spin-up and centrifugal mass loss of ejected larger\naggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 08:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

In order to trigger the\nformation of a penumbra, large inclinations at the outskirts of the protospot\nare necessary. The penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral\nareas and granulation. Evidence for a unique stable boundary value for the\nvertical component of the magnetic field strength, $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$,\nwas found along the umbra-penumbra boundary of developed sunspots. We use\nbroadband G-band images and spectropolarimetric GFPI/VTT data to study the\nevolution of and the vertical component of the magnetic field on a forming\numbra-penumbra boundary. For comparison with stable sunspots, we also analyse\nthe two maps observed by Hinode/SP on the same spot after the penumbra formed.\nThe vertical component of the magnetic field, $B_{\\rm ver}$, at the\numbra-penumbra boundary increases during penumbra formation owing to the\nincursion of the penumbra into umbral areas. After 2.5 hours, the penumbra\nreaches a stable state as shown by the GFPI data. At this stable stage, the\nsimultaneous Hinode/SP observations show a $B_{\\rm ver}$ value comparable to\nthat of umbra-penumbra boundaries of fully fledged sunspots. We confirm that\nthe umbra-penumbra boundary, traditionally defined by an intensity threshold,\nis also characterised by a distinct canonical magnetic property, namely by\n$B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$. During the penumbra formation process, the inner\npenumbra extends into regions where the umbra previously prevailed. Hence, in\nareas where $B_{\\rm ver} < B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$, the magneto-convection\nmode operating in the umbra turns into a penumbral mode. Eventually, the inner\npenumbra boundary settles at $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$, which hints toward the\nrole of $B_{\\rm ver}^{\\rm stable}$ as inhibitor of the penumbral mode of\nmagneto-convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 10:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

The DBM is based on the assumption that beyond a\ndistance of about 20 solar radii from the Sun, the dominant force acting on\nCMEs is the \"aerodynamic\" drag force. In the standard form of DBM, the user\nprovisionally chooses values for the model input parameters, by which the\nkinematics of the CME over the entire Sun--\"target\" distance range is defined.\nThe choice of model input parameters is usually based on several previously\nundertaken statistical studies. In other words, the model is used by ad hoc\nimplementation of statistics-based values of the input parameters, which are\nnot necessarily appropriate for the CME under study. Furthermore, such a\nprocedure lacks quantitative information on how well the simulation reproduces\nthe coronagraphically observed kinematics of the CME, and thus does not provide\nan estimate of the reliability of the arrival prediction. In this paper we\nadvance the DBM by adopting it in a form that employs the CME observations over\na given distance range to evaluate the most suitable model input parameters for\na given CME by means of the least-squares fitting. Furthermore, the new version\nof the model automatically responds to any significant change of the conditions\nin the ambient medium (solar wind speed, density, CME--CME interactions, etc.)\nby changing the model input parameters according to changes in the CME\nkinematics. The advanced DBM is shaped in a form that can be readily employed\nin an operational system for real-time space-weather forecasting by promptly\nadjusting to a successively expanding observational dataset, thus providing a\nsuccessively improving prediction of the CME arrival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 11:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Methods: V 0332+53\nwas observed by RXTE and Swift during the decay of the intermediate-luminosity\nX-ray outburst of 2008, as well as with Suzaku before the rising of the third\nnormal outburst of the 2010 series.

This\nproblem arises for instance in the context of spline interpolation or the\ncomputation of empirical probability distribution from empirical data. Often it\nneeds to be solved for a large number of different values $z$ and the same\narray $X$, which makes it worth investing resources upfront in pre-processing\nthe array $X$ with the goal of speeding up subsequent search operations. In\nsome cases the values $z$ to be processed are known simultaneously in blocks of\nsize $M$, which offers the opportunity to solve the problem vectorially,\nexploiting the parallel capabilities of modern CPUs. The common solution is to\nsequentially invoke $M$ times the well known binary search algorithm, which has\ncomplexity $O(log_2 N)$ per individual search and, in its classic formulation,\nis not vectorizable, i.e. is not SIMD friendly. This paper describes technical\nimprovements to the binary search algorithm, which make it faster and\nvectorizable. Next it proposes a new vectorizable algorithm, based on an\nindexing technique, applicable to a wide family of $X$ partitions, which solves\nthe problem with complexity $O(1)$ per individual search at the cost of\nintroducing an initial overhead to compute the index and requiring extra memory\nfor its storage. Test results using streaming SIMD extensions compare the\nperformance of the algorithm versus various benchmarks and demonstrate its\neffectiveness. Depending on the test case, the algorithm can produce a\nthroughput up to two orders of magnitude larger than the classic binary search.\nApplicability limitations and cache-friendliness related aspects are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 13:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 15:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 06:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

Here we predict tunable multiphonon\nblockade in coupled nonlinear NAMRs, where nonlinearity is induced by two-level\nsystems (TLSs) assuming dispersive (far off-resonance) interactions.\nSpecifically, we derive an effective Kerr-type interaction in a hybrid system\nconsisting of two nonlinearly-interacting NAMRs coupled to two TLSs and driven\nby classical fields. The interaction between a given NAMR and a TLS is\ndescribed by a Jaynes-Cummings-like model. We show that by properly tuning the\nfrequency of the driving fields one can induce various types of phonon\nblockade, corresponding to the entangled phonon states of either two qubits,\nqutrit and quartit, or two qudits. Thus, a $k$-phonon Fock state (with\n$k=1,2,3$) can impede the excitation of more phonons in a given NAMR, which we\ninterpret as a $k$-phonon blockade (or, equivalently, phonon tunneling). Our\nresults can be explained in terms of resonant transitions in the Fock space and\nvia phase-space interference using the $s$-parametrized Cahill-Glauber\nquasiprobability distributions including the Wigner function.

Furthermore, the\nimpact of increasing correlation between the slope of the shadowed dominant and\nmultipath components similarly acts to reduce crossings at lower signal levels.\nThe new expressions for the second-order statistics are also compared with\nfield measurements obtained for cellular device-to-device and body centric\ncommunications channels which are known to be susceptible to shadowed fading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 13:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

The preferences and social dynamics\nof a population can have a large impact on the course of an outbreak as well as\nthe effectiveness of interventions intended to influence individual behavior.\nIn addition, individuals may alter their sexual behavior in response to the\npresence of STIs, creating a feedback loop between transmission and behavior.\nWe investigate the consequences of modeling the interaction between STI\ntransmission and prophylactic use with a model that links a\nSusceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) system to evolutionary game dynamics\nthat determine the effective contact rate. The combined model framework allows\nus to address protective behavior by both infected and susceptible individuals.\nFeedback between behavioral adaptation and prevalence creates a wide range of\ndynamic behaviors in the combined model, including damped and sustained\noscillations as well as bistability, depending on the behavioral parameters and\ndisease growth rate. We found that disease extinction is possible for multiple\nregions where R0 > 1, due to behavior adaptation driving the epidemic downward,\nalthough conversely endemic prevalence for arbitrarily low R0 is also possible\nif contact rates are sufficiently high. We also tested how model\nmisspecification might affect disease forecasting and estimation of the model\nparameters and R0. We found that alternative models that neglect the behavioral\nfeedback or only consider behavior adaptation by susceptible individuals can\npotentially yield misleading parameter estimates or omit significant features\nof the disease trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 13:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

To make the problem even more difficult (and interesting), neutrinos\ncan experience collective oscillations through nonlinear refraction in the\ndense neutrino medium in this environment. Significant progress has been made\nin the last decade towards the understanding of collective neutrino\noscillations in various simplified neutrino gas models with imposed symmetries\nand reduced dimensions. However, a series of recent studies seem to have\n\"reset\" this progress by showing that these models may not be compatible with\ncollective neutrino oscillations because the latter can break the symmetries\nspontaneously if they are not imposed. We review some of the key concepts of\ncollective neutrino oscillations by using a few simple toy models.

The\nstrength of these social influences are controlled by two parameters: $F$, the\nnumber of features that characterizes the cultures and $q$, the common number\nof states each feature can assume. Here we assume that the innovation is a new\nstate of a cultural feature of a single individual -- the innovator -- and\nstudy how the innovation spreads through the networks among the individuals.\nFor infinite regular lattices in one (1D) and two dimensions (2D), we find that\ninitially the successful innovation spreads linearly with the time $t$, but in\nthe long-time limit it spreads diffusively ($\\sim t^{1/2}$) in 1D and\nsub-diffusively ($\\sim t/\\ln t$) in 2D. For finite lattices, the growth curves\nfor the number of adopters are typically concave functions of $t$. For random\ngraphs with a finite number of nodes $N$, we argue that the classical S-shaped\ngrowth curves result from a trade-off between the average connectivity $K$ of\nthe graph and the per feature diversity $q$. A large $q$ is needed to reduce\nthe pace of the initial spreading of the innovation and thus delimit the\nearly-adopters stage, whereas a large $K$ is necessary to ensure the onset of\nthe take-off stage at which the number of adopters grows superlinearly with\n$t$. In an infinite random graph we find that the number of adopters of a\nsuccessful innovation scales with $t^\\gamma$ with $\\gamma =1$ for $K> 2$ and\n$1/2 < \\gamma < 1$ for $K=2$.

The Boltzmann equation is solved by means of a\nChapman-Enskog-like expansion around the (local) shear flow distributions\n$f_r^{(0)}$ for each species that retain all the hydrodynamic orders in the\nshear rate. Due to the anisotropy induced by the shear flow, tensorial\nquantities are required to describe the transport processes instead of the\nconventional scalar coefficients. These tensors are given in terms of the\nsolutions of a set of coupled equations, which can be analytically solved as\nfunctions of the shear rate $a$, the coefficients of restitution $\\alpha_{rs}$\nand the parameters of the mixture (masses, diameters and composition). Since\nthe reference distribution functions $f_r^{(0)}$ apply for arbitrary values of\nthe shear rate and are not restricted to weak dissipation, the corresponding\ngeneralized coefficients turn out to be nonlinear functions of both $a$ and\n$\\alpha_{rs}$.

The uncertainty emerges from number\nfluctuations, called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly\nfit individuals of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary\nvanguard also limits the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic\nmodels that ignore these chance effects. Several approaches have been developed\nto analyze the crucial role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation,\nincluding the mean fitness of the entire population, or the fate of newly\narising beneficial deleterious mutations. However, very little is known about\nhow genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level,\nincluding fitness distribution variations and speed variations. Yet, these\nphenomena control the replicability of experimental evolution experiments and\nare key to a truly predictive understanding of evolutionary processes. Here, we\ndevelop an exact approach to these emergent fluctuations by a combination of\ncomputational and analytical methods. We show, analytically, that the infinite\nhierarchy of moment equations can be closed at any arbitrary order by a\nsuitable choice of a dynamical constraint. This constraint regulates (rather\nthan fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations. The\nresulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit\nfluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress\nlong-distance ones. Importantly, by accounting for the dynamics of\nsub-populations, we provide a systematic route to key population genetic\nquantities, such as fixation probabilities and decay rates of the genetic\ndiversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 15:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

We introduce a family of convex\ndomains, characterized by Linear Matrix Inequalities, in the space of voltages\nsuch that there is at most one power flow solution in each of these domains.\nFurther, if a solution exists in one of these domains, it can be found\nefficiently, and if one does not exist, a certificate of non-existence can also\nbe obtained efficiently. The approach is based on the theory of monotone\noperators and related algorithms for solving variational inequalities involving\nmonotone operators. We validate our approach on IEEE test networks and show\nthat practical power flow solutions lie within an appropriately chosen convex\ndomain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 23:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 21:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

FIS refers to the finding\nthat, under certain conditions, an excess of the individuals' vigor in the\nattempt to exit causes a decrease in the flow rate. In general, this effect is\nidentified by the appearance of a minimum when plotting the total evacuation\ntime of a crowd as a function of the pedestrian desired velocity. Here, we\nexperimentally show that the FIS effect indeed occurs in three different\nsystems of discrete particles flowing through a constriction: (a) humans\nevacuating a room, (b) a herd of sheep entering a barn and (c) grains flowing\nout a 2D hopper over a vibrated incline. This finding suggests that FIS is a\nuniversal phenomenon for active matter passing through a narrowing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 13:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}
