The probability\ndistribution functions of these functionals of Voronoi cells in MRJ sphere\npackings are qualitatively similar to those of an equilibrium hard-sphere\nliquid and partly even to the uncorrelated Poisson point process, implying that\nsuch local statistics are relatively structurally insensitive. This is not\nsurprising because the Minkowski functionals of a single Voronoi cell\nincorporate only local information and are insensitive to global structural\ninformation. To improve upon this, we introduce descriptors that incorporate\nnonlocal information via the correlation functions of the Minkowski functionals\nof two cells at a given distance as well as certain cell-cell probability\ndensity functions. We evaluate these higher-order functions for our MRJ\npackings as well as equilibrium hard spheres and the Poisson point process.

In this paper, we propose a motion pattern\napproach to mine frequent behaviors in trajectory data. Motion patterns,\ndefined by a set of highly similar flow vector groups in a spatial locality,\nhave been shown to be very effective in extracting dominant motion behaviors in\nvideo sequences. Inspired by applications and properties of motion patterns, we\nhave designed a framework that successfully solves the general task of\ntrajectory clustering. Our proposed algorithm consists of four phases: flow\nvector computation, motion component extraction, motion component's\nreachability set creation, and motion pattern formation. For the first phase,\nwe break down trajectories into flow vectors that indicate instantaneous\nmovements. In the second phase, via a Kmeans clustering approach, we create\nmotion components by clustering the flow vectors with respect to their location\nand velocity. Next, we create motion components' reachability set in terms of\nspatial proximity and motion similarity. Finally, for the fourth phase, we\ncluster motion components using agglomerative clustering with the weighted\nJaccard distance between the motion components' signatures, a set created using\npath reachability. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method\nin an extensive set of experiments on diverse datasets.

The fact that planets can form in these\ndynamically challenging environments implies that planet formation must be a\nrobust process. The initial protoplanetary disks in these systems from which\nplanets must form should be tidally truncated to radii of a few AU, which\nindicates that the efficiency of planet formation must be high. Here, we\nexamine the truncation of circumstellar protoplanetary disks in close binary\nsystems, studying how the likelihood of planet formation is affected over a\nrange of disk parameters. If the semimajor axis of the binary is too small or\nits eccentricity is too high, the disk will have too little mass for planet\nformation to occur. However, we find that the stars in the binary systems known\nto have planets should have once hosted circumstellar disks that were capable\nof supporting planet formation despite their truncation. We present a way to\ncharacterize the feasibility of planet formation based on binary orbital\nparameters such as stellar mass, companion mass, eccentricity and semi-major\naxis. Using this measure, we can quantify the robustness of planet formation in\nclose binaries and better understand the overall efficiency of planet formation\nin general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 00:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This thick brane scenario satisfies the regularity conditions and it can\nbe regarded as an interior and exterior string-like solution. The source\nundergoes a geometric Ricci flow which is connected to a variation of the bulk\ncosmological constant. The Ricci flow changes the width and amplitude of the\nmassless mode at the brane core and recover the usual thin string-like behavior\nat large distances. By numerical means we obtain the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum\nfor both the thin brane and the string-cigar. It turns out that both models\nexhibit a mass gap between the massless and the massive modes and between the\nhigh and the low mass regimes. The KK modes are smooth near the brane and their\namplitude are enhanced by the string-cigar core. The analogue Schr\\\"odinger\npotential is also tuned by the geometric flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 05:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 16:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial)\nsolution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an\noptimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure\nquantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel\nas a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent\nstates, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the\nconcave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output\nstates corresponding to the Gaussian input are \"the least chaotic\", majorizing\nall the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the\ngauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special\nrole. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was\nsolved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the\nadditivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of\ninformation quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel,\nsuch as $(1\\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or R\\'enyi output\nentropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum\nGaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not\nvalid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the\ngauge-covariant Gaussian channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 08:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 09:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 12:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

In this work, using a Tree-SPH\nsimulation of an Sb-type disc galaxy, we quantify the effects of blurring\n(epicyclic excursions) and churning (change of guiding radius). We quantify\nmigration (either blurring or churning) both in terms of flux (the number of\nmigrators passing at a given radius), and by estimating the population of\nmigrators at a given radius at the end of the simulation compared to\nnon-migrators, but also by giving the distance over which the migration is\neffective at all radii. We confirm that the corotation of the bar is the main\nsource of migrators by churning in a bar-dominated galaxy, its intensity being\ndirectly linked to the episode of a strong bar, in the first 1-3 Gyr of the\nsimulation. We show that within the outer Lindblad resonance (OLR), migration\nis strongly dominated by churning, while blurring gains progressively more\nimportance towards the outer disc and at later times. Most importantly, we show\nthat the OLR limits the exchange of angular momentum, separating the disc in\ntwo distinct parts with minimal or null exchange, except in the transition\nzone, which is delimited by the position of the OLR at the epoch of the\nformation of the bar, and at the final epoch.

We present a compact design\nsolution for this problem that allows in-situ control of the orientation of the\nresonator at cryogenic temperatures. Tests of the apparatus show that when\nproper alignment is achieved, there is almost no hysteresis in the field\ndependence of the resonant frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jan 2015 17:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 19:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-19"}

Within the modern standard\ncosmological model there are both observational and conceptual cosmological\nparadoxes which stimulate to search their solution. Confrontation of\ntheoretical predictions of the standard cosmological model with the latest\nastrophysical observational data is considered. A review of conceptual problems\nof the Friedmann space expending models, which are in the bases of modern\ncosmological model, is discussed. The main paradoxes, which are discussed in\nmodern literature, are the Newtonian character of the exact Friedmann equation,\nthe violation of the energy conservation within any comoving local volume,\nviolation of the limiting recession velocity of galaxies for the observed high\nredshift objects. Possible observational tests of the nature of the\ncosmological redshift are discussed\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 14:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-09"}
