We complement our analysis with synthetic spectra\nobtained from extensive cosmological simulations that are part of the OWLS\nproject (Schaye et al. 2010).\n  Our main conclusions are:\n  1) Both the observations and simulations imply that \\Ovi absorbers at high\nredshift arise in structures spanning a broad range of scales and different\nphysical conditions. When the \\Ovi components are characterized by small\nDoppler parameters, the ionizing mechanism is most likely photoionization;\notherwise, collisional ionization is the dominant mechanism.\n  2) The baryon- and metal-content of the \\Ovi absorbers at $z\\approx2$ is less\nthan one per cent of the total mass-density of baryons and metals at that\nredshift. Therefore, \\Ovi absorbers do not trace the bulk of baryons and metals\nat that epoch.\n  3) The \\Ovi gas density, metallicity and non-thermal broadening mechanisms\nare significantly different at high redshift with respect to low redshift. In\nparticular, non-thermal broadening mechanisms appear less important at high\nredshift as compared to low redshift, where the turbulence in the absorption\ngas might be significant. This, together with the result that \\Ovi arises in\ndifferent environments, embedded in small- and large-scale structures,\nindicates that \\Ovi does not trace characteristic regions in the circumgalactic\nand intergalactic medium, but rather traces a gas phase with a characteristic\ntransition temperature ($T\\sim10^{5}$K).\n  4) The \\Ovi absorbers at high redshift arise in gas with metallicities\nsignificantly higher than the surrounding environment, which suggests an\ninhomogeneous metal enrichment of the IGM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 19:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

For our IDL software package tellrem we used a recent\napproach to model telluric absorption features with the line-by-line radiative\ntransfer model (LBLRTM). The broad wavelength coverage of the X-Shooter at VLT\nallows us to expand their technique by determining the abundances of the most\nimportant telluric molecules H2O, O2, CO2, and CH4 from sufficiently isolated\nline groups.

Measurements of large-scale B-modes of\nthe CMB are considered to be the best method for probing gravitational waves\nfrom the cosmic inflation. Future CMB experiments will, however, suffer from\ncontamination by non-primordial B-modes, one source of which is the lensing\nB-modes. Delensing, therefore, will be required for further improvement of the\ndetection sensitivity for gravitational waves. Analyzing the use of the\ntwo-dimensional map of galaxy distribution provided by the SKA RC survey as a\nlensing mass tracer, we find that joint delensing using near future CMB\nexperiments and the SKA phase 1 will improve the constraints on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio by more than a factor of $\\sim 2$ compared to those\nwithout the delensing analysis. Compared to the use of CMB data alone, the\ninclusion of the SKA phase 1 data will increase the significance of the\nconstraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by a factor $1.2$-$1.6$. For LiteBIRD\ncombined with a ground-based experiment such as Simons Array and Advanced ACT,\nthe constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio when adding SKA phase 2 data is\nimproved by a factor of $2.3$-$2.7$, whereas delensing with CMB data alone\nimproves the constraints by only a factor $1.3$-$1.7$. We conclude that the use\nof SKA data is a promising method for delensing upcoming CMB experiments such\nas LiteBIRD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 03:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 23:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

The optical trapping mechanism is based on the\ninteraction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In\natom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed\noptical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic\nparticles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two\ndifferent regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any\ndirect link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one\nbeing the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other\none being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum\noptics. Here we show that for nanoscale diamond crystals containing artificial\natoms, so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers, both regimes of optical\ntrapping can be observed at the same time even in a noisy liquid environment.\nFor wavelengths in the vicinity of the zero-phonon line transition of the color\ncenters, we observe a significant modification ($10\\%$) of the overall trapping\nstrength.

The M8.5 dwarf 2MASSI J1835379+325954\nwhose T_eff is 2275K is analyzed by the dusty model, in which the surface\ntemperature is higher by about 600K due to the blanketing effect of the dust,\nand C and O abundances are higher by 0.25 and 0.15dex, respectively, compared\nto the analysis by the dust-free model. Once dust forms in the photosphere, the\ndust works as a kind of thermostat and temperatures of the surface layers\nremain nearly the same as the condensation temperatures of the dust grains. For\nthis reason, the temperatures of the surface layers of the dusty dwarfs are not\nsensitive to the fundamental parameters including T_eff. Also, 2MASS J1835379\n+325954 is a rapid rotator, for which its EWs are thought to remain unchanged\nby the rotational broadening. This is, however, true only when the true\ncontinuum is well defined. Otherwise, the pseudo-continuum level depends on the\nrotational velocity and hence the EWs as well. For this reason, the derived\nabundances depend on the rotational velocity assumed: For the values of\nV_rot*sin(i)=37.6 and 44.0km/s available in the literature, the derived C and O\nabundances differ by 0.23 and 0.14dex, respectively, and we find that the\nhigher value provides a better account of the observed spectrum.

An iterative-based algorithm, namely maximum distortion\ndescend (MDD), is developed to reduce quality fluctuation among MBs within a\nframe, where the Structure SIMilarity (SSIM) index is used to measure the\nperceptual distortion of MBs.

Instead of maximizing the likelihood of\ntarget labels for individual samples, we propose an objective function that\npushes the network to produce feature distributions which: (a) have low\nvariance within the same class and (b) high variance between different classes.\nOur objective is derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem and still\nallows to train with stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation. For\nevaluation we test our approach on three different benchmark datasets (MNIST,\nCIFAR-10 and STL-10). DeepLDA produces competitive results on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 and outperforms a network trained with categorical cross entropy (same\narchitecture) on a supervised setting of STL-10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 14:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 08:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 17:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 09:52:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 08:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

It is, therefore, of paramount\nimportance in several branches of engineering -- ranging from aerospace\nengineering, civil engineering to biomedical engineering -- to have a\nfundamental understanding of degradation of materials, as the materials in\nthese applications are often subjected to adverse environments. As a result of\nrecent advancements in material science, new materials like fiber-reinforced\npolymers and multi-functional materials that exhibit high ductility have been\ndeveloped and widely used; for example, as infrastructural materials or in\nmedical devices (e.g., stents). The traditional small-strain approaches of\nmodeling these materials will not be adequate. In this paper, we study\ndegradation of materials due to an exposure to chemical species and temperature\nunder large-strain and large-deformations. In the first part of our research\nwork, we present a consistent mathematical model with firm thermodynamic\nunderpinning. We then obtain semi-analytical solutions of several canonical\nproblems to illustrate the nature of the quasi-static and unsteady behaviors of\ndegrading hyperelastic solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 22:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 22:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}
