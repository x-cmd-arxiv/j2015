These methods share the common idea that the interference can be\ncancelled when the content of it is known. Existing work on KIC mainly focuses\non single-hop or two-hop networks, with physical-layer network coding (PNC) and\nfull-duplex (FD) communications as typical examples. This paper extends the\nidea of KIC to general multi-hop networks, and proposes an end-to-end KIC\n(E2E-KIC) transmission method together with its MAC design. With E2E-KIC,\nmultiple nodes in a flow passing through a few nodes in an arbitrary topology\ncan simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel. We first present a\ntheoretical analysis on the effectiveness of E2E-KIC in an idealized case.\nThen, to support E2E-KIC in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology, we\npropose an E2E-KIC-supported MAC protocol (E2E-KIC MAC), which is based on an\nextension of the Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism in the IEEE\n802.11 MAC. We also analytically analyze the performance of the proposed\nE2E-KIC MAC in the presence of hidden terminals. Simulation results illustrate\nthat the proposed E2E-KIC MAC protocol can improve the network throughput and\nreduce the end-to-end delay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 16:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

A universal behavior is observed in atomistic strain simulations\n(in terms of both strain magnitude and profile) of QDs with different shapes\nand materials. In this paper, this universal behavior is investigated by\natomistic as well as analytic continuum models. Atomistic strain simulations\nare very accurate but computationally expensive. On the other hand, analytic\ncontinuum solutions are based on assumptions that significantly reduce the\naccuracy of the strain calculations, but are very fast. Both techniques\nindicate that the strain depends on the aspect ratio (AR) of the QDs, and not\non the individual dimensions. Thus simple closed form equations are introduced\nwhich directly provide the atomistic strain values inside the QD as a function\nof the AR and the material parameters. Moreover, the conduction and valence\nband edges $E_{C/V}$ and their effective masses $m^*_{C/V}$ of the QDs are\ndictated by the strain and AR consequently. The universal dependence of\natomistic strain on the AR is useful in many ways; Not only does it reduce the\ncomputational cost of atomistic simulations significantly, but it also provides\ninformation about the optical transitions of QDs given the knowledge of\n$E_{C/V}$ and $m^*_{C/V}$ from AR. Finally, these expressions are used to\ncalculate optical transition wavelengths in InAs/GaAs QDs and the results agree\nwell with experimental measurements and atomistic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 16:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The technique allows the SU to perform\nselective retransmissions of SU data packets that have not been successfully\ndecoded in the previous attempts. The temporal redundancy introduced by the PU\nARQ protocol and by the selective retransmission process of the SU can be\nexploited by the SU receiver to perform interference cancellation (IC) over\nmultiple transmission slots, thus creating a \"clean\" channel for the decoding\nof the concurrent SU or PU packets. The chain decoding technique is initiated\nby a successful decoding operation of a SU or PU packet and proceeds by an\niterative application of IC in order to decode the buffered signals that\nrepresent packets that could not be decoded before. Based on this scheme, an\noptimal policy is designed that maximizes the SU throughput under a constraint\non the average long-term PU performance. The optimality of the chain decoding\nprotocol is proved, which determines which packet the SU should send at a given\ntime. Moreover, a decoupling principle is proved, which establishes the\noptimality of decoupling the secondary access strategy from the chain decoding\nprotocol. Specifically, first, the SU access policy, optimized via dynamic\nprogramming, specifies whether the SU should access the channel or not, based\non a compact state representation of the protocol; and second, the chain\ndecoding protocol embeds four basic rules that are used to determine which\npacket should be transmitted by the SU. Chain decoding provably yields the\nmaximum improvement that can be achieved by any scheme under our assumptions,\nand thus it is the ultimate scheme, which completely closes the gap between\nprevious schemes and optimality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 18:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

Based on pixel-wise modification of light transport, previous\ntechniques have successfully modified static surface properties such as surface\ncolor, dynamic range, gloss and shading. Here, we propose an alternative light\nprojection technique that adds a variety of illusory, yet realistic distortions\nto a wide range of static 2D and 3D projection targets. The key idea of our\ntechnique, named Deformation Lamps, is to project only dynamic luminance\ninformation, which effectively activates the motion (and shape) processing in\nthe visual system, while preserving the color and texture of the original\nobject. Although the projected dynamic luminance information is spatially\ninconsistent with the color and texture of the target object, the observer's\nbrain automatically com- bines these sensory signals in such a way as to\ncorrect the inconsistency across visual attributes. We conducted a\npsychophysical experiment to investigate the characteristics of the\ninconsistency correction, and found that the correction was dependent\ncritically on the retinal magnitude of inconsistency. Another experiment showed\nthat perceived magnitude of image deformation by our techniques was\nunderestimated. The results ruled out the possibility that the effect by our\ntechnique stemmed simply from the physical change of object appearance by light\nprojection. Finally, we discuss how our techniques can make the observers\nperceive a vivid and natural movement, deformation, or oscillation of a variety\nof static objects, including drawn pictures, printed photographs, sculptures\nwith 3D shading, objects with natural textures including human bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2015 00:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

The recent great\nimprovements on benchmark data sets achieved by increasingly complex\nunsupervised learning methods and deep learning models with lots of parameters\nusually requires many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However,\nfilters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard\nhand-crafted features visually. In this paper, unsupervised learning methods,\nsuch as PCA or auto-encoder, are employed as the building block to learn filter\nbanks at each layer. The lower layer responses are transferred to the last\nlayer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation retaining more\ninformation. In addition, some beneficial methods such as local contrast\nnormalization and whitening are added to the proposed deep trans-layer networks\nto further boost performance. The trans-layer representations are followed by\nblock histograms with binary encoder schema to learn translation and rotation\ninvariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as\nrecognition and classification. Compared to traditional deep learning methods,\nthe implemented feature learning method has much less parameters and is\nvalidated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST\nand MNIST variations, object recognition on Caltech 101 dataset and face\nverification on LFW dataset. The deep trans-layer unsupervised learning\nachieves 99.45% accuracy on MNIST dataset, 67.11% accuracy on 15 samples per\nclass and 75.98% accuracy on 30 samples per class on Caltech 101 dataset,\n87.10% on LFW dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2015 00:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

We\naim to investigate the environmental and mass dependence of the formation of\n'quiescent' LRGs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Date Release 8 and\nto pave the way for using LRGs as cosmic chronometers. Using the population\nsynthesis software STARLIGHT, we derive the stellar populations in each LRG\nthrough the full spectrum fitting and obtain the mean age distribution and the\nmean star formation history (SFH) of those LRGs. We find that there is no\napparent dependence of the mean age and the SFH of quiescent LRGs on their\nenvironment, while the ages of those quiescent LRGs depend weakly on their\nmass. We compare the SFHs of the SDSS LRGs with those obtained from a\nsemi-analytical galaxy formation model, and find that they are roughly\nconsistent with each other if we consider the errors in the STARLIGHT-derived\nages. We find that a small fraction of later star formation in LRGs leads to a\nsystematical overestimation (~28 %) of the Hubble constant by the differential\nage method, and the systematical errors in the STARLIGHT-derived ages may lead\nto an underestimation (~ 16 %) of the Hubble constant. However, these errors\ncan be corrected by a detailed study of the mean SFH of those LRGs and by\ncalibrating the STARLIGHT-derived ages to those obtained independently by other\nmethods.

Compilation of large\nbase code is a time consuming process. Parallel compilation of code will help\nin reducing the time complexity.

Current\nLR(k) parallel parsing techniques either face difficulty in creating Abstract\nSyntax Tree or requires modification in the grammar or are specific to less\nexpressive grammars. Most of the programming languages like C, ALGOL are\nblock-structured, and in most languages grammars the grammar of different\nblocks is independent, allowing different blocks to be parsed in parallel. We\nare proposing a block level parallel parser derived from Incremental Jump Shift\nReduce Parser by [13]. Block Parallelized Parser (BPP) can even work as a block\nparallel incremental parser. We define a set of Incremental Categories and\ncreate the partitions of a grammar based on a rule. When parser reaches the\nstart of the block symbol it will check whether the current block is related to\nany incremental category. If block parallel parser find the incremental\ncategory for it, parser will parse the block in parallel. Block parallel parser\nis developed for LR(1) grammar. Without making major changes in Shift Reduce\n(SR) LR(1) parsing algorithm, block parallel parser can create an Abstract\nSyntax tree easily.

In order to complement our\nasymptotical predictions derived analytically, we also perform a full numerical\nanalysis of a temporally-weighted observation of the day-night effect,\nincluding the energy spectrum of the day-night asymmetry and an estimation of\nthe recoil energy distributions for the elastic-scattering detection channel.\nAccording to both analytical and numerical results, it turns out that a\nweighted observation is able to magnify the amplitude of the peculiar\ncontribution to the day-night asymmetry even to as much as several times the\ncumulative term, and it looks feasible and appealing to perform such a\nweighting procedure at next-generation detectors to revive otherwise hidden\nsignatures of the neutrino regeneration effect in the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2015 09:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

However,\na drawback of ABC is that it is an approximate method that induces a systematic\nerror because it is necessary to set a tolerance level to make the computation\ntractable. The issue of how to optimally set this tolerance level has been the\nsubject of extensive research. This paper proposes an ABC algorithm based on\nimportance sampling that estimates expectations with respect to the \"exact\"\nposterior distribution given the observed summary statistics. This overcomes\nthe need to select the tolerance level. By \"exact\" we mean that there is no\nsystematic error and the Monte Carlo error can be made arbitrarily small by\nincreasing the number of importance samples. We provide a formal justification\nfor the method and study its convergence properties. The method is illustrated\nin two applications and the empirical results suggest that the proposed ABC\nbased estimators consistently converge to the true values as the number of\nimportance samples increases.

One of the leading modified gravity\ntheories is Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND).
