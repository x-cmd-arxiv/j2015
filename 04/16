Under this architecture, not all the pico BSs are\nconnected to the backhaul, resulting in a significant reduction in the\ninfrastructure costs. In this regard, pico BSs without backhaul connectivity\nneed to communicate with their nearby BSs in order to have indirect\naccessibility to the backhaul. This makes the radio resource management (RRM)\nin such networks more complex and challenging. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of cross-layer RRM in HetNets with flexible backhaul. We formulate this\nproblem as a two-timescale non-convex stochastic optimization which jointly\noptimizes flow control, routing, interference mitigation and link scheduling in\norder to maximize a generic network utility. By exploiting a hidden convexity\nof this non-convex problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which converges\nto the global optimal solution. The proposed algorithm benefits from low\ncomplexity and low signalling, which makes it scalable.

The high anatomical variability of organs in\nthe abdomen, such as the pancreas, prevents many segmentation methods from\nachieving high accuracies when compared to other segmentation of organs like\nthe liver, heart or kidneys. Recently, the availability of large annotated\ntraining sets and the accessibility of affordable parallel computing resources\nvia GPUs have made it feasible for \"deep learning\" methods such as\nconvolutional networks (ConvNets) to succeed in image classification tasks.\nThese methods have the advantage that used classification features are trained\ndirectly from the imaging data. We present a fully-automated bottom-up method\nfor pancreas segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images of the abdomen.\nThe method is based on hierarchical coarse-to-fine classification of local\nimage regions (superpixels). Superpixels are extracted from the abdominal\nregion using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). An initial probability\nresponse map is generated, using patch-level confidences and a two-level\ncascade of random forest classifiers, from which superpixel regions with\nprobabilities larger 0.5 are retained. These retained superpixels serve as a\nhighly sensitive initial input of the pancreas and its surroundings to a\nConvNet that samples a bounding box around each superpixel at different scales\n(and random non-rigid deformations at training time) in order to assign a more\ndistinct probability of each superpixel region being pancreas or not. We\nevaluate our method on CT images of 82 patients (60 for training, 2 for\nvalidation, and 20 for testing). Using ConvNets we achieve average Dice scores\nof 68%+-10% (range, 43-80%) in testing. This shows promise for accurate\npancreas segmentation, using a deep learning approach and compares favorably to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 16:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

While most of the existing literature on IDNC\ndoes not consider any physical layer complications and abstract the model as\nequally slotted time for all users, this paper proposes a cross-layer scheme\nthat incorporates the different channel rates of the various users in the\ndecision process of both the transmitted message combinations and the rates\nwith which they are transmitted. The consideration of asymmetric rates for\nreceivers reflects more practical application scenarios and introduces a new\ntrade-off between the choice of coding combinations for various receivers and\nthe broadcasting rate for achieving shorter completion time. The completion\ntime minimization problem in such scenario is first shown to be intractable.\nThe problem is, thus, approximated by reducing, at each transmission, the\nincrease of an anticipated version of the completion time. The paper solves the\nproblem by formulating it as a maximum weight clique problem over a newly\ndesigned rate aware IDNC (RA-IDNC) graph. The highest weight clique in the\ncreated graph being potentially not unique, the paper further suggests a\nmulti-layer version of the proposed solution to improve the obtained results\nfrom the employed completion time approximation.

To predict this\nevolution in state, both the energy and particle number eigenvalue problems for\na dilute gas are set up and solved analytically. Wall and non-ideal-gas\nbehavior effects are neglected, although the extension to dense gases is\nstraightforward but left for a future paper. The system-level energy and\nparticle number eigenvalues and eigenstates found are used in the nonlinear\nequation of motion of SEAQT to determine the time evolution of the\nthermodynamic state of the system, thus, effectively describing the reaction\nkinetics of the reaction and the system's relaxation to stable equilibrium. The\npredicted time evolution is then compared to the results of a standard detailed\nkinetic model used, in the near-equilibrium limit, to extract the single time\nconstant needed by the SEAQT equation of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 19:30:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2016 19:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

In this paper, we generalize the study on the exponential\nnonlinear electrodynamics by adding a scalar dilaton field to the action. By\nsuitably choosing the coupling of the matter field to the dilaton field, we\nvary the action and obtain the corresponding field equations. Then, by making a\nproper ansatz, we construct a new class of charged dilaton black hole solutions\ncoupled to the exponential nonlinear electrodynamics field in the presence of\ntwo Liouville-type potentials for the dilaton field. Due to the presence of the\ndilaton field, the asymptotic behavior of these solutions are neither flat nor\n(A)dS.

Here we apply this approach to the\n$Kepler$ KOIs, identifying nine systems where the photometric spot modulation\nis large enough and the transit timing accurate enough to allow detection of a\nTTV-brightness-derivatives correlation. Of those systems five show highly\nsignificant prograde motion (Kepler-17b, Kepler-71b, KOI-883.01, KOI-895.01,\nand KOI-1074.01), while no system displays retrograde motion, consistent with\nthe suggestion that planets orbiting cool stars have prograde motion. All five\nsystems have impact parameter $0.2\\lesssim b\\lesssim0.5$, and all systems\nwithin that impact parameter range show significant correlation, except\nHAT-P-11b where the lack of a correlation follows its large stellar obliquity.\nOur search suffers from an observational bias against detection of high impact\nparameter cases, and the detected sample is extremely small. Nevertheless, our\nfindings may suggest that stellar spots, or at least the larger ones, tend to\nbe located at a low stellar latitude, but not along the stellar equator,\nsimilar to the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 20:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 05:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Of the 1000 simulated\nlight curves, 770 were injected into actual quiescent Kepler light curves to\nsimulate Kepler noise.

The results show that the `overall' period is well\nrecovered for stars exhibiting low and moderate activity levels. Most teams\nreported values within 10% of the true value in 70% of the cases. There was,\nhowever, little correlation between the reported and simulated values of the\ndifferential rotation shear, suggesting that differential rotation studies\nbased on full-disk light curves alone need to be treated with caution, at least\nfor solar-type stars.\n  The simulated light curves and associated parameters are available online for\nthe community to test their own methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 20:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Our results imply a\nhost of known and a few new results in graphical model inference, matrix\noperations, relational joins, and logic.\n  We also briefly explain how recent algorithms on beyond worst-case analysis\nfor joins and those for solving SAT and #SAT can be viewed as variable\nelimination to solve FAQ over compactly represented input functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 20:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 23:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 17:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2015 04:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 09:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 01:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

By adopting a two-layer\nencoding scheme, a rate-adaptive channel code is applied in each fading block\nto enable successful decoding by a chosen subset of users (which varies over\ndifferent blocks) and an application layer erasure code is employed across\nmultiple blocks to ensure that every user is able to recover the message after\ndecoding successfully in a sufficient number of blocks. The transmit signal and\ncode-rate in each block determine opportunistically the subset of users that\nare able to successfully decode and can be chosen to maximize the long-term\nmulticast efficiency. The employment of OUS not only helps avoid\nrate-limitations caused by the user with the worst channel, but also helps\ncoordinate interference among different cells and multicast groups. In this\nwork, efficient algorithms are proposed for the design of the transmit\ncovariance matrices, the physical layer code-rates, and the target user subsets\nin each block. In the single group scenario, the system parameters are\ndetermined by maximizing the group-rate, defined as the physical layer\ncode-rate times the fraction of users that can successfully decode in each\nblock. In the multi-group scenario, the system parameters are determined by\nconsidering a group-rate balancing optimization problem, which is solved by a\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) approach. To further reduce the feedback\noverhead, we also consider the case where only part of the users feed back\ntheir channel vectors in each block and propose a design based on the balancing\nof the expected group-rates. In addition to SCA, a sample average approximation\ntechnique is also introduced to handle the probabilistic terms arising in this\nproblem. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is demonstrated by computer\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 01:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

A novel\ntechnique, based on interactive profile fitting, was used to separate the main\ndisk gas from the anomalous (halo) gas. The rotation curve (RC) derived for the\nHI disk confirms that it is declining in the outer parts, as seen in previous\noptical Fabry-Perot measurements. As for the anomalous component, its RC has a\nvery shallow gradient in the inner parts and turns over at the same radius as\nthe disk, kinematically lagging by ~100 km/sec. The kinematics of the observed\nextra planar gas is compatible with an outflow due to the central starburst and\ngalactic fountains in the outer parts. However, the gas kinematics shows no\nevidence for inflow. Analysis of the near-IR WISE data, shows clearly that the\nstar formation rate (SFR) is compatible with the starburst nature of NGC 253.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 02:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

We use a million spectra targeting\nLuminous Red Galaxies at z<0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxy\nspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift Lya surface\nbrightness. The quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shape\nconsistent with a LambdaCDM model with Omega_M =0.30^+0.10-0.07. The predicted\namplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the mean\nLya surface brightness, <mu_alpha>, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and the\nquasar and Lya emission bias factors. Using known values, we infer\n<mu_alpha>(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 A^-1 arcsec^-2,\nwhere b_alpha is the Lya emission bias factor.

Finally, having in mind the space-time\nformulation of electromagnetism and the Maurer-Cartan equations for Lie groups,\ngauge theory has been created by C.N. Yang and R.L. Mills in 1954 as a way to\nintroduce in physics the differential geometric methods available at that time,\nindependently of any group action, contrary to all the previous approaches. The\nmain purpose of this paper is to revisit the mathematical foundations of\nthermodynamics and gauge theory by using new differential geometric methods\ncoming from the formal theory of systems of partial differential equations and\nLie pseudogroups, mostly developped by D.C Spencer and coworkers around 1970.\nIn particular, we justify and extend the virial theorem, showing that the\nClausius/Cosserat/Maxwell/Weyl equations are nothing else but the formal\nadjoint of the Spencer operator appearing in the canonical Spencer sequence for\nthe conformal group of space-time and are thus totally dependent on the group\naction. The duality principle also appeals to the formal adjoint of a linear\ndifferential operator used in differential geometry and to the extension\nmodules used in homological algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 07:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

We find tentative evidence for a correlation between\nthe half-light radii and the [Fe/H], with metal-poor GCs being larger than\nmetal-rich GCs.

The\nquasar S4 0917+624 exhibits only very weak or no IDV during our 4.5 year\nobserving interval. Prior to the year 2000, the source S4 0917+624 was one of\nthe most prominent IDV sources. Our new data indicate that the previous strong\nIDV has ceased. We analyzed the long-term VLBI structural variability using\nGaussian model-fitting. From this we obtained the flux densities and the\ndeconvolved sizes of core and inner-jet components of the source. We studied\nthe properties such as core fraction, angular size, spectral index, and\nbrightness temperature of VLBI core for S4 0917+624, as well as the time delay\nbetween 5 and 15 GHz variations, and compared them with the IDV properties of\nS4 0917+624. The source shows ejection of several jet components that are\nsuspected to have partially reduced the IDV amplitude of S4 0917+624. However,\nduring 2005-2006, the VLBI core size was comparable to the size before the year\n2000, but no strong IDV was detected in the period, suggesting that the\nquenching effect due to source size changes may not be responsible for the lack\nof strong IDV after the year 2000. The refractive scattering properties for the\nstrong IDV phase of S4 0917+624 before the year 2000 are discussed. The\ndisappearance of strong IDV in S4 0917+624 after the year 2000 is a mystery and\ncannot be explained via the quenching effect by changes in the observable VLBI\nstructure. However, it may be caused by changes in the interstellar medium,\ni.e. by interstellar weather, which induces changes in the scintillation\npattern on timescales of several years. Further coordinated multi-frequency\nobservations will be required to distinguish between the effect of\nsource-intrinsic variability and changing properties of the interstellar\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 08:54:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 10:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this\nArticle we use a combination of numerical and analytic techniques to explore\nthe nature of proton correlations in both classical and quantum models of ice\nIh. In the case of classical ice Ih, we find that the ice rules have two,\ndistinct, consequences for scattering experiments - singular \"pinch points\",\nreflecting a zero-divergence condition on the uniform polarization of the\ncrystal, and broad, asymmetric features, coming from its staggered\npolarisation. In the case of the quantum model, we find that the collective\nquantum tunnelling of groups of protons can convert states obeying the ice\nrules into a quantum liquid, whose excitations are birefringent, emergent\nphotons. We make explicit predictions for scattering experiments on both\nclassical and quantum ice Ih, and show how the quantum theory can explain the\n\"wings\" of incoherent inelastic scattering observed in recent neutron\nscattering experiments [Bove et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 165901 (2009)].\nThese results raise the intriguing possibility that the protons in ice Ih could\nform a quantum liquid at low temperatures, in which protons are not merely\ndisordered, but continually fluctuate between different configurations obeying\nthe ice rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 09:31:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 00:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 02:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV. Several array geometries, the shape of the energy\nerror distributions and the uncertainties due to the unknown composition of the\nprimary flux have been analyzed as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 09:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

Such computational implementations occur,\nfor example, if we apply the fully implicit two-level scheme (the backward\nEuler scheme). A three-level modification of the SM-stable scheme is proposed.\nIts unconditional stability is established in the corresponding norms. The\nemphasis is on the scheme, where the numerical algorithm involves two stages,\nnamely, the backward Euler scheme of first order at the first (prediction)\nstage and the following correction of the approximate solution using a\nfactorized operator. The SM-stability is established for the proposed scheme.\nTo illustrate the theoretical results of the work, a model problem is solved\nnumerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 10:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

We discuss how the semidefinite programming formulations of\ncheating strategies can be reduced to optimizing a linear combination of\nfidelity functions over a polytope. These turn out to be much simpler\nsemidefinite programs which can be modelled using second-order cone programming\nproblems. We then use these simplifications to construct their point games as\ndeveloped by Kitaev. We also study the classical version of these protocols and\nuse linear optimization to formulate optimal cheating strategies. We then\nconstruct the point games for the classical protocols as well using the\nanalysis for the quantum case.\n  We discuss the philosophical connections between the classical and quantum\nprotocols and their point games as viewed from optimization theory. In\nparticular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from\nclassical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from\nlinear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone\nprogramming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear\nprogramming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is\ncorrelated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming\nmodels on the optimization side.\n  Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that\nevery classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to\nentirely determine the coin-flip. Using the relationships between the quantum\nand classical protocols, we show that only \"classical\" protocols can saturate\nKitaev's lower bound for strong coin-flipping. Moreover, if the product of\nAlice and Bob's optimal cheating probabilities is 1/2, then one party can cheat\nwith probability 1. This rules out quantum protocols of this type from\nattaining the optimal level of security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 13:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

This comparison is important because LMTs are a novel\ntype of inexpensive telescope that are very useful for astronomical surveys,\nparticularly surveys in the time domain, and a validation of data taken with an\nLMT, by comparison with data from a classical telescope, will validate their\nreliability.

The proposed scenario is composed by sensors that measure\nsome relevant information of the plant that is first processed by aggregator\nnode and then sent to the control unit. The sensor measurements, their\ncommunication with the aggregetor and the information processing are all\nassumed perfect. To reach the control unit, the message may travel through\nrelay nodes, forming a multi-hop, wireless link. At every hop, eavesdropper\nnodes attempt to acquire the messages transmitted through the legitimate link.\nThe communication design problem posed here is how to maximize the multi-hop\nthroughput from the aggregator to the control unit by finding the best\ncombination of relay positions (i.e. hop length: short or long) and coding\nrates (i.e. high or low spectral efficiency) so that the secrecy constraint is\nsatisfied.

The light curves of these pulsating stars have been\nclassified phenomenologically into stars with symmetric light curves and with\nasymmetric light curves. In the same effective temperature ranges as the gamma\nDor and SPB stars, there are variable stars with downward light curves that\nhave been conjectured to be caused by spots. Among these phenomenological\nclasses of stars, some show `frequency groups' in their amplitude spectra that\nhave not previously been understood. While it has been recognised that\nnonlinear pulsation gives rise to combination frequencies in a Fourier\ndescription of the light curves of these stars, such combination frequencies\nhave been considered to be a only a minor constituent of the amplitude spectra.\nIn this paper we unify the Fourier description of the light curves of these\ngroups of stars, showing that many of them can be understood in terms of only a\nfew base frequencies, which we attribute to g mode pulsations, and combination\nfrequencies, where sometimes a very large number of combination frequencies\ndominate the amplitude spectra. The frequency groups seen in these stars are\nthus tremendously simplified. We show observationally that the combination\nfrequencies can have amplitudes greater than the base frequency amplitudes, and\nwe show theoretically how this arises. Thus for some gamma Dor and SPB stars\ncombination frequencies can have the highest observed amplitudes. Among the B\nstars are pulsating Be stars that show emission lines in their spectra from\noccasional ejection of material into a circumstellar disk. Our analysis gives\nstrong support to the understanding of these pulsating Be stars as rapidly\nrotating SPB stars, explained entirely by g mode pulsations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 14:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Stellar bow shocks have been studied not only observationally, but\nalso theoretically since the late 1980s. Only a few catalogues of them exist.\nThe bow shocks show emission along all the electromagnetic spectrum, but they\nare detected more easily in infrared wavelengths. The release of new and\nhigh-quality infrared data eases the discovery and subsequent study of new\nobjects. Aims. We search stellar bow-shock candidates associated with nearby\nrunaway stars, and gather them together with those found elsewhere, to enlarge\nthe list of the E-BOSS first release. We aim to characterize the bow-shock\ncandidates and provide a database suitable for statistical studies. We\ninvestigate the low-frequency radio emission at the position of the bow-shock\nfeatures, that can contribute to further studies of high-energy emission from\nthese objects. Methods. We considered samples from different literature sources\nand searched for bow-shaped structures associated with stars in the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) images. We looked for each bow-shock candidate\non centimeter radio surveys. Results. We reunited 45 bow-shock candidates and\ngenerated composed WISE images to show the emission in different infrared\nbands. Among them there are new sources, previously studied objects, and bow\nshocks found serendipitously. Five bow shocks show evidence of radio emission.\nConclusions. Stellar bow shocks constitute an active field with open questions\nand enormous amounts of data to be analyzed. Future research at all wavelengths\ndatabases, and use of instruments like Gaia, will provide a more complete\npicture of these objects. For instance, infrared spectral energy distributions\ncan give information about physical parameters of the bow shock matter.

In our model we accounted for both intra-species\ncompetition (early individuals have a competitive advantage) and a disturbance\nwhich strikes at a random time, killing a fraction $1-p$ of the population.\nDisturbances include spells of bad weather, such as freezing or heavily raining\ndays. It has been shown in Iwasa and Levin (1995), that when $p=0$, then the\nESS is a mixed strategy, where individuals wait for a certain time and\nafterwards start arriving (or breeding) every day. We remove the constraint\n$p=0$ and show that if $0<p<1$ then the ESS still implies a mixed choice of\ntimes, but strong competition may lead to a massive arrival at the earliest\ntime possible of a fraction of the population, while the rest will arrive\nthroughout the whole period during which the disturbance may occur. More\nprecisely, given $p$, there is a threshold for the competition parameter $a$,\nabove which massive arrivals occur and below which there is a behaviour as in\nIwasa and Levin (1995). We study the behaviour of the ESS and of the average\nfitness of the population, depending on the parameters involved. We also\ndiscuss how the population may be affected by climate change, in two respects:\nfirst, how the ESS should change under the new climate and whether this change\nimplies an increase of the average fitness; second, which is the impact of the\nnew climate on a population that still follows the old strategy. We show that,\nat least under some conditions, extreme weather events imply a temporary\ndecrease of the average fitness (thus an increasing mortality). If the\npopulation adapts to the new climate, the survivors may have a larger fitness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 15:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 09:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

With this choice for IR cutoff, we are able to derive evolution\nof the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and the\ndeceleration parameters, $w$ and $q$, as the functions of the redshift\nparameter $z$. As far as we know, most previous models of HDE presented in the\nliteratures, do not gives analytically $\\omega=\\omega(z)$ and $q=q(z)$. We plot\nthe evolution of these parameters versus $z$ and discuss that the results are\ncompatible with the recent observations. With suitably choosing the parameters,\nthis model can exhibit a transition from deceleration to the acceleration\naround $z\\approx 0.6$. Then, we suggest a correspondence between the\nquintessence and tachyon scalar fields and HDE in the framework of DGP\nbraneworld. This correspondence allows us to reconstruct the evolution of the\nscalar fields and the scalar potentials. We also investigate stability of the\npresented model by calculating the squared sound speed, $v^2_s$, whose sign\ndetermines the stability of the model. Our study shows that $v^2_s$ could be\npositive provided the parameters of the model are chosen suitably. In\nparticular, for $\\alpha>1$, $\\beta>0$, and $\\alpha<1$, $\\beta<0$, we have\n$v^2_s>0$ during the history of the universe, and so the stable dark energy\ndominated universe can be achieved. This is in contrast to the HDE in standard\ncosmology, which is unstable against background perturbations and so cannot\nlead to a stable dark energy dominated universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 17:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Most of these\nautomatic face identification systems fail where the effects of aging come into\nthe picture. Little work exists in the literature on the subject of face\nprediction that accounts for aging, which is a vital part of the computer face\nrecognition systems. In recent years, individual face components' (e.g. eyes,\nnose, mouth) features based matching algorithms have emerged, but these\napproaches are still not efficient. Therefore, in this work we describe a Face\nPrediction Model (FPM), which predicts human face aging or growth related image\nvariation using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural\nNetwork (ANN) learning techniques. The FPM captures the facial changes, which\noccur with human aging and predicts the facial image with a few years of gap\nwith an acceptable accuracy of face matching from 76 to 86%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 12:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
