In the case of a\nplasma composed of electrons and positrons continuously heated by the\nturbulence, inverse Compton scattering can lead to relativistic bulk motions\nthrough the Compton rocket effect.

Here we demonstrate a novel dual-comb interferometer that is based on\nelectrooptic frequency comb technology and measures consecutive complex spectra\nat a record-high refresh rate of 25 MHz. These results pave the way for novel\nscientific and metrology applications of frequency comb generators beyond the\nrealm of molecular spectroscopy, where the measurement of ultrabroadband\nwaveforms is of paramount relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 16:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

This information is then converted into a neural\ncode that represents the animal's current position in space by engaging place\ncell, grid cell, and head direction cell networks. In particular, sensory\nlandmark (allothetic) cues can be utilized in concert with an animal's\nknowledge of its own velocity (idiothetic) cues to generate a more accurate\nrepresentation of position than (idiothetic) path integration provides on its\nown (Battaglia et al, 2004). We develop a computational model that merges path\nintegration with information from external sensory cues that provide a reliable\nrepresentation of spatial position along an annular track. Starting with a\ncontinuous bump attractor model, we allow for the possibility of synaptic\nspatial heterogeneity that would break the translation symmetry of space. We\nuse asymptotic analysis to reduce the bump attractor model to a single scalar\nequation whose potential represents the impact of heterogeneity. Such\nheterogeneity causes errors to build up when the network performs path\nintegration, but these errors can be corrected by an external control signal\nrepresenting the effects of sensory cues. We demonstrate that there is an\noptimal strength and decay rate of the control signal when cues are placed both\nperiodically and randomly. A similar analysis is performed when errors in path\nintegration arise from dynamic noise fluctuations. Again, there is an optimal\nstrength and decay of discrete control that minimizes the path integration\nerror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 16:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

For CGCG 97-079 we deduce an\ninfall velocity to the cluster of $\\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and moderate ram\npressure (P$_\\mathrm{ram} \\sim 10^{-11}$ dyn cm$^{-2}$). The observed offset in\nCGCG 97-079 of the highest density HI and CO (J = 2 - 1) from the stellar\ncomponents has not previously been observed in galaxies currently undergoing\nram pressure stripping, although previous detailed studies of gas morphology\nand kinematics during ram pressure stripping were restricted to significantly\nmore massive galaxies with deeper gravitational potential wells. We conclude\nthe observed cold gas density maxima offsets are most likely the result of ram\npressure and/or the high-speed tidal interaction with CGCG 97-073. However ram\npressure stripping is likely to be playing a major role in the perturbation of\nlower density gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 17:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

We use an original and\nnumerically exact method, based on a systematic coherent-state expansion of the\nground state of the underlying spin-boson Hamiltonian, which we apply to the\ncomputation of observables that are specific to the fermionic Kondo model. We\nalso present an important technical improvement to the method, that obviates\nthe need to discretize modes of the Fermi sea, and allows one to tackle the\nproblem in the thermodynamic limit. One can thus obtain excellent spatial\nresolution over arbitrary length scales, for a relatively low computational\ncost, a feature that gives the method an advantage over popular techniques such\nas NRG and DMRG. We find that the anisotropic Kondo model shows rich universal\nscaling behavior in the spatial structure of the entanglement cloud.

The latter tendency is known in the\nliterature as the resolution limit problem. To address them, we propose to\nmodify modularity by subtracting from it the fraction of edges connecting nodes\nof different communities and by including community density into modularity.

Using 2D time-dependent hydrodynamical\ncalculations, we show that the mass-outflow is unstable in the cases of thick\naccretion flows such as the low angular momentum accretion flow and the\nadvection-dominated accretion flow. For the low angular momentum flow, the\ninward accreting matter on the equatorial plane interacts with the outflowing\ngas along the rotational axis and the centrifugally supported oblique shock is\nformed at the interface of both the flows, when the viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha$ is as small as $\\alpha \\le 10^{-3}$. The hot and rarefied blobs, which\nresult in the eruptive mass-outflow, are generated in the inner shocked region\nand grow up toward the outer boundary. The advection-dominated accretion flow\nattains finally in the form of a torus disc with the inner edge of the disc at\n$3R_{\\rm g} \\le r \\le 6R_{\\rm g}$ and the center at $6R_ {\\rm g} \\le r \\le\n10R_{\\rm g}$, and a series of hot blobs is intermittently formed near the inner\nedge of the torus and grows up along the outer surface of the torus. As a\nresult, the luminosity and the mass-outflow rate are modulated irregularly\nwhere the luminosity is enhanced by 10-40% and the mass-outflow rate is\nincreaed by a factor of few up to ten. We interpret the unstable nature of the\noutflow to be due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, examining the Richardson\nnumber for the Kelvin-Helmholtz criterion in the inner region of the flow. We\npropose that the flare phenomena of Sgr A* may be induced by the unstable\nmass-outflow as is found in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 18:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

The local nature of an MIS allows for fast solutions in\na static distributed setting, which are logarithmic in the number of nodes or\nin their degrees. The result trivially applies for the dynamic distributed\nmodel, in which edges or nodes may be inserted or deleted. In this paper, we\ntake a different approach which exploits locality to the extreme, and show how\nto update an MIS in a dynamic distributed setting, either \\emph{synchronous} or\n\\emph{asynchronous}, with only \\emph{a single adjustment} and in a single\nround, in expectation. These strong guarantees hold for the \\emph{complete\nfully dynamic} setting: Insertions and deletions, of edges as well as nodes,\ngracefully and abruptly. This strongly separates the static and dynamic\ndistributed models, as super-constant lower bounds exist for computing an MIS\nin the former.\n  Our results are obtained by a novel analysis of the surprisingly simple\nsolution of carefully simulating the greedy \\emph{sequential} MIS algorithm\nwith a random ordering of the nodes. As such, our algorithm has a direct\napplication as a $3$-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering. This\nadds to the important toolbox of distributed graph decompositions, which are\nwidely used as crucial building blocks in distributed computing.\n  Finally, our algorithm enjoys a useful \\emph{history-independence} property,\nmeaning the output is independent of the history of topology changes that\nconstructed that graph. This means the output cannot be chosen, or even biased,\nby the adversary in case its goal is to prevent us from optimizing some\nobjective function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 19:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 10:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

Here we propose that high-temperature TDEs are produced when the\ntidal debris of a disrupted star self-intersects relatively close to the\nsupermassive black hole, in contrast to the more distant self-intersection that\nleads to lower color temperatures. In particular, we note from simple ballistic\nconsiderations that greater apsidal precession in an orbit is the key to closer\nself-intersection. Thus larger values of $\\beta$, the ratio of the tidal radius\nto the pericenter distance of the initial orbit, are more likely to lead to\nhigher temperatures of more compact disks which are super-Eddington and\ngeometrically and optically thick. For a given star and $\\beta$, apsidal\nprecession also increases for larger black hole masses, but larger black hole\nmasses imply a lower temperature at the Eddington luminosity. Thus the expected\ndependence of the temperature on the mass of the black hole is non-monotonic.\nWe find that in order to produce a soft X-ray temperature TDE, a deep plunging\nstellar orbit with $\\beta> 3$ is needed and a black hole mass of $\\lesssim\n5\\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ is favored. Although observations of TDEs are\ncomparatively scarce and are likely dominated by selection effects, it is\nencouraging that both expectations are consistent with current data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 19:14:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 00:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The inevitability of adiabatic cooling from the flow's initial\n10^7-10^8K temperature and the shape of the cooling function for T<10^7K imply\nthat outflows with hot gas mass-loss rate relative to star formation rate of\nbeta=Mdot_hot/Mdot_star > 0.5 cool radiatively on scales ranging from the size\nof the energy injection region to tens of kpc.

At r_cool, the gas produces X-ray\nand then UV/optical line emission with a total power bounded by 10^{-2} L_star\nif the flow is powered by steady-state star formation with luminosity L_star.\nThe wind is thermally unstable at r_cool, potentially leading to a multi-phase\nmedium. Cooled winds decelerate significantly in the extended gravitational\npotential of galaxies. The cool gas precipitated from hot outflows may explain\nits prevalence in galactic halos. We forward a picture of winds whereby cool\nclouds are initially accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot flow, but are\nrapidly shredded by hydrodynamical instabilities, thereby increasing beta,\nseeding radiative and thermal instability, and cool gas rebirth. If the cooled\nwind shocks as it sweeps up the circumgalactic medium, its cooling time is\nshort, thus depositing cool gas far out into the halo. Finally, conduction can\ndominate energy transport in low-beta hot winds, leading to flatter temperature\nprofiles than otherwise expected, potentially consistent with X-ray\nobservations of some starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 20:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 16:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Such an interaction could result from a planet-planet scattering\nor merging event. We show that when the planet mass is comparable to that of\nthe disc, the former is often circularised with little change to its semimajor\naxis. The secular effect of such a planet can cause debris to apsidally\nanti-align with the planet's orbit (the opposite of what may be naively\nexpected), leading to the counter-intuitive result that a low-mass planet may\nclear a larger region of debris than a higher-mass body would. The interaction\ngenerally results in a double-ringed debris disc, which is comparable to those\nobserved in HD 107146 and HD 92945. As an example we apply our results to HD\n107146, and show that the disc's morphology and surface brightness profile can\nbe well-reproduced if the disc is interacting with an eccentric planet of\ncomparable mass (~10-100 Earth masses).

An important source of\nsystematic uncertainty in cluster mass and structure measurements is the secure\nselection of background galaxies that are gravitationally lensed by clusters.\nThis issue has been shown to be particular severe for faint blue galaxies. We\ntherefore explore the selection of faint blue background galaxies, by reference\nto photometric redshift catalogs derived from the COSMOS survey and our own\nobservations of massive galaxy clusters at z~0.2. We show that methods relying\non photometric redshifts of galaxies in/behind clusters based on observations\nthrough five filters, and on deep 30-band COSMOS photometric redshifts are both\ninadequate to identify safely faint blue background galaxies. This is due to\nthe small number of filters used by the former, and absence of massive galaxy\nclusters at redshifts of interest in the latter. We therefore develop a\npragmatic method to combine both sets of photometric redshifts to select a\npopulation of blue galaxies based purely on photometric analysis. This sample\nyields stacked weak-lensing results consistent with our previously published\nresults based on red galaxies. We also show that the stacked clustercentric\nnumber density profile of these faint blue galaxies is consistent with\nexpectations from consideration of the lens magnification signal of the\nclusters. Indeed, the observed number density of blue background galaxies\nchanges by ~10-30 per cent across the radial range over which other surveys\nassume it to be flat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 20:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

In this paper we extend and generalize their exhaustive sampling\napproach, presenting a framework for $(1-\\eps)$-approximating any \\kCSP\\\nproblem in \\emph{sub-exponential} time while significantly relaxing the\ndenseness requirement on the input instance. Specifically, we prove that for\nany constants $\\delta \\in (0, 1]$ and $\\eps > 0$, we can approximate \\kCSP\\\nproblems with $\\Omega(n^{k-1+\\delta})$ constraints within a factor of\n$(1-\\eps)$ in time $2^{O(n^{1-\\delta}\\ln n /\\eps^3)}$.

Successful\ntreatment of cardiac arrest is extremely time sensitive, and use of an\nautomated external defibrillator (AED) where possible significantly increases\nthe probability of survival. Placement of AEDs in public locations can improve\nsurvival by enabling bystanders to treat victims of cardiac arrest prior to the\narrival of emergency medical responders. However, since the exact locations of\nfuture cardiac arrests cannot be known a priori, AEDs must be placed\nstrategically in public locations to ensure their accessibility in the event of\nan out-of-hospital cardiac arrest emergency. In this paper, we propose a\ndata-driven optimization model for deploying AEDs in public spaces while\naccounting for uncertainty in future cardiac arrest locations. Our approach\ninvolves discretizing a continuous service area into a large set of scenarios,\nwhere the probability of cardiac arrest at each location is itself uncertain.\nWe model uncertainty in the spatial risk of cardiac arrest using a polyhedral\nuncertainty set that we calibrate using historical cardiac arrest data. We\npropose a solution technique based on row-and-column generation that exploits\nthe structure of the uncertainty set, allowing the algorithm to scale\ngracefully with the total number of scenarios. Using real cardiac arrest data\nfrom the City of Toronto, we conduct an extensive numerical study on AED\ndeployment public locations. We find that hedging against cardiac arrest\nlocation uncertainty can produce AED deployments that outperform a intuitive\nsample average approximation by 9 to 15%, and cuts the performance gap with\nrespect to an ex-post model by half.

Yet, the problem of\npercolation on dimer-covered lattices has received little attention. In\nparticular, percolation on lattices that are fully covered by non-overlapping\ndimers has not evidently been considered. Here, we propose a novel procedure\nfor generating random dimer coverings of a given lattice. We then compute the\nbond percolation threshold on random and ordered coverings of the square and\nthe triangular lattice, on the remaining bonds connecting the dimers. We obtain\n$p_c=0.367713(2)$ and $p_c=0.235340(1)$ for random coverings of the square and\nthe triangular lattice, respectively. We observe that the percolation\nfrustration induced as a result of dimer covering is larger in the\nlow-coordination-number square lattice. There is also no relationship between\nthe existence of long-range order in a covering of the square lattice, and its\npercolation threshold. In particular, an ordered covering of the square\nlattice, denoted by shifted covering in this work, has an unusually low\npercolation threshold, and is topologically identical to the triangular\nlattice. This is in contrast to the other ordered dimer coverings considered in\nthis work, which have higher percolation thresholds than the random covering.\nIn the case of the triangular lattice, the percolation thresholds of the\nordered and random coverings are very close, suggesting the lack of sensitivity\nof the percolation threshold to microscopic details of the covering in\nhighly-coordinated networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 23:05:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 09:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Recent results\nindicate that adaptive dynamics may often not converge to equilibrium points\nand instead generate complicated trajectories if evolution takes place in\nhigh-dimensional phenotype spaces. Even though some analytical results on\ndiversification in complex phenotype spaces are available, to study this\nproblem in general we need to reconstruct individual-based models from the\nadaptive dynamics generating the non-equilibrium dynamics. Here we first\nprovide a method to construct individual-based models such that they faithfully\nreproduce the given adaptive dynamics attractor without diversification. We\nthen show that a propensity to diversify can by introduced by adding Gaussian\ncompetition terms that generate frequency dependence while still preserving the\nsame adaptive dynamics. For sufficiently strong competition, the disruptive\nselection generated by frequency-dependence overcomes the directional evolution\nalong the selection gradient and leads to diversification in phenotypic\ndirections that are orthogonal to the selection gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 00:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

We address this\nlongstanding question from a computational perspective, focusing on the case of\nsound change. Sound change arises from the pronunciation variability ubiquitous\nin every speech community, but most such variability does not lead to change.\nHence, an adequate model must allow for stability as well as change. Existing\ntheories of sound change tend to emphasize factors at the level of individual\nlearners promoting one outcome or the other, such as channel bias (which favors\nchange) or inductive bias (which favors stability). Here, we consider how the\ninteraction of these biases can lead to both stability and change in a\npopulation setting. We find that population structure itself can act as a\nsource of stability, but that both stability and change are possible only when\nboth types of bias are active, suggesting that it is possible to understand why\nsound change occurs at some times and not others as the population-level result\nof the interplay between forces promoting each outcome in individual speakers.\nIn addition, if it is assumed that learners learn from two or more teachers,\nthe transition from stability to change is marked by a phase transition,\nconsistent with the abrupt transitions seen in many empirical cases of sound\nchange. The predictions of multiple-teacher models thus match empirical cases\nof sound change better than the predictions of single-teacher models,\nunderscoring the importance of modeling language change in a population\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 00:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

A non-DC-biased OFDM\n(NDC OFDM) scheme that uses two LEDs has been proposed in the literature\nrecently. NDC OFDM has been shown to perform better than other OFDM schemes for\nVLC like DC-biased OFDM (DCO OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped OFDM (ACO OFDM)\nin multiple LEDs settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient multiple LED\nOFDM scheme for VLC which uses {\\em coded index modulation}. The proposed\nscheme uses two transmitter blocks, each having a pair of LEDs. Within each\nblock, NDC OFDM signaling is done. The selection of which block is activated in\na signaling interval is decided by information bits (i.e., index bits). In\norder to improve the reliability of the index bits at the receiver (which is\ncritical because of high channel correlation in multiple LEDs settings), we\npropose to use coding on the index bits alone.

The most popular\ntool for studying bilattices-based algebras is product representation. The\nauthors recently set up a widely applicable algebraic framework which enabled\nproduct representations over a base variety to be derived in a uniform and\ncategorical manner. By combining this methodology with that of natural duality\ntheory, we demonstrate how to build a natural duality for any bilattice-based\nvariety which has a suitable product representation over a dualisable base\nvariety. This procedure allows us systematically to present economical natural\ndualities for many bilattice-based varieties, for most of which no dual\nrepresentation has previously been given. Among our results we highlight that\nfor bilattices with a generalised conflation operation (not assumed to be an\ninvolution or commute with negation). Here both the associated product\nrepresentation and the duality are new. Finally we outline analogous procedures\nfor pre-bilattice-based algebras (so negation is absent).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 07:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level. As a\nparticularly interesting consequence, we find that the heavy Majorana neutrino\nmass scale ends up being tied to the gravitino mass, Lambda_N ~ m_3/2. Assuming\nnonthermal leptogenesis to be responsible for the generation of the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, this connection may then explain why SUSY\nnecessarily needs to be broken at a rather high energy scale, so that m_3/2 >~\n1000 TeV in accord with the concept of PGM. We illustrate our idea by means of\na minimal model of dynamical SUSY breaking, in which B-L is identified as a\nweakly gauged flavor symmetry. We also discuss the effect of the B-L gauge\ndynamics on the superparticle mass spectrum as well as the resulting\nconstraints on the parameter space of our model.

Precise detection of the GRB polarization\ncarried out by dedicated instruments can provide new data and be an ultimate\ntool to unveil their real nature. A novel space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR\nonboard the Chinese space station TG2 is designed to measure linear\npolarization of gamma-rays arriving from GRB prompt emissions. POLAR uses\nplastics scintillator bars (PS) as gamma-ray detectors and multi-anode\nphotomultipliers (MAPMTs) for readout of the scintillation light.

IEEE standard 802.11ad, also known as WiGig, is\nstandardized for the usage of the 60 GHz unlicensed band for wireless local\narea networks (WLANs). By using this mmw WLAN, multi-Gbps rate can be achieved\nto support bandwidth-intensive multimedia applications. Exhaustive search along\nwith beamforming (BF) is usually used to overcome 60 GHz channel propagation\nloss and accomplish data transmissions in such mmw WLANs. Because of its short\nrange transmission with a high susceptibility to path blocking, multiple number\nof mmw access points (APs) should be used to fully cover a typical target\nenvironment for future high capacity multi-Gbps WLANs. Therefore, coordination\namong mmw APs is highly needed to overcome packet collisions resulting from\nun-coordinated exhaustive search BF and to increase the total capacity of mmw\nWLANs. In this paper, we firstly give the current status of mmw WLANs with our\ndeveloped WiGig AP prototype. Then, we highlight the great need for coordinated\ntransmissions among mmw APs as a key enabler for future high capacity mmw\nWLANs. Two different types of coordinated mmw WLAN architecture are introduced.\nOne is the distributed antenna type architecture to realize centralized\ncoordination, while the other is an autonomous coordination with the assistance\nof legacy Wi-Fi signaling. Moreover, two heterogeneous network (HetNet)\narchitectures are also introduced to efficiently extend the coordinated mmw\nWLANs to be used for future 5th Generation (5G) cellular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 10:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

The spectrum has a typical shape\nfor accreting X-ray pulsars, consisting of a simple power law with an\nexponential cutoff starting at ~7 keV with a folding energy of E_fold=~18 keV.\nThere is also an indication of the presence of a 6.4 keV iron line in the\nspectrum at the ~3 sigma significance level. NuSTAR measurements of the\npulsation period reveal that the pulsar has undergone a strong and steady\nspin-up for the last 20 years. The pulsed fraction is estimated to be ~80%, and\nis constant with energy up to 40 keV. The power density spectrum shows a break\ntowards higher frequencies relative to the current spin period. This, together\nwith steady persistent luminosity, points to a long-term mass accretion rate\nhigh enough to bring the pulsar out of spin equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 11:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Presently, the general theory of modeling and the\nprogress in computational techniques provide wide options for simulation of\nseismic and aseismic events with various source mechanisms accounting for\nblocky structure of rock mass, inclusions, faults, cracks, complicated contact\nconditions and various mechanical properties of rock. Meanwhile, in practical\napplications, the input data are limited and uncertain. The data on observed\nseismicity are also often limited with a few parameters, like coordinates and\ntime. The paper aims to agree the input and output data, used in and provided\nby numerical simulations, with uncertain and limited data of direct\nobservations. For the input parameters, we suggest their minimal set, which\ncomplies with commonly available data. For output seismic parameters, we\ndistinguish three major groups, which are provided by field observations. The\nfirst group includes the common (minimal) data on distributions of the event\nlocation. These distributions are of special value for improving the input data\non geometrical features of a problem. The second group employs the data\n(commonly available, as well) on the event magnitude. These distributions are\nof exceptional need for evaluating the risk of strong events. The third group\nemploys data on the event source mechanism. It is based on the tensor of\nseismic moment/potency, provided by advanced mining seismic systems. This group\nincludes distributions of the geometrical parameters of the event source\n(orientation of nodal planes, B, P and T directions).

In their most basic form, Bayesian methods such as Approximate Bayesian\nComputation (ABC) involve sampling from the parameter space and keeping those\nparameters that produce data that fit sufficiently well to the actually\nobserved data. Exploring the whole parameter space, however, makes this\napproach inefficient in high dimensional problems. This led to the proposal of\nmore sophisticated iterative methods of inference such as particle filters.\n  Here, we propose an alternative approach that is based on stochastic gradient\nmethods and applicable both in a frequentist and a Bayesian setting. By moving\nalong a simulated gradient, the algorithm produces a sequence of estimates that\nwill eventually converge either to the maximum likelihood estimate or to the\nmaximum of the posterior distribution, in each case under a set of observed\nsummary statistics. To avoid reaching only a local maximum, we propose to run\nthe algorithm from a set of random starting values.\n  As good tuning of the algorithm is important, we explored several tuning\nstrategies, and propose a set of guidelines that worked best in our\nsimulations. We investigate the performance of our approach in simulation\nstudies, and also apply the algorithm to two models with intractable likelihood\nfunctions. First, we present an application to inference in the context of\nqueuing systems. We also re-analyze population genetic data and estimate\nparameters describing the demographic history of Sumatran and Bornean\norang-utan populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 12:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

We present a\nsimulation of single-dish observations including an instrumental noise model\nwith 1/f and white noise, and sky emission with a diffuse Galactic foreground\nand HI emission. We consider two foreground cleaning methods: spectral\nparametric fitting and principal component analysis. For a smooth frequency\nspectrum of the foreground and instrumental effects, we find that the\nparametric fitting method provides residuals that are still contaminated by\nforeground and 1/f noise, but the principal component analysis can remove this\ncontamination down to the thermal noise level. This method is robust for a\nrange of different models of foreground and noise, and so constitutes a\npromising way to recover the HI signal from the data. However, it induces a\nleakage of the cosmological signal into the subtracted foreground of around 5%.\nThe efficiency of the component separation methods depends heavily on the\nsmoothness of the frequency spectrum of the foreground and the 1/f noise.

Instead of directly accelerating the ions, current\napproaches rely on TV/m laser fields to ionize and drive out electrons. The\nions are then accelerated by the resulting electrostatic fields from charge\nseparation. Here we report experimental and numerical acceleration of ions by\nmeans of laser driven Z-pinch exiting a sharp plasma interface. This is\nachieved by first driving a plasma wakefield in the self-modulated bubble\nregime. Cold return currents are generated to maintain quasi-neutrality of the\nplasma. The opposite current repel and form an axial fast current and a\ncylindrical-shell cold return current with a large (100 MG) azithmuthal field\nin between. These conditions produce a Z-pinch that compresses the fast\nelectrons and ions on axis. If this process is terminated at a sharp plasma\ninterface, a beam of ions are then accelerated in the forward direction as the\nZ-pinch collapses.
