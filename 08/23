In this study, a socially-aware crowdsensing system is\nadvocated, in which a cloud-based platform incentivizes mobile users to\nparticipate in sensing tasks} by leveraging social trust among users, upon\nreceiving sensing requests. For this system, social trust assisted reciprocity\n(STAR) - a synergistic marriage of social trust and reciprocity, is exploited\nto design an incentive mechanism that stimulates users' participation.\n  Given the social trust structure among users, the efficacy of STAR for\nsatisfying users' sensing requests is thoroughly investigated. Specifically, it\nis first shown that all requests can be satisfied if and only if sufficient\nsocial credit can be \"transferred\" from users who request more sensing service\nthan they can provide to users who can provide more than they request. Then\nutility maximization for sensing services under STAR is investigated, and it is\nshown that it boils down to maximizing the utility of a circulation flow in the\ncombined social graph and request graph. Accordingly, an algorithm that\niteratively cancels a cycle of positive weight in the residual graph is\ndeveloped, which computes the optimal solution efficiently, for both cases of\ndivisible and indivisible sensing service. Extensive simulation results\ncorroborate that STAR can significantly outperform the mechanisms using social\ntrust only or reciprocity only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2015 16:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-25"}

Steady solutions of the dynamical system\nwhich governs the evolution of the helical modes are determined, and a\nstability analysis of these solutions is carried out. The interpretation of the\nanalysis is that unstable solutions lead to energy transfer between the\ninteracting modes while stable solutions do not. From this, a dependence of\npossible interscale energy and helicity transfers on the helicities of the\ninteracting modes is derived. As expected from the inverse cascade of magnetic\nhelicity in 3D MHD turbulence, mode interactions with like helicities lead to\ntransfer of energy and magnetic helicity to smaller wavenumbers. However, some\ninteractions of modes with unlike helicities also contribute to an inverse\nenergy transfer. As such, an inverse energy cascade for nonhelical magnetic\nfields is shown to be possible. Furthermore, it is found that high values of\nthe cross-helicity may have an asymmetric effect on forward and reverse\ntransfer of energy, where forward transfer is more quenched in regions of high\ncross-helicity than reverse transfer. This conforms with recent observations of\nsolar wind turbulence. For specific helical interactions the relation to dynamo\naction is established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2015 17:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 16:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes a\ndeclarative real-time component model. In this model, the distinguishing\nreal-time contract of each component is declaratively described, and a general\ncomponent real-time management interface is designed. They are used to maintain\nan accurate view of existing real-time components' promised contracts. A\nreal-time component runtime service is designed to control the whole lifecycle\nof the components.

The infrared emission of\nasteroids depends on the body's size, shape, albedo, thermal inertia, roughness\nand rotational properties. These parameters can therefore be derived by\nthermophysical modeling of infrared data. Thermophysical modeling led to\nasteroid size estimates that were confirmed at the few-percent level by later\nspacecraft visits. We discuss how instrumentation advances now allow\nmid-infrared interferometric observations as well as high-accuracy\nspectro-photometry, posing their own set of thermal-modeling challenges.We\npresent major breakthroughs achieved in studies of the thermal inertia, a\nsensitive indicator for the nature of asteroids soils, allowing us, for\ninstance, to determine the grain size of asteroidal regoliths. Thermal inertia\nalso governs non-gravitational effects on asteroid orbits, requiring\nthermophysical modeling for precise asteroid dynamical studies. The radiative\nheating of asteroids, meteoroids, and comets from the Sun also governs the\nthermal stress in surface material; only recently has it been recognized as a\nsignificant weathering process. Asteroid space missions with thermal infrared\ninstruments are currently undergoing study at all major space agencies. This\nwill require a high level of sophistication of thermophysical models in order\nto analyze high-quality spacecraft data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2015 08:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The coexistence of ferroelectric and topological orders\nis one such example. Ferroelectrics, which have a spontaneous macroscopic\npolarization switchable by an applied electric field, usually are\nsemiconductors with a well-developed wide band gap with a few exceptions. On\nthe other hand, time-reversal symmetric $Z_2$ topological insulators (TI),\ncharacterized by robust metallic surface states protected by the topology of\nthe bulk, usually are narrow-gap semiconductors ($< 0.7$ eV) which allow band\ninversion induced by the spin-orbit interaction. To date, a ferroelectric\ntopological insulator (FETI) has remained elusive, owing to the seemingly\ncontradictory characters of the ferroelectric and topological orders. Here, we\nreport that the FETI can be realized in halide perovskite CsPbI$_3$ under\nstrain. Our first-principles study reveals that a non-centrosymmetric\nferroelectric structure of CsPbI$_3$ is energetically favored under a wide\nrange of pressures, while maintaining its topological order. The proposed FETI\nis characterized by switchable polar surfaces with spin-momentum locked Dirac\ncones, which allows for electric-field control of topological surface states\n(TSSs) and the surface spin current. Our demonstration of a FETI in a feasible\nmaterial opens doors for future studies combining ferroelectric and topological\norders, and offers a new paradigm for diverse applications in electronics,\nspintronics, and quantum information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2015 15:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The partial exposure trades better conditioning for less\nenergy. In problems such as motion deblurring the available energy is what\ncaused the problem in the first place (as strong illumination allows short\nexposure thus eliminates motion blur). It is still beneficial because the\nbenefit from the better conditioning outweighs the cost in energy.\n  This documents is focused on light efficient flutter shutter that provides\nbetter conditioning and better energy utilization than conventional flutter\nshutter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2015 00:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}

Evaluation is defined\nas one or more processes for interpreting the data acquired through the\nassessment processes in order to determine how well the set objectives and\noutcomes are being attained. Even though assessment processes for accreditation\nare well documented but existence of an evaluation process is assumed. This\npaper focuses on evaluation process to provide insights and techniques for data\ninterpretation. It gives a complete evaluation process from the data collection\nthrough various assessment methods, performance metrics, to the presentations\nin the form of tables and graphs.
