The spin-driven nematic phase, characterized by the broken\n$C_4$ symmetry, but unbroken $O(3$) spin-rotational symmetry, is generated by\nthe presence of magnetic fluctuations associated with the striped phase. It\noccurs as a separate phase between $T_N$ and $T_s$ in systems where the\nstructural and magnetic phase transitions are separated. Detecting the presence\nof nematic degrees of freedom in iron-based superconductors is a difficult\ntask, since it involves measuring higher order spin correlation functions. We\nshow that the nematic degrees of freedom manifest themselves in the\nexperimentally measurable Raman response function. We calculate the Raman\nresponse function in tetragonal phase in the large $N$ limit by considering\nAslamazov-Larkin type of diagrams that contain a series of inserted fermionic\nboxes that resemble the nematic coupling constant of the theory. These diagrams\neffectively account for collisions between spin fluctuations. By summing an\ninfinite number of such higher order diagrams, we demonstrate that the\nelectronic Raman response function shows a clear maximum at the structural\nphase transition in the $B_{1g}$ channel. Hence, the Raman response function\ncan be used to probe nematic degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 16:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 12:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

This\ngenerator induces a class of problems in the bitstringdomain which is\ninteresting to study from a theoretical perspective in the context of\nmultimodal optimization, as it is a generalization of the classical OneMax and\nTwoMax functions for an arbitrary number of peaks. An average-case runtime\nanalysis for multistart next ascent hill-climbing is presented for uniformly\ndistributed equal-height instances of this class of problems. It is shown\nempirically that conventional niching and mating restriction techniques\nincorporated in an evolutionary algorithm are not sufficient to make them\ncompetitive with the hillclimbing strategy. We conjecture the reason for this\nbehaviour is the lack of structure in the space of local optima on instances of\nthis problem class, which makes an optimization algorithm unable to exploit\ninformation from one optimum to infer where another optimum might be. When no\nsuch structure exist, it seems that the best strategy for discovering all\noptima is a brute-force one. Overall, our study gives insights with respect to\nthe adequacy of hillclimbers and evolutionary algorithms for multimodal\noptimization, depending on properties of the fitness landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 18:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2022 21:56:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-13"}

One specific case of study is\nrepresented by the collective attention to the action of political parties. Not\nsurprisingly, researchers and stakeholders tried to correlate parties' presence\non social media with their performances in elections. Despite the many efforts,\nresults are still inconclusive since this kind of data is often very noisy and\nsignificant signals could be covered by (largely unknown) statistical\nfluctuations. In this paper we consider the number of tweets (tweet volume) of\na party as a proxy of collective attention to the party, identify the dynamics\nof the volume, and show that this quantity has some information on the\nelections outcome. We find that the distribution of the tweet volume for each\nparty follows a log-normal distribution with a positive autocorrelation of the\nvolume over short terms, which indicates the volume has large fluctuations of\nthe log-normal distribution yet with a short-term tendency. Furthermore, by\nmeasuring the ratio of two consecutive daily tweet volumes, we find that the\nevolution of the daily volume of a party can be described by means of a\ngeometric Brownian motion (i.e., the logarithm of the volume moves randomly\nwith a trend). Finally, we determine the optimal period of averaging tweet\nvolume for reducing fluctuations and extracting short-term tendencies. We\nconclude that the tweet volume is a good indicator of parties' success in the\nelections when considered over an optimal time window. Our study identifies the\nstatistical nature of collective attention to political issues and sheds light\non how to model the dynamics of collective attention in social media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 18:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 09:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

In particular, we show how to\ndesign a Gibbs sampler which quickly converges to the target distribution.\nNumerical simulations show a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the\nestimates over state-of-the-art kernel-based methods when employed in\nidentification of systems with quantized data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 20:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

When the jump\nis maximal and the fluctuations range over the entire range of allowed values,\nthe behavior has been coined an `extreme Thouless effect'. Here, we report\nfindings of such a phenomenon, in the context of dynamic, social networks.\nDefined by minimal rules of evolution, it describes a population of extreme\nintroverts and extroverts, who prefer to have contacts with, respectively, no\none or everyone.

Fortunately, sparsity constraints have\ncome into rescue as it helps solving the ill-posed problems when the signal is\nsparse. When the signal has a structure such as block structure, consideration\nof block sparsity produces better results. Knowing sparse Bayesian learning is\nan important member in the family of sparse recovery, and a superior choice\nwhen the projection matrix is highly coherent (which is typical the case for\nEEG), in this work we evaluate the performance of block sparse Bayesian\nlearning (BSBL) method for EEG source localization.

Plasmonic nanorod\nmetamaterials with hyperbolic dispersion of electromagnetic modes are believed\nto deliver a significant Purcell enhancement with both broadband and\nnon-resonant nature. Here, we have investigated finite-size cavities formed by\nnanorod metamaterials and shown that the main mechanism of the Purcell effect\nin these hyperbolic resonators originates from the cavity hyperbolic modes,\nwhich in a microscopic description stem from the interacting cylindrical\nsurface plasmon modes of the finite number of nanorods forming the cavity.

The Purcell factors, delivered by those cavity modes,\nreach several hundred, which is 4-5 times larger than those emerging at the\nepsilon near zero transition frequencies. The effect of enhancement is less\npronounced for dipoles, polarized along the rods.

However, such\ncatalogs suffer from biases whose effects increase with the distance. Malmquist\nbiases and lognormal error distribution affect the catalogs. Velocity fields of\nthe Local Universe reconstructed with these catalogs present a spurious overall\ninfall onto the Local Volume if they are not corrected for biases. Such an\ninfall is observed in the reconstructed velocity field obtained when applying\nthe BayesianWiener-Filter technique to the raw second radial peculiar velocity\ncatalog of the Cosmicflows project. In this paper, an iterative method to\nreduce spurious non-Gaussianities in the radial peculiar velocity distribution,\nto retroactively derive overall better distance estimates resulting in a\nminimization of the effects of biases, is presented. This method is tested with\nmock catalogs. To control the cosmic variance, mocks are built out of different\ncosmological constrained simulations which resemble the Local Universe. To\nrealistically reproduce the effects of biases, the mocks are constructed to be\nlook-alikes of the second data release of the Cosmicflows project, with respect\nto the size, distribution of data and distribution of errors. Using a suite of\nmock catalogs, the outcome of the correction is verified to be affected neither\nby the added error realization, nor by the datapoint selection, nor by the\nconstrained simulation. Results are similar for the different tested mocks.\nAfter correction, the general infall is satisfactorily suppressed.

Applying this notion to the shortest-path metric in\nedge-weighted graphs, it is known that $n$-vertex graphs admit an $O(\\ln\nn)$-padded decomposition (Bartal, 1996), and that excluded-minor graphs admit\n$O(1)$-padded decomposition (Klein, Plotkin and Rao 1993, Fakcharoenphol and\nTalwar 2003, Abraham et al. 2014).\n  We design decompositions to the family of $p$-path-separable graphs, which\nwas defined by Abraham and Gavoille (2006). and refers to graphs that admit\nvertex-separators consisting of at most $p$ shortest paths in the graph.\n  Our main result is that every $p$-path-separable $n$-vertex graph admits an\n$O(\\ln (p \\ln n))$-decomposition, which refines the $O(\\ln n)$ bound for\ngeneral graphs, and provides new bounds for families like bounded-treewidth\ngraphs. Technically, our clustering process differs from previous ones by\nworking in (the shortest-path metric of) carefully chosen subgraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 10:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 21:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

Here\nwe search for the roots of this connection, investigating the relation between\nentanglement and thermodynamics in the framework of general probabilistic\ntheories. We first address the question whether an entangled state can be\ntransformed into another by means of local operations and classical\ncommunication. Under two operational requirements, we prove a general version\nof the Lo-Popescu theorem, which lies at the foundations of the theory of\npure-state entanglement. We then consider a resource theory of purity where\nfree operations are random reversible transformations, modelling the scenario\nwhere an agent has limited control over the dynamics of a closed system. Our\nkey result is a duality between the resource theory of entanglement and the\nresource theory of purity, valid for every physical theory where all processes\narise from pure states and reversible interactions at the fundamental level. As\nan application of the main result, we establish a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween entropies and measures of pure bipartite entanglement and exploit it to\ndefine entanglement measures in the general probabilistic framework. In\naddition, we show a duality between the task of information erasure and the\ntask of entanglement generation, whereby the existence of entropy sinks\n(systems that can absorb arbitrary amounts of information) becomes equivalent\nto the existence of entanglement sources (correlated systems from which\narbitrary amounts of entanglement can be extracted).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 12:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 15:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 17:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

In this\npaper, we give an efficient algorithm for generating optimal shuffle code in\nthe setting of Mohr et al. An interesting special case occurs when no register\nhas to be transferred to more than one destination, i.e., it suffices to\npermute the contents of the registers. This case is equivalent to factoring a\npermutation into a minimal product of permutations, each of which permutes up\nto five elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 13:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 07:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

The generated spectrum of gravitons is also compared with the standard\ncalculations where an abrupt transition, from the early de Sitter to the\nradiation phase, is usually assumed.} It is found that the stochastic\nbackground of gravitons is very similar to the one predicted by the cosmic\nconcordance model plus inflation except at higher frequencies ($\\nu \\gtrsim\n100$ kHz). This remarkable signature of a \"running vacuum\" cosmology combined\nwith the proposed high frequency gravitational wave detectors and measurements\nof the CMB polarization (B-modes) may provide a new window to confront more\nconventional models of inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 13:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 14:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

As we will see,\nalready in the simplest case, the statements of the results in the\nsub-Riemannian setting are quite different from those in the Riemannian one.\nLet us consider a sub-Riemannian (sR) metric on a closed three-dimensional\nmanifold with an oriented contact distribution. There exists a privileged\nchoice of the contact form, with an associated Reeb vector field and a\ncanonical volume form that coincides with the Popp measure. We establish a\nQuantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of any associated sR\nLaplacian under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. The limit measure\nis given by the normalized Popp measure.This is the first time that such a\nresult is established for a hypoelliptic operator, whereas the usual Shnirelman\ntheorem yields QE for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a closed Riemannian\nmanifold with ergodic geodesic flow.To prove our theorem, we first establish a\nmicrolocal Weyl law, which allows us to identify the limit measure and to prove\nthe microlocal concentration of the eigenfunctions on the characteristic\nmanifold of the sR Laplacian. Then, we derive a Birkhoff normal form along this\ncharacteristic manifold, thus showing that, in some sense, all 3D contact\nstructures are microlocally equivalent. The quantum version of this normal form\nprovides a useful microlocal factorization of the sR Laplacian. Using the\nnormal form, the factorization and the ergodicity assumption, we finally\nestablish a variance estimate, from which QE follows.We also obtain a second\nresult, which is valid without any ergodicity assumption: every Quantum Limit\n(QL) can be decomposed in a sum of two mutually singular measures: the first\nmeasure is supported on the unit cotangent bundle and is invariant under the sR\ngeodesic flow, and the second measure is supported on the characteristic\nmanifold of the sR Laplacian and is invariant under the lift of the Reeb flow.\nMoreover, we prove that the first measure is zero for most QLs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 08:57:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 21:22:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 08:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Geometric frustration proposes that a\ntransition to a crystalline state is frustrated because these LFS do not tile\nspace. However, this concept is based on icosahedra which are not always the\nLFS for a given system. The LFS of the popular Kob-Andersen (KA) model\nglassformer is the bicapped square antiprism, which does tile space. Such an\nLFS-crystal is indeed realised in the $\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ structure, which is\npredicted to be a low energy state for the KA model with a 2:1 composition. We\ntherefore hypothesise that upon changing the composition in the KA model\ntowards 2:1, geometric frustration may be progressively relieved, leading to\nlarger and larger domains of LFS which would ultimately correspond to the\n$\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal. Remarkably, rather than an increase, upon changing\ncomposition we find a small decrease in the LFS population, and the system\nremains impervious to nucleation of LFS crystals. We suggest that this may be\nrelated to the composition of the LFS, as only a limited subset are compatible\nwith the crystal. We further demonstrate that the $\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal\nwill grow from a seed in the KA model with 2:1 composition and identify the\nmelting temperature to be 0.447(2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

Susko et\nal. (2004) reported some strikingly broad results about the forms of\ninconsistency in tree estimation that can arise if corrected distances are not\nproportional to the true distances. They showed that if the corrected distance\nis a concave function of the true distance, then inconsistency due to long\nbranch attraction will occur. If these functions are convex, then two \"long\nbranch repulsion\" trees will be preferred over the true tree -- though these\ntwo incorrect trees are expected to be tied as the preferred true.

For example, if some\npositions in a sequence are constrained to be free of substitutions and\ninsertion/deletion events while the remaining sites evolve with independent\nsubstitutions and insertion/deletion events, then the distances obtained by\ntreating gaps as missing data can support an incorrect tree topology even given\nan unlimited amount of data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 15:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

Our results show that by increasing temperature, both polymers\ntend to lengthen, and at all temperatures a more radius is predicted for PS\nrather than PE, but interestingly, with a difference in short and long chains.\nWe show that stiffness enhancement is not the same at short and long polymers\nand the behavior is very different. Our results show a good consonance with\nboth experimental and theoretical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 22:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 07:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

The\nevolution of the structure is determined indirectly, from a carefully built\ntransformation of the eigenvector matrices of the coupling Laplacians, which\nare guaranteed to change smoothly in time. In turn, this allows to extend the\nMaster Stability Function formalism, which can be used to assess the stability\nof a synchronized state. This approach is independent from the particular\ntopologies that the network visits, and is not restricted to commuting\nstructures. Also, it does not depend on the time scale of the evolution, which\ncan be faster than, comparable to, or even secular with respect to the the\ndynamics of the units.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 12:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2015 11:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}
