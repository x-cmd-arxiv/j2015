Here we develop a stochastic dynamical model on the DNA\nrenaturation. According to our model there are at least three steps in the\nrenaturation process viz. incorrect-contact formation, correct-contact\nformation and nucleation, and zipping. Most of the earlier two-state models\ncombined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we\nsuggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with\nthe zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated\nand zipping molecules are indistinguishable. Incorrect-contact formation step\nis a pure three-dimensional diffusion controlled collision process. Whereas\nnucleation involves several rounds of one-dimensional slithering dynamics of\none single strand of DNA on the other complementary strand in the process of\nsearching for the correct-contact and then initiate nucleation. Upon\nnucleation, the stochastic zipping follows to generate a fully renatured double\nstranded DNA. It seems that the square-root dependency of the overall\nrenaturation rate constant on the length of reacting single strands originates\nmainly from the geometric constraints in the diffusion controlled\nincorrect-contact formation step. Further the inverse scaling of the\nrenaturation rate on the viscosity of the reaction medium also originates from\nthe incorrect-contact formation step.

Using new NIR interferometric\nobservations, we aim to characterize the 0.1-10~au region of the HD~139614 disk\nfurther and identify viable mechanisms for the inner disk clearing. We report\nthe first multiwavelength radiative transfer modeling of the interferometric\ndata acquired on HD~139614 with PIONIER, AMBER, and MIDI, complemented by\nHerschel/PACS photometries. We confirm a gap structure in the um-sized dust,\nextending from about 2.5 au to 6 au, and constrained the properties of the\ninner dust component: e.g., a radially increasing surface density profile, and\na depletion of 10^3 relative to the outer disk. Since self-shadowing and\nphotoevaporation appears unlikely to be responsible for the au-sized gap of\nHD~139614, we thus tested if dynamical clearing could be a viable mechanism\nusing hydrodynamical simulations to predict the gaseous disk structure. Indeed,\na narrow au-sized gap is expected when a single giant planet interacts with the\ndisk. Assuming that small dust grains are well coupled to the gas, we found\nthat a ~ 3~Mjup planet located at 4.5 au from the star could, in less than 1\nMyr, reproduce most of the aspects of the dust surface density profile, while\nno significant depletion in gas occurred in the inner disk, in contrast to the\ndust. However, the dust-depleted inner disk could be explained by the expected\ndust filtration by the gap and the efficient dust growth/fragmentation in the\ninner disk regions. Our results support the hypothesis of a giant planet\nopening a gap and shaping the inner region of the HD~139614 disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2015 20:08:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 07:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 15:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The constrained estimation problem can be\nsolved by, e.g., interior-point (IP) or active-set (AS) methods, where the main\ncomputational effort in both methods is known to be the computation of the\nsearch direction, i.e., the Newton step. This is often done using generic\nsparsity exploiting algorithms or serial Riccati recursions, but as parallel\nhardware is becoming more commonly available the need for parallel algorithms\nfor computing the Newton step is increasing. In this paper a tailored,\nnon-iterative parallel algorithm for computing the Newton step using the\nRiccati recursion is presented. The algorithm exploits the special structure of\nthe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system for the optimal estimation problem. As a result\nit is possible to obtain logarithmic complexity growth in the estimation\nhorizon length, which can be used to reduce the computation time for IP and AS\nmethods when applied to what is today considered as challenging estimation\nproblems.

In contrast, most previous works have designed specific\ndetectors using different features for each of these objects. To enhance the\nfeature robustness to noises and image deformations, we introduce spatially\npooled features as a part of aggregated channel features. In order to further\nimprove the generalization performance, we propose an object subcategorization\nmethod as a means of capturing intra-class variation of objects. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed\nframework in three detection applications: traffic sign detection, car\ndetection, and cyclist detection. The proposed framework achieves the\ncompetitive performance with state-of- the-art approaches on several benchmark\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 02:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The survey covered about 38 deg$^2$ of\nsky and imaged 147 fields spread across a wide region of the L4 cloud. Each\nfield was imaged in both the $g'$ and the $i'$ band, allowing for the\nmeasurement of $g-i$ color. We detected 557 Trojans in the observed fields,\nranging in absolute magnitude from $H=10.0$ to $H = 20.3$. We fit the total\nmagnitude distribution to a broken power law and show that the power-law slope\nrolls over from $0.45\\pm 0.05$ to $0.36^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ at a break magnitude\nof $H_{b}=14.93^{+0.73}_{-0.88}$. Combining the best-fit magnitude distribution\nof faint objects from our survey with an analysis of the magnitude distribution\nof bright objects listed in the Minor Planet Center catalog, we obtain the\nabsolute magnitude distribution of Trojans over the entire range from $H=7.2$\nto $H=16.4$. We show that the $g-i$ color of Trojans decreases with increasing\nmagnitude. In the context of the less-red and red color populations, as\nclassified in Wong et al. 2014 using photometric and spectroscopic data, we\ndemonstrate that the observed trend in color for the faint Trojans is\nconsistent with the expected trend derived from extrapolation of the best-fit\ncolor population magnitude distributions for bright catalogued Trojans. This\nindicates a steady increase in the relative number of less-red objects with\ndecreasing size. Finally, we interpret our results using collisional modeling\nand propose several hypotheses for the color evolution of the Jupiter Trojan\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 05:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Using stochastic geometry, we study the outage probability\nexperienced at the BS and a D2D receiver, and spectrum reuse ratio, which\nquantifies the average fraction of successfully transmitting D2D users. The\nanalysis shows that the outage probability at the D2D receiver varies for\ndifferent locations. Additionally, without impairing the performance at the BS,\nif the path-loss exponent on the cellular link is slightly lower than that on\nthe D2D link, the spectrum reuse ratio can have negligible decrease while the\nD2D users' average number of successful transmissions increases with increasing\nD2D node density.

We aim to\nintegrate corpus of heterogeneous knowledge, both digital and human, in order\nto help the interested user to speed-up the initialization of a small-scale\nwind project. We exemplify one use case scenario of our ontology, that consists\nof automatically checking whether a planned wind project is compliant or not\nwith the active regulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 08:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

There are three types of senile cataract:\ncortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and posterior/anterior sub-capsular\ncataract. The most common senile cataract is cortical cataract. For\nunderstanding cortical cataract, the pathology and the causing factors in\ncortical cataract are analyzed. The clouding change in senile cortical cataract\nbegins from the edge of the lens and develops progressively to lens centre. The\npathology of clouding change in cortical cataract is characterized by\ndisruption of some lens fibers, swelling of some other fibers, and deposition\nof water between fibers. Based on the property of a lens fiber, we propose here\na hypothesis on the mechanism of development of senile cortical cataract. I.\nCortical cataract is triggered by disruption of a cortical lens fiber as a\nresult of injury. The disrupted fiber will release water and crystallin\nproteins. II. Neighbor fibers can absorb this water due to high intracellular\nosmotic pressure (IOP) and become swollen. Swelling makes a fiber be stiff and\nhave increased risk to disrupt when it is curved during the accommodation of\nthe lens. These fibers will release water again when they disrupt, and the\nwater will make more local fibers swelling. In this way, the local fibers\nbecome swollen and then disrupt successively. III. The successive swellings and\ndisruptions of local fibers result in enlargement of a clouding change in lens.\nSince the fibers on the outer part of lens cortex have higher risk to be\ninjured than that in the inner part, a clouding change starts from the edge of\nthe lens. In conclusion, the progressive development of senile cortical\ncataract is a result of successive swellings and disruptions of local lens\nfibers, and this is driven by the high IOP in a lens fiber.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 09:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 11:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

The presence of dust in the interstellar medium has profound\nconsequences on the chemical composition of regions where stars are forming.\nRecent observations show that many species formed onto dust are populating the\ngas phase, especially in cold environments where UV and CR induced photons do\nnot account for such processes. Aims. The aim of this paper is to understand\nand quantify the process that releases solid species into the gas phase, the\nso-called chemical desorption process, so that an explicit formula can be\nderived that can be included into astrochemical models. Methods. We present a\ncollection of experimental results of more than 10 reactive systems. For each\nreaction, different substrates such as oxidized graphite and compact amorphous\nwater ice are used. We derive a formula to reproduce the efficiencies of the\nchemical desorption process, which considers the equipartition of the energy of\nnewly formed products, followed by classical bounce on the surface. In part II\nwe extend these results to astrophysical conditions. Results. The equipartition\nof energy describes correctly the chemical desorption process on bare surfaces.\nOn icy surfaces, the chemical desorption process is much less efficient and a\nbetter description of the interaction with the surface is still needed.\nConclusions. We show that the mechanism that directly transforms solid species\nto gas phase species is efficient for many reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 10:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

We say that a sketch is \\emph{compact} if its size is\nbounded by a polynomial function of the length of the dynamic data,\n(essentially) independent of the size of the static part.\n  A graph optimization problem $P$ in this model is defined as follows. The\ninput is a graph $G(V,E)$ and a set $T \\subseteq V$ of $k$ terminals; the edges\nbetween the terminals are the dynamic part and the other edges in $G$ are the\nstatic part. The goal is to summarize the graph $G$ into a compact sketch (of\nsize poly$(k)$) such that given any set $Q$ of edges between the terminals, one\ncan answer the problem $P$ for the graph obtained by inserting all edges in $Q$\nto $G$, using only the sketch.\n  We study the fundamental problem of computing a maximum matching and prove\ntight bounds on the sketch size.

The prevalent methods for achieving DNP in solutions\nare typically most effective in the regime of small interaction correlation\ntimes between the electron and nuclear spins, limiting the size of accessible\nmolecules. To solve this limitation, we design a mechanism for DNP in the\nliquid phase that is applicable for large interaction correlation times.\nImportantly, while this mechanism makes use of a resonance condition similar to\nsolid-state DNP, the polarization transfer is robust to a relatively large\ndetuning from the resonance due to molecular motion. We combine this scheme\nwith optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds to\ndesign a setup that employs optical pumping and is therefore not limited by\nroom temperature electron thermal polarisation.

We discuss the design of CC and argue that it constitutes a canonical\nmodel for choreographic programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 13:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 09:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

However, TTVs can also be caused by deformations of the system transits\nby starspots, which might thus pose a serious complication in their\ninterpretation. We therefore simulate transit light curves deformed by\nspot-crossing events for different properties of the stellar surface and the\nplanet, such as starspot position, limb darkening, planetary period, and impact\nparameter. Mid-transit times determined from these simulations can be\nsignificantly shifted with respect to the input values; these shifts cannot be\nlarger than ~1% of the transit duration and depend most strongly on the\nlongitudinal position of the spot during the transit and the transit duration.\nConsequently, TTVs with amplitudes larger than the above limit are very\nunlikely to be caused by starspots. We also investigate whether TTVs from\nsequences of consecutive transits with spot-crossing anomalies can be\nmisinterpreted as the result of an additional body in the system. We use the\nGeneralized Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for periods in TTVs and conclude\nthat low amplitude TTVs with statistically significant periods around active\nstars are the most problematic cases. In those cases where the photometric\nprecision is high enough to inspect the transit shapes for deformations, it\nshould be possible to identify TTVs caused by starspots, however, especially\nfor cases with low transit signal to noise light curves (TSNR $\\lesssim$ 15) it\nbecomes quite difficult to reliably decide whether these periods come from\nstarspots, physical companions in the system or if they are random noise\nartifacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

In this regard, a robust\nrisk-constrained unit commitment (RRUC) formulation is proposed to cope with\nlarge-scale volatile and uncertain wind generation. Differing from existing RUC\nformulations, the wind generation uncertainty set in RRUC is adjustable via\nchoosing diverse levels of operational risk. By optimizing the uncertainty set,\nRRUC can allocate operational flexibility of power systems over spatial and\ntemporal domains optimally, reducing operational cost in a risk-constrained\nmanner. Moreover, since impact of wind generation realization out of the\nprescribed uncertainty set on operational risk is taken into account, RRUC\noutperforms RUC in the case of rare events. Three algorithms based on column\nand constraint generation (C&CG) are derived to solve the RRUC.

The\nperfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no\nfalse alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of\ndomains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics.

NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled,\nreal-world time-series data.

All current\nmodels addressing this question are one-dimensional and do not account for the\nfact that magnetic fields can effectively channel ions and electrons, leading\nto anisotropic transport of momentum, heat, and particle diffusion in the\nweakly collisional intracluster medium (ICM). This anisotropy can lead to a\nwide variety of instabilities, which could be relevant for understanding the\ndynamics of heterogeneous media. In this paper, we consider the radial\ntemperature and composition profiles as obtained from a state-of-the-art Helium\nsedimentation model and analyze its stability properties. We find that the\nassociated radial profiles are unstable, to different kinds of instabilities\ndepending on the magnetic field orientation, at all radii. The fastest growing\nmodes are usually related to generalizations of the Magnetothermal Instability\n(MTI) and the Heat-flux-driven Buoyancy Instability (HBI) which operate in\nheterogeneous media. We find that the effect of sedimentation is to increase\n(decrease) the predicted growth rates in the inner (outer) cluster region. The\nunstable modes grow fast compared to the sedimentation timescale. This suggests\nthat the composition gradients as inferred from sedimentation models, which do\nnot fully account for the anisotropic character of the weakly collisional\nenvironment, might not be very robust. Our results emphasize the subtleties\ninvolved in understanding the gas dynamics of the ICM and argue for the need of\na comprehensive approach to address the issue of Helium sedimentation beyond\ncurrent models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 15:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

In this\npaper, we present a simulation of the monitoring of CO$_2$ plume evolution in a\ngeological reservoir using muon radiography. The stratigraphy in the vicinity\nof a nominal test facility is modelled using geological data, and a numerical\nfluid flow model is used to describe the time evolution of the CO$_2$ plume. A\nplanar detection region with a surface area of 1000 m$^2$ is considered, at a\nvertical depth of 776 m below the seabed. We find that one year of constant\nCO$_2$ injection leads to changes in the column density of $\\lesssim 1\\%$, and\nthat the CO$_2$ plume is already resolvable with an exposure time of less than\n50 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

Commencing from a representation of graph structure based on a\ncharacteristic polynomial computed from the normalized Laplacian matrix, we\nshow how the polynomial is linked to the Boltzmann partition function of a\nnetwork. This allows us to compute a number of thermodynamic quantities for the\nnetwork, including the average energy and entropy. Assuming that the system\ndoes not change volume, we can also compute the temperature, defined as the\nrate of change of entropy with energy. All three thermodynamic variables can be\napproximated using low-order Taylor series that can be computed using the\ntraces of powers of the Laplacian matrix, avoiding explicit computation of the\nnormalized Laplacian spectrum. These polynomial approximations allow a smoothed\nrepresentation of the evolution of networks to be constructed in the\nthermodynamic space spanned by entropy, energy, and temperature. We show how\nthese thermodynamic variables can be computed in terms of simple network\ncharacteristics, e.g., the total number of nodes and node degree statistics for\nnodes connected by edges. We apply the resulting thermodynamic characterization\nto real-world time-varying networks representing complex systems in the\nfinancial and biological domains. The study demonstrates that the method\nprovides an efficient tool for detecting abrupt changes and characterizing\ndifferent stages in network evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 12:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}
