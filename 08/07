These NL interfaces have the ability to\nconstruct SPARQL queries based on NL user queries. However, most efforts were\nrestricted to queries expressed in English, and they often benefited from the\nadvancement of English NLP tools. However, little research has been done to\nsupport querying the Arabic content on the Semantic Web by using NL queries.\nThis paper presents a domain-independent approach to translate Arabic NL\nqueries to SPARQL by leveraging linguistic analysis. Based on a special\nconsideration on Noun Phrases (NPs), our approach uses a language parser to\nextract NPs and the relations from Arabic parse trees and match them to the\nunderlying ontology. It then utilizes knowledge in the ontology to group NPs\ninto triple-based representations. A SPARQL query is finally generated by\nextracting targets and modifiers, and interpreting them into SPARQL. The\ninterpretation of advanced semantic features including negation, conjunctive\nand disjunctive modifiers is also supported. The approach was evaluated by\nusing two datasets consisting of OWL test data and queries, and the obtained\nresults have confirmed its feasibility to translate Arabic NL queries to\nSPARQL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 16:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-07"}

One of the oldest and best-studied interdiction problems is\nminimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction. Here, an undirected multigraph with\nnonnegative edge weights and positive interdiction costs on its edges is given,\ntogether with a positive budget B. The goal is to find a subset of edges R,\nwhose total interdiction cost does not exceed B, such that removing R leads to\na graph where the weight of an MST is as large as possible. Frederickson and\nSolis-Oba (SODA 1996) presented an O(log m)-approximation for MST interdiction,\nwhere m is the number of edges. Since then, no further progress has been made\nregarding approximations, and the question whether MST interdiction admits an\nO(1)-approximation remained open.\n  We answer this question in the affirmative, by presenting a 14-approximation\nthat overcomes two main hurdles that hindered further progress so far.\nMoreover, based on a well-known 2-approximation for the metric traveling\nsalesman problem (TSP), we show that our O(1)-approximation for MST\ninterdiction implies an O(1)-approximation for a natural interdiction version\nof metric TSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 16:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-07"}

These form factors are functions of the\nsquared four-momentum transfer $Q^2$ between the electron and the proton. The\ntwo main classes of observables of this reaction are the scattering cross\nsection and polarization asymmetries, both of which are sensitive to the form\nfactors in different ways. When considering large momentum transfers,\ndouble-polarization observables offer superior sensitivity to the electric form\nfactor. This thesis reports the results of a new measurement of the ratio of\nthe electric and magnetic form factors of the proton at high momentum transfer\nusing the recoil polarization technique. A polarized electron beam was\nscattered from a liquid hydrogen target, transferring polarization to the\nrecoiling protons. These protons were detected in a magnetic spectrometer which\nwas used to reconstruct their kinematics, including their scattering angles and\nmomenta, and the position of the interaction vertex. A proton polarimeter\nmeasured the polarization of the recoiling protons by measuring the azimuthal\nasymmetry in the angular distribution of protons scattered in CH$_2$ analyzers.\nThe scattered electron was detected in a large-acceptance electromagnetic\ncalorimeter in order to suppress inelastic backgrounds. The measured ratio of\nthe transverse and longitudinal polarization components of the scattered proton\nis directly proportional to the ratio of form factors $G_E^p/G_M^p$.

However, the\napplication of Bayesian inference to systematically quantify the uncertainties\nin parameters, by means of exploring posterior probability density functions\n(PPDFs), has been hindered by the prohibitively daunting computational cost\nassociated with the large number of model executions, in addition to daunting\ncomputation time per one turbulence simulation. In this effort, we perform in\nthis paper an adaptive hierarchical sparse grid surrogate modeling approach to\nBayesian inference of large eddy simulation (LES). First, an adaptive\nhierarchical sparse grid surrogate for the output of forward models is\nconstructed using a relatively small number of model executions. Using such\nsurrogate, the likelihood function can be rapidly evaluated at any point in the\nparameter space without simulating the computationally expensive LES model.\nThis method is essentially similar to those developed in [62] for geophysical\nand groundwater models, but is adjusted and applied here for a much more\nchallenging problem of uncertainty quantification of turbulence models. Through\na numerical demonstration of the Smagorinsky model of two-dimensional flow\naround a cylinder at sub-critical Reynolds number, our approach is proven to\nsignificantly reduce the number of costly LES executions without losing much\naccuracy in the posterior probability estimation. Here, the model parameters\nare calibrated against synthetic data related to the mean flow velocity and\nReynolds stresses at different locations in the flow wake. The influence of the\nuser-elected LES parameters on the quality of output data will be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 18:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-07"}

We\nconsider the governing equations for a partially ionized hydrogen-helium plasma\nin the single-fluid MHD approximation and include realistic wave damping\nmechanisms that may operate in the chromosphere, namely Ohmic and ambipolar\nmagnetic diffusion, viscosity, thermal conduction, and radiative losses. We\nperform an analytic local study in the limit of small amplitudes to\napproximately derive the lengthscales for critical damping and efficient\ndissipation of MHD wave energy. We find that the critical dissipation\nlengthscale for Alfv\\'en waves depends strongly on the magnetic field strength\nand ranges from 10~m to 1~km for realistic field strengths. The damping of\nAlfv\\'en waves is dominated by Ohmic diffusion for weak magnetic field and low\nheights in the chromosphere, and by ambipolar diffusion for strong magnetic\nfield and medium/large heights in the chromosphere. Conversely, the damping of\nslow magnetoacoustic waves is less efficient, and spatial scales shorter than\n10~m are required for critical damping. Thermal conduction and viscosity govern\nthe damping of slow magnetoacoustic waves and play an equally important role at\nall heights.

However, whether the Higgs\nmechanism is responsible for the generation of all the fermion masses, in\nparticular, the fermions of the first two generations, is an open question. In\nthis letter we present a construction where the light fermion masses are\ngenerated through a secondary, subdominant and sequestered source of EWSB. This\nfits well with the approximate U(2) global symmetry of the observed structure\nof the flavor sector. We first realize the above idea using a calculable two\nHiggs doublet model. We then show that the first two generation masses could\ncome from technicolor dynamics, while the third generation fermions, as well as\nthe electroweak gauge bosons get their masses dominantly from the Higgs\nmechanism. We also discuss how the small CKM mixing between the first two\ngenerations and the third generation, and soft mixing between the sequestered\nEWSB components arise in this setup. A typical prediction of this scenario is a\nsignificant reduction of the couplings of the observed Higgs boson to the first\ntwo generation of fermions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 19:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 20:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

During their\ngrowth, axons often face complex decisions that are difficult to understand\nwhen observing just a small part of the problem. In this work we propose a\ncomputational model of AG based on activity-independent mechanisms that takes\ninto account the most important aspects of AG.\n  The model includes the main elements (neurons, with soma, axon and growth\ncone; glial cells acting as guideposts) and mechanisms (attraction/repulsion\nguidance cues, growth cone adaptation, tissue-gradient intersections, axonal\ntransport, changes in the growth cone complexity and a range of responses for\neach receptor). The growth cone guidance is defined as a function that maps the\nreceptor activation by ligands into a repulsive or attractive force. This force\nis then converted into a turn- ing angle using spherical coordinates. A\nregulatory network between the receptors and the intracellular proteins is\nconsidered, leading to more complex and realistic behaviors. The ligand\ndiffusion through the extracellular environment is modeled with linear or\nexponential functions. Concerning experimentation, it was developed the first\ncomputational model and a new theoretical model of the midline crossing of\nDrosophila axons that focus all the decision points. The computational model\ncreated allows describing to a great extent the behaviors that have been\nreported in the literature, for three different pathfinding scenarios: (i)\nnormal, (ii) comm mutant and (iii) robo mutant. Moreover, this model suggests\nnew hypotheses, being the most relevant the existence of an inhibitory link\nbetween the DCC receptor and the Comm protein that is Netrin-mediated or\nmediated by a third unknown signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 20:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-10"}

These measurements are compared with the predictions from a Leaky\nBox propagation model. It is found that above ~50-100 MeV/nuc the spectra of\nall the nuclei, H, He, C, O, Ne, Mg, Si and Fe are well connected between 100\nMeV/nuc and 10 GeV/nuc and above by simple source rigidity spectra proportional\nto P-2.28, with the exponent independent of rigidity and using a rigidity\ndependent diffusion coefficient ~P0.50 above ~1.0 GV. This leads to intensities\nand spectra ~P-2.78 at ~100 GeV/nuc and above, which are consistent with new\nAMS-2 and PAMELA measurements of H, He and C to within + 10%.\n  Below 50-100 MeV the spectra of these primary charges fall into two groups.\nThe spectra of primary nuclei with Z > 6 fall more rapidly at low energies than\nthose of H and He and more rapidly than would be expected from a pure diffusive\nLBM, where energy loss by ionization is important at low energies. Increasing\nthe fraction of ionized hydrogen in the interstellar medium from 15% to 30%\ndoes not satisfactorily explain the systematics of the intensity decreases of\nthe heavier primary nuclei at low energies. Other processes beyond those\nassumed in a simple leaky box model, such as a lack of cosmic ray sources near\nthe Sun are being investigated as the source of this more rapid intensity\ndecrease of these nuclei.\n  The spectra of H and He are very similar to each other but both contain more\nlow energy particles than would be expected from a correspondence with the\nheavier nuclei spectra. We believe that this may indicate the presence of a\nlocal (heliospheric) component of these nuclei in addition to the galactic\ncomponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2015 21:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-10"}

The existence of these invariants is linked to the\ninability of non-symmorphic crystals to host band insulating ground states\nexcept at special fillings.

We complement this earlier work by\ndeveloping digital tracking methodology for detecting asteroids using\nlarge-format CCD imagers. We demonstrate that the technique enables the\nground-based detection of large numbers of new faint asteroids. Our methodology\nresolves or circumvents all major obstacles to the large-scale application of\ndigital tracking for finding main belt and near-Earth asteroids. We find that\nfor both asteroid populations, digital tracking can deliver a factor of ten\nimprovement over conventional searches. Digital tracking has long been standard\npractice for deep Kuiper Belt surveys, but even there our methodology enables\ndeeper integrations than have yet been attempted. Our search for main belt\nasteroids using a one-degree imager on the 0.9m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak\nvalidates our methodology, delivers sensitivity to asteroids in a regime\npreviously probed only with 4-meter and larger instruments, and leads to the\ndetection of 156 previously unknown asteroids and 59 known objects in a single\nfield. Digital tracking has the potential to revolutionize searches for faint\nmoving objects ranging from the Kuiper Belt through main belt and near-Earth\nasteroids, and perhaps even anthropogenic space debris in low Earth orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 04:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Annual and monthly\naverages of the surface temperature and wind components were considered. We\nshow that different definitions of the anomaly results in different conclusions\nregarding the variance of the ensemble members. However, some features of the\nuncertainty are common to all the measures we considered. We found that over\ndecadal time scales, there is no considerable increase in the uncertainty with\ntime. The model variability is more sensitive to the annual cycle than the\ninternal variability. This, in turn, results in a maximal uncertainty during\nthe winter in the northern hemisphere. The uncertainty of the surface\ntemperature prediction is dominated by the model variability, whereas the\nuncertainty of the wind components is determined by both sources. Analysis of\nthe spatial distribution of the uncertainty reveals that the surface\ntemperature has higher variability over land and in high latitudes, whereas the\nsurface zonal wind has higher variability over the ocean. The relative\nimportance of the internal and model variabilities depends on the averaging\nperiod, the definition of the anomaly, and the location.

For avoiding the problem like interference and\nmaintaining the constant network performance or increasing the performance the\nWMN need to consider the packet aggregation and packet forwarding. Packet\naggregation is process of collecting several packets ready for transmission and\nsending them to the intended recipient through the channel, while the packet\nforwarding holds the hop-by-hop routing.

It is well established that the strong DEA efficiency is both\nnecessary and sufficient for achieving the Pareto efficiency. For the weak\nPareto efficiency, however, the weak DEA efficiency is only sufficient, but not\nnecessary in general. Therefore, a DEA-inefficient DMU can be either weakly\nPareto efficient or Pareto inefficient. Motivated by this fact, we propose a\nnew classification of DMUs in terms of both DEA and Pareto efficiencies. To\nmake this classification, we first demonstrate that the Farrell efficiency is\nbased on the notion of FGL dominance. Based on the concept of dominance, we\nthen propose and substantiate an alternative single-stage method.

Such hardening leads to the slow drift in time of the gel\nelastic modulus $G'$ towards ever larger values, and thus to an erroneous\nestimate of $G'$. As an alternative, we show that imposing a constant normal\nforce equals to zero during the gelation, instead of a constant gap width,\nsuppresses the hardening as the decrease of the gap compensates for the sample\ncontraction. Using normal force controlled rheology, we then investigate the\nimpact of thermal history on 1.5\\% wt. agar gels. We show that neither the\nvalue of the cooling rate, nor the introduction of a constant temperature stage\nduring the cooling process influence the gel elastic properties. Instead, $G'$\nonly depends on the terminal temperature reached at the end of the cooling\nramp, as confirmed by direct imaging of the gel microstructure by cryoelectron\nmicroscopy. The present work offers an extensive review of the technical\ndifficulties associated with the rheology of hydrogels and paves the way for a\nsystematic use of normal force controlled rheology to monitor non-isochoric\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 13:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 16:28:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 23:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

A number of authors have analysed\nthe security of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, but whether OpenID Connect is secure in\npractice remains an open question. We report on a large-scale practical study\nof Google's implementation of OpenID Connect, involving forensic examination of\n103 RP websites which support its use for sign-in. Our study reveals serious\nvulnerabilities of a number of types, all of which allow an attacker to log in\nto an RP website as a victim user. Further examination suggests that these\nvulnerabilities are caused by a combination of Google's design of its OpenID\nConnect service and RP developers making design decisions which sacrifice\nsecurity for simplicity of implementation. We also give practical\nrecommendations for both RPs and OPs to help improve the security of real world\nOpenID Connect systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 14:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-10"}

Fiber bundles provide a\ngood framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number\nscaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and\ngeometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce\na new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1)\ninvariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling\nfield. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to\naffect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on\nflat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates\nfor the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics\nrestricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to\nzero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no\nrestrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does\nnot affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another.\nHowever it does affect the assignment of numerical values to the outputs of\ncomputations or measurements.

A trend affects individuals'\nbehavior while individuals' behavior creates a trend.\n  To analyze such a complex interplay between local- and global-scale\nphenomena, I generalize the standard threshold model by introducing a new type\nof node, called \\textit{global nodes} (or \\textit{trend followers}), whose\nactivation probability depends on a global-scale trend; specifically the\npercentage of activated nodes in the population. The model shows that global\nnodes play a role as accelerating cascades once a trend emerges while reducing\nthe probability of a trend emerging.

The\ndegree of homogeneity of a mixed fluid may be characterized by the Kolmogorov\nmicro-scale. The smaller its value, the better homogeneity. The micro-scale\nscales inversely with the fourth root of the energy dissipation rate in the\nstirring process. The higher this rate, the smaller lambda, and the better the\nhomogeneity in the reactor. This is true for Newtonian fluids. In non-Newtonian\nfluids the situation is different. For instance, in shear-thickening fluids it\nis plausible that high shear rates thicken the fluid and might strangle the\nmixing. The internal interactions between different fluid-mechanical and\ncolloidal variables are subtle, namely due to the (until recently) very limited\nunderstanding of turbulence. Starting from a qualitatively new turbulence\ntheory for inviscid fluids [Baumert, 2013], giving e.g. the Karman constant as\n$(2\\pi)^{-1/2} = 0.40$ [the super-pipe in Princeton gave 0.40 p/m 0.02, Bailey\net al., 2014], we generalize this approach to the case of viscous fluids and\nderive equations which in the steady state exhibit two solutions. One solution\nbranch describes a state of good mixing, the other a state of strangled\nturbulence. The physical system cannot be in two different steady states at the\nsame time. But it is physically admissible to switch between the two steady\nstates by non-stationary transitions, maybe in a chaotic fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 11:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}
