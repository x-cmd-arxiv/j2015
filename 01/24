The automaton's evolution is based on an attack rule that is applied\nsimultaneously to all its cells.

It is shown that this\nnotion of integrability amounts to the annihilator of the nilpotent algebra\nbeing contained in a Cartan subalgebra of the dynamics.

The\nmean radius of the rings is (324 +/- 10) km. One can use the rotational\nlightcurve amplitude of Chiron at different epochs to distinguish between the\ntwo solutions for the pole. Both imply lower lightcurve amplitude in 2013 than\nin 1988, when the rotational lightcurve was first determined. We derived\nChiron's rotational lightcurve in 2013 from observations at the 1.23-m CAHA\ntelescope and indeed its amplitude is smaller than in 1988.

In the proposed ring, the cross-sections for collisions\nbetween hydrogen, the most abundant atom in the universe, with any atom or\nmolecule that can be put in a beam, including He, H$_2$, CO, ammonia and OH can\nbe measured at energies below 100 K. We discuss the possibility to use optical\ntransitions to load hydrogen atoms into the ring without influencing the atoms\nthat are already stored. In this way it will be possible to reach high\ndensities of stored hydrogen atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 19:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

The absence of these channels in the closely related, but\ntopologically trivial insulator Bi13Pt3I7 corroborates the channels'\ntopological nature. The backscatter-free electron channels are a direct\nconsequence of Bi14Rh3I9's structure, a stack of 2D topologically insulating,\ngraphene-like planes separated by trivial insulators.

In particular, each KAM\ninvariant curve has stable and unstable smooth 2-dimensional invariant\nmanifolds being Lagrangian. The related stable and unstable manifolds of $W^c$\nare 3-dimensional smooth manifolds which are supposed to be transverse along\nhomoclinic orbit $\\Gamma$. One of our theorems presents conditions under which\neach KAM invariant curve on $W^c$ in a sufficiently small neighborhood of\n$\\Gamma$ has four transverse homoclinic orbits. Another result ensures that\nunder some Birkhoff genericity assumption for the restriction of $f$ on $W^c$\nsaddle periodic orbits in resonance zones also have homoclinic orbits though\nits transversality or tangency cannot be verified directly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 20:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth.

This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth. As a result, the currently available planet\nradius and metallicity data for solar-metallicity F and G stars give no reason\nto expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines\nwhether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The variations of all the strong\nemission lines lag behind those of the continuum, with He II 1640 lagging\nbehind the continuum by ~2.5 days and Lyman alpha 1215, C IV 1550, and Si IV\n1400 lagging by ~5-6 days. The relationship between the continuum and emission\nlines is complex. In particular, during the second half of the campaign, all\nemission-line lags increased by a factor of 1.3-2 and differences appear in the\ndetailed structure of the continuum and emission-line light curves.\nVelocity-resolved cross-correlation analysis shows coherent structure in lag\nversus line-of-sight velocity for the emission lines; the high-velocity wings\nof C IV respond to continuum variations more rapidly than the line core,\nprobably indicating higher velocity BLR clouds at smaller distances from the\ncentral engine. The velocity-dependent response of Lyman alpha, however, is\nmore complex and will require further analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 21:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 22:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) are used to probe the distant\nuniverse and are therefore important for galaxy evolution studies and for\nproviding clues to the nature of the epoch of reionization, but the exact\ncircumstances under which Lyman alpha escapes a galaxy are still not fully\nunderstood.\n  Aims. The Trident project is designed to simultaneously examine Lyman alpha,\nH-alpha and Lyman Continuum emission from galaxies at redshift z~2, thus\nlinking together these three aspects of ionising radiation in galaxies. In this\npaper, we outline the strategy of this project and examine the properties of\nLAEs in the GOODS North field.\n  Methods. We performed a narrowband LAE survey in GOODS North using existing\nand two custom made filters at the Nordic Optical Telescope with MOSCA. We use\ncomplementary broad band archival data in the field to make a careful candidate\nselection and perform optical to near-IR SED fitting. We also estimate\nfar-infrared luminosities by matching our candidates to detections in\nSpitzer/MIPS 24{\\mu}m and Herschel/PACS catalogs.\n  Results. We find a total of 25 LAE candidates, probing mainly the bright end\nof the LAE luminosity function with L_Ly {\\alpha} ~ 1-15e42 erg/s. They display\na range of masses of ~0.5-50e9 M_solar, and average ages from a few tens of Myr\nto 1 Gyr when assuming a constant star formation history.

Three candidates\nhave counterparts in the GOODS-Herschel far-IR catalogue, with luminosities\nconsistent with ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).\n  Conclusions. The wide range of parameters derived from our SED fitting, as\nwell as part of our sample being detected as ULIRGs, seems to indicate that at\nthese Lyman alpha luminosities, LAEs do not necessarily have to be young\ndwarfs, and that a lack of dust is not required for Lyman alpha to escape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 09:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 12:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

It is well-acknowledged that the\nestimation of the noise-clutter covariance matrix is a fundamental step in\nadaptive radar detection. In this paper, we consider regularized estimation\nmethods which force by construction the eigenvalues of the scatter estimates to\nbe greater than a positive regularization parameter rho. This makes them more\nsuitable for high dimensional problems with a limited number of secondary data\nsamples than traditional sample covariance estimates. While an increase of rho\nseems to improve the conditioning of the estimate, it might however cause it to\nsignificantly deviate from the true covariance matrix. The setting of the\noptimal regularization parameter is a difficult question for which no\nconvincing answers have thus far been provided. This constitutes the major\nmotivation behind our work. More specifically, we consider the design of the\nANMF detector for two kinds of regularized estimators, namely the regularized\nsample covariance matrix (RSCM), appropriate when the clutter follows a\nGaussian distribution and the regularized Tyler estimator (RTE) for\nnon-Gaussian spherically invariant distributed clutters. Based on recent random\nmatrix theory results studying the asymptotic fluctuations of the statistics of\nthe ANMF detector when the number of samples and their dimension grow together\nto infinity, we propose a design for the regularization parameter that\nmaximizes the detection probability under constant false alarm rates.\nSimulation results which support the efficiency of the proposed method are\nprovided in order to illustrate the gain of the proposed optimal design over\nconventional settings of the regularization parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 11:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 13:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

The main reason is that many of the NS in these systems appear to be\nspinning well below their Keplerian breakup frequency, and it has been\nsuggested that torques associated with GW emission may be setting the observed\nspin period. This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to\nassess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal.

The 3LAC includes 1591 AGNs\nlocated at high Galactic latitudes (|b|>10{\\deg}), a 71% increase over the\nsecond catalog based on 2 years of data. There are 28 duplicate associations,\nthus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3FGL catalog are\nAGNs. Most of them (98%) are blazars. About half of the newly detected blazars\nare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficient\nquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. Based on their\ngamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split between\nflat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and BL~Lacs. The most abundant detected\nBL~Lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) type. About 50% of the BL~Lacs\nhave no measured redshifts. A few new rare outliers (HSP-FSRQs and\nhigh-luminosity HSP BL~Lacs) are reported. The general properties of the 3LAC\nsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. The fraction of 3LAC\nblazars in the total population of blazars listed in BZCAT remains\nnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the BZCAT-blazar radio, optical and\nX-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazars\ncould eventually shine in gamma rays at LAT-detection levels.

Using this redshift, we find M_U_peak = -21.05 +0.10 -0.09 for\nthe peak, rest-frame U-band absolute magnitude, and find DES13S2cmm to be\nlocated in a faint, low metallicity (sub-solar), low stellar-mass host galaxy\n(log(M/M_sun) = 9.3 +/- 0.3); consistent with what is seen for other SLSNe-I.\nWe compare the bolometric light curve of DES13S2cmm to fourteen similarly\nwell-observed SLSNe-I in the literature and find it possesses one of the\nslowest declining tails (beyond +30 days rest frame past peak), and is the\nfaintest at peak.

While the\nresearch findings are useful to guide urban governance and planning in Beijing,\nthe methods developed in this paper can be applied to understand travel\npatterns elsewhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 05:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}
