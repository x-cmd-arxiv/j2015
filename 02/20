For a system of Gaussian fermions, the fermionic analog of linear\nor Gaussian optics, these dynamics can be elegantly and efficiently described\nby evolution of the system's covariance matrix. Taking both system and bath to\nbe Gaussian fermionic, we observe that decoherence occurs at a rate that is\nindependent of the bath temperature. Furthermore, we also consider a weak\ncoupling regime where the dynamics are Markovian. We present a microscopic\nderivation of Markovian master equations entirely in the language of covariance\nmatrices, where temperature independence remains manifest.

This work investigates the potential of using the wavelength-dependence\nof galaxy structural parameters (S\\'ersic index, n, and effective radius, Re)\nto separate galaxies into distinct types. Methods. A sample of nearby galaxies\nwith reliable visual morphologies is considered, for which we measure\nstructural parameters by fitting multi-wavelength single-S\\'ersic models.\nAdditionally, we use a set of artificially redshifted galaxies to test how\nthese classifiers behave when the signal-to-noise decreases. Results. We show\nthat the wavelength-dependence of n may be employed to separate\nvisually-classified early- and late-type galaxies, in a manner similar to the\nuse of colour and n. Furthermore, we find that the wavelength variation of n\ncan recover galaxies that are misclassified by these other morphological\nproxies. Roughly half of the spiral galaxies that contaminate an early-type\nsample selected using (u-r) versus n can be correctly identified as late-types\nby N, the ratio of n measured in two different bands. Using a set of\nartificially-redshifted images, we show that this technique remains effective\nup to z ~ 0.1. N can therefore be used to achieve purer samples of early-types\nand more complete samples of late-types than using a colour-n cut alone. We\nalso study the suitability of R, the ratio of Re in two different bands, as a\nmorphological classifier, but find that the average sizes of both early- and\nlate-type galaxies do not change substantially over optical wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 17:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In order to get our result we use the\nindifference principle fulfilled by any Nash equilibrium, and the classical KKT\nconditions (in the vector setting), that are necessary conditions for Pareto\nefficiency.

In reality, all systems have a finite size and are prepared at non-zero\ntemperature; the condensate has then a finite coherence time, even when the\nsystem is isolated in its evolution and the particle number $N$ is fixed. The\nloss of phase memory is due to interactions of the condensate with the excited\nmodes that constitute a dephasing environment. This fundamental effect, crucial\nfor applications using the condensate of pairs' macroscopic coherence, was\nscarcely studied. We link the coherence time to the condensate phase dynamics,\nand we show with a microscopic theory that the time derivative of the\ncondensate phase operator $\\hat{\\theta}\\_0$ is proportional to a chemical\npotential operator that we construct including both the pair-breaking and\npair-motion excitation branches.

We show that the emergence of SSA activity\nis linked to spectral properties of the asymmetric synaptic weight matrix. In\nparticular, the leading eigenvalues that dictate the slow dynamics exhibit a\ngap with respect to the bulk of the spectrum, and the associated Schur vectors\nexhibit a measure of block-localization on groups of neurons, thus resulting in\ncoherent dynamical activity on those groups. Through simple rate models, we\ngain analytical understanding of the origin and importance of the spectral gap,\nand use these insights to develop new network topologies with alternative\nconnectivity paradigms which also display SSA activity. Specifically, SSA\ndynamics involving excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be achieved by\nmodifying the connectivity patterns between both types of neurons. We also show\nthat SSA activity can occur at multiple timescales reflecting a hierarchy in\nthe connectivity, and demonstrate the emergence of SSA in small-world like\nnetworks.

These magnets are finite in size and contain very\nlarge spins. They are interesting because they possess macroscopic quantum\ntunneling of N\\'eel vectors. For antiferromagnetic molecular nanomagnets with\nfinite number of even-numbered coupled spins, tunneling involves two classical\nlocalized N\\'eel ground states separated by a magnetic energy barrier. The\nquestion is: can such phenomena be observed in nano magnets with odd number of\nmagnetic ions? The answer is not directly obvious because cyclic chains with\nodd-numbered coupled spins are frustrated as one cannot obtain a perfect N\\'eel\norder. These frustrated spins can indeed be observed experimentally, so they\nare of interest. In this Letter, we theoretically investigate macroscopic\nquantum tunneling in these odd spin systems with arbitrary spins $s$, in the\npresence of a magnetic field applied along the plane of the magnet. In contrast\nto systems with an even-numbered coupled spins, the ground state of the cyclic\nodd-spin system contains a topological soliton due to spin frustration. Thus\nthe classical ground state is $2N$-fold degenerate as the soliton can be placed\nanywhere along the ring with total $S_z=\\pm s$. Small quantum fluctuations\ndelocalize the soliton with a formation of an energy band. We obtain this\nenergy band using degenerate perturbation theory at order $2s$. We show that\nthe soliton ground state is chiral for half-odd integer spins and non-chiral\nfor integer spins. From the structure of the energy band we infer that as the\nvalue of the spin increases the inelastic polarized neutron-scattering\nintensity may increase or decrease depending on the strengths of the parameters\nof the Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 19:54:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 14:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 17:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 17:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 19:29:47 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 18:13:08 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 15:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 16:07:05 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 11:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

Altmetrics, short for\nalternative (to citation) metrics -- and as such a misnomer -- refers to a new\ngroup of metrics based (largely) on social media events relating to scholarly\ncommunication. As current definitions of altmetrics are shaped and limited by\nactive platforms, technical possibilities, and business models of aggregators\nsuch as Altmetric.com, ImpactStory, PLOS, and Plum Analytics, and as such\nconstantly changing, this work refrains from defining an umbrella term for\nthese very heterogeneous new metrics.

These\nactivities occur in the context of social media, such as discussing on Twitter\nor saving to Mendeley, as well as downloading and citing. The framework groups\nvarious types of acts into three categories -- accessing, appraising, and\napplying -- and provides examples of actions that lead to visibility and\ntraceability online. To improve the understanding of the acts, which result in\nonline events from which metrics are collected, select citation and social\ntheories are used to interpret the phenomena being measured. Citation theories\nare used because the new metrics based on these events are supposed to replace\nor complement citations as indicators of impact.

Similar properties have been argued to arise for Little String\nTheories and M-theory. For such theories, the notion of micro-causality and the\ntime ordering used to define the S-matrix and correlation functions must be\nmodified, and we give a Lorentz invariant prescription for how this can be\nachieved.

After careful data reduction and\nstacking analysis, we conduct a radially resolved pixel SED fitting to obtain\nthe radial distributions of the stellar mass and rest-frame colors. The stellar\nmass of MWs increases in self-similar way, irrespective of the radial distance,\nwhile that of MGs grows in inside-out way where they obtain ~ 75% of the total\nmass at outer (> 2.5 kpc) radius since z ~ 2. Although the radial mass profiles\nevolve in distinct ways, the formation and quenching of the central dense\nregion (or bulge) ahead of the outer disk formation are found to be common for\nboth systems. The sudden reddening of bulge at z ~ 1.6 and z ~ 2.4 for MWs and\nMGs, respectively, suggests the formation of bulge and would give a clue to the\ndifferent gas accretion histories and quenching. A new approach to evaluate the\nmorphological diversity is conducted by using the average surface density\nprofile and its dispersion. The variety of the radial mass profiles for MGs\npeaks at higher redshift (z > 2.8), and then rapidly converges to more uniform\nshape at z < 1.5, while that for MWs remains in the outer region over the\nredshift. Compared with the observed star formation rates and color profiles,\nthe evolution of variety is consistently explained by the star formation\nactivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 21:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 02:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The most fundamental\nmetric used to measure how \"random\" a hash function or a random number\ngenerator is, is its independence: a sequence of random variables is said to be\n$k$-independent if every variable is uniform and every size $k$ subset is\nindependent. In this paper we consider three classic algorithms under limited\nindependence. We provide new bounds for randomized quicksort, min-wise hashing\nand largest bucket size under limited independence. Our results can be\nsummarized as follows.\n  -Randomized quicksort. When pivot elements are computed using a\n$5$-independent hash function, Karloff and Raghavan, J.ACM'93 showed $O ( n\n\\log n)$ expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort.\nWe improve upon this, showing that the same running time is achieved with only\n$4$-independence.\n  -Min-wise hashing. For a set $A$, consider the probability of a particular\nelement being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that\n$5$-independence implies the optimal probability $O (1 /n)$. Broder et al.,\nSTOC'98 showed that $2$-independence implies it is $O(1 / \\sqrt{|A|})$. We show\na matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for $3$- and $4$-independent\nhash functions.\n  -Largest bucket. We consider the case where $n$ balls are distributed to $n$\nbuckets using a $k$-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket\nsize. Alon et. al, STOC'97 showed that there exists a $2$-independent hash\nfunction implying a bucket of size $\\Omega ( n^{1/2})$.

The Fisher information\nmatrix has been the standard tool for GW parameter estimation in the last two\ndecades.

For example, the Fisher matrix approach sometimes\npredicts errors of $\\geq100\\%$ in the estimation of parameters such as the\nluminosity distance and sky position. With advances in computing power,\nBayesian inference is beginning to replace the Fisher matrix approximation in\nparameter estimation studies.

Despite their extreme\nsimplicity, these systems have been shown to cooperatively perform complex\ncomputational tasks, such as simulating register machines to compute standard\narithmetic functions. The election of a unique leader agent is a key\nrequirement in such computational constructions. Yet, the fastest currently\nknown population protocol for electing a leader only has linear stabilization\ntime, and, it has recently been shown that no population protocol using a\nconstant number of states per node may overcome this linear bound.\n  In this paper, we give the first population protocol for leader election with\npolylogarithmic stabilization time, using polylogarithmic memory states per\nnode. The protocol structure is quite simple: each node has an associated\nvalue, and is either a leader (still in contention) or a minion (following some\nleader). A leader keeps incrementing its value and \"defeats\" other leaders in\none-to-one interactions, and will drop from contention and become a minion if\nit meets a leader with higher value. Importantly, a leader also drops out if it\nmeets a minion with higher absolute value. While these rules are quite simple,\nthe proof that this algorithm achieves polylogarithmic stabilization time is\nnon-trivial. In particular, the argument combines careful use of concentration\ninequalities with anti-concentration bounds, showing that the leaders' values\nbecome spread apart as the execution progresses, which in turn implies that\nstraggling leaders get quickly eliminated. We complement our analysis with\nempirical results, showing that our protocol stabilizes extremely fast, even\nfor large network sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 23:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2017 17:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 17:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

The key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:\nWhat are exoplanets made of? Why are planets as they are? What causes the\nexceptional diversity observed as compared to the Solar System?\n  EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory) has been designed as a\ndedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable of\nobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year mission\nlifetime. EChO can target the atmospheres of super-Earths, Neptune-like, and\nJupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures\nof 300K-3000K) of F to M-type host stars. Over the next ten years, several new\nground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS,\nTESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.\nThe current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be further\noptimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric\ncharacterisation of hundreds of planets. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a\ncold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard to\nallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed over\nthe sky. A 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary\nspectro-photometric precision. The spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16\nmicron) and SNR to be achieved by EChO, thanks to its high stability and\ndedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmospheric\ncomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 23:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

At higher doses, nanocrystalline graphene rapidly\nloses its conductance and at doses over 2e15 cm-2 becomes actually insulating.\nAnnealing in vacuum restores conductance of the irradiated nanocrystalline\ngraphene and, if the irradiation has not exceeded a dose of 3e15 cm-2, this\nrestoration can be complete.

The present work is part of the IRAM\nLarge Programme ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM), which makes use of\nunbiased broadband spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths. We detected HNCO\nin all the sources and NH2CHO in five of them. We derived their abundances and\nanalysed them together with those reported in the literature for high-mass\nsources. For those sources with formamide detection, we found a tight and\nalmost linear correlation between HNCO and NH2CHO abundances, with their ratio\nbeing roughly constant -between 3 and 10- across 6 orders of magnitude in\nluminosity. This suggests the two species are chemically related. The sources\nwithout formamide detection, which are also the coldest and devoid of hot\ncorinos, fall well off the correlation, displaying a much larger amount of HNCO\nrelative to NH2CHO. Our results suggest that, while HNCO can be formed in the\ngas phase during the cold stages of star formation, NH2CHO forms most\nefficiently on the mantles of dust grains at these temperatures, where it\nremains frozen until the temperature rises enough to sublimate the icy grain\nmantles. We propose hydrogenation of HNCO as a likely formation route leading\nto NH2CHO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 02:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We investigate\nthe ME of three dimensional massive Dirac electrons in a superconducting state\non the basis of Kubo formula, and clarify that Meissner kernel becomes finite\nby use of the inter-band contribution.

At the opposite\nextremity of the nilpotent cone, the closure of the minimal nilpotent orbit is\nalso an isolated symplectic singularity, called a minimal singularity. For\nclassical Lie algebras, Kraft and Procesi showed that these two types of\nsingularities suffice to describe all generic singularities of nilpotent orbit\nclosures: specifically, any such singularity is either a simple surface\nsingularity, a minimal singularity, or a union of two simple surface\nsingularities of type $A_{2k-1}$.

This is due to additional cost of BFT in\nterms of resources, protocol complexity and performance, compared with crash\nfault-tolerance (CFT). This overhead of BFT comes from the assumption of a\npowerful adversary that can fully control not only the Byzantine faulty\nmachines, but at the same time also the message delivery schedule across the\nentire network, effectively inducing communication asynchrony and partitioning\notherwise correct machines at will. To many practitioners, however, such strong\nattacks appear irrelevant.\n  In this paper, we introduce cross fault tolerance or XFT, a novel approach to\nbuilding reliable and secure distributed systems and apply it to the classical\nstate-machine replication (SMR) problem. In short, an XFT SMR protocol provides\nthe reliability guarantees of widely used asynchronous CFT SMR protocols such\nas Paxos and Raft, but also tolerates Byzantine faults in combination with\nnetwork asynchrony, as long as a majority of replicas are correct and\ncommunicate synchronously. This allows the development of XFT systems at the\nprice of CFT (already paid for in practice), yet with strictly stronger\nresilience than CFT --- sometimes even stronger than BFT itself.\n  As a showcase for XFT, we present XPaxos, the first XFT SMR protocol, and\ndeploy it in a geo-replicated setting.

The evolution of the\nsystem is described by a \\textit{degenerating} Cahn-Hilliard equation for the\nconcentration, a doubly nonlinear differential inclusion for the damage\nvariable and a \\textit{degenerating} quasi-static balance equation for the\ndisplacement field. All these equations are highly nonlinearly coupled. Because\nof the doubly degenerating character of the system, the doubly nonlinear\ndifferential inclusion and the nonsmooth domain, the structure of the model is\nvery complex from an analytical point of view.\n  A novel approach is introduced for proving existence of weak solutions for\nsuch degenerating coupled system. To this end, we first establish a suitable\nnotion of weak solutions, which consists of weak formulations of the diffusion\nand the momentum balance equation, a variational inequality for the damage\nprocess and a total energy inequality. To show existence of weak solutions,\nseveral new ideas come into play. Various results on shrinking sets and its\ncorresponding local Sobolev spaces are used.

This paper presents, for the\nfirst time, interferometric millimetre-wavelength observations of these\nsources. The angular resolution of our observations, 1.8\", allowed us to\naccurately determine the positions of the target SMGs. Using a detection\nthreshold of S/N>4.5 regardless of multiwavelength counterpart association, and\n4<S/N<=4.5 if a multiwavelength counterpart within 1.5\" is also present, the\ntotal number of detections in our survey is 22. Three of our detected SMGs\n(AzTEC21, 27, and 28; which corresponds to 20%) are marginally resolved at our\nangular resolution, and these sources are found to have elongated or clumpy\nmorphologies and/or multiple components.

We find that the median redshift for the 15 brightest AzTEC SMGs\n($\\tilde{z}=3.05\\pm0.44$) is consistent with that for AzTEC16-30.

We find that this dissipative system has the ability to flow as a\nperfect fluid even though its entropy density does not match the equilibrium\nform. The non-equilibrium contribution to the entropy density is shown to be\ndue to higher order scalar moments (which possess no hydrodynamical\ninterpretation) of the Boltzmann equation that can remain out of equilibrium\nbut do not couple to the energy-momentum tensor of the system. Thus, in this\nsystem the slowly moving hydrodynamic degrees of freedom can exhibit true\nperfect fluidity while being totally decoupled from the fast moving,\nnon-hydrodynamical microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to entropy\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 14:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 11:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

These interactions affect the disk inclinations with respect to\nthe plane of motion. We formally de-rive a macroscopic model composed of planar\nSelf-Organized Hydrodynamic (SOH) models describing the transport of mass and\nevolution of mean direction of motion of the disks in each plane, supplemented\nwith transport equations for the mean disk inclination. These planar models are\ncoupled due to the interactions with the neighboring planes. Numerical\ncomparisons between the individual-based and macroscopic models are carried\nout. These models could be applicable, for instance, to describe sperm-cell\ncollective dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 17:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}

VByte decoding can be a performance bottleneck especially when\nthe unpredictable lengths of the encoded integers cause frequent branch\nmispredictions.
