A\nsurprisingly linear relationship is found: $ m_a^{(j)} + 0.4\\;m_a^{(p)} =\nm_a^{(jp)} $. Furthermore, another relationship is found concerning the measure\nof the total number of citations, $A_a$, i.e. the surface of the citation\nsize-rank histogram up to $m_a$. Another linear relationship exists :\n$A_a^{(j)} + 1.36\\; A_a^{(p)} = A_a^{(jp)} $. These empirical findings\ncoefficients (0.4 and 1.36) are supported by considerations based on an\nempirical power law found between the number of joint publications of an author\nand the rank of a coauthor. Moreover, a simple power law relationship is found\nbetween $m_a$ and the number ($r_M$) of coauthors of a LI: $m_a\\simeq\nr_M^{\\mu}$; the power law exponent $\\mu$ depends on the type ($j$ or $p$) of\npublications. These simple relations, at this time limited to publications in\nphysics, imply that coauthors are a \"more positive measure\" of a principal\ninvestigator role, in both types of scientific outputs, than the Hirsch index\ncould indicate. Therefore, to scorn upon co-authors in publications, in\nparticular in proceedings, is incorrect. On the contrary, the findings suggest\nan immediate test of coherence of scientific authorship in scientific policy\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 16:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

Irradiation of superconductors\nwith high-energy heavy ions can be used to create nanoscale defects that act as\ndeep pinning potentials for vortices. This approach holds unique promise for\nhigh current applications of iron-based superconductors because Jc\namplification persists to much higher radiation doses than in cuprate\nsuperconductors without significantly altering the superconducting critical\ntemperature. However, for these compounds virtually nothing is known about the\natomic scale interplay of the crystal damage from the high-energy ions, the\nsuperconducting order parameter, and the vortex pinning processes. Here, we\nvisualize the atomic-scale effects of irradiating FeSexTe1-x with 249 MeV Au\nions and find two distinct effects: compact nanometer-sized regions of crystal\ndisruption or 'columnar defects', plus a higher density of single atomic-site\n'point' defects probably from secondary scattering. We show directly that the\nsuperconducting order is virtually annihilated within the former while\nsuppressed by the latter. Simultaneous atomically-resolved images of the\ncolumnar crystal defects, the superconductivity, and the vortex configurations,\nthen reveal how a mixed pinning landscape is created, with the strongest\npinning occurring at metallic-core columnar defects and secondary pinning at\nclusters of pointlike defects, followed by collective pinning at higher fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 17:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

As part of a world-wide campaign coordinated by\nthe International Halley Watch (IHW), narrowband photometry was obtained with\ntelescopes at 18 observatories. Following submissions to and basic reductions\nby the Photometry and Polarimetry Network of the IHW, we computed production\nrates and created composite lightcurves for each species. These were used to\nmeasure how the apparent rotational period (~7.35 day), along with its shape,\nevolved with time during the apparition. The lightcurve shape systematically\nvaried from double-peaked to triple-peaked and back again every 8-9 weeks, due\nto Halley's non-principal axis (complex) rotation and the associated component\nperiods. Unexpectedly, we found a phase shift of one-half cycle also took place\nduring this interval, and therefore the actual beat frequency between the\ncomponent periods is twice this interval or 16-18 weeks. Preliminary modeling\nsuggests that a single source might produce the entire post-perihelion\nlightcurve variability and associated evolution. The detailed evolution of the\napparent period varied in a non-smooth manner between 7.2 and 7.6 day, likely\ndue to a combination of synodic effects and the interaction of solar\nillumination with isolated source regions on a body in complex rotation. The\nneed to simultaneously reproduce each of these characteristics will provide\nvery strong additional constraints on Halley's component periods associated\nwith its complex rotation. To assist in these and future analyses, we created a\nsynthetic lightcurve based directly on the measured data. We unexpectedly\ndiscovered a strong correlation of ion tail disconnection event start times\nwith minima in the comet's gas production, implying that a decrease in\noutgassing is another cause of these events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 17:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

The proposal is centered on maximizing the\nhypervolume indicator, thus converting the multi-objective problem into a\nsingle-objective one. The exploitation employs gradient-based methods, but\nconsidering a single candidate efficient solution at a time, to overcome\nlimitations associated with population-based approaches and also to allow an\neasy control of the number of solutions provided. There is an interchange\nbetween two steps. The first step is a deterministic local exploration, endowed\nwith an automatic procedure to detect stagnation. When stagnation is detected,\nthe search is switched to a second step characterized by a stochastic global\nexploration using an evolutionary algorithm. Using five ZDT benchmarks with 30\nvariables, the performance of the new algorithm is compared to state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for multi-objective optimization, more specifically NSGA-II, SPEA2,\nand SMS-EMOA. The solutions found by the H2MA guide to higher hypervolume and\nsmaller distance to the true Pareto frontier with significantly less function\nevaluations, even when the gradient is estimated numerically.

We identify 1723 clumps, 1056 (61%) of which are protostellar and 667\n(39%) starless. These clumps are found within 764 different IRDCs, 375 (49%) of\nwhich are only associated with protostellar clumps, 178 (23%) only with\nstarless clumps, and 211 (28%) with both categories of clumps. The clumps have\na median mass of 250 M_sun and range up to >10^4$ M_sun in mass and up to 10^5\nL_sun in luminosity. The mass-radius distribution shows that almost 30% of the\nstarless clumps identified in this survey could form high-mass stars, however\nthese massive clumps are confined in only ~4% of the IRDCs. Assuming a minimum\nmass surface density threshold for the formation of high-mass stars, the\ncomparison of the numbers of massive starless clumps and those already\ncontaining embedded sources suggests an upper limit lifetime for the starless\nphase of 10^5 years for clumps with a mass M>500 M_sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 20:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\nobservations further confirm that (1) the spectrum and flux of the central\nobject are consistent with a rotation-powered pulsar, (2) the non-thermal\nspectrum and morphology of the surrounding nebula are consistent with a pulsar\nwind and, (3) the spectrum at greater distances is consistent with thermal\nemission from the supernova remnant. The cometary shape of the nebula,\nsuggesting motion towards the southwest, appears to be subsonic: There is no\nevidence either spectrally or morphologically for a bow shock or contact\ndiscontinuity; the nearly circular ring is not distorted by motion through the\nambient medium; and the shape near the apex of the nebula is narrow.

The method is designed to\nallow image reconstruction for an extended number of transmitters and receivers\nin the presence noise and without plane wave approximation or otherwise\napproximation on the size or regularity of source and receiver functions. An\noverdetermined set of functions are formed from the Hadamard product between a\nGaussian function and a uniformly distributed random number set. It is shown\nthat this particular type of randomization tends to produce well-conditioned\nmatrices whose pseudoinverses may be determined without implementing relaxation\nmethods. When the inverted sets are applied to simulated first-order scattering\nfrom a Shepp-Logan phantom, successful image reconstructions are achieved for\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNR) as low as 1. Evaluation of the randomization\napproach is conducted by comparing condition numbers with other forms of signal\nrandomization.

In this paper, we want to detect communities of multiple\npartially aligned networks simultaneously, which is formally defined as the\n\"Mutual Clustering\" problem. The \"Mutual Clustering\" problem is very\nchallenging as it has two important issues to address: (1) how to preserve the\nnetwork characteristics in mutual community detection? and (2) how to utilize\nthe information in other aligned networks to refine and disambiguate the\ncommunity structures of the shared users? To solve these two challenges, a\nnovel community detection method, MCD (Mutual Community Detector), is proposed\nin this paper. MCD can detect social community structures of users in multiple\npartially aligned networks at the same time with full considerations of (1)\ncharacteristics of each network, and (2) information of the shared users across\naligned networks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world partially\naligned heterogeneous social networks demonstrate that MCD can solve the\n\"Mutual Clustering\" problem very well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 02:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We identify three main\nprocesses related to baryons -- adiabatic contraction, tidal disruption and\nreionization -- which jointly shape the dark matter distribution in both the\nmain halo and its subhalos. The relative effect of each baryonic process\ndepends strongly on the subhalo mass. For massive subhalos with maximum\ncircular velocity $v_{\\rm max} > 35 km/s$, adiabatic contraction increases the\ndark matter concentration, making these halos less susceptible to tidal\ndisruption. For low-mass subhalos with $v_{\\rm max} < 20 km/s$, reionization\neffectively reduces their mass on average by $\\approx$ 30% and $v_{\\rm max}$ by\n$\\approx$ 20%. For intermediate subhalos with $20 km/s < v_{\\rm max} < 35\nkm/s$, which share a similar mass range as the classical dwarf spheroidals,\nstrong tidal truncation induced by the main galaxy reduces their $v_{\\rm max}$.\nMoreover, the stellar disk of the main galaxy effectively depletes subhalos\nnear the central region. As a combined result of reionization and increased\ntidal disruption, the total number of low-mass subhalos in the hydrodynamic\nsimulation is nearly halved compared to that of the $\\textit{N-}$body\nsimulation. We do not find dark matter cores in dwarf galaxies, unlike previous\nstudies that employed bursty feedback-driven outflows.

Mapping-based assembly of RNA-seq reads sometimes is\ninfeasible due to lack of high-quality references. However, de novo assembly is\nvery challenging due to uneven expression levels among transcripts and also the\nread coverage variation within a single transcript. Existing methods either\napply de Bruijn graphs of single-sized k-mers to assemble the full set of\ntranscripts, or conduct multiple runs of assembly, but still apply graphs of\nsingle-sized k-mers at each run. However, a single k-mer size is not suitable\nfor all the regions of the transcripts with varied coverage. Contribution: This\npaper presents a de novo assembler Bermuda with new insights for handling\nuneven coverage. Opposed to existing methods that use a single k-mer size for\nall the transcripts in each run of assembly, Bermuda self-adaptively uses a few\nk-mer sizes to assemble different regions of a single transcript according to\ntheir local coverage. As such, Bermuda can deal with uneven expression levels\nand coverage not only among transcripts, but also within a single transcript.\nExtensive tests show that Bermuda outperforms popular de novo assemblers in\nreconstructing unevenly-expressed transcripts with longer length, better\ncontiguity and lower redundancy.

This gives a characterization of compact perturbation in\nterms of difference between the operator parts of perturbed and unperturbed\nsubspaces. It is shown that a self-adjoint subspace is still self-adjoint under\neither relatively bounded perturbation with relative bound less than one or\nrelatively compact perturbation or compact perturbation with a certain\nadditional condition. By using these results, invariance of essential spectra\nof self-adjoint subspaces is proved under relatively compact and compact\nperturbations, separately.

Differences in the\nbehavior of patchy particles (flowing over uniform collectors) relative to the\nreverse case of uniform particles (flowing over patchy collectors) are\nquantified. Because a particle rotates more slowly than it translates in the\nshear field near a collecting surface, the effective interaction time of a\npatch on a particle is larger than that of a patch on the collector, suggesting\ndistinct particle capture tendencies in each case. This paper presents a new\ncomputational approach to simulate the near-surface motion (rotation and\ntranslation) of particles having nanoscale surface heterogeneities flowing over\nuniform collectors. Small amounts of ~10 nm cationic patches randomly\ndistributed on a net-negative particle surface produced spatially varying DLVO\ninteractions that were computed via the Grid Surface Integration (GSI)\ntechnique and then combined with hydrodynamic forces in a mobility tensor\nformulation. Statistical analysis of simulated trajectories revealed fewer\nextrema in the fluctuating particle-collector separation of heterogeneous\nparticles, compared with the reverse system geometry of uniform particles\nflowing past a heterogeneous fixed surface.

It is very easy\nto recover the GW process from theGW tree as it is just the number of\nindividuals at each generation.

After a storage node fails, the lost data should be regenerated at a\nreplacement storage node as soon as possible to maintain the same level of\nredundancy. Minimizing such a regeneration time is critical to the reliability\nof distributed storage systems. Existing work commits to reduce the\nregeneration time by either minimizing the regenerating traffic, or adjusting\nthe regenerating traffic patterns, whereas nodes participating data\nregeneration are generally assumed to be given beforehand. However, such\nregeneration time also depends heavily on the selection of the participating\nnodes. Selecting different participating nodes actually involve different data\nlinks between the nodes. Real-world distributed storage systems usually exhibit\nheterogeneous link capacities. It is possible to further reduce the\nregeneration time via exploiting such link capacity differences and avoiding\nthe link bottlenecks.

We analyze the regeneration time and propose node selection\nalgorithms for overlay networks and real-world topologies. Considering that the\nflexible amount of data blocks from each provider may deeply influence the\nregeneration time, several techniques are designed to enhance our schemes in\noverlay networks.

To decouple the effect of the galaxy mass and of the environment in\ntheir statistical radio properties, we investigate the possible dependence of\nthe occurrence of radio loudness and of the fractional radio luminosity\nfunction on the dynamical state of the hosting cluster. We studied the radio\nproperties of the BCGs in the Extended GMRT Radio Halo Survey (EGRHS). We\nobtained a statistical sample of 59 BCGs, which was divided into two classes,\ndepending on the dynamical state of the host cluster, i.e. merging (M) and\nrelaxed (R). Among the 59 BCGs, 28 are radio-loud, and 31 are radio--quiet. The\nradio-loud sources are located favourably located in relaxed clusters (71\\%),\nwhile the reverse is true for the radio-quiet BCGs, mostly located in merging\nsystems (81\\%). The fractional radio luminosity function (RLF) for the BCGs is\nconsiderably higher for BCGs in relaxed clusters, where the total fraction of\nradio loudness reaches almost 90\\%, to be compared to the $\\sim$30\\% in merging\nclusters.

For the first time, the Cl/H ratios are computed by simply\nadding ionic abundances and not using an ionization correction factor (ICF). We\nuse a collection of published very deep spectra of Galactic HII regions. We\nhave re-calculated the physical conditions, ionic and total abundances of Cl\nand O using the same methodology and updated atomic data for all the objects.\nWe find that the slopes of the radial gradients of Cl and O are identical\nwithin the uncertainties: -0.043 dex/kpc. This is consistent with a lockstep\nevolution of both elements. We obtain that the mean value of the Cl/O ratio\nacross the Galactic disc is log(Cl/O) = -3.42 +/- 0.06. We compare our Cl/H\nratios with those determined from Cl++ abundances and using some available ICF\nschemes of the literature. We find that our total Cl abundances are always\nlower than the values determined using ICFs, indicating that those correction\nschemes systematically overestimate the contribution of Cl+ and Cl+++ species\nto the total Cl abundance. Finally, we propose an empirical ICF(Cl++) to\nestimate the Cl/H ratio in HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 10:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Recent calculations of this\nquantity, using a formula due to Kambersky, find that it is infinite for a\nperfect crystal owing to an intraband scattering term which is of third order\nin the spin-orbit parameter xi This surprising result conflicts with recent\nwork by Costa and Muniz who study damping numerically by direct calculation of\nthe dynamical transverse spin susceptibility in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling. We resolve this inconsistency by following the Costa-Muniz approach\nfor a slightly simplified model where it is possible to calculate alpha\nanalytically. We show that to second order in the spin-orbit parameter xi one\nretrieves the Kambersky result for alpha, but to higher order one does not\nobtain any divergent intraband terms. The present work goes beyond that of\nCosta and Muniz by pointing out the necessity of including the effect of\nlong-range Coulomb interaction in calculating damping for large xi. A direct\nderivation of the Kambersky formula is given which shows clearly the\nrestriction of its validity to second order in xi so that no intraband\nscattering terms appear. This restriction has an important effect on the\ndamping over a substantial range of impurity content and temperature.

A multi-scale analysis\nis performed in order to take into account that the velocity of the sediment\nlayer is smaller than the one of the fluid layer. This leads us to consider a\nshallow water type system for the fluid layer and a lubrication Reynolds\nequation for the sediment one. This deduction provides some improvements with\nrespect to the classical Saint-Venant-Exner model: (i) the deduced model has an\nassociated energy. Moreover, it allows us to explain why classical models do\nnot have an associated energy and how to modify them in order to recover a\nmodel with this property. (ii) The model incorporates naturally a necessary\nmodification that must be taken into account in order to be applied to\narbitrarily sloping beds. Furthermore, we show that this modification is\ndifferent of the ones considered classically, and that it coincides with a\nclassical one only if the solution has a constant free surface. (iii) The\ndeduced solid transport discharge naturally depends on the thickness of the\nmoving sediment layer, what allows to ensure sediment mass conservation.\nMoreover, we include a simplified version of the model for the case of\nquasi-stationary regimes.

In this paper we propose a model for weed\ncontrol that handles the allele frequency in a direct manner, grounded on the\nvery dynamics of the weed life cycle, with no need of a priori distributions\nnor the use of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The proposed model is individual\nbased, stochastic, and considers some phenomena like the relative fitnesses and\nmutation that are prominent in the resistance dynamics without herbicide. A\ncase study is presented for the herbicide nicosulfuron in a field with the weed\nBidens pilosa.

We\nconclude that in order to better constrain the properties of the DM subhalos,\nit is important to perform detailed measurements of the radio emission in the\nregions where the DM halos have their peaks, and that the separation of the\ncomplex radio halo in different subhalos is a promising technique to understand\nthe properties of each specific subhalo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 12:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

This makes it desirable to use methods which\nare robust with respect to perturbed or not well resolved domains, and which\nallow for efficient discretizations not resolving any fine detail of those\ngeometries. For forward problems in partial differential equations methods\nbased on diffuse interface representations gained strong attention in the last\nyears, but so far they have not been considered systematically for inverse\nproblems. In this work we introduce a diffuse domain method as a tool for the\nsolution of variational inverse problems. As a particular example we study ECG\ninversion in further detail. ECG inversion is a linear inverse source problem\nwith boundary measurements governed by an anisotropic diffusion equation, which\nnaturally cries for solutions under changing geometries, namely the beating\nheart.\n  We formulate a regularization strategy using Tikhonov regularization and,\nusing standard source conditions, we prove convergence rates. A special\nproperty of our approach is that not only operator perturbations are introduced\nby the diffuse domain method, but more important we have to deal with\ntopologies which depend on a parameter $\\eps$ in the diffuse domain method,\ni.e. we have to deal with $\\eps$-dependent forward operators and\n$\\eps$-dependent norms. In particular the appropriate function spaces for the\nunknown and the data depend on $\\eps$. This prevents to apply some standard\nconvergence techniques for inverse problems, in particular interpreting the\nperturbations as data errors in the original problem does not yield suitable\nresults.

The determination of the 3D\nfilm thickness profiles allows us to calculate 3D maps over the wetted surface\nof the local capillary, disjoining and lift pressures, viscous stress and\nfriction force. In this way the average friction force and the corresponding\nfriction coefficient are obtained. A theoretical model for the dependence of\nthe friction coefficient on the film thickness is developed. The relevant slip\ncoefficient, being a measure for the slip between liquid and solid, is\ndetermined as a function of the speed of the solid surface. It is found out\nthat below 170 um/s a friction regime exists which formally resembles dry\nfriction, while at larger speed the friction force between the bubble and solid\npasses through a maximum. Furthermore, the friction coefficient has a large\nvalue at low speed of the solid and reduces substantially with the speed\nincrease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 12:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 04:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this paper, a\nnovel approach that combines the rigor of the D-bar approach with the\nedge-preserving nature of Total Variation regularization is presented. The\nmethod also includes a data-driven contrast adjustment technique guided by the\nkey functions (CGO solutions) of the D-bar method. The new TV-Enhanced D-bar\nMethod produces reconstructions with sharper edges and improved contrast while\nstill solving the full nonlinear problem.

It would thus be very useful to estimate the dependency structure\nfrom data. While such models have been proposed, they usually concentrated on\nhigher-order correlations such as energy (square) correlations. Yet, linear\ncorrelations are a most fundamental and informative form of dependency in many\nreal data sets. Linear correlations are usually completely removed by ICA and\nrelated methods, so they can only be analyzed by developing new methods which\nexplicitly allow for linearly correlated components. In this paper, we propose\na probabilistic model of linear non-Gaussian components which are allowed to\nhave both linear and energy correlations. The precision matrix of the linear\ncomponents is assumed to be randomly generated by a higher-order process and\nexplicitly parametrized by a parameter matrix. The estimation of the parameter\nmatrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the\nobjective function is a quadratic form. Using simulations with artificial data,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed method improves identifiability of\nnon-Gaussian components by simultaneously learning their correlation structure.\nApplications on simulated complex cells with natural image input, as well as\nspectrograms of natural audio data show that the method finds new kinds of\ndependencies between the components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 13:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 05:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

We conduct two series of\nexperimental comparisons of H2PC against Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC), which is\ncurrently the most powerful state-of-the-art algorithm for Bayesian network\nstructure learning. First, we use eight well-known Bayesian network benchmarks\nwith various data sizes to assess the quality of the learned structure returned\nby the algorithms. Our extensive experiments show that H2PC outperforms MMHC in\nterms of goodness of fit to new data and quality of the network structure with\nrespect to the true dependence structure of the data. Second, we investigate\nH2PC's ability to solve the multi-label learning problem. We provide\ntheoretical results to characterize and identify graphically the so-called\nminimal label powersets that appear as irreducible factors in the joint\ndistribution under the faithfulness condition. The multi-label learning problem\nis then decomposed into a series of multi-class classification problems, where\neach multi-class variable encodes a label powerset. H2PC is shown to compare\nfavorably to MMHC in terms of global classification accuracy over ten\nmulti-label data sets covering different application domains. Overall, our\nexperiments support the conclusions that local structural learning with H2PC in\nthe form of local neighborhood induction is a theoretically well-motivated and\nempirically effective learning framework that is well suited to multi-label\nlearning.

Traditional\ntechniques of routing are not well adapted. Indeed, their lack of reactivity\nwith respect to the variability of network changes makes them difficult to use.\nMoreover, conserving energy is a critical concern in the design of routing\nprotocols for ad hoc networks, because most mobile nodes operate with limited\nbattery capacity, and the energy depletion of a node affects not only the node\nitself but also the overall network lifetime. In all proposed single-path\nrouting schemes a new path-discovery process is required once a path failure is\ndetected, and this process causes delay and wastage of node resources. A\nmultipath routing scheme is an alternative to maximize the network lifetime. In\nthis paper, we propose an energy-efficient multipath routing protocol, called\nAOMR-LM (Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Routing with Lifetime Maximization), which\npreserves the residual energy of nodes and balances the consumed energy to\nincrease the network lifetime. To achieve this goal, we used the residual\nenergy of nodes for calculating the node energy level. The multipath selection\nmechanism uses this energy level to classify the paths. Two parameters are\nanalyzed: the energy threshold beta and the coefficient alpha. These parameters\nare required to classify the nodes and to ensure the preservation of node\nenergy. Our protocol improves the performance of mobile ad hoc networks by\nprolonging the lifetime of the network. This novel protocol has been compared\nwith other protocols: AOMDV and ZD-AOMDV. The protocol performance has been\nevaluated in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, and end-to-end\ndelay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 14:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We propose a practical usage of this logics for\nmodel-checking purposes. A CLTL formula defines a function from infinite words\nto integers. Finding the bounds of such a function over a given set of words\ncan be seen as an extension of LTL universal and existential model-checking. We\npropose a CEGAR-like algorithm to find these bounds by relying on classical LTL\nmodel-checking, and use B\\\"{u}chi automata with counters to implement it. This\nmethod constitutes a first step towards the practical use of such a discrete\nquantitative logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 15:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Here, we develop a novel approach of node weighted coupled network\nmeasures to study correlations between ocean and atmosphere in the Northern\nHemisphere extratropics and construct 18 coupled climate networks, each\nconsisting of two subnetworks. In all cases, one subnetwork represents monthly\nsea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while the other is based on the\nmonthly geopotential height (HGT) of isobaric surfaces at different pressure\nlevels covering the troposphere as well as the lower stratosphere. The weighted\ncross-degree density proves to be consistent with the leading coupled pattern\nobtained from maximum covariance analysis. Network measures of higher order\nallow for a further analysis of the correlation structure between the two\nfields and consistently indicate that in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics\nthe ocean is correlated with the atmosphere in a hierarchical fashion such that\nlarge areas of the ocean surface correlate with multiple statistically\ndissimilar regions in the atmosphere.
