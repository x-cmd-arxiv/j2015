These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large\nazimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$. Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic\nmodels, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct\nphoton excess and $v_{2}$ in a self-consistent manner. This paper presents a\ndescription of the low $p_{T}$ photon flow as the result of increased photon\nproduction from soft-gluon mediated $q$-$\\bar{q}$ interactions as the system\nbecomes color-neutral. This production mechanism will generate photons that\nfollow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$\nvalue of two for direct photons. $\\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published PHENIX\ndirect photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements finds that\n$n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value\n$n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases. The 0-20%\nand 20-40% Au$+$Au direct photon data are compared to a coalescence-like Monte\nCarlo simulation that calculates the direct photon $v_{2}$ while describing the\nshape of the direct photon $p_{T}$ spectra in a consistent manner. The\nsimulation, while systematically low compared to the data, is in agreement with\nthe Au$+$Au measurement at $p_{T}<3$ GeV/c in both centrality bins.\nFurthermore, this model predicts that higher order flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, in\ndirect photons will follow the modified $n_{q}$-scaling laws seen in identified\nhadron $v_{n}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 16:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 04:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Unfortunately, flash memory is subject to challenging\nidiosyncrasies like erase-before-write and limited block lifetime. These\nconstraints are handled by a flash translation layer (FTL), which performs\nout-of-place updates, wear-leveling and garbage-collection behind the scene,\nwhile offering the application a virtualization of the physical address space.\n  A class of relevant FTLs employ a flash-resident page-associative mapping\ntable from logical to physical addresses, with a smaller RAM-resident cache for\nfrequently mapped entries. In this paper, we address the problem of performing\ngarbage-collection under such FTLs. We observe two problems. Firstly,\nmaintaining the metadata needed to perform garbage-collection under these\nschemes is problematic, because at write-time we do not necessarily know the\nphysical address of the before-image. Secondly, the size of this metadata must\nremain small, because it makes RAM unavailable for caching frequently accessed\nentries. We propose two complementary techniques, called Lazy Gecko and\nLogarithmic Gecko, which address these issues. Lazy Gecko works well when RAM\nis plentiful enough to store the GC metadata. Logarithmic Gecko works well when\nRAM isn't plentiful and efficiently stores the GC metadata in flash. Thus,\nthese techniques are applicable to a wide range of flash devices with varying\namounts of embedded RAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 16:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

To use observational resources most\nefficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can\nform. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of\nwater (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.\nWe want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice\nlines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic\nequilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our\nsemi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)\naccretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed\nplanet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses\nat distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around\nJupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O\nice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close\nas ~3 AU to Sun-like stars. Super-Jovian planets forming beyond ~5 AU can host\nMars-mass moons. We study a broad range of disk parameters for planets at 5.2\nAU and find that the H2O ice lines are universally between ~15 and 30 Jupiter\nradii when the last generation of moons is forming. If the abundant population\nof super-Jovian planets at ~1 AU formed in situ, then they should lack giant\nicy moons because their disks did not host H2O ice in the final stages of\naccretion. In the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current\nlocations from beyond a few AU, they might be orbited by large, H2O-rich moons.\nIn this case, Mars-mass ocean moons might be common in the stellar habitable\nzones.

However, for actual\nnuclei, this picture may no longer be the case, and one should use a more\nrealistic nuclear-structure model. We address this point by studying the\nspectroscopy of Hf. We remeasure the 2^+_1 half-lives of 172,174,176Hf, for\nwhich there is some disagreement in the literature. The main goal is to\nmeasure, for the first time, the half-lives of higher-lying states of the\nrotational band. The new results are compared to a theoretical calculation for\nabsolute transition strengths. The half-lives were measured using \\gamma-\\gamma\nand conversion-electron-\\gamma delayed coincidences with the fast timing\nmethod. For the determination of half-lives in the picosecond region, the\ngeneralized centroid difference method was applied. For the theoretical\ncalculation of the spectroscopic properties, the interacting boson model is\nemployed, whose Hamiltonian is determined based on microscopic energy-density\nfunctional calculations.

This is the appropriate framework for the case of\nsizeable deviations in the Higgs couplings of order $10\\%$ from the Standard\nModel, considered to be parametrically larger than new-physics effects in the\nsector of electroweak gauge interactions. The role of power counting in\nidentifying the relevant parameters is emphasized. The three relevant scales,\n$v$, the scale of new Higgs dynamics $f$, and the cut-off $\\Lambda=4\\pi f$,\nadmit expansions in $\\xi=v^2/f^2$ and $f^2/\\Lambda^2$.

The leading effects in the\nconsistent approximation provided by the EFT, relevant for the presently most\nimportant processes of Higgs production and decay, are given by a few\n(typically six) couplings.

We compute the characteristic GW strain of\nthis background based on the observed distribution of planet parameters. We\nalso show that the integrated extragalactic background is comparable or less\nthan the galactic background at different frequencies. Our estimate shows that\nthe net background is significantly below the sensitivities of the proposed GW\nexperiments in different frequency bands. However, we notice that the peak of\nthe spectrum, at around $10^{-5}$Hz, is not too far below the proposed space\nbased GW missions. A future space based mission may be able to observe or\ntightly constrain this signal, which will possibly be the only way to probe the\ngalactic population of exoplanets as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 19:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 19:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

We analyse the evolution of\nstellar mass functions of coeval main sequence stars including all relevant\naspects of single- and binary-star evolution. We show that the slope of the\nupper part of the mass function in a stellar cluster can be quite different to\nthe slope of the initial mass function. Wind mass loss from massive stars leads\nto an accumulation of stars which is visible as a peak at the high mass end of\nmass functions, thereby flattening the mass function slope. Mass accretion and\nmergers in close binary systems create a tail of rejuvenated binary products.\nThese blue straggler stars extend the single star mass function by up to a\nfactor of two in mass and can appear up to ten times younger than their parent\nstellar cluster. Cluster ages derived from their most massive stars that are\nclose to the turn-off may thus be significantly biased. To overcome such\ndifficulties, we propose the use of the binary tail of stellar mass functions\nas an unambiguous clock to derive the cluster age because the location of the\nonset of the binary tail identifies the cluster turn-off mass. It is indicated\nby a pronounced jump in the mass function of old stellar populations and by the\nwind mass loss peak in young stellar populations. We further characterise the\nbinary induced blue straggler population in star clusters in terms of their\nfrequency, binary fraction and apparent age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 20:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Ca2RuO4 is a structurally-driven\nMott insulator with a metal-insulator transition at TMI = 357 K, which is well\nseparated from antiferromagnetic order at TN = 110 K. Substitution of 5d\nelement, Ir, for Ru enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and locking between the\nstructural distortions and magnetic moment canting. In particular, Ir doping\nintensifies the distortion or rotation of Ru/IrO6 octahedra and induces weak\nferromagnetic behavior along the c-axis. Moreover, the magnetic ordering\ntemperature TN increases from 110 K at x = 0 to 215 K with enhanced magnetic\nanisotropy at x = 0.65. The effect of Ir doping sharply contrasts with that of\n3d-element doping such as Cr, Mn and Fe, which suppresses TN and induces\nunusual negative volume thermal expansion. The stark difference between 3d- and\n5d-element doping underlines a strong magnetoelastic coupling inherent in the\nIr-rich oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 20:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

Users who invest more effort into their activity on the site not only\nplace themselves in more structurally diverse positions within the network than\nthe less engaged users, but they also receive more diverse information when\nlocated in similar network positions.

By appropriately choosing the\nnon-canonical scalar field, we show that the canonical scalar field corresponds\nto a potential that is nearly the $R^2$ inflation potential. If the Type IV\nsingularity occurs at the end of inflation, the Universe's dynamical evolution\nnear inflation is determined effectively by the canonical scalar field and at\nlate-time the evolution is effectively determined by the non-canonical scalar.\nWe also discuss the evolution of the Universe in terms of the effective\nequation of state and we show that the Type IV singularity, that occurs at the\nend of inflation, drives late-time acceleration.

While such truncation removes the\nfine-grained sensitive information, it also strips the data of many features\nthat are crucial to the profiling of user activity. We show how to overcome the\nsevere handicap of lack of crucial features for the purpose of filtering out\nthe URLs representing a user activity from the noisy network traffic trace\n(including advertisement, spam, analytics, webscripts) with high accuracy.

Given\nmolecular turnover, how can synapses maintain strong for the years that\nmemories can persist? Some models postulate that biochemical bistability\nmaintains strong synapses. However, bistability should give a bimodal\ndistribution of synaptic strength or weight, whereas current data show unimodal\ndistributions for weights and for a correlated variable, dendritic spine\nvolume. Bistability of single synapses has also never been empirically\ndemonstrated. Thus it is important for models to simulate both unimodal\ndistributions and long-term memory persistence. Here a model is developed that\nconnects ongoing, competing processes of synaptic growth and weakening to\nstochastic processes of receptor insertion and removal in dendritic spines. The\nmodel simulates long-term (in excess of 1 yr) persistence of groups of strong\nsynapses. A unimodal weight distribution results. For stability of this\ndistribution it proved essential to incorporate resource competition between\nsynapses organized into small clusters. With competition, these clusters are\nstable for years. These simulations concur with recent data to support the\nclustered plasticity hypothesis, which suggests clusters, rather than single\nsynaptic contacts, may be a fundamental unit for storage of long-term memory.\nThe model makes empirical predictions, and may provide a framework to\ninvestigate mechanisms maintaining the balance between synaptic plasticity and\nstability of memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 00:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

The\nnovelty of this paper is to generalize LRR on Euclidean space onto an LRR model\non Grassmann manifold in a uniform kernelized framework. The new methods have\nmany applications in computer vision tasks. Several clustering experiments are\nconducted on handwritten digit images, dynamic textures, human face clips and\ntraffic scene sequences. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethods outperform a number of state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 02:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

New\nalgorithms must be developed which minimise the transfer of data. Patch\ndynamics is a computational macroscale modelling scheme which provides a coarse\nmacroscale solution of a problem defined on a fine microscale by dividing the\ndomain into many nonoverlapping, coupled patches. Patch dynamics is readily\nadaptable to massive parallelisation as each processor can evaluate the\ndynamics on one, or a few, patches. However, patch coupling conditions\ninterpolate across the unevaluated parts of the domain between patches, and are\ntypically reevaluated at every microscale time step, thus requiring almost\ncontinuous data transfer.

It is believed\nthat the long GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars. So it is\npossible to use GRBs to investigate the star formation rate (SFR). In this\npaper, we use Lynden-Bell's $c^-$ method to study the luminosity function and\nrate of \\emph{Swift} long GRBs without any assumptions. We find that the\nluminosity of GRBs evolves with redshift as $L(z)\\propto g(z)=(1+z)^k$ with\n$k=2.43_{-0.38}^{+0.41}$. After correcting the redshift evolution through\n$L_0(z)=L(z)/g(z)$, the luminosity function can be expressed as\n$\\psi(L_0)\\propto L_0^{-0.14\\pm0.02}$ for dim GRBs and $\\psi(L_0)\\propto\nL_0^{-0.70\\pm0.03}$ for bright GRBs, with the break point\n$L_{0}^{b}=1.43\\times10^{51}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$.

De novo assembly is not only\ncomputationally challenging, but also requires high-quality data. While the\nreads from a single individual may not always meet this requirement, using\nreads from multiple individuals can increase power to detect novel insertions.\nWe have developed the program PopIns, which can discover and characterize\nnon-reference insertions of 100 bp or longer on a population scale.

It takes as input a\nreads-to-reference alignment, assembles unaligned reads using a standard\nassembly tool, merges the contigs of different individuals into high-confidence\nsequences, anchors the merged sequences into the reference genome, and finally\ngenotypes all individuals for the discovered insertions. Our tests on simulated\ndata indicate that the merging step greatly improves the quality and\nreliability of predicted insertions and that PopIns shows significantly better\nrecall and precision than the recent tool MindTheGap.

The single power-law shallow decay index of\nthe optical light curve observed by GROND between 640 s and 10 ks is\n$\\alpha_{\\rm opt} = 0.57 \\pm 0.02$, which apparently conflicts with the simple\nexternal shock model expectation. Especially, there is a remarkable\nrebrightening in the optical to near infrared bands at late time, challenging\nthe external shock model with synchrotron emission coming from the interaction\nof the blast wave with the surrounding interstellar medium. In this paper, we\ninvoke a magnetar with spin evolution to explain the complex multi-band\nafterglow emission of GRB 100814A. The initial shallow decay phase in optical\nbands and the plateau in X-ray can be explained as due to energy injection from\na spin-down magnetar. At late time, with the falling of materials from the\nfall-back disk onto the central object of the burster, angular momentum of the\naccreted materials is transferred to the magnetar, which leads to a spin-up\nprocess. As a result, the magnetic dipole radiation luminosity will increase,\nresulting in the significant rebrightening of the optical afterglow. It is\nshown that the observed multi-band afterglow emission can be well reproduced by\nthe model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 04:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

It is unlike solids\nor Abrikosov lattices that are observable in physical systems. Abrikosov\nlattices are vortices closely packed into a lattice with a flux quantum through\na unit cell. Although Abrikosov lattices appear generally in various physical\nsystems, vortex lattices with multiple-flux quantums through a unit cell are\nmore stable than Abrikosov lattices in some physical regimes of the systems\nwith non-local interactions between particles. No theory is able to describe\nthese vortex lattices today. Here, we develop a theory for these vortex\nlattices by extending von Neumann lattices to the coordinate space with a unit\ncell of area that is proportional to flux quantums through a unit cell. The von\nNeumann lattices not only show the same physical properties as the Abrikosov\nlattice, but also describe vortex lattices with multiple-flux quantums through\na unit cell. From numerical simulations of a rapidly rotating dipole-blockaded\ngas, we confirm that vortex lattices showed in our simulations are the\nrepresentation of von Neumann lattices in the coordinate space. We anticipate\nour theory to be a starting point for developing more sophisticated\nvortex-lattice models. For example, the effect of Landau-level mixing on vortex\nlattice structures, vortices formed inside superfluid droplets and structural\nphase transitions of vortex matter in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates\nwill be relevant for such developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 04:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

However, with the constant launch of new\ncloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big (e.g., Amazon\nWeb Service, Microsoft Azure) and small companies (e.g. Rackspace, Ninefold),\ndecision makers (e.g. application developers, CIOs) are likely to be\noverwhelmed by choices available. The decision making problem is further\ncomplicated due to heterogeneous service configurations and application\nprovisioning Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. To address this hard\nchallenge, in our previous work we developed a semi-automated, extensible, and\nontology-based approach to infrastructure service discovery and selection based\non only design time constraints (e.g., renting cost, datacentre location,\nservice feature, etc.). In this paper, we extend our approach to include the\nreal-time (run-time) QoS (endto- end message latency, end-to-end message\nthroughput) in the decision making process. Hosting of next generation\napplications in domain of on-line interactive gaming, large scale sensor\nanalytics, and real-time mobile applications on cloud services necessitates\noptimization of such real-time QoS constraints for meeting Service Level\nAgreements (SLAs). To this end, we present a real-time QoS aware multi-criteria\ndecision making technique that builds over well known Analytics Hierarchy\nProcess (AHP) method. The proposed technique is applicable to selecting\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offers, and it allows users to define\nmultiple design-time and real-time QoS constraints or requirements.

All five objects were identified as super-Eddington\naccreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). The highest measured accretion rates\nfor the objects in this campaign are $\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}\\gtrsim 200$, where\n$\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}= \\dot{M}_{\\bullet}/L_{\\rm Edd}c^{-2}$, $\\dot{M}_{\\bullet}$\nis the mass accretion rates, $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity and $c$\nis the speed of light. We find that the H$\\beta$ time lags in SEAMBHs are\nsignificantly shorter than those measured in sub-Eddington AGNs, and the\ndeviations increase with increasing accretion rates. Thus, the relationship\nbetween broad-line region size ($R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}$) and optical luminosity at\n5100\\AA, $R_{_{\\rm H\\beta}}-L_{5100}$, requires accretion rate as an additional\nparameter.

This comparison\nsuggests that the 24mic based dust extinction correction for Halpha might be\nnon universal, and that it should be used with caution in all objects with a\nSFA, where dust heating can be dominated by the old stellar population.\nFurthermore, because of the sudden truncation of the SFA of cluster galaxies\noccurring after their interaction with the surrounding environment, the\nstationarity conditions required to transform monochromatic fluxes into SFR\nmight not always be satisfied in tracers other than L(Halpha). In a similar\nway, the parametrisation of the SFH generally used in SED fitting codes might\nnot be adequate for these recently interacting systems.

In fact, the relation between the transient\nphotoabsorption spectrum and the properties of the examined sample can be\nrather intricate since the former is a complicated functional of both the\ndriving pump and the feeble probe fields. In this work we critically review the\nderivation of the time-resolved photoabsorption spectrum in terms of the\nnonequilibrium dipole response function $\\chi$ and assess its domain of\nvalidity. We then analyze $\\chi$ in detail and discuss a few exact properties\nuseful to interpret the transient spectrum {\\em during} (overlapping regime)\nand {\\em after} (nonoverlapping regime) the action of the pump. The\nnonoverlapping regime is the simplest to address. The absorption energies are\nindeed independent of the delay between the pump and probe pulses and hence the\ntransient spectrum can change only by a rearrangement of the spectral weights.\nWe give a close expression of these spectral weights in two limiting cases\n(ultrashort and everlasting monochromatic probes) and highlight their strong\ndependence on coherence and probe-envelope. In the overlapping regime we obtain\na Lehmann-like representation of $\\chi$ in terms of light-dressed states and\nprovide a unifying framework of various well known effects in pump-driven\nsystems.

Among the many practical needs,\nclassifying videos (or video clips) based on their major semantic categories\n(e.g., \"skiing\") is useful in many applications. In this paper, we conduct an\nin-depth study to investigate important implementation options that may affect\nthe performance of deep nets on video classification.

Notwithstanding the abundant usage of such inherently limited data\nsets, the impact of sampling biases on mobility patterns is unclear -- we do\nnot have methods available to reliably infer mobility information from a\nlimited data set. Here, we investigate the effects of sampling using a data set\nof millions of taxi movements in New York City.

The main observation was a simplification of\nthe mechanism at ignition and extinction points. The critical simplification is\nan example of a much more general phenomenon that we call \\emph{a bifurcational\nparametric simplification}. Ignition and extinction points are points of\nequilibrium multiplicity bifurcations, i.e., they are points of a corresponding\nbifurcation set for parameters.\n  Any bifurcation produces a dependence between system parameters. This is a\nmathematical explanation and/or justification of the \"parametric\nsimplification\". It leads us to a conjecture that \"maximal bifurcational\nparametric simplification\" corresponds to the \"maximal bifurcation complexity.\"\n  This conjecture can have practical applications for experimental study,\nbecause at points of \"maximal bifurcation complexity\" the number of independent\nsystem parameters is minimal and all other parameters can be evaluated\nanalytically or numerically.\n  We illustrate this method by the case of the simplest possible bifurcation,\nthat is a multiplicity bifurcation of equilibrium and we apply this analysis to\nthe Langmuir mechanism. Our analytical study is based on a coordinate-free\nversion of the method of invariant manifolds (proposed recently in 2006 ).

As single markers tend\nto explain only a small proportion of phenotypic variation, there is increasing\ninterest in using multiple genetic markers to obtain more precise estimates of\ncausal parameters. Structural mean models (SMMs) are semiparametric models that\nuse instrumental variables to identify causal parameters.

IPTV provides triple-play services that\nrequire high-speed access networks with the functions of multicasting and\nquality of service (QoS) guarantees. Among optical access networks, Ethernet\npassive optical networks (EPONs) are regarded as among the best solutions to\nmeet higher bandwidth demands. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for\nmulticasting live IPTV traffic in optical access network. The proposed\nmechanism involves assigning a unique logical link identifier to each IPTV\nchannel. To manage multicasting, a prior storing server in the optical line\nterminal (OLT) and in each optical network unit (ONU) is constructed. In this\nwork, we propose a partial prior storing strategy that considers the changes in\nthe popularity of the video content segments over time and the access patterns\nof the users to compute the utility of the objects in the prior storage. We\nalso propose to partition the prior storage to avoid the eviction of the\npopular objects (those not accessed frequently) by the unpopular ones which are\naccessed with higher frequency. The popularity distribution and ageing of\npopularity are measured from two online datasets and use the parameters in\nsimulations. Simulation results show that our proposed architecture can improve\nthe system performance and QoS parameters in terms of packet delay, jitter and\npacket loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 13:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

For a pair of given input images geodesic paths in the space of\nimages are defined as minimizers of a resulting path energy. To this end, the\nunderlying Riemannian metric measures the rate of transport cost and the rate\nof viscous dissipation. Furthermore, the model is capable to deal with strongly\nvarying image contrast and explicitly allows for sources and sinks in the\ntransport equations which are incorporated in the metric related to the\nmetamorphosis approach by Trouv\\'e and Younes. In the non-viscous case with\nsource term existence of geodesic paths is proven in the space of measures.

Frequently, the image sequence is corrupted by noise and one\nsimultaneously asks for the underlying motion field and a restored sequence. In\nsmoothly shaded regions of the restored image sequence the brightness constancy\nassumption along motion paths leads to a pointwise differential condition on\nthe motion field. At object boundaries which are edge discontinuities both for\nthe image intensity and for the motion field this condition is no longer well\ndefined. In this paper a total-variation type functional is discussed for joint\nimage restoration and motion estimation. This functional turns out not to be\nlower semicontinuous, and in particular fine-scale oscillations may appear\naround edges. By the general theory of vector valued $BV$ functionals its\nrelaxation leads to the appearance of a singular part of the energy density,\nwhich can be determined by the solution of a local minimization problem at\nedges. Based on bounds for the singular part of the energy and under\nappropriate assumptions on the local intensity variation one can exclude the\nexistence of microstructures and obtain a model well-suited for simultaneous\nimage restoration and motion estimation. Indeed, the relaxed model incorporates\na generalized variational formulation of the brightness constancy assumption.\nThe analytical findings are related to ambiguity problems in motion estimation\nsuch as the proper distinction between foreground and background motion at\nobject edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 15:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

The annual\nrate of nuclear accidents, with size above 20 Million US$, per plant, decreased\nfrom the 1950s until dropping significantly after Chernobyl (April, 1986). The\nrate is now roughly stable at 0.002 to 0.003, i.e., around 1 event per year\nacross the current fleet. The distribution of damage values changed after Three\nMile Island (TMI; March, 1979), where moderate damages were suppressed but the\ntail became very heavy, being described by a Pareto distribution with tail\nindex 0.55. Further, there is a runaway disaster regime, associated with the\n\"dragon-king\" phenomenon, amplifying the risk of extreme damage. In fact, the\ndamage of the largest event (Fukushima; March, 2011) is equal to 60 percent of\nthe total damage of all 174 accidents in our database since 1946. In dollar\nlosses we compute a 50% chance that (i) a Fukushima event (or larger) occurs in\nthe next 50 years, (ii) a Chernobyl event (or larger) occurs in the next 27\nyears and (iii) a TMI event (or larger) occurs in the next 10 years. Finally,\nwe find that the INES scale is inconsistent. To be consistent with damage, the\nFukushima disaster would need to have an INES level of 11, rather than the\nmaximum of 7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 18:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-10"}

We\nshow that the common Fst index of genetic differentiation between populations\ncan be viewed as a proportion of variance explained by the principal\ncomponents. Considering the correlations between genetic variants and each\nprincipal component provides a conceptual framework to detect genetic variants\ninvolved in local adaptation without any prior definition of populations. To\nvalidate the PCA-based approach, we consider the 1000 Genomes data (phase 1)\nafter removal of recently admixed individuals resulting in 850 individuals\ncoming from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The number of genetic variants is of the\norder of 36 millions obtained with a low-coverage sequencing depth (3X).

In addition to identifying genes involved in biological adaptation, we\nidentify two biological pathways involved in polygenic adaptation that are\nrelated to the innate immune system (beta defensins) and to lipid metabolism\n(fatty acid omega oxidation). An additional analysis of European data shows\nthat a genome scan based on PCA retrieves classical examples of local\nadaptation even when there are no well-defined populations.
