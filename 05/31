Restraints derived from XL-MS\nexperiments have been used successfully for structure refinement and\nprotein-protein docking. However, one formidable question is under which\ncircumstances XL-MS data might be sufficient to determine a protein's tertiary\nstructure de novo? Answering this question will not only include understanding\nthe impact of XL-MS data on sampling and scoring within a de novo protein\nstructure prediction algorithm, it must also determine an optimal cross-linker\ntype and length for protein structure determination. While a longer\ncross-linker will yield more restraints, the value of each restraint for\nprotein structure prediction decreases as the restraint is consistent with a\nlarger conformational space.\n  In this study, the number of cross-links and their discriminative power was\nsystematically analyzed in silico on a set of 2,055 non-redundant protein folds\nconsidering Lys-Lys, Lys-Asp, Lys-Glu, Cys-Cys, and Arg-Arg reactive\ncross-linkers between 1 {\\AA} and 60 {\\AA}.

Next,\nsimulated restraints of variable length were used to de novo predict the\ntertiary structure of fifteen proteins using the BCL::Fold algorithm.

One of the main\nchallenges in such recognition is the ability to distinguish between image\nfeatures resulting from the vessels surface and image features resulting from\nthe material inside the vessel. Reflections and the functional parts of a\nvessels surface can create strong edges that can be mistakenly identified as\ncorresponding to the vessel contents, and cause recognition errors. The ability\nto evaluate whether a specific edge in an image stems from the vessels surface\nor from its contents can considerably improve the ability to identify materials\ninside transparent vessels. This work will suggest a method for such\nevaluation, based on the following two assumptions: 1) Areas of high curvature\non the vessel surface are likely to cause strong edges due to changes in\nreflectivity, as is the appearance of functional parts (e.g. corks or valves).\n2) Most transparent vessels (bottles, glasses) have high symmetry\n(cylindrical). As a result the curvature angle of the vessels surface at each\npoint of the image is similar to the curvature angle of the contour line of the\nvessel in the same row in the image. These assumptions, allow the\nidentification of image regions with strong edges corresponding to the vessel\nsurface reflections. Combining this method with existing image analysis methods\nfor detecting materials inside transparent containers allows considerable\nimprovement in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 21:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

We construct a general framework\nto investigate whether models based on halo abundance matching are able to\nreproduce the observed stellar mass TFR and mass-size relation (MSR), and use\nthe data to constrain galaxy formation parameters. Our model tests a range of\nplausible scenarios, differing in the response of haloes to disc formation, the\nrelative angular momentum of baryons and dark matter, the impact of selection\neffects, and the abundance matching parameters. We show that agreement with the\nobserved TFR puts an upper limit on the scatter between galaxy and halo\nproperties, requires weak or reversed halo contraction, and favours selection\neffects that preferentially eliminate fast-rotating galaxies. The MSR\nconstrains the ratio of the disc to halo specific angular momentum to be\napproximately in the range 0.6-1.2. We identify and quantify two problems that\nmodels of this nature face. (1) They predict too large an intrinsic scatter for\nthe MSR, and (2) they predict too strong an anticorrelation between the TFR and\nMSR residuals. We argue that resolving these problems requires introducing a\ncorrelation between stellar surface density and enclosed dark matter mass.\nFinally, we explore the expected difference between the TFRs of central and\nsatellite galaxies, finding that in the favoured models this difference should\nbe detectable in a sample of ~700 galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 22:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2015 19:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

There are six\ngauge-invariant sets of such diagrams that generate corrections of order\n$m\\alpha^7$. The contributions of these diagrams are calculated for an\narbitrary electron-muon mass ratio without expansion in the small mass ratio.\nWe obtain the formulae for contributions to hyperfine splitting that in the\ncase of small mass ratio describe corrections for muonium and in the case of\nequal masses describe corrections for positronium. First few terms of the\nexpansion of hard corrections in the small mass ratio were earlier calculated\nfor muonium analytically. We check numerically that the new results coincide\nwith the sum of the known terms of the expansion in the case of small mass\nratio. In the case of equal masses we obtain hard nonlogarithmic corrections of\norder $m\\alpha^7$ to hyperfine splitting in positronium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 22:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

In the scenario where the receiver has limited battery\nsize, a signal with bursty energy content may cause power outage at the\nreceiver since the battery will drain during intervals with low signal energy.\nIn this paper, we consider a discrete memoryless channel and characterize\nachievable information rates when the energy content in each codeword is\nregularized by ensuring that sufficient energy is carried within every subblock\nduration. In particular, we study constant subblock-composition codes (CSCCs)\nwhere all subblocks in every codeword have the same fixed composition, and this\nsubblock-composition is chosen to maximize the rate of information transfer\nwhile meeting the energy requirement. Compared to constant composition codes\n(CCCs), we show that CSCCs incur a rate loss and that the error exponent for\nCSCCs is also related to the error exponent for CCCs by the same rate loss\nterm. We show that CSCC capacity can be improved by allowing different\nsubblocks to have different composition while still meeting the subblock energy\nconstraint.

We\nexamine whether the observed scatter can be accounted for by combining scatters\nin disc scale-lengths, the concentration-halo mass relation, and the M*-Mhalo\nrelation. We use these scatters to create model galaxy populations; when housed\nwithin dark matter halos that have universal, NFW density profiles, the model\ndoes not match the lowest observed values of Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax and has too little\nscatter in Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax compared to observations. By contrast, a model using\na mass dependent dark matter profile, where the inner slope is determined by\nthe ratio of M*/Mhalo, produces galaxies with low values of Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax and\na much larger scatter, both in agreement with observation. We conclude that the\nlarge observed scatter in Vrot(1kpc)/Vmax favours density profiles that are\nsignificantly affected by baryonic processes. Alternative dark matter core\nformation models such as SIDM may also account for the observed variation in\nrotation curve shapes, but these observations may provide important constraints\nin terms of core sizes, and whether they vary with halo mass and/or merger\nhistory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2015 10:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 08:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}

The observed energy\nshifts of the G and 2D bands allowed to determine carrier concentration\nfluctuations induced by GaN nanowires. Comparison of Raman scattering spatial\nintensity maps and the images obtained using scanning electron microscope led\nto conclusion that vertically aligned GaN nanowires induce a homogenous strain,\nsubstantial spatial modulation of carrier concentration in graphene and\nunexpected homogenous distribution of defects created by interaction with\nnanowires. The analysis of the D and D' peak intensity ratio showed that\ninteraction with nanowires also changes the probability of scattering on\ndifferent types of defects. The Raman studies were correlated with weak\nlocalization effect measured using microwave induced contactless electron\ntransport.
