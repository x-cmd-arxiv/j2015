We consider neuromechanical systems where slow movements are\nproduced by neural commands that modulate muscle stiffness. This formulation\nbased on strain-energy equilibria is in agreement with prior work on neural\ncontrol of muscle and limb impedance. Slow limb movements are driftless in the\nsense that movement stops when neural commands stop. We demonstrate, in the\ncontext of two planar tendon-driven systems representing a finger and a leg,\nthat the control of muscle stiffness suffices to produce stable and accurate\nlimb postures and quasi-static (slow) transitions among them. We prove,\nhowever, that stable postures are achievable only when muscles are\npre-tensioned, as is the case for natural muscle tone. Our results further\nindicate, in accordance with experimental findings, that slow movements are\nnon-smooth. The non-smoothness arises because the precision with which\nindividual muscle stiffnesses need to be controlled changes substantially\nthroughout the limb's motion. These results underscore the fundamental roles of\nmuscle tone and accurate neural control of muscle stiffness in producing stable\nlimb postures and slow movements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2015 16:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 17:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

Under a mild\nassumption, basic Tukey reductions are inherited under Tukey reduction. In\nparticular, every ultrafilter Tukey reducible to a p-point has continuous Tukey\nreductions. If $\\mathcal{U}$ is a Fubini iterate of p-points, then each\nmonotone cofinal map from $\\mathcal{U}$ to some other ultrafilter is generated\n(on a cofinal subset of $\\mathcal{U}$) by a finitary map on the base tree for\n$\\mathcal{U}$ which is monotone and end-extension preserving - the analogue of\ncontinuous in this context. Further, every ultrafilter which is Tukey reducible\nto some Fubini iterate of p-points has finitely generated cofinal maps.

Despite\nthe steady progress in multi-view stereo reconstruction, most existing methods\nare still limited in recovering fine-scale details and sharp features while\nsuppressing noises, and may fail in reconstructing regions with few textures.\nTo address these limitations, this paper presents a Detail-preserving and\nContent-aware Variational (DCV) multi-view stereo method, which reconstructs\nthe 3D surface by alternating between reprojection error minimization and mesh\ndenoising. In reprojection error minimization, we propose a novel inter-image\nsimilarity measure, which is effective to preserve fine-scale details of the\nreconstructed surface and builds a connection between guided image filtering\nand image registration. In mesh denoising, we propose a content-aware\n$\\ell_{p}$-minimization algorithm by adaptively estimating the $p$ value and\nregularization parameters based on the current input. It is much more promising\nin suppressing noise while preserving sharp features than conventional\nisotropic mesh smoothing. Experimental results on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our DCV method is capable of recovering more surface details,\nand obtains cleaner and more accurate reconstructions than state-of-the-art\nmethods. In particular, our method achieves the best results among all\npublished methods on the Middlebury dino ring and dino sparse ring datasets in\nterms of both completeness and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 03:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Such a highly retrievable atom-photon entanglement\nsource will be very useful in future larger-scale quantum repeater and quantum\nnetwork applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 08:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

The standard two-step mapping technique is adopted to\nestablish the photospheric footpoints of the magnetic flux tubes along which\nthe ACE winds flow. The footpoints are then placed in the context of EIT\n284~\\AA\\ images and photospheric magnetograms, allowing us to categorize the\nsources into four groups: coronal holes (CHs), active regions (ARs), the quiet\nSun (QS), and \"Undefined\". This practice also enables us to establish the\nresponse to solar activity of the fractions occupied by each kind of solar\nwinds, and of their speeds and O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios measured in situ. We\nfind that during the maximum phase, the majority of ACE winds originate from\nARs. During the declining phase, CHs and ARs are equally important contributors\nto the ACE solar winds. The QS contribution increases with decreasing solar\nactivity, and maximizes in the minimum phase when QS appear to be the primary\nsupplier of the ACE winds. With decreasing activity, the winds from all sources\ntend to become cooler, as represented by the increasingly low O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$\nratios. On the other hand, during each activity phase, the AR winds tend to be\nthe slowest and associated with the highest O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$ ratios, and the\nCH winds correspond to the other extreme, with the QS winds lying in between.\nApplying the same analysis method to the slow winds only, here defined as the\nwinds with speeds lower than 500 km s$^{-1}$, we find basically the same\noverall behavior, as far as the contributions of individual groups of sources\nare concerned. This statistical study indicates that QS regions are an\nimportant source of the solar wind during the minimum phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 09:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

Fortunately, it has recently been discovered that harnessing various\nsparsity structures in massive MIMO channels can lead to significant overhead\nreduction, and thus improve the system performance. This paper presents and\ndiscusses the use of sparsity-inspired CSI acquisition techniques for massive\nMIMO, as well as the underlying mathematical theory. Sparsity-inspired\napproaches for both frequency-division duplexing and time-division duplexing\nmassive MIMO systems will be examined and compared from an overall system\nperspective, including the design trade-offs between the two duplexing modes,\ncomputational complexity of acquisition algorithms, and applicability of\nsparsity structures. Meanwhile, some future prospects for research on\nhigh-dimensional CSI acquisition to meet practical demands will be identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 12:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

In particular, Scale Free\nnetworks with degree distribution $P(k)\\sim k^{-\\lambda}$, are widely used in\nresearch since they are ubiquitous in nature and other real systems. In this\npaper we focus on the surface relaxation growth model in Scale Free networks\nwith $2.5< \\lambda <3$, and study the scaling behavior of the fluctuations, in\nthe steady state, with the system size $N$. We find a novel behavior of the\nfluctuations characterized by a crossover between two regimes at a value of\n$N=N^*$ that depends on $\\lambda$: a logarithmic regime, found in previous\nresearch, and a constant regime. We propose a function that describes this\ncrossover, which is in very good agreement with the simulations. We also find\nthat, for a system size above $N^{*}$, the fluctuations decrease with\n$\\lambda$, which means that the synchronization of the system improves as\n$\\lambda$ increases. We explain this crossover analyzing the role of the\nnetwork's heterogeneity produced by the system size $N$ and the exponent of the\ndegree distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 05:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2015 19:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}

In our setup, the moving and laboratory frames used the (same) set\nof measurement directions that maximally violate Svetlichny's inequality in the\nlaboratory frame. We also investigate the behavior of Mermin's and Collins'\ninequalities. We find that, regardless of the particles' type of entanglement,\nviolation of Svetlichny's inequality in the moving frame is decreased by\nincreasing the boost velocity and the energy of particles in the laboratory\nframe. In the relativistic regime Svetlichny's inequality is a good criterion\nto investigate the non-locality of the GHZ state. We also find that Mermin's\nand Collins' inequalities lead to reasonable predictions, in agreement with the\nbehavior of the spin state, about non-locality of the W state in the\nrelativistic regime. Then, comparing our results with those in which Czachor's\nrelativistic spin is used instead of the Pauli operator, we find that the\nresults obtained by considering the Pauli spin operator are in better agreement\nwith the behavior of spin state of the system in the relativistic information\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 07:24:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2015 04:42:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 04:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}
