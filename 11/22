By\nestimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (NGC 2264, NGC\n2547, NGC 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 Myr respectively), we aim to\nestablish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magnetically\nactive stars. We use radial velocities from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and\npublished photometry to establish cluster membership and combine GES\nmeasurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radii\nfor groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosity\nand age. The average radii are compared with the predictions of both standard\nevolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convection\nand starspots. At a given luminosity, the stellar radii in NGC 2516 and NGC\n2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages of\nthese clusters. The discrepancy is least pronounced and not significant ~10\npercent) in ZAMS stars with radiative cores, but more significant in\nlower-mass, fully convective pre main-sequence cluster members, reaching\n30+/-10 percent. The uncertain age and distance of NGC 2264 preclude a reliable\ndetermination of any discrepancy for its members. The median radii we have\nestimated for low-mass fully convective stars in the older clusters are\ninconsistent (at the 2-3 sigma level) with non-magnetic evolutionary models and\nmore consistent with models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields or\ndark starspots. The available models suggest this requires either surface\nmagnetic fields exceeding 2.5 kG, spots that block about 30 per cent of the\nphotospheric flux, or a more moderate combination of both.

Furthermore, several authors recently\nclaimed existence of the helicity=0 fundamental field. We re-examine the theory\nof antisymmetric tensor fields and 4-vector potentials. We study the massless\nlimits. In fact, a theoretical motivation for this venture is the old papers of\nOgievetskii and Polubarinov, Hayashi, and Kalb and Ramond. They proposed the\nconcept of the notoph, whose helicity properties are complementary to those of\nthe photon. We analyze the quantum field theory with taking into account mass\ndimensions of the notoph and the photon. It appears to be possible to describe\nboth photon and notoph degrees of freedom on the basis of the modified\nBargmann-Wigner formalism for the symmetric second-rank spinor. Next, we\nproceed to derive equations for the symmetric tensor of the second rank on the\nbasis of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism in a straightforward way. The symmetric\nmultispinor of the fourth rank is used. Due to serious problems with the\ninterpretation of the results obtained on using the standard procedure we\ngeneralize it and obtain the spin-2 relativistic equations, which are\nconsistent with the general relativity. Thus, in fact we deduced the\ngravitational field equations from relativistic quantum mechanics. The\nrelations of this theory with the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation and\nf(R) are discussed. Particular attention has been paid to the correct\ndefinitions of the energy-momentum tensor and other Noether currents in the\nelectromagnetic theory, the relativistic theory of gravitation, the general\nrelativity, and their generalizations. We estimate possible interactions,\nfermion-notoph, graviton-notoph, photon-notoph, and we conclude that they can\nprobably be seen in experiments in the next few years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 18:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 18:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-09"}

While numerous studies exist to examine its\nvalidity against numerical simulations in a statistical fashion, there are few\nanalyses to compare the TSC dynamics in an individual object-wise basis, which\nis what we attempt in the present paper. We extract 100 halos at z = 0 from a\ncosmological N-body simulation according to the conventional TSC criterion for\nthe spherical over-density. Then we trace back their spherical counter-parts at\nearlier epochs. Just prior to the turn-around epoch of the halos, their\ndynamics is well approximated by TSC, but their turn-around epochs are\nsystematically delayed and the virial radii are larger by ~ 20 percent on\naverage relative to the TSC predictions. We find that this systematic deviation\nis mainly ascribed to the non-uniformity/inhomogeneity of dark matter density\nprofiles and the non-zero velocity dispersions, both of which are neglected in\nTSC. In particular, the inside-out-collapse and shell-crossing of dark matter\nhalos play an important role in generating the significant velocity dispersion.\nThe implications of the present result are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2015 23:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The unsteady adjoint method is\neffective in capturing the gradient for a short time interval aerothermal\nobjective, whereas the method provides diverging gradients for long\ntime-averaged thermal objectives.

They have received considerable attention in recent\nyears due to their applications in distributed storage. Most existing results\non LRCs do not explicitly take into consideration the field size $q$, i.e., the\nsize of the code alphabet. In particular, for the binary case, only a few\nresults are known.\n  In this work, we present an upper bound on the minimum distance $d$ of linear\nLRCs with availability, based on the work of Cadambe and Mazumdar. The bound\ntakes into account the code length $n$, dimension $k$, locality $r$,\navailability $t$, and field size $q$. Then, we study binary linear LRCs in\nthree aspects. First, we focus on analyzing the locality of some classical\ncodes, i.e., cyclic codes and Reed-Muller codes, and their modified versions,\nwhich are obtained by applying the operations of extend, shorten, expurgate,\naugment, and lengthen. Next, we construct LRCs using phantom parity-check\nsymbols and multi-level tensor product structure, respectively. Compared to\nother previous constructions of binary LRCs with fixed locality or minimum\ndistance, our construction is much more flexible in terms of code parameters,\nand gives various families of high-rate LRCs, some of which are shown to be\noptimal with respect to their minimum distance. Finally, availability of LRCs\nis studied. We investigate the locality and availability properties of several\nclasses of one-step majority-logic decodable codes, including cyclic simplex\ncodes, cyclic difference-set codes, and $4$-cycle free regular low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes.

More precisely, if $T$ denotes\nthe SDS map of such an SDS, then we obtain an explicit formula for\n$|\\text{Per}_r(T)|$, the number of periodic points of $T$ of period $r$, for\nevery positive integer $r$. It turns out that if we fix $r$ and vary $n$ and\n$T$, then $|\\text{Per}_r(T)|$ only takes at most three nonzero values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 05:37:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 20:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2017 02:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 04:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

At the leading order O(p^2) the g-factor of the charged rho meson is\nfixed to be 2, implying that the rho meson at this order is treated just like a\npoint-like spin-1 particle. Beyond the leading order, one finds anomalous\nmagnetic interactions of the charged rho meson, involving the anomalous\nmagnetic moment, which give corrections to the effective mass. It is then\nsuggested that up to O(p^4) the charged rho meson tends to become massless. Of\ninterest is that nontrivial magnetic-dependence of neutral mesons emerges to\ngive rise to the significant mixing among neutral mesons.

Our main result is a\nrigorous polynomial lower bound on the minimum spectral gap for the adiabatic\nevolution when the bit-symmetric cost function has a thin but polynomially high\nbarrier. This is accomplished by the use of a variational argument with an\nimproved ansatz for the ground state, along with a comparison to the spectrum\nof the system when no spike term is present.

The interpretation of\nnon-sentential utterances is an important problem in computational linguistics\nsince they constitute a frequent phenomena in dialogue and they are\nintrinsically context-dependent. The interpretation of NSUs is the task of\nretrieving their full semantic content from their form and the dialogue\ncontext. The first half of this thesis is devoted to the NSU classification\ntask. Our work builds upon Fern\\'andez et al. (2007) which present a series of\nmachine-learning experiments on the classification of NSUs.

An explicit calculation shows that the attractive\nCoulomb force density is balanced exactly at every point in space by the\nrepulsive confinement force density. The latter requires evaluating the\ndivergence of the stress tensor for the 1s solution of the Dirac equation. Such\na local force balance goes beyond the global stability criteria that are\nusually given for the H atom. This concept is extended to the internal\nstability of any charged particle by investigating the force densities acting\non its surrounding vacuum polarization.

Three independent problems are described for up-link and down-\nlink in terms of two distinguished optimization problems. At first, in up-link,\nPulse-width optimization is proposed to reduce dispersions over fibers as the\nterrestrial part. This is performed for return-to-zero (RZ) modulation that is\nsupposed to be used as an example in here. This is carried out by solving the\nfirst optimization problem, while minimizing the probability of overlapping for\nthe Gaussian pulses that are used to produce RZ. Some constraints are assumed\nsuch as a threshold for the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In down-link,\nthe second and the third problems are discussed as follows, jointly as a\nclosed-form solution. Solving the second optimization problem, an objective\nfunction is obtained, namely the MIMO CDMA-based satellite weight-matrix as a\nconventional adaptive beam-former. The Satellite link is stablished over flat\nun-correlated Nakagami-m/Suzuki fading channels as the second problem. On the\nother hand, the mentioned optimization problem is robustly solved as the third\nimportant problem, while considering inter-cell interferences in the multi-cell\nscenario. Robust solution is performed due to the partial knowledge of each\ncell from the others in which the link capacity is maximized.
