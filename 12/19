This paper presents a\nmethod which learns linear models based on the local geometrical structure on\nthe high-resolution manifold rather than on the low-resolution manifold. For\nthis, in a first step, the low-resolution patch is used to derive a globally\noptimal estimate of the high-resolution patch. The approximated solution is\nshown to be close in Euclidean space to the ground-truth but is generally\nsmooth and lacks the texture details needed by state-ofthe-art face\nrecognizers. This first estimate allows us to find the support of the\nhigh-resolution manifold using sparse coding (SC), which are then used as\nsupport for learning a local projection (or upscaling) model between the\nlow-resolution and the highresolution manifolds using Multivariate Ridge\nRegression (MRR). Experimental results show that the proposed method\noutperforms six face super-resolution methods in terms of both recognition and\nquality. These results also reveal that the recognition and quality are\nsignificantly affected by the method used for stitching all super-resolved\npatches together, where quilting was found to better preserve the texture\ndetails which helps to achieve higher recognition rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 16:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

A resonant bump at a mass of around 750\nGeV in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum is indicated and the corresponding\ndiphoton production cross section is around 3-10 fb. Motivated by the LHC\ndiphoton excess, we propose that the possible resonance candidate is a Higgs\nsinglet. To produce the Higgs singlet via gluon-gluon fusion process, we embed\nthe Higgs singlet in the framework of vector-like triplet quark (VLTQ) model.\nAs a result, the Higgs singlet decaying to diphoton final state is via VLTQ\nloops. Using the enhanced number of new quarks and new Yukawa couplings of the\nVLTQs and Higgs singlet, we successfully explain the diphoton production cross\nsection. We find that the width of the Higgs singlet is below 1 GeV, its\nproduction cross section can be of order of 1 pb at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, and the\nbranching ratio for it decaying to diphoton is around $0.017$ and is\ninsensitive to the masses of VLTQs and new Yukawa couplings.

Spectra obtained using OSIRIS on the Gran Telescopio\nCANARIAS (GTC) show DES14X3taz is a SLSN-I at z=0.608. Multi-color photometry\nreveals a double-peaked light curve: a blue and relatively bright initial peak\nthat fades rapidly prior to the slower rise of the main light curve. Our\nmulti-color photometry allows us, for the first time, to show that the initial\npeak cools from 22,000K to 8,000K over 15 rest-frame days, and is faster and\nbrighter than any published core-collapse supernova, reaching 30% of the\nbolometric luminosity of the main peak. No physical Nickel powered model can\nfit this initial peak. We show that a shock-cooling model followed by a\nmagnetar driving the second phase of the light curve can adequately explain the\nentire light curve of DES14X3taz. Models involving the shock-cooling of\nextended circumstellar material at a distance of ~400 solar radii are preferred\nover the cooling of shock-heated surface layers of a stellar envelope. We\ncompare DES14X3taz to the few double-peaked SLSN-I events in the literature.\nAlthough the rise-times and characteristics of these initial peaks differ,\nthere exists the tantalizing possibility that they can be explained by one\nphysical interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 17:21:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 13:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In contrast, the heavy Fermion superconductors U vs Tc are strongly\n(up to a factor of 100) enhanced above the IBS/BCS while the cuprate\nsuperconductors U are strongly (factor of 8) reduced. However, scaling of U\nwith the specific heat gamma (or deltaC) brings all the superconductors\ninvestigated onto one universal dependence upon Tc. This apparent universal\nscaling U/gamma = 0.2Tc**2 for all superconductor classes investigated, both\nweak and strong coupled and both conventional and unconventional, links\ntogether extremely disparate behaviors over almost seven orders of magnitude\nfor U and almost three orders of magnitude for Tc. Since U has not yet been\nexplicitly calculated beyond the weak coupling limit, the present results can\nhelp direct theoretical efforts into the medium and strong coupling regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 21:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

We\ndescribe our results in terms of a sequence of parameters $(s_n)_{n\\geq 1}$\nthat quantifies the extreme-value behavior of small weights, and that describes\ndifferent universality classes for first passage percolation on the complete\ngraph. We consider both $n$-independent as well as $n$-dependent edge weights.\nThe simplest example consists of edge weights of the form $E^{s_n}$, where $E$\nis an exponential random variable with mean 1.\n  In this paper, we focus on the case where $s_n\\rightarrow \\infty$ with\n$s_n=o(n^{1/3})$. Under mild regularity conditions, we identify the scaling\nlimit of the weight of the smallest-weight path between two uniform vertices,\nand we prove that the number of edges in this path obeys a central limit\ntheorem with asymptotic mean $s_n\\log{(n/s_n^3)}$ and variance\n$s_n^2\\log{(n/s_n^3)}$. This settles a conjecture of Bhamidi and van der\nHofstad [6]. The proof relies on a decomposition of the smallest-weight tree\ninto an initial part following invasion percolation dynamics, and a main part\nfollowing branching process dynamics. The initial part has been studied in\n[14]; the current article focuses on the global branching dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 21:31:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 10:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Time delays between channels for an active region exhibit a\nwide range of values, with maxima $>$ 5,000\\,s. These large time delays make up\n3-26\\% (depending on the channel pair) of the pixels where a significant,\npositive time delay is measured. It has been suggested that time delays can be\nexplained by impulsive heating. In this paper, we investigate whether the\nlargest observed time delays can be explained by this hypothesis by simulating\na series of coronal loops with different heating rates, loop lengths,\nabundances, and geometries to determine the range of expected time delays\nbetween a set of four EUV channels. We find that impulsive heating cannot\naddress the largest time delays observed in two of the channel pairs and that\nthe majority of the large time delays can only be explained by long, expanding\nloops with photospheric abundances. Additional observations may rule out these\nsimulations as an explanation for the long time delays. We suggest that either\nthe time delays found in this manner may not be representative of real loop\nevolution, or that the impulsive heating and cooling scenario may be too simple\nto explain the observations and other heating scenarios must be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 21:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

With respect to the cumulative Kepler Object of\nInterest (KOI) catalog, we designate 1,478 new KOIs, of which 402 are\ndispositioned as planet candidates (PCs). Also, 237 KOIs dispositioned as false\npositives (FPs) in previous Kepler catalogs have their disposition changed to\nPC and 118 PCs have their disposition changed to FP. This brings the total\nnumber of known KOIs to 8,826 and PCs to 4,696. We compare the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI\ncatalog to previous KOI catalogs, as well as ancillary Kepler catalogs, finding\ngood agreement between them. We highlight new PCs that are both potentially\nrocky and potentially in the habitable zone of their host stars, many of which\norbit solar-type stars.

Most of this inability to\nachieve high throughput is explained by the fundamental constraints involved in\nguaranteeing ACID --- the addition of cores results in more concurrent\ntransactions accessing the same contended data for which access must be\nserialized in order to guarantee isolation. Thus, linear scalability for\ncontended workloads is impossible. However, there exist flaws in many modern\narchitectures that exacerbate their poor scalability, and result in throughput\nthat is much worse than fundamentally required by the workload.\n  In this paper we identify two prevalent design principles that limit the\nmulti-core scalability of many (but not all) transactional database systems on\ncontended workloads: the multi-purpose nature of execution threads in these\nsystems, and the lack of advanced planning of data access. We demonstrate the\ndeleterious results of these design principles by implementing a prototype\nsystem, ORTHRUS, that is motivated by the principles of separation of database\ncomponent functionality and advanced planning of transactions. We find that\nthese two principles alone result in significantly improved scalability on\nhigh-contention workloads, and an order of magnitude increase in throughput for\na non-trivial subset of these contended workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 00:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 19:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 16:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

The work in this paper builds on the\npreviously proposed self-triggered pursuit strategy which guarantees capture of\nthe evader in finite time with a finite number of evader samples. However, this\nalgorithm relied on the unrealistic assumption that the evader's exact position\nwas available to the pursuer. Instead, we extend our previous framework to\ndevelop an algorithm which allows for uncertainties in sampling the information\nabout the evader, and derive tolerable upper-bounds on the error such that the\npursuer can guarantee capture of the evader. In addition, we outline the\nadvantages of retaining the evader's history in improving the current estimate\nof the true location of the evader that can be used to capture the evader with\neven less samples. Our approach is in sharp contrast to the existing works in\nliterature and our results ensure capture without sacrificing any performance\nin terms of guaranteed time-to-capture, as compared to classic algorithms that\nassume continuous availability of information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 04:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 20:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

A possible remedy can be found in the promising new theory\nof compressed sensing (CS), which allows for the accurate recovery of sparse\nsignals from sub-Nyquist sampling given certain measurement conditions. We\nprovide an introductory assessment of optimal arrays for CS in snapshot-mode\nradio interferometry, using orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), a widely used CS\nrecovery algorithm similar in some respects to CLEAN. We focus on centrally\ncondensed (specifically, Gaussian) arrays versus uniform arrays, and the\nprinciple of randomization versus deterministic arrays such as the VLA. The\ntheory of CS is grounded in $a)$ sparse representation of signals and $b)$\nmeasurement matrices of low coherence. We calculate a related quantity, mutual\ncoherence (MC), as a theoretical indicator of arrays' suitability for OMP based\non the recovery error bounds in (Donoho et al. 2006). OMP reconstructions of\nboth point and extended objects are also run from simulated incomplete data.\nOptimal arrays are considered for object recovery through 1) the natural pixel\nrepresentation and 2) the representation by the block discrete cosine transform\n(BDCT). We find that reconstructions of the pixel representation perform best\nwith the uniform random array, while reconstructions of the BDCT representation\nperform best with normal random arrays. Slight randomization to the VLA also\nimproves it hugely for CS with the pixel basis. In the pixel basis, array\ndesign for CS reflects known principles of array design for small numbers of\nantennas, namely of randomness and uniform distribution. Differing results with\nthe BDCT, however, emphasize the importance of studying how sparsifying bases\naffect array design before CS can be optimized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 04:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

We conclude that emission-line spectra of low-metallicity BCDs in the\n0.36-2.40mum wavelength range are emitted by a relatively transparent ionized\ngas. The H2 emission line fluxes can be accounted for by fluorescence in most\nof the observed galaxies.

With the use of published data on the chemical\ncomposition of the PLD, along with existing analytical models of the disk\nstructure, we show that the high temperatures that were prevalent in the disk\nwould have led to ionization of Na, K, SiO, Zn and, to a lesser extent, O$_2$.\nWe assume that the disk has a vapor structure. The resulting ionization\nfractions, together with a relatively weak magnetic field, would have been\nsufficient to trigger the magneto-rotational instability, or MRI. We calculate\nthe intensity of the resulting magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, as parameterized\nby the dimensionless ratio $\\alpha$ of turbulent stresses to gas pressure, and\nobtain maximum values $\\alpha\\sim 10^{-2}$ along most of the vertical extent of\nthe disk, and at different orbital radii. Under these conditions, turbulent\nmixing within the PLD due to the MRI was likely capable of transporting\nisotopic and chemical species efficiently. To test these results in a\nconservative manner, we carry out a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of\na small, rectangular patch of the PLD, located at 4 Earth radii ($r_{\\rm E}$)\nfrom the center of the Earth, and assuming once again that the disk is\ncompletely gaseous. We obtain turbulence with an average intensity $\\alpha\\sim\n7\\times 10^{-6}$ over the course of 280 orbital periods (133 days at\n4$r_{\\rm{E}}$). Despite this relatively low value of $\\alpha$, the effective\nturbulent diffusivity of a passive tracer introduced in the flow is large\nenough to allow the tracer to spread across a radial distance of $10r_{\\rm{E}}$\nin $\\sim13-129$ yr, less than the estimated cooling time of the PLD of\n$\\sim250$ yr. Further improvements to our model will need to incorporate the\nenergy balance in the disk, a complete two-phase structure, and a more\nrealistic equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2015 05:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Currently they can harness multiple GPUs on a single machine, but are\nunable to use GPUs that are distributed across multiple machines; as even\naverage-sized DNNs can take days to train on a single GPU with 100s of GBs to\nTBs of data, distributed GPUs present a prime opportunity for scaling up DL.\nHowever, the limited bandwidth available on commodity Ethernet networks\npresents a bottleneck to distributed GPU training, and prevents its trivial\nrealization.\n  To investigate how to adapt existing frameworks to efficiently support\ndistributed GPUs, we propose Poseidon, a scalable system architecture for\ndistributed inter-machine communication in existing DL frameworks. We integrate\nPoseidon with Caffe and evaluate its performance at training DNNs for object\nrecognition. Poseidon features three key contributions that accelerate DNN\ntraining on clusters: (1) a three-level hybrid architecture that allows\nPoseidon to support both CPU-only and GPU-equipped clusters, (2) a distributed\nwait-free backpropagation (DWBP) algorithm to improve GPU utilization and to\nbalance communication, and (3) a structure-aware communication protocol (SACP)\nto minimize communication overheads.

Through the action of controllable Energy\nTransmitters (ETs) that operate at-a-distance, the sensors can be re-charged by\nharvesting the radiated RF energy. However, both the charging rate and\neffective charging range of the ETs are limited, and thus multiple ETs are\nrequired to cover large areas. While this action increases the amount of\nwireless energy injected into the network, there are certain areas where the RF\nenergy combines destructively.

In this paper the effect of surface roughness on the\nT2 relaxation spectrum is studied. By homogenization of the problem using an\nelectrostatic approach it is found that the effective surface relaxivity can\nincrease dramatically in the presence of rough surfaces. This leads to a\nsituation where the system responds as a smooth pore, but with significantly\nincreased surface relaxivity. As a result: the standard approach of assuming an\nidealized geometry with known surface-to-volume and inverting the T2 relaxation\nspectrum to a pore size distribution is no longer valid. The effective\nrelaxivity is found to be fairly insensitive to the shape of roughness but\nstrongly dependent on the width and depth of the surface topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 19:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}
