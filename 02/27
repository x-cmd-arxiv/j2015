Exoplanet searches have unveiled a large\npopulation of short-period objects with hot atmospheres, very different from\nwhat we find in our solar system. Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can\nnow be studied by transit spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and\nhave typical temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV\nphotolysis cross section data are severely lacking. Our goal is to provide\nhigh-temperature absorption cross sections and their temperature dependency for\nimportant atmospheric compounds. This study is dedicated to CO2, which is\nobserved and photodissociated in exoplanet atmospheres. We performed these\nmeasurements for the 115 - 200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and 550 K. In the 195\n- 230 nm range, we worked at seven temperatures between 465 and 800 K. We found\nthat the absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to temperature,\nespecially above 160 nm. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross\nsection can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,\nmakes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230 nm,\nwhile it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K. To investigate the influence of\nthese new data on the photochemistry of exoplanets, we implemented the measured\ncross section into a 1D photochemical model.

The domain considered is bounded by\nperiodic boundary conditions in the two directions perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field and by two plane Hartmann walls in the third direction. High\nmagnetic fields (Hartmann number of up to 896) are considered thanks to a\nnumerical method based on a spectral code using the eigenvectors of the\ndissipation operator. It is found that the decay proceeds through two phases:\nfirst, energy and integral lengthscales vary rapidly during a\ntwo-dimensionalisation phase extending over about one Hartmann friction time.\nDuring this phase, the evolution of the former appears significantly more\nimpeded by the presence of walls than that of the latter. Once the large scales\nare close to quasi-two dimensional, the decay results from the competition of a\ntwo-dimensional dynamics driven by dissipation in the Hartmann boundary layers\nand the three-dimensional dynamics of smaller scales. In the later stages of\nthe decay, three-dimensionality subsists under the form of barrel-shaped\nstructures. A purely quasi-two dimensional decay dominated by friction in the\nHartmann layers is not reached, because of residual dissipation in the bulk.\nHowever, this dissipation is not generated by the three-dimensionality that\nsubsists, but by residual viscous friction due to horizontal velocity\ngradients. Also, the energy in the velocity component aligned with the magnetic\nfield is found to be strongly suppressed, as is transport in this direction.\nThis results reproduces the experimental findings of Kolesnikov & Tsinober\n(1974).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 16:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 17:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

These\nare one of the most powerful probes to infer the properties of the plasma in\nthe innermost part of the accretion disk around a compact object. In this paper\nwe present a recent Suzaku observation, 100-ks effective exposure, of the atoll\nsource and X-ray burster 4U 1705-44, where we clearly detect signatures of a\nreflection component which is distorted by the high-velocity motion in the\naccretion disk. The reflection component consists of a broad iron line at about\n6.4 keV and a Compton bump at high X-ray energies, around 20 keV. All these\nfeatures are consistently fitted with a reflection model, and we find that in\nthe hard state the smearing parameters are remarkably similar to those found in\na previous XMM-Newton observation performed in the soft state. In particular,\nwe find that the inner disk radius is Rin = 17 +/- 5 Rg (where Rg is the\nGravitational radius, GM/c^2), the emissivity dependence from the disk radius\nis -2.5 +/- 0.5, the inclination angle with respect to the line of sight is i =\n43 +/- 5 degrees, and the outer radius of the emitting region in the disk is\nRout > 200 Rg. We note that the accretion disk does not appear to be truncated\nat large radii, although the source is in a hard state at about 3 % of the\nEddington luminosity for a neutron star. We also find evidence of a broad\nemission line at low energies, at 3.03 +/- 0.03 keV, compatible with emission\nfrom mildly ionized Argon (Ar XVI-XVII). Argon transitions are not included in\nthe self-consistent reflection models that we used and we therefore added an\nextra component to our model to fit this feature. The low energy line appears\ncompatible with being smeared by the same inner disk parameters found for the\nreflection component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 18:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Previous studies of NGC 2264 have shown\nthat similar photometric behavior is common among CTTS.\n  The goal of this work is to investigate the main causes of the observed\nphotometric variability of CTTS in NGC 2264 that present AA Tau-like light\ncurves, and verify if an inner disk warp could be responsible for their\nvariability. We investigate veiling variability in their spectra and u-r color\nvariations and estimate parameters of the inner disk warp using an occultation\nmodel proposed for AA Tau. We compare infrared and optical light curves to\nanalyze the dust responsible for the occultations. AA Tau-like variability is\ntransient on a timescale of a few years. We ascribe it to stable accretion\nregimes and aperiodic variability to unstable accretion regimes and show that a\ntransition, and even coexistence, between the two is common. We find evidence\nof hot spots associated with occultations, indicating that the occulting\nstructures could be located at the base of accretion columns. We find average\nvalues of warp maximum height of 0.23 times its radial location, consistent\nwith AA Tau, with variations of on average 11% between rotation cycles.

This necessary condition for viability\nwas proposed by Myerson (1977) and is modeled via an interaction graph\n$G=(V,E)$; a coalition $S\\subseteq V$ is then viable if and only if the induced\ngraph $G[S]$ is connected. The non-emptiness of the core of a coalition game\ncan be tested by a well-known covering LP. Moreover, the integrality gap of its\ndual packing LP defines exactly the multiplicative least-core and the relative\ncost of stability of the coalition game. This gap is upper bounded by the\npacking-covering ratio which, for graphical coalition games, is known to be at\nmost the treewidth of the interaction graph plus one (Meir et al. 2013).\n  We examine the packing-covering ratio and integrality gaps of graphical\ncoalition games in more detail. We introduce the thicket parameter of a graph,\nand prove it precisely measures the packing-covering ratio. It also\napproximately measures the primal and dual integrality gaps. The thicket number\nprovides an upper bound of both integrality gaps. Moreover we show that for any\ninteraction graph, the primal integrality gap is, in the worst case, linear in\nterms of the thicket number while the dual integrality gap is polynomial in\nterms of it. At the heart of our results, is a graph theoretic minmax theorem\nshowing the thicket number is equal to the minimum width of a vine\ndecomposition of the coalition graph (a vine decomposition is a generalization\nof a tree decomposition).

First, by the choice of\nappropriate units, the number of governing parameters of the collision process\nis reduced to one, which is a simple combination of known material parameters\nas well as initial conditions.

The bimodal\n(anomalous) option (B) was frequently regarded as an artifact (lattice or\nother) in previous studies, but we show for the first time that it persists in\nthe continuum limit, and conclude that it informs of a non-confining phase with\nbroken valence chiral symmetry. This generalization rests on the following.\n$(\\alpha)$ We show that bimodality in $N_f$=0 theory past deconfinement\ntemperature $T_c$ is stable with respect to removal of both infrared and\nultraviolet cutoffs, indicating that anomalous phase is not an artifact.\n$(\\beta)$ We demonstrate that transition to bimodality in $N_f$=0 is\nsimultaneous with the loss of confinement: anomalous phase occurs for $T_c < T\n< T_{ch}$, where $T_{ch}$ is the valence chiral restoration temperature.\n$(\\gamma)$ Evidence is presented for thermal anomalous phase in $N_f$=2+1 QCD\nat physical quark masses, whose onset too coincides with the conventional\n\"crossover $T_c$''.

Similar to the original\ntemporal-domain COLA, sCOLA is an N-body method for solving for large-scale\nstructure in a frame that is comoving with observers following trajectories\ncalculated in Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. Incorporating the sCOLA method in\nan N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the\ngravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while\nletting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields\nare completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of\nthe code. Thus, running an N-body code for a small simulation volume using\nsCOLA can reproduce the results of a standard N-body run for the same small\nvolume embedded inside a much larger simulation. We demonstrate that sCOLA can\nbe safely combined with the original temporal-domain COLA. sCOLA can be used as\na method for performing zoom-in simulations. It also allows N-body codes to be\nmade embarrassingly parallel, thus allowing for efficiently tiling a volume of\ninterest using grid computing. Moreover, sCOLA can be useful for cheaply\ngenerating large ensembles of accurate mock halo catalogs required to study\ngalaxy clustering. Surveys that will benefit the most are ones with large\naspect ratios, such as pencil-beam surveys, where sCOLA can easily capture the\neffects of large-scale transverse modes without the need to substantially\nincrease the simulated volume.

If the symmetry of the system is unitary, then a\nformal way to determine whether a $d-$dim theory must be a boundary or not, is\nto couple this theory to a gauge field (or to \"gauge\" its symmetry), and check\nif there is a gauge anomaly. In this paper we discuss the following question:\ncan the boundary of a SPT state be driven into a fully gapped topological order\nwhich preserves all the symmetries? We argue that if the gauge anomaly of the\nboundary is \"perturbative\", then the boundary must remain gapless; while if the\nboundary only has global gauge anomaly but no perturbative anomaly, then it is\npossible to gap out the boundary by driving it into a topological state, when\n$d \\geq 2$.

These results hold even in the\npresence of severe systematics and provide, for the first time, a mechanism to\nvalidate the uncertainties on these parameters via comparison with\nspectroscopic redshifts. We propose a new technique (annealing) to re-calibrate\nthe joint uncertainties in the photo-z and SED fitting parameters without\ncompromising the performance of the SED fitting + photo-z estimation. This\nprocedure provides a consistent estimation of the multidimensional probability\ndistribution function in SED fitting + z parameter space, including all\ncorrelations. While the performance of joint SED fitting and photo-z estimation\nmight be hindered by template incompleteness, we demonstrate that the latter is\n\"flagged\" by a large fraction of outliers in redshift, and that significant\nimprovements can be achieved by using flexible stellar populations synthesis\nmodels and more realistic star formation histories. In all cases, we find that\nthe median stellar age is better recovered than the time elapsed from the onset\nof star formation [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 21:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

There are many uncertainties involved in modelling the\nevolution and nucleosynthesis of AGB stars, and this is especially the case at\nlow metallicity, where most of the stars with high enough masses to enter the\nAGB have evolved to become white dwarfs and can no longer be observed. The\nstellar population in the Galactic halo is of low mass ($\\lesssim\n0.85M_{\\odot}$) and only a few observed stars have evolved beyond the first\ngiant branch. However, we have evidence that low-metallicity AGB stars in\nbinary systems have interacted with their low-mass secondary companions in the\npast. The aim of this work is to investigate AGB nucleosynthesis at low\nmetallicity by studying the surface abundances of chemically peculiar very\nmetal-poor stars of the halo observed in binary systems. To this end we select\na sample of 15 carbon- and $s$-element-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-$s$) halo\nstars that are found in binary systems with measured orbital periods. With our\nmodel of binary evolution and AGB nucleosynthesis, we determine the binary\nconfiguration that best reproduces, at the same time, the observed orbital\nperiod and surface abundances of each star of the sample. The observed periods\nprovide tight constraints on our model of wind mass transfer in binary stars,\nwhile the comparison with the observed abundances tests our model of AGB\nnucleosynthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 21:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

This\nstudy aims to quantify the diffusion kinetics and barrier of the abundant ice\nconstituent CO into H2O dominated ices at low temperatures (15-23 K), by\nmeasuring the mixing rate of initially layered H2O(:CO2)/CO ices. The mixed\nfraction of CO as a function of time is determined by monitoring the shape of\nthe infrared CO stretching band.

The derived barrier is low compared to current surface\ndiffusion barriers in use in astrochemical models.

We demonstrate\nthat internal gravity waves (IGW), excited via envelope convection during a red\nsupergiant phase or during vigorous late time burning phases, can have a\nsignificant impact on the rotation rate of the pre-SN core. In typical ($10 \\,\nM_\\odot \\lesssim M \\lesssim 20 \\, M_\\odot$) supernova progenitors, IGW may\nsubstantially spin down the core, leading to iron core rotation periods $P_{\\rm\nmin,Fe} \\gtrsim 30 \\, {\\rm s}$. Angular momentum (AM) conservation during the\nsupernova would entail minimum NS rotation periods of $P_{\\rm min,NS} \\gtrsim 3\n\\, {\\rm ms}$. In most cases, the combined effects of magnetic torques and IGW\nAM transport likely lead to substantially longer rotation periods. However, the\nstochastic influx of AM delivered by IGW during shell burning phases inevitably\nspin up a slowly rotating stellar core, leading to a maximum possible core\nrotation period. We estimate maximum iron core rotation periods of $P_{\\rm\nmax,Fe} \\lesssim 5 \\times 10^3 \\, {\\rm s}$ in typical core-collapse supernova\nprogenitors, and a corresponding spin period of $P_{\\rm max, NS} \\lesssim 500\n\\, {\\rm ms}$ for newborn neutron stars. This is comparable to the typical birth\nspin periods of most radio pulsars. Stochastic spin-up via IGW during shell\nO/Si burning may thus determine the initial rotation rate of most neutron\nstars.

In most real-world applications, even though the\nenvironment is 3D, the grounded sensor nodes are usually deployed on 2D planar\nsurfaces. Examples of these surfaces include structures seen in both indoor\n(e.g. floors, doors, walls, tables etc.) and outdoor (e.g. mountains, valleys,\nhills etc.) environments. In such environments, sensor nodes typically appear\nas coplanar node clusters. We refer to this type of a deployment as a planar\ndeployment. When there is a planar deployment, the coplanarity causes\ndifficulties to the traditional range-based multilateration algorithms because\na node cannot be unambiguously localized if the distance measurements to that\nnode are from coplanar nodes. Thus, many already localized groups of nodes are\nrendered ineffective in the process just because they are coplanar. We,\ntherefore propose an algorithm called Coplanarity Based Localization (CBL) that\ncan be used as an extension of any localization algorithm to avoid most flips\ncaused by coplanarity.

This observation has led to\nspeculation about what role, if any, microscopic disorder may play in enhancing\nexciton transport properties. In this article, we present the results of a\nmodel study aimed at addressing this point. Specifically, we present a general\nmodel, based upon F\\\"orster theory, for incoherent exciton diffusion in a\nmaterial composed of independent molecular subunits with static energetic\ndisorder. Energetic disorder leads to heterogeneity in molecule-to-molecule\ntransition rates which we demonstrate has two important consequences related to\nexciton transport. First, the distribution of local site-specific diffusivity\nis broadened in a manner that results in a decrease in average exciton\ndiffusivity relative to that in a perfectly ordered film. Second, since\nexcitons prefer to make transitions that are downhill in energy, the steady\nstate distribution of exciton energies is biased towards low energy molecular\nsubunits, those that exhibit reduced diffusivity relative to a perfectly\nordered film. These effects combine to reduce the net diffusivity in a manner\nthat is time dependent and grows more pronounced as disorder is increased.\nNotably, however, we demonstrate that the presence of energetic disorder can\ngive rise to a population of molecular subunits with exciton transfer rates\nexceeding that of subunits in an energetically uniform material. Such\nenhancements may play an important role in processes that are sensitive to\nmolecular-scale fluctuations in exciton density field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 01:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-02"}

The method is applicable to computational tasks that\nsolve a sequence of eigenvalue problems where the solution for a particular\niteration is similar but not identical to the solution from the previous\niteration. Such problems occur frequently when performing electronic structure\ncalculations in which the eigenvectors are solutions to the Kohn-Sham\nequations. The eigenvectors are represented in some type of basis but the\nproblem sizes are normally too large for direct diagonalization in that basis.\nInstead a subspace diagonalization procedure is employed in which matrix\nelements of the Hamiltonian operator are generated and the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the resulting reduced matrix are obtained using a standard\neigensolver from a package such as LAPACK or SCALAPACK. While this method works\nwell and is widely used, the standard eigensolvers scale poorly on massively\nparallel computer systems for the matrix sizes typical of electronic structure\ncalculations. We present a new method that utilizes a partitioned folded\nspectrum scheme (PFSM) that takes into account the iterative nature of the\nproblem and performs well on massively parallel systems.

Such dark matter can arise in simple hidden\nsector gauge models, including those featuring an unbroken $U(1)'$ gauge\nsymmetry, leading to a dark photon. Previous work has shown that such models\ncan not only explain the LSS and CMB, but potentially also dark matter\nphenomena on small scales, such as the inferred cored structure of dark matter\nhalos. In this picture, dark matter halos of disk galaxies not only cool via\ndissipative interactions but are also heated via ordinary supernovae\n(facilitated by an assumed photon - dark photon kinetic mixing interaction).\nThis interaction between the dark matter halo and ordinary baryons, a very\nspecial feature of these types of models, plays a critical role in governing\nthe physical properties of the dark matter halo. Here, we further study the\nimplications of this type of dissipative dark matter for disk galaxies.\nBuilding on earlier work, we develop a simple formalism which aims to describe\nthe effects of dissipative dark matter in a fairly model independent way. This\nformalism is then applied to generic disk galaxies. We also consider specific\nexamples, including NGC 1560 and a sample of dwarf galaxies from the LITTLE\nTHINGS survey. We find that dissipative dark matter, as developed here, does a\nfairly good job accounting for the rotation curves of the galaxies considered.\nNot only does dissipative dark matter explain the linear rise of the rotational\nvelocity of dwarf galaxies at small radii, but it can also explain the observed\nwiggles in rotation curves which are known to be correlated with corresponding\nfeatures in the disk gas distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 05:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 04:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that\nquantum coherence and entanglement may play a role in this excitation energy\ntransfer (EET). We examine whether bipartite quantum nonlocality, a property\nthat expresses a stronger-than-entanglement form of correlation, exists between\ndifferent pairs of chromophores in the FMO complex when modeling the EET by the\nhierarchically coupled equations of motion method. We compare the results for\nnonlocality with the amount of bipartite entanglement in the system. In\nparticular, we analyze in what way these correlation properties are affected by\ndifferent initial conditions. It is found that bipartite nonlocality only\nexists when the initial conditions are chosen in an unphysiological manner and\nprobably is absent when considering the EET in the FMO complex in its natural\nhabitat. It is also seen that nonlocality and entanglement behave quite\ndifferently in this system. In particular, for localized initial states,\nnonlocality only exists on a very short time scale and then drops to zero in an\nabrupt manner. As already known from previous studies, quantum entanglement\nbetween chromophore pairs on the other hand is oscillating and exponentially\ndecaying and follow thereby a pattern more similar to the chromophore\npopulation dynamics. The abrupt disappearance of nonlocality in the presence of\nnonvanishing entanglement is a phenomenon we call nonlocality sudden death; a\nstriking manifestation of the difference between these two types of\ncorrelations in quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 09:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 14:29:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 12:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

The parameters include the source location, moment tensor components,\nand start time and frequency in the time function. The forward problem is\nmodeled by elastodynamic wave equations. We show that the Hessian of the cost\nfunctional, which is usually defined as the square of the weighted L2 norm of\nthe difference between the experimental data and the simulated data, is\nproportional to the measurement time and the number of receivers. Consequently,\nthe posterior distribution of the parameters, in a Bayesian setting,\nconcentrates around the \"true\" parameters, and we can employ Laplace\napproximation and speed up the estimation of the expected Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence (expected information gain), the optimality criterion in the\nexperimental design procedure.

While these algorithms are highly interesting from a theoretical\nperspective, there are no published results how they perform in practice.\n  With this paper we address this gap. We provide the first implementation of\nthe combinatorial solver by [Kelner et al., STOC 2013], which is particularly\nappealing for implementation due to its conceptual simplicity. The algorithm\nexploits that a Laplacian matrix corresponds to a graph; solving Laplacian\nlinear systems amounts to finding an electrical flow in this graph with the\nhelp of cycles induced by a spanning tree with the low-stretch property.\n  The results of our comprehensive experimental study are ambivalent. They\nconfirm a nearly-linear running time, but for reasonable inputs the constant\nfactors make the solver much slower than methods with higher asymptotic\ncomplexity. One other aspect predicted by theory is confirmed by our findings,\nthough: Spanning trees with lower stretch indeed reduce the solver's running\ntime. Yet, simple spanning tree algorithms perform in practice better than\nthose with a guaranteed low stretch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 13:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-02"}

Motivated by this limitation, we first propose a receding horizon fault\nestimator parameterized by predictor Markov parameters. This estimator provides\n(asymptotically) unbiased fault estimates as long as the subsystem from faults\nto outputs has no unstable transmission zeros. When the identified Markov\nparameters are used to construct the above fault estimator, zero-mean\nstochastic identification errors appear as model uncertainty multiplied with\nunknown fault signals and online system inputs/outputs (I/O). Based on this\nfault estimation error analysis, we formulate a mixed-norm problem for the\noffline robust design that regards online I/O data as unknown. An alternative\nonline mixed-norm problem is also proposed that can further reduce estimation\nerrors when the online I/O data have large amplitudes, at the cost of increased\ncomputational burden.

Such a\ncorrespondence permits to naturally interpret QNMs as quantum levels in a\nsemi-classical model. This is a model of BH somewhat similar to the historical\nsemi-classical model of the structure of a hydrogen atom introduced by Bohr in\n1913. In a certain sense, QNMs represent the \"electron\" which jumps from a\nlevel to another one and the absolute values of the QNMs frequencies\n\"triggered\" by emissions (Hawking radiation) and absorption of particles\nrepresent the energy \"shells\" of the \"gravitational hydrogen atom\". Important\nconsequences on the BH information puzzle are discussed. In fact, it is shown\nthat the time evolution of this \"Bohr-like BH model\" obeys to a time dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation which permits the final BH state to be a pure quantum\nstate instead of a mixed one. Thus, information comes out in BH evaporation, in\nagreement with the assumption by 't Hooft that Schr\\\"oedinger equations can be\nused universally for all dynamics in the universe. We also show that, in\naddition, our approach solves the entanglement problem connected with the\ninformation paradox. We emphasize that Bohr model is an approximated model of\nthe hydrogen atom with respect to the valence shell atom model of full quantum\nmechanics.

The physical processes that produce these observable\ndifferences are still a matter of debate. In this PhD Thesis I performed a\nstudy of these 4 different systems to provide new data to constrain the models.\nThis study consists of:(i) the determination of the orbital solution,(ii) a\nsystematic study of the wind behavior along the orbit by the measure of Halpha\nvariations,(iii) a model of stellar atmospheres of the donor star,(iv)\nestablish whether there are X-ray flux variations modulated by the orbital\nperiod. The study of the wind shows that Halpha variations are dominated by\nintrinsic wind processes. The stellar atmospheres study shows that the\nsupergiant stars that harbor these binaries have a higher projected rotational\nvelocity, higher He abundance and higher N/C ratio than that of isolated\nsupergiant stars. The results of this study show that the eccentricity of the\nbinary does not have a simple correlation with the differences in the X-ray\nflux of the different sub-groups. Therefore, the idea of a more complex\nscenario is consolidated. The discovery of a new type of system, IGR\nJ00370+6122, which properties do not fit in any of the established sub-groups,\nreinforces the idea of a continuum in the observed properties more than a\nstrict classification of systems.
