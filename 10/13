On this occasion, we\nlook back at the growth of the scientific disciplines involved around the world\nover almost a full century. Solar activity and fields of research looking into\nthe related physics of the heliosphere continue to be vibrant and growing, with\ncurrently over 2,000 refereed publications appearing per year from over 4,000\nunique authors, publishing in dozens of distinct journals and meeting in dozens\nof workshops and conferences each year. The size of the rapidly growing\ncommunity and of the observational and computational data volumes, along with\nthe multitude of connections into other branches of astrophysics, pose\nsignificant challenges; aspects of these challenges are beginning to be\naddressed through, among others, the development of new systems of literature\nreviews, machine-searchable archives for data and publications, and virtual\nobservatories. As customary in these reports, we highlight some of the research\ntopics that have seen particular interest over the most recent triennium,\nspecifically active-region magnetic fields, coronal thermal structure, coronal\nseismology, flares and eruptions, and the variability of solar activity on long\ntime scales. We close with a collection of developments, discoveries, and\nsurprises that illustrate the range and dynamics of the discipline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 16:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

Towards this goal, quasar absorption lines play\na unique role by probing the properties of diffuse gas on galactic and\nintergalactic scales. In this review we examine the multiple ways in which\nabsorption lines trace the connection between galaxies and the IGM near the\nreionization epoch. We first describe how the Ly$\\alpha$ forest is used to\ndetermine the intensity of the ionizing ultraviolet background and the global\nionizing emissivity budget. Critically, these measurements reflect the escaping\nionizing radiation from all galaxies, including those too faint to detect\ndirectly. We then discuss insights from metal absorption lines into\nreionization-era galaxies and their surroundings. Current observations suggest\na buildup of metals in the circumgalactic environments of galaxies over $z \\sim\n6$ to 5, although changes in ionization will also affect the evolution of metal\nline properties. A substantial fraction of metal absorbers at these redshifts\nmay trace relatively low-mass galaxies. Finally, we review constraints from the\nLy$\\alpha$ forest and quasar near zones on the timing of reionization. Along\nwith other probes of the high-redshift Universe, absorption line data are\nconsistent with a relatively late end to reionization ($5.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim\n7$); however the constraints are still fairly weak.

In order to tackle this\nproblem, projected subspace within the high dimensions and limited window sized\ndata per unit of time are used for clustering purpose.

We formulate the basic concepts of the VDA\napproach and introduce the pion transverse momentum distribution amplitude\n(TMDA) which plays, in a covariant Lagrangian formulation, a role similar to\nthat of the pion wave function in the 3-dimensional Hamiltonian light-front\napproach. We propose simple factorized models for soft TMDAs, and use them to\ndescribe existing data on the pion transition form factor, thus fixing the\nscale determining the size of the transverse-momentum effects. Finally, we\napply the VDA approach to the one-gluon exchange contribution for the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor. We observe a very late $Q^2 \\gtrsim 20$ GeV$^2$\nonset of transition to the asymptotic pQCD predictions and show that in the\n$Q^2 \\lesssim 10$ GeV$^2$ region there is essentially no sensitivity to the\nshape of the pion distribution amplitude.

Our main\napplication is to ekpyrotic models in which the primordial curvature\nperturbations are generated via the non-minimal entropic mechanism. In these\nmodels, nearly scale-invariant entropy perturbations are generated first due to\na non-minimal kinetic coupling between two scalar fields, and subsequently\nthese perturbations are converted into curvature perturbations.

This has led to new nontrivial insights into the structure of\ngravity theories, including the discovery of enhanced ultraviolet\ncancellations. To continue to gain deeper understandings and probe these new\nproperties, it is crucial to further improve techniques for constructing\nmultiloop gravity integrands. In this paper, we show by example how one can\nalleviate difficulties encountered at the multiloop level by relaxing the\ncolor-kinematics duality conditions to hold manifestly only on unitarity cuts\ninstead of globally on loop integrands. As an example, we use a minimal ansatz\nto construct an integrand for the two-loop four-point nonsupersymmetric pure\nYang-Mills amplitude in $D$ dimensions that is compatible with these relaxed\ncolor-kinematics duality constraints. We then immediately obtain a\ncorresponding gravity integrand through the double-copy procedure.

The association of\nthe large \"gradual\" SEP events with shock acceleration is supported by the\nextensive spatial distribution of SEPs and by the delayed acceleration of the\nparticles. The relative abundances of the elements in these gradual events are\na measure of those in the ambient solar corona, differing from those in the\nphotosphere by a widely-observed function of the first ionization potential\n(FIP) of the elements. SEP events we call \"impulsive\", the traditional\n\"3He-rich\" events with enhanced heavy-element abundances, are associated with\ntype III radio bursts, flares, and narrow CMEs; they selectively populate flux\ntubes that thread a localized source, and they are fit to new particle-in-cell\nmodels of magnetic reconnection on open field lines as found in solar jets.\nThese models help explain the strong enhancements seen in heavy elements as a\npower (of 2 - 8) in the mass-to-charge ratio A/Q throughout the periodic table\nfrom He to Pb. A study of the temperature dependence of A/Q shows that the\nsource plasma in impulsive SEP events must lie in the range of 2-4 MK to\nexplain the pattern of abundances. This is much lower than the temperatures of\n>10 MK seen on closed loops in solar flares.

This causes a\nlarge bulge in the propagator at small momentum. Mass is defined through\n$m^{-2}=\\Delta (p=0)$, where $\\Delta(p)$ is the scalar function for the gluon\npropagator in some chosen gauge, it is not a pole mass and is generally\ngauge-dependent, except in the gauge-invariant Pinch Technique (PT). We\ntruncate the PT equations with a new method called the vertex paradigm that\nautomatically satisfies the QED-like Ward identity relating the 3-gluon PT\nvertex function with the PT propagator. The mass is determined by a homogeneous\nBethe-Salpeter equation involving this vertex and propagator. This gap equation\nalso encapsulates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless scalar\nexcitations, essentially Nambu-Goldstone fields, that necessarily accompany\ngauge-invariant gluon mass. The problem is to find a good approximate value for\n$m$ and at the same time explain the bulge, which by itself leads, in the gap\nequation for the gluon mass, to excessively large values for the mass. Our\npoint is not to give a high-accuracy determination of $m$ but to clarify the\nway in which the propagator bulge and a fairly accurate estimate of $m$ can\nco-exist, and we use various approximations that illustrate the underlying\nmechanisms. The most critical point is to satisfy the Ward identity. In the PT\nwe estimate a gauge-invariant dynamical gluon mass of $m \\approx Ng^2/(2.48\n\\pi)$.

Similarly, injecting fluid into a porous material can expand\nthe pore space, distorting the solid skeleton. This poromechanical coupling has\napplications ranging from tissue mechanics to hydrogeology. The classical\ntheory of linear poroelasticity captures this coupling by combining Darcy's law\nwith Terzaghi's effective stress and linear elasticity in a linearized\nkinematic framework. Linear poroelasticity is a good model for very small\ndeformations, but it becomes increasingly inappropriate for moderate to large\ndeformations, which are common in the context of phenomena such as swelling and\ndamage, and for soft materials such as gels and tissues. The well-known theory\nof large-deformation poroelasticity combines Darcy's law with Terzaghi's\neffective stress and nonlinear elasticity in a rigorous kinematic framework.\nThis theory has been used extensively in biomechanics to model large elastic\ndeformations in soft tissues, and in geomechanics to model large elastoplastic\ndeformations in soils. Here, we first provide an overview and discussion of\nthis theory with an emphasis on the physics of poromechanical coupling. We\npresent the large-deformation theory in an Eulerian framework to minimize the\nmathematical complexity, and we show how this nonlinear theory simplifies to\nlinear poroelasticity under the assumption of small strain.

The spin\nwaves in plasmas were considered among new phenomena considered in spin-1/2\nquantum plasmas. The spin density evolution equation found by means of the\nmany-particle quantum hydrodynamics shows existence of the \"thermal\" part of\nthe spin current, which is an analog of the thermal pressure, or the Fermi\npressure for degenerate electron gas, existing in the Euler equation. However,\nthis term has been dropped, since there has not been found any equation of\nstate for the thermal part of the spin current (TPSC), like we have for the\npressure. In this paper we derive the equation of state for the TPSC and apply\nit for study of spectrum of collective excitations in spin-1/2 quantum plasmas.\nWe focus our research on the spectrum of spin waves, since this spectrum is\naffected by the thermal part of the spin current. We consider two kinds of\nplasmas: electron-ion plasma with motionless ions and degenerate electrons, and\ndegenerate electron-positron plasmas. We also present the non-linear Pauli\nequation with the spinor pressure term containing described effects.

Our scaling theory predicts new exponents,\nexponent equalities and scaling collapses for energy, pressure and shear stress\nthat we verify with numerical simulations of jammed packings of soft spheres.\nIt also yields new insight into why the shear and bulk moduli exhibit different\nscalings; the difference arises because the shear stress vanishes as\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$ while the pressure approaches a constant in the thermodynamic\nlimit.

Focusing on planets orbiting Red Dwarf (RD) stars, the\nmost abundant stellar type, we show that including RDs as potential host stars\ncould increase the probability of finding biotic planets by a factor of up to a\nthousand, and reduce the estimate of the distance to our nearest biotic\nneighbor by up to 10. We argue that binary and multiple star systems need to be\ntaken into account when discussing exoplanet habitability. Early considerations\nindicated that conditions on RD planets would be inimical to life, as their\nHabitable Zones (where liquid water could exist) would be so close as to make\nplanets tidally locked to their star. This was thought to cause an erratic\nclimate and expose life forms to flares of ionizing radiation. Recent\ncalculations show that these negative factors are less severe than originally\nthought. It has been argued that the lesser photon energy of the radiation of\nthe relatively cool RDs would not suffice for Oxygenic Photosynthesis (OP) and\nother related energy expending reactions. Numerous authors suggest that OP on\nRD planets may evolve to utilize photons in the infrared. We however argue, by\nanalogy to the evolution of OP and the environmental physiology and\ndistribution of land-based vegetation on Earth, that the evolutionary pressure\nto utilize infrared radiation would be small. This is because vegetation on RD\nplanets could enjoy continuous illumination of moderate intensity, containing a\nsignificant component of photosynthetic 400-700 nm radiation. We conclude that\nconditions for OP could exist on RD planets and consequently the evolution of\ncomplex life might be possible. Furthermore, the huge number and the long\nlifetime of RDs make it more likely to find planets with photosynthesis and\nlife around RDs than around solar type stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 23:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The common assumption is that the probe collects\nthe random flux of electrons incident on the sheath, which tacitly implies that\nthere is no electron presheath and that the flux collected is due to a velocity\nspace truncation of the electron velocity distribution function (EVDF). This\nwork provides a dedicated theory of electron sheaths, which suggests that they\nare not so simple. Motivated by EVDFs observed in Particle-In-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations, a 1D model for the electron sheath and presheath is developed. In\nthe model, under low temperature plasma conditions ($T_e\\gg T_i$), an electron\npressure gradient accelerates electrons in the presheath to a flow velocity\nthat exceeds the electron thermal speed at the sheath edge. This pressure\ngradient generates large flow velocities compared to what would be generated by\nballistic motion in response to the electric field. It is found that in many\nsituations, under common plasma conditions, the electron presheath extends much\nfurther into the plasma than an analogous ion presheath. PIC simulations reveal\nthat the ion density in the electron presheath is determined by a flow around\nthe electron sheath and that this flow is due to 2D aspects of the sheath\ngeometry. Simulations also indicate the presence of ion acoustic waves excited\nby the differential flow between electrons and ions in the presheath which\nresult in sheath edge fluctuations. The 1D model and time averaged PIC\nsimulations are compared and it is shown that the model provides a good\ndescription of the electron sheath and presheath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 00:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-01"}

A growing number of\napplications, e.g. energy-efficient localization and cellular provider side\nlocalization, depend on the availability of only sparse and coarse-grained\npositioning data; leading to a challenging map matching process.\n  In this paper, we present semMatch: a system that can provide accurate\nHMM-based map matching for challenging positioning traces. semMatch leverages\nthe smartphone's inertial sensors to detect different road semantics; such as\nspeed bumps, tunnels, and turns; and uses them in a mathe-matically-principled\nway as hints to overcome the sparse, noisy, and coarse-grained input\npositioning data, improving the HMM map matching accuracy and efficiency. To do\nthat, semMatch applies a series of preprocessing modules to handle the noisy\nlocations.

The search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 Hz and\n128 Hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ Hz/s and $+1.5\n\\times 10^{-11}$ Hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. The starting\npoint was a set of short Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), of length 8192 seconds,\nbuilt from the calibrated strain data. Aggressive data cleaning, both in the\ntime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much as\npossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. On each dataset a\nnumber of candidates has been selected, using the FrequencyHough transform in\nan incoherent step. Only coincident candidates among VSR2 and VSR4 have been\nexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the most\nsignificant candidates have been selected. Selected candidates have been\nsubject to a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer FFTs followed by a\nfurther incoherent analysis, still based on the FrequencyHough transform. No\nevidence for continuous gravitational wave signals was found, therefore we have\nset a population-based joint VSR2-VSR4 90$\\%$ confidence level upper limit on\nthe dimensionless gravitational wave strain in the frequency range between 20\nHz and 128 Hz. This is the first all-sky search for continuous gravitational\nwaves conducted, on data of ground-based interferometric detectors, at\nfrequencies below 50 Hz. We set upper limits in the range between about\n$10^{-24}$ and $2\\times 10^{-23}$ at most frequencies. Our upper limits on\nsignal strain show an improvement of up to a factor of $\\sim$2 with respect to\nthe results of previous all-sky searches at frequencies below $80~\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 11:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 08:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-18"}

This generalization\nis far from being straightforward due to the fact that several new geometric\nphenomena appear. Also, the oscillatory integrals have two different asymptotic\nexpansions: the 'usual' one when the norm of the parameter tends to infinity,\nand another one when the norm of the parameter tends to zero. The first\nasymptotic expansion is controlled by the poles (with negative real parts) of\nall the twisted local zeta functions associated to the meromorphic functions\nf/g - c, for certain special values c.

Meanwhile, as a result of their\nconfining network structure, training RBMs confronts less difficulties\n(compared with more complicated models, e.g., Boltzmann machines) when dealing\nwith approximation and inference issues. However, in certain computational\nbiology scenarios, such as the cancer data analysis, employing RBMs to model\ndata features may lose its efficacy due to the \"$p\\gg N$\" problem, in which the\nnumber of features/predictors is much larger than the sample size. The \"$p\\gg\nN$\" problem puts the bias-variance trade-off in a more crucial place when\ndesigning statistical learning methods. In this manuscript, we try to address\nthis problem by proposing a novel RBM model, called elastic restricted\nBoltzmann machine (eRBM), which incorporates the elastic regularization term\ninto the likelihood/cost function. We provide several theoretical analysis on\nthe superiority of our model. Furthermore, attributed to the classic\ncontrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, eRBMs can be trained efficiently. Our\nnovel model is a promising method for future cancer data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 11:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 12:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

The limitation of the approach is\ngenerally given by the number of strongly-correlated orbitals in the molecule,\nas its cost will grow exponentially with this number. We present a new\nmulti-configurational self-consistent field approach, wherein linear\ndeterminant coefficients of a multi-configurational wavefunction are optimized\nvia the stochastic full configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo technique\nat greatly reduced computational cost, with non-linear orbital rotation\nparameters updated variationally based on this sampled wavefunction.

By comparison with\nthis traditional approach, we demonstrate that the introduction of stochastic\nnoise in both the determinant amplitudes and the gradient and Hessian of the\norbital rotations does not preclude robust and reliable convergence of the\norbital optimization. It can even improve the ability to avoid convergence to\nlocal minima in the orbital space, and therefore aid in finding variationally\nlower-energy solutions.

In this paper, we consider the strong disorder limit of the\nMBL transition, where the critical level statistics is close to the Poisson\nstatistics. We analyse a one-dimensional quantum spin model, in order to\ndetermine the statistical properties of the rare extensive resonances that are\nneeded to destabilize the MBL phase.

Starting with the idea of location based services,\nnowadays it is not only important to know where users are in real time, but\nalso to be able predict where they will be in future. Moreover, it is not\nenough to know user location in form of latitude longitude coordinates provided\nby GPS devices, but also to give a place its meaning (i.e., semantically label\nit), in particular detecting the most probable home location for the given\nuser. The aim of this paper is to provide novel insights on differences among\nthe ways how different types of human digital trails represent the actual\nmobility patterns and therefore the differences between the approaches\ninterpreting those trails for inferring said patterns. Namely, with the\nemergence of different digital sources that provide information about user\nmobility, it is of vital importance to fully understand that not all of them\ncapture exactly the same picture. With that being said, in this paper we start\nfrom an example showing how human mobility patterns described by means of\nradius of gyration are different for Flickr social network and dataset of bank\ncard transactions. Rather than capturing human movements closer to their homes,\nFlickr more often reveals people travel mode. Consequently, home location\ninferring methods used in both cases cannot be the same. We consider several\nmethods for home location definition known from the literature and demonstrate\nthat although for bank card transactions they provide highly consistent\nresults, home location definition detection methods applied to Flickr dataset\nhappen to be way more sensitive to the method selected, stressing the paramount\nimportance of adjusting the method to the specific dataset being used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The thesis we will argue is that there are\nthree different characters at play in programming languages, all of them now\ncalled types: the technical concept used in language design to guide\nimplementation; the general abstraction mechanism used as a modelling tool; the\nclassifying tool inherited from mathematical logic. We will suggest three\npossible dates ad quem for their presence in the programming language\nliterature, suggesting that the emergence of the concept of type in computer\nscience is relatively independent from the logical tradition, until the\nCurry-Howard isomorphism will make an explicit bridge between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 15:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 09:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

The same is true when looking at nanoconfined water: The\nliquid between constituents in a cell is confined to such dimensions, and there\nis already evidence that such water can behave very differently from its bulk\ncounterpart. A striking finding has been reported from computer simulations for\ntwo-dimensionally confined water: The liquid displays continuous or\ndiscontinuous melting depending on its density. In order to understand this\nbehavior, we have analyzed the melting exhibited by a bilayer of nanoconfined\nwater by means of molecular dynamics simulations. At high density we observe\nthe continuous melting to be related to the phase change of the oxygens only,\nwith the hydrogens remaining liquid-like throughout. Moreover, we find an\nintermediate hexatic phase for the oxygens between the liquid and a triangular\nsolid ice phase, following the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory\nfor two-dimensional melting.

We show that the asymmetry of the\ncapacitive couplings between the electronic reservoirs and the cavity plays a\ncrucial role in relating optical measurements to transport properties.

Clients arrive at the sensor network according to a Poisson process\nand are interested in retrieving a fixed number of sensor measurements, based\non which a reliable estimate is computed. We show that the time until an\narbitrary sensor broadcasts has a phase-type distribution.

Perception of gravity in root and shoot gravitropisms is usually\nattributed to gravisensitive cells, called statocytes, which exploit\nsedimentation of macroscopic and heavy organelles, amyloplasts, to sense the\ndirection of gravity. Gravity stimulus is then transduced into distal\nelongation zone, which is several mm far from statocytes, where it causes\nstretching. It is suggested that gravity stimulus is conveyed by gradients in\nauxin flux. We propose a theoretical model that may explain how concentration\ngradients and/or stretching may indirectly affect the global orientation of\ncortical microtubules, attached to the cell membrane and induce their dynamic\nreorientation perpendicular to the gradients. In turn, oriented microtubules\narrays direct the growth and orientation of cellulose microfibrils, forming\npart of the cell external skeleton and determine the shape of the cell.\nReorientation of microtubules is also observed in reaction to light in\nphototropism and mechanical bending, thus suggesting universality of the\nproposed mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}
