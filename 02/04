In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \\lambda_pp\\mu\\\nvalue used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.\n  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and\nthe fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to\nthe main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ to a\nminor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \\Lambda_S and g_P, as\ndetermined in MuCap.

Moreover, we show that in absence of\nright-handed currents the angular observables P4' and P5' fulfill the relation\nP4' = beta P5' at the position where P2 reaches its maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 16:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 22:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

To handle this\nshortcoming, D. Sudarsky and collaborators have developed a proposal: the\nself-induced collapse hypothesis. In this scheme, the objective collapse of the\ninflaton wave function is responsible for the emergence of inhomogeneity and\nanisotropy at all scales. In previous papers, the proposal was developed with\nan almost exact de Sitter space-time approximation for the background that led\nto a perfect scale-invariant power spectrum. In the present article, we\nconsider a full quasi-de Sitter expansion and calculate the primordial power\nspectrum for three different choices of the self-induced collapse. The\nconsideration of a quasi-de Sitter background allow us to distinguish\ndepartures from an exact scale-invariant power spectrum that are due to the\ninclusion of the collapse hypothesis. These deviations are also different from\nthe prediction of standard inflationary models with running spectral index.\nComparison with the primordial power spectrum and the CMB temperature\nfluctuation spectrum preferred by the latest observational data is also\ndiscussed.

Calculations of the dust\ndestruction timescale have so far been carried out using plane parallel steady\nshocks, however that approximation breaks down when the destruction timescale\nbecomes longer than that for the evolution of the supernova remnant (SNR)\nshock. In this paper we present new calculations of grain destruction in\nevolving, radiative SNRs. To facilitate comparison with the previous study by\nJones et al. (1996), we adopt the same dust properties as in that paper. We\nfind that the efficiencies of grain destruction are most divergent from those\nfor a steady shock when the thermal history of a shocked gas parcel in the SNR\ndiffers significantly from that behind a steady shock. This occurs in shocks\nwith velocities >~ 200 km/s for which the remnant is just beginning to go\nradiative. Assuming SNRs evolve in a warm phase dominated ISM, we find dust\ndestruction timescales are increased by a factor of ~2 compared to those of\nJones et al. (1996), who assumed a hot gas dominated ISM. Recent estimates of\nsupernova rates and ISM mass lead to another factor of ~3 increase in the\ndestruction timescales, resulting in a silicate grain destruction timescale of\n~2-3 Gyr. These increases, while not able resolve the problem of the discrepant\ntimescales for silicate grain destruction and creation, are an important step\ntowards understanding the origin, and evolution of dust in the ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 17:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The measured\nproperties of solar energetic particles (SEPs) have long been modeled in\ndifferent particle-acceleration scenarios. The challenge has been to\ndisentangle to the effects of transport from those of acceleration. The Payload\nfor Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA)\ninstrument, enables unique observations of SEPs including composition and the\nangular distribution of the particles about the magnetic field, i.e. pitch\nangle distribution, over a broad energy range (>80 MeV) -- bridging a critical\ngap between space-based measurements and ground-based.

SEP protons exhibit two distinct pitch angle\ndistributions; a low-energy population that extends to 90{\\deg} and a\npopulation that is beamed at high energies (>1 GeV), consistent with neutron\nmonitor measurements. To explain a low-energy SEP population that exhibits\nsignificant scattering or redistribution accompanied by a high-energy\npopulation that reaches the Earth relatively unaffected by dispersive transport\neffects, we postulate that the scattering or redistribution takes place\nlocally. We believe these are the first comprehensive measurements of the\neffects of solar energetic particle transport in the Earth's magnetosheath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 17:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Moreover, contact angle measurements show that hierarchical\nSWCNT/MWCNT composite surfaces exhibit a higher hydrophobicity (contact angles\nof up to 137{\\deg}) than bare SWCNT (110{\\deg}) and MWCNT (97{\\deg}) coatings,\nthereby confirming the enhancement produced by the surface hierarchical\nmorphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 17:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

The most obvious source for such a distribution is past data. The goal\nis to understand how much data is necessary and sufficient to guarantee\nnear-optimal expected revenue.\n  Our basic model is a single-item auction in which bidders' valuations are\ndrawn independently from unknown and non-identical distributions. The seller is\ngiven $m$ samples from each of these distributions \"for free\" and chooses an\nauction to run on a fresh sample. How large does m need to be, as a function of\nthe number k of bidders and eps > 0, so that a (1 - eps)-approximation of the\noptimal revenue is achievable?\n  We prove that, under standard tail conditions on the underlying\ndistributions, m = poly(k, 1/eps) samples are necessary and sufficient. Our\nlower bound stands in contrast to many recent results on simple and\nprior-independent auctions and fundamentally involves the interplay between\nbidder competition, non-identical distributions, and a very close (but still\nconstant) approximation of the optimal revenue. It effectively shows that the\nonly way to achieve a sufficiently good constant approximation of the optimal\nrevenue is through a detailed understanding of bidders' valuation\ndistributions. Our upper bound is constructive and applies in particular to a\nvariant of the empirical Myerson auction, the natural auction that runs the\nrevenue-maximizing auction with respect to the empirical distributions of the\nsamples.\n  Our sample complexity lower bound depends on the set of allowable\ndistributions, and to capture this we introduce alpha-strongly regular\ndistributions, which interpolate between the well-studied classes of regular\n(alpha = 0) and MHR (alpha = 1) distributions.

An important part in the answer to those questions lies in\nscattering theory. The present investigation explores various aspects of\ninelastic quantum scattering theory for cylindrically symmetric beams with\norbital angular momentum. The model system of Coulomb scattering on a hydrogen\natom provides the setting to address various open questions: How is momentum\ntransferred? Do vortex beams selectively excite atoms, and how can one employ\nvortex beams to detect magnetic transitions? The analytical approach presented\nhere provides answers to these questions. OAM transfer is possible, but not\nthrough selective excitation; rather, by pre- and post-selection one can filter\nout the relevant contributions to a specific signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 19:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Radio\nastronomical observations of this transition, using either a single dish\ntelescope or an array interferometer, reveal different properties of the\ninterstellar medium. Such observations are particularly useful to study the\nmultiphase nature and turbulence in the interstellar gas. Observations with\nmultiple radio telescopes have recently been used to study these two closely\nrelated aspects in greater detail. Using various observational techniques, the\ndensity and the velocity fluctuations in the Galactic interstellar medium was\nfound to have a Kolmogorov-like power law power spectra. The observed power law\nscaling of the turbulent velocity dispersion with the length scale can be used\nto derive the true temperature distribution of the medium. Observations from a\nlarge ongoing atomic hydrogen absorption line survey have also been used to\nstudy the distribution of gas at different temperature. The thermal steady\nstate model predicts that the multiphase neutral gas will exist in cold and\nwarm phase with temperature below 200 K and above 5000 K respectively. However,\nthese observations clearly show the presence of a large fraction of gas in the\nintermediate unstable phase.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to account for biases in our\nsample, due to both selection limits and the steep slope of the massive end of\nthe galaxy stellar-mass distribution. We find our sample is consistent with no\nevolution in the M_BH-M_* relation from z~2 to z~0. BLAGNs and their host\ngalaxies which lie off the black hole mass galaxy total stellar mass relation\ntend to have evolutionary vectors anti-correlated with their mass ratios: that\nis, galaxies with over-massive (under-massive) black holes tend to have a low\n(high) ratio of the specific accretion rate to the specific star formation\nrate. We also use the measured growth rates to estimate the preferred AGN duty\ncycle for our galaxies to evolve most consistently onto the local M_BH-M_Bul\nrelation. Under reasonable assumptions of exponentially declining star\nformation histories, the data suggest a non-evolving (no more than a factor of\na few) BLAGN duty cycle among star-forming galaxies of 10% (1sigma range of\n1-42% at z<1 and 2-34% at z>1).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 21:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Unlike the conventional calibration programs,\nthese observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. Reciprocity\nfailure is known to exist in HgCdTe devices and a correction for this effect\nhas already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. However\nobservations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. Here instead, we\nprovide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. This\nis obtained via inter-calibration of NIC2 F110W/F160W with WFC3 in the low\ncount-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.\nThese objects have relatively simple near-IR SEDs, uniform colors, and their\nextended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate than\nwould stars. The use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on PSF\nprofiles. We find ST magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the NICMOS\ncooling system, NCS) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for F110W and 25.803 +- 0.023 for\nF160W, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates\n1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799).

We also check the\nstandard bandpasses of WFC3 and NICMOS 2 using a range of stars and galaxies at\ndifferent colors and find mild tension for WFC3, limiting the accuracy of the\nzeropoints. To avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was \"blinded\" in that\nthe fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 21:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 02:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an\nobjective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of\nstar-forming galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-Mass-Number plot, the MS is then\ndefined as the ridge line of the star-forming peak, as illustrated with various\nfigures. The advantages of such definition are manifold. If generally adopted\nit will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using\nthe same star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass diagnostics, or to\nhighlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics.

In the study, we present a rigorous\ntheoretical analysis of the self-imaging of curved transmission gratings based\non Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction. Numerical simulations have demonstrated the\nself-imaging phenomenon of cylindrical grating interferometer. The theoretical\nresults are in agreement with the results of numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 21:34:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 01:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 21:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

The\ndiffusion equation, which describes the temperature as a function of space and\ntime, is linear. For every linear equation the superposition principle is\nvalid, which is known as Huygens principle for optical or mechanical wave\nfields. This limits the spatial resolution, like the Abbe diffraction limit in\noptics. The resolution is the minimal size of a structure which can be detected\nat a certain depth. If an embedded structure at a certain depth in a sample is\nsuddenly heated, e.g. by eddy current or absorbed light, an image of the\nstructure can be reconstructed from the measured temperature at the sample\nsurface. To get the resolution the image reconstruction can be considered as\nthe time reversal of the thermal wave. This inverse problem is ill-conditioned\nand therefore regularization methods have to be used taking additional\nassumptions like smoothness of the solutions into account. In the present work\nfor the first time methods of non-equilibrium statistical physics are used to\nsolve this inverse problem without the need of such additional assumptions and\nwithout the necessity to choose a regularization parameter. For reconstructing\nsuch an embedded structure by thermal waves the resolution turns out to be\nproportional to the depth and inversely proportional to the natural logarithm\nof the signal-to-noise ratio. This result could be derived from the diffusion\nequation by using a delta-source at a certain depth and setting the entropy\nproduction caused by thermal diffusion equal to the information loss. No\nspecific model about the stochastic process of the fluctuations and about the\ndistribution densities around the mean values was necessary to get this result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 21:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2015 10:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

This new analysis\nsuggests that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions\nbut varies enormously ($\\sim$10,000 times) depending on the stem cell's\nenvironment. Future research should investigate how tissue characteristics\n(anatomical site, type, size, stem cell divisions) explain cancer incidence\nover a wider range of cancers, to what extent different tissues express\nspecific protective mechanisms, and whether any differential protection can be\nattributed to natural selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 22:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}

The experimental results on two commonly used datasets show that\ndense sampling has the best performance among all the strategies but with high\nspatial and computational complexity, random sampling gives better or\ncomparable results than other sparse sampling methods, like the sophisticated\nmulti-scale key-point operators and the saliency-based methods which are\nintensively studied and commonly used recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 05:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-03"}

Robustness is based on the joint adoption of the Cluster Weighted\nModel and of an estimator based on trimming and restrictions. The selected\nmodel provides the conditional distribution of the response for each group, as\nin mixtures of regression, and further supplies local distributions for the\nexplanatory variables. A novel version of the restrictions has been devised,\nunder this model, for separately controlling the two sources of variability\nidentified in it. This proposal avoids singularities in the log-likelihood,\ncaused by approximate local collinearity in the explanatory variables or local\nexact fit in regressions, and reduces the occurrence of spurious local\nmaximizers. In a natural way, due to the interaction between the model and the\nestimator, the procedure is able to resist the harmful influence of bad\nleverage points along the estimation of the mixture of regressions, which is\nstill an open issue in the literature. The given methodology defines a\nwell-posed statistical problem, whose estimator exists and is consistent to the\ncorresponding solution of the population optimum, under widely general\nconditions. A feasible EM algorithm has also been provided to obtain the\ncorresponding estimation.

It also describes the advanced technologies\nto be used in WATCHMAN, including high quantum efficiency photomultipliers,\nWater-Based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS), picosecond light sensors such as the\nLarge Area Picosecond Photo Detector (LAPPD), and advanced pattern recognition\nand particle identification methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 09:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}

RESULTS: We\nfind that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and\nCo (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the\nalpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is\ngenerally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0.\nAlso, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is\nalmost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span\n(-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation\nbetween the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap.\nFor Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections\nare used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference element show flat trends for all\nthe elements except for Mn that show well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for\nthe thin and thick disks. CONCLUSIONS: Sc and V present trends compatible with\nproduction from SNII events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a metallicity\ndependence for [Fe/H]<-1. Mn instead is produced in SNII events for [Fe/H]<-0.4\nand then SNIa start to produce Mn. Finally, Co appears to be produced mainly in\nSNII with suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low metallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 10:52:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 10:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

As an example, different devices may have different implementations,\nleading to different user experiences. A similar story emerges when devices\nrunning different physical and link layer protocols share frequencies in the\nsame spectrum in order to maximize the system-wide spectral efficiency. In such\nsituations, coordinating multiple interfering devices presents a significant\nchallenge not only from an interworking perspective (as a result of reduced\ninfrastructure), but also from an implementation point of view. The following\nquestion may then naturally arise: How to accommodate integrating such\nheterogeneous wireless devices seamlessly? One approach is to coordinate the\nspectrum in a centralized manner. However, the desired autonomous feature of\nfuture wireless systems makes the use of a central authority for spectrum\nmanagement less appealing.

Within the core accretion scenario of planetary formation, most\nsimulations performed so far always assume the accreting envelope to have a\nsolar composition. From the study of meteorite showers on Earth and numerical\nsimulations, we know that planetesimals must undergo thermal ablation and\ndisruption when crossing a protoplanetary envelope. Once the protoplanet has\nacquired an atmosphere, the primordial envelope gets enriched in volatiles and\nsilicates from the planetesimals. This change of envelope composition during\nthe formation can have a significant effect in the final atmospheric\ncomposition and on the formation timescale of giant planets.\n  Aims. To investigate the physical implications of considering the envelope\nenrichment of protoplanets due to the disruption of icy planetesimals during\ntheir way to the core. Particular focus is placed on the effect on the critical\ncore mass for envelopes where condensation of water can occur.\n  Methods. Internal structure models are numerically solved with the\nimplementation of updated opacities for all ranges of metallicities and the\nsoftware CEA to compute the equation of state. CEA computes the chemical\nequilibrium for an arbitrary mixture of gases and allows the condensation of\nsome species, including water. This means that the latent heat of phase\ntransitions is consistently incorporated in the total energy budget.\n  Results. The critical core mass is found to decrease significantly when an\nenriched envelope composition is considered in the internal structure\nequations. A particular strong reduction of the critical core mass is obtained\nfor planets whose envelope metallicity is larger than Z=0.45 when the outer\nboundary conditions are suitable for condensation of water to occur in the top\nlayers of the atmosphere. We show that this effect is qualitatively preserved\nwhen the atmosphere is out of chemical equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 11:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

As the number of distributed\nenergy resources increases, the household power will become more variable and\nthus unpredictable from the viewpoint of the Distribution System Operator\n(DSO). It is therefore expected, in the near future, to have an increased\nnumber of Wide Area Measurement System (WAMS) devices with Phasor Measurement\nUnit (PMU)-like capabilities in the distribution grid, thus allowing the\nutilities to monitor the low voltage grid quality while providing information\nrequired for tighter grid control. From a communication standpoint, the traffic\nprofile will change drastically towards higher data volumes and higher rates\nper device. In this paper, we characterize the current traffic generated by\nsmart electricity meters and supplement it with the potential traffic\nrequirements brought by introducing enhanced Smart Meters, i.e., meters with\nPMU-like capabilities. Our study shows how GSM/GPRS and LTE cellular system\nperformance behaves with the current and next generation smart meters traffic,\nwhere it is clearly seen that the PMU data will seriously challenge these\nwireless systems.

We modelled\nthe spectral energy distribution using both hadronic and leptonic scenarios.\nFrom the combination of the new GMRT observations with existing data, we\nderived a continuum spectral index alpha=-0.62+-0.03 for the whole remnant. The\nlocal synchrotron spectra of G15.4+0.1, calculated from the combination of the\nGMRT data with 330 MHz observations from the VLA, tends to be flatter in the\ncentral part of the remnant, accompanying the region where the blast wave is\nimpinging molecular gas. No spectral index trace was found indicating the radio\ncounterpart to the pulsar wind nebula proposed from X-ray observations. In\naddition, the search for radio pulsations yielded negative results. Emission at\nfar-infrared wavelengths is observed in the region where the SNR shock is\ninteracting with dense molecular clumps. We also identified HI features forming\na shell that wraps most of the outer border of G15.4+0.1. Characteristic\nparameters were estimated for the shocked HI gas. We found that either a purely\nhadronic or leptonic model is compatible with the broadband emission known so\nfar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 15:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

In this context, recent observations and dynamical\nmodelling of several galactic and extra-galactic globular clusters (GCs)\nsuggest that most of them show, close to their centre, an overabundance of mass\nwhose nature is still matter of debate. For instance, many works show that\norbitally segregated stars may collide with each other in a runaway fashion,\nleading to the formation of a very massive star or an intermediate mass black\nhole (IMBH) with a mass comparable to the observed mass excess. On the other\nhand, segregated stars can form a dense system if the IMBH formation fails. In\nthis paper we study the early formation phase of a dense, massive sub-system\n(MSS) in several GCs models using a recently developed semi-analytical\ntreatment of the mass segregation process. In order to investigate how the MSS\nproperties depend on the host cluster properties, we varied initial mass\nfunction (IMF), total mass, spatial distribution and metallicity of our models.\nOur results show how the IMF contributes to determine the final mass of the\nMSS, while the metallicity and the spatial distribution play a minor role. The\nmethod presented in this paper allowed us to provide scaling relations that\nconnect the MSS mass and the host cluster mass in agreement with the observed\ncorrelation. In order to follow the early formation stage of the MSSs and\nimprove our statistical results, we performed several $N$-body simulations of\nstellar clusters with masses between $10^3$ and $2\\times 10^5$ solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 15:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 08:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 16:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 07:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 10:07:06 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 09:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2015 13:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

Several models have been proposed for explaining the\norigin; however, they have advantages and disadvantages. In particular,\nprevious models only demonstrate either two important observations for the\nallometric scaling: the variability of scaling exponents and predominance of\n3/4-power law. Thus, these models have a dispute over their validity. In this\nstudy, we propose a simple geometry model, and show that a hypothesis that\ntotal surface area of cells determines metabolic rate can reproduce these two\nobservations by combining two concepts: the impact of cell sizes on metabolic\nrate and fractal-like (hierarchical) organization. The proposed model both\ntheoretically and numerically demonstrates the approximately 3/4-power law\nalthough several different biological strategies are considered. The model\nvalidity is confirmed using empirical data. Furthermore, the model suggests the\nimportance of heterogeneity of cell size for the emergence of the allometric\nscaling. The proposed model provides intuitive and unique insights into the\norigin of allometric scaling laws in biology, despite several limitations of\nthe model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 13:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 08:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}
