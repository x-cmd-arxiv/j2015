Unlike most designs\nthat rely on analog cancelers to suppress self-interference, SoftNull relies on\ndigital transmit beamforming to reduce self-interference. SoftNull does not\nattempt to perfectly null self-interference, but instead seeks to reduce\nself-interference sufficiently to prevent swamping the receiver's dynamic\nrange. Residual self-interference is then cancelled digitally by the receiver.\nWe evaluate the performance of SoftNull using measurements from a 72-element\nantenna array in both indoor and outdoor environments. We find that SoftNull\ncan significantly outperform half-duplex for small cells operating in the\nmany-antenna regime, where the number of antennas is many more than the number\nof users served simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2015 19:27:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 23:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

One way to\naccess different cosmological histories is via the nucleation of bubble\nuniverses from a metastable false vacuum. Another way to sample different\ncosmological histories is via classical transitions, the creation of pocket\nuniverses through the collision between bubbles. Using relativistic numerical\nsimulations, we examine the possibility of observationally determining if our\nobservable universe resulted from a classical transition. We find that\nclassical transitions produce spatially infinite, approximately open\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker universes. The leading set of observables in the\naftermath of a classical transition are negative spatial curvature and a\ncontribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature quadrupole. The\nlevel of curvature and magnitude of the quadrupole are dependent on the\nposition of the observer, and we determine the possible range of observables\nfor two classes of single-scalar field models. For the first class, where the\ninflationary phase has a lower energy than the vacuum preceding the classical\ntransition, the magnitude of the observed quadrupole generally falls to zero\nwith distance from the collision while the spatial curvature grows to a\nconstant. For the second class, where the inflationary phase has a higher\nenergy than the vacuum preceding the classical transition, the magnitude of the\nobserved quadrupole generically falls to zero with distance from the collision\nwhile the spatial curvature grows without bound. We find that the magnitude of\nthe quadrupole and curvature grow with increasing centre of mass energy of the\ncollision, and explore variations of the parameters in the scalar field\nlagrangian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 03:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

However, in observational studies, prior\nknowledge is required to generate the hypotheses about the cause-effect\nrelationships to be tested, hence they can only be applied to problems with\navailable domain knowledge and a handful of variables. In practice, many data\nsets are of high dimensionality, which leaves observational studies out of the\nopportunities for causal discovery from such a wealth of data sources. In\nanother direction, many efficient data mining methods have been developed to\nidentify associations among variables in large data sets. The problem is,\ncausal relationships imply associations, but the reverse is not always true.\nHowever we can see the synergy between the two paradigms here. Specifically,\nassociation rule mining can be used to deal with the high-dimensionality\nproblem while observational studies can be utilised to eliminate non-causal\nassociations. In this paper we propose the concept of causal rules (CRs) and\ndevelop an algorithm for mining CRs in large data sets. We use the idea of\nretrospective cohort studies to detect CRs based on the results of association\nrule mining. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CR mining. In comparison with\nthe commonly used causal discovery methods, the proposed approach in general is\nfaster and has better or competitive performance in finding correct or sensible\ncauses. It is also capable of finding a cause consisting of multiple variables,\na feature that other causal discovery methods do not possess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 12:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

The proposed method has three components: the\nproportion of cure, the risk of failure, irrespective of the cause, and the\nrelative risk of a certain cause of failure, given a failure occurred.\nCovariates may affect each of these components. An appealing aspect of the\nmethod is that it is a natural extension to competing risks of the\nsemi-parametric mixture cure model in ordinary survival analysis; thus, causes\nof failure are assigned only if a failure occurs. This contrasts with the\nexisting mixture cure model for competing risks of Larson and Dinse, which\nconditions at the onset on the future status presumably attained. Regression\nparameter estimates are obtained using an EM-algorithm. The performance of the\nestimators is evaluated in a simulation study. The method is illustrated using\na melanoma cancer data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 12:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

The measurements were performed on composites for\ntwo distinct regimes of fractional filling: monolayer coverage at the pore\nwalls and complete filling of the pores. For the layer coverage a slow surface\nrelaxation dominates the dielectric properties. For the entirely filled\nchannels the dielectric spectra are governed by two thermally-activated\nrelaxation processes with considerably different relaxation rates: A slow\nrelaxation in the interface layer next to the channel walls and a fast\nrelaxation in the core region of the channel filling. The strengths and\ncharacteristic frequencies of both relaxation processes have been extracted and\nanalysed as a function of temperature. Whereas the temperature dependence of\nthe static capacitance reflects the effective (average) molecular ordering over\nthe pore volume and is well described within a Landau-de Gennes theory, the\nextracted relaxation strengths of the slow and fast relaxation processes\nprovide an access to distinct local molecular ordering mechanisms. The order\nparameter in the core region exhibits a bulk-like behaviour with a strong\nincrease in the nematic ordering just below the paranematic-to-nematic\ntransition temperature T_PN and subsequent saturation during cooling. By\ncontrast, the surface ordering evolves continuously with a kink near T_PN.

Since the invention of\ncomputer graphics researchers have not paid much of attentions toward the\npossibility of converting oral tales otherwise known as folktales into possible\ncartoon animated videos. This paper is based on how to develop cartoons of\nlocal folktales that will be of huge benefits to Nigerians. The activities were\ndivided into 5 stages; analysis, design, development, implementation and\nevaluation which involved various processes and use of various specialized\nsoftware and hardware. After the implementation of this project, the video\ncharacteristics were evaluated using likert scale. Analysis of 30 user\nresponses indicated that 17 users (56.7 percent) rated the image quality as\nexcellent, the video and image synchronization was rated as excellent by 9\nusers (30 percent), the Background noise was rated excellent by 18 users (60\npercent), the Character Impression was rated Excellent by 11 users (36.67\npercent), the general assessment of the storyline was rated excellent by 17\nusers (56.7 percent), the video Impression was rated excellent by 11 users\n(36.67 percent) and the voice quality was rated by 10 users (33.33 percent) as\nexcellent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 15:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

For example,\ndisease, rumor, and information spread over underlying social and information\nnetworks. It is well known that there is no threshold for epidemic models on\nscale-free networks; this suggests that disease can spread on such networks,\nregardless of how low the contact rate may be. In this paper, I consider six\nmodels with different contact and propagation mechanisms. Each model is\nanalyzed by degree-based mean-field theory. I show that the presence or absence\nof an outbreak threshold depends on the contact and propagation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 13:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}
