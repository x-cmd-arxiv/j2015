We show that the lemma can fail,\nhowever, in models of set theory with $V\\neq HOD$, and it necessarily fails in\nthe forcing extension to add a generic Cohen real. We go on to formulate a\nscheme of natural parametric generalizations of Ehrenfeucht's lemma, namely,\nthe principles of the form $EL(A,P,Q)$, which asserts that whenever an object\n$b$ is definable from some $a\\in A$ using parameters in $P$, with $b\\neq a$,\nthen the types of $a$ and $b$ over $Q$ are different.

We find that, for the sphere sizes considered in this\ncontribution, the radiative decay rate is barely affected by the presence of\nthe nanosphere, whereas the non-radiative decay rate is greatly enhanced due to\nenergy transfer from the quantum system to the nanosphere, leading to a strong\nquenching of the emission of the quantum system. The emission wavelength of the\nquantum emitter and its intrinsic quantum yield play an important role and the\nimpact of both has to be considered together when investigating their effect on\nthe non-radiative decay rate. The energy transfer process from the emitter to\nthe nanosphere has a complicated distance dependence, with a 1/r^6 regime,\ncharacteristic of the F\\\"orster energy transfer mechanism, but also exhibiting\nother distance dependence regimes. In the case of a donor-acceptor pair in the\npresence of a Au nanosphere, the donor couples strongly to the nanosphere,\nacting as an enhanced dipole; the donor-acceptor energy transfer rate then\nfollows a F\\\"orster trend, with an increased F\\\"orster radius. The angular\ndependence of the energy transfer efficiency between donor and acceptor has a\nstrong dipole-dipole trend for small spheres and deviates from it for larger\nspheres, especially when the donor and acceptor are on opposite sides of the\nsphere. The spectral overlap of the donor emission, acceptor absorption and\ngold nanosphere extinction shows an interesting trend in that the largest\nF\\\"orster radius is obtained when the donor emission and acceptor absorption\nmaxima are somewhat red-shifted from the localized surface plasmon peak in the\nextinction spectrum of the Au nanosphere, being located between it and the\nnear-field scattering maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 18:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-09"}

In particular, if a railway track has a bend to provide the\npossibility of changing direction of train movement, the Rayleigh surface waves\ngenerated by high-speed trains under the condition of ground vibration boom may\nbecome focused. This results in concentration of their energy along a simple\ncaustic line at one side of the track and in the corresponding increase in\nground vibration amplitudes. The effect of focusing of Rayleigh waves may occur\nalso if a train moves along a straight line with acceleration and its current\nspeed is higher than Rayleigh wave velocity in the ground.

As an example, in a\nfederated cloud environment, each cloud provider could encode the information\nusing Bloom filters and share the Bloom filters with a central coordinator. The\nproblem of interest is not only whether a given element is in any of the sets\nrepresented by the Bloom filters, but which of the existing sets contain the\ngiven element. This problem cannot be solved by just constructing a Bloom\nfilter on the union of all the sets. Instead, we effectively have a\nmultidimensional Bloom filter problem: given an element, we wish to receive a\nlist of candidate sets where the element might be.\n  To solve this problem, we consider 3 alternatives. Firstly, we can naively\ncheck many Bloom filters. Secondly, we propose to organize the Bloom filters in\na hierarchical index structure akin to a B+ tree, that we call Bloofi. Finally,\nwe propose another data structure that packs the Bloom filters in such a way as\nto exploit bit-level parallelism, which we call Flat-Bloofi.\n  Our theoretical and experimental results show that Bloofi and Flat-Bloofi\nprovide scalable and efficient solutions alternatives to search through a large\nnumber of Bloom filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 20:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 15:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 18:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

We consider using a robust pairwise covariance matrix\nas an input to various regularisation routines, such as the graphical lasso,\nQUIC and CLIME. To ensure the input covariance matrix is positive semidefinite,\nwe use a method that transforms a symmetric matrix of pairwise covariances to\nthe nearest covariance matrix. The result is a potentially sparse precision\nmatrix that is resilient to moderate levels of cellwise contamination. Since\nthis procedure is not based on subsampling it scales well as the number of\nvariables increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 20:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

We also extract directly from simulation, several\ntravelling waves (TWs). These TWs together with the RPOs are unstable states\nand are believed to provide the skeleton of the chaotic saddle. Earlier studies\nhave shown that such invariant solutions can help to explain wall bounded shear\nflows, and a finite subset of them are expected to dominate the dynamics\n(Faisst & Eckhardt 2003; Pringle & Kerswell 2007; Hof et al. 2004). The\nintroduction of symmetries is typically necessary to facilitate this approach.\nApplying only the shift-reflect symmetry, the geometry is less constrained than\nprevious studies in pipe flow. A 'long-period' RPO is identified that is only\nvery weakly repelling. Turbulent trajectories are found to frequently approach\nand frequently shadow this orbit. In addition the orbit characterises a\nresulting 'bubble' of chaos, itself a saddle, deep within the turbulent sea\n(Kreilos et al. 2014). We explicitly analyse the merger of the two saddles and\nshow how it results in a considerable increase of the total lifetime. Both\nexits and entries to the bubble are observed, as the stable manifolds of the\ninner and outer saddles intertwine. We observe that the typical lifetime of the\nturbulence is influenced by switches between the inner and outer saddles, and\nis thereby dependent on whether or not it 'shadows' or 'visits' the vicinity of\nthe long-period RPO (Cvitanovic et al. 2014).

Thus, it is an important feature of a recommender system to make it\npossible to adjust diversity and accuracy of the recommendations by tuning the\nmodel.

Thus, we investigate the\nexistence and properties of travelling solitons in Lorentz and CPT breaking\nscenarios for a class of models with two interacting scalar fields.

In fact, such models are very\nimportant in applications that include Bloch branes, Skyrmions, Yang-Mills,\nQ-balls, oscillons and various superstring-motivated theories. We find that the\nso-called Configurational Entropy (CE) for travelling solitons, which we name\nas travelling Configurational Entropy (TCE), shows that the best value of\nparameter responsible to break the Lorentz symmetry is one where the energy\ndensity is distributed equally around the origin. In this way, the\ninformation-theoretical measure of travelling solitons in Lorentz symmetry\nviolation scenarios opens a new window to probe situations where the parameters\nresponsible for breaking the symmetries are random. In this case, the TCE\nselects the best value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 23:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 00:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-25"}

The coupling of dynamics and accretion\noften leads to one or two dominant bodies controlling the center of the cloud\ncore, while banishing the other(s) to the lower-density outskirts, leading to\nstunted growth. Eventually each system transforms either to a bound\nhierarchical configuration or breaks apart into separate single and binary\ncomponents. The orbital motion is followed for 100 Myr. To illustrate the\nsimulations we introduce the 'triple diagnostic diagram', which plots two\ndimensionless numbers against each other, representing the binary mass ratio\nand the mass ratio of the third body to the total system mass. Numerous\nfreefloating BD binaries are formed in these simulations. The separation\ndistribution function is in good correspondence with observations, showing a\nsteep rise at close separations, peaking around 13 AU and then declining more\ngently. Unresolved BD triple systems may appear as wider BD binaries. Mass\nratios are strongly peaked towards unity, as observed, but this is partially\ndue to the initial assumptions. Eccentricities gradually increase towards\nhigher values, due to the lack of viscous interactions in the simulations,\nwhich would both shrink the orbits and decrease their eccentricities. The main\nthreat to newly born triple systems is internal instabilities, not external\nperturbations.

Within a month the accretion rate reaches super-Eddington levels. It\nthen drops gradually over a time scale of a year to sub-Eddington regimes. The\ninitially geometrically thick disk becomes a thin one and eventually an ADAF at\nvery low accretion rates. As such, TDEs explore the whole range of accretion\nrates and configurations. A challenging question is what the corresponding\nlight curves of these events are. We explore numerically the disk luminosity\nand the conditions within the inner region of the disk using a fully general\nrelativistic slim disk model. Those conditions determine the magnitude of the\nmagnetic field that engulfs the black hole and this, in turn, determines the\nBlandford-Znajek jet power. We estimate this power in two different ways and\nshow that they are self-consistent. We find, as expected earlier from analytic\nargu- ments (Krolik & Piran 2012), that neither the disk luminosity nor the jet\npower follows the accretion rate throughout the disruption event. The disk\nluminosity varies only logarithmi- cally with the accretion rate at\nsuper-Eddington luminosities. The jet power follows initially the accretion\nrate but remains a constant after the transition from super- to sub- Eddington.\nAt lower accretion rates at the end of the MAD phase the disk becomes thin and\nthe jet may stop altogether.

We construct model templates of galaxies using a stellar\npopulation synthesis code and apply Bayesian priors on physical properties such\nas stellar mass and star formation rate. These priors are a function of\nredshift and they effectively evolve the templates with time in an\nobservationally motivated way.

This implies the need of slim edges of about 100-200 $\\mu$m\nwidth for the sensor side facing the beam to minimise the dead area. Another\nchallenge is an expected non-uniform irradiation of the pixel sensors. It is\nstudied if these requirements can be met using slightly-modified FE-I4 3D pixel\nsensors from the ATLAS Insertable B-Layer production. AFP-compatible slim edges\nare obtained with a simple diamond-saw cut. Electrical characterisations and\nbeam tests are carried out and no detrimental impact on the leakage current and\nhit efficiency is observed. For devices without a 3D guard ring a remaining\ninsensitive edge of less than 15 $\\mu$m width is found. Moreover, 3D detectors\nare non-uniformly irradiated up to fluences of several 10$^{15}$\nn$_{eq}$/cm$^2$ with either a focussed 23 GeV proton beam or a 23 MeV proton\nbeam through holes in Al masks. The efficiency in the irradiated region is\nfound to be similar to the one in the non-irradiated region and exceeds 97% in\ncase of favourable chip-parameter settings. Only in a narrow transition area at\nthe edge of the hole in the Al mask, a significantly lower efficiency is seen.\nA follow-up study of this effect using arrays of small pad diodes for\nposition-resolved dosimetry via the leakage current is carried out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 09:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

The extreme irradiation\n$L_{\\rm eq}$ these hot Jupiters receive from their close in stars creates a\nthick isothermal layer in their envelopes, which slows down their convective\ncooling, allowing them to retain their inflated size for longer. This is yet\ninsufficient to explain the observed sizes of the most inflated planets. Some\nmodels invoke an additional power source, deposited deep in the planet's\nenvelope. Here we present an analytical model for the cooling of such\nirradiated, and internally heated gas giants.

Fingerprint image segmentation is typically the first processing\nstep of most fingerprint algorithms and it divides an image into foreground,\nthe region of interest, and background. Two types of error can occur during\nthis step which both have a negative impact on the recognition performance:\n'true' foreground can be labeled as background and features like minutiae can\nbe lost, or conversely 'true' background can be misclassified as foreground and\nspurious features can be introduced. The contribution of this paper is\nthreefold: firstly, we propose a novel factorized directional bandpass (FDB)\nsegmentation method for texture extraction based on the directional Hilbert\ntransform of a Butterworth bandpass (DHBB) filter interwoven with\nsoft-thresholding. Secondly, we provide a manually marked ground truth\nsegmentation for 10560 images as an evaluation benchmark.

The environment is classified depending on its density\nas in previous works. We analyse the dynamical properties of void-centered\nspherical shells at different void-centric distances depending on this\nclassification. The above dynamical properties are given by the angular\ndistribution of the radial velocity field, its smoothness, the field dependence\non the tracer density and shape, and the field departures from linear theory.\nWe found that the velocity field in expanding voids follows more closely the\nlinear prediction, with a more smooth velocity field. However when using\nvelocity tracers with large densities such deviations increase. Voids with\nsizes around $18\\,h^{-1}\\,Mpc$ are in a transition regime between regions with\nexpansion overpredicted and underpredicted from linear theory. We also found\nthat velocity smoothness increases as the void radius, indicating the laminar\nflow dominates the expansion of larger voids (more than $18\\,h^{-1}\\,Mpc$). The\ncorrelations observed suggest that nonlinear dynamics of the inner regions of\nvoids could be dependent on the evolution of the surrounding structures. These\nalso indicate possible scale couplings between the void inner expansion and the\nlarge scale regions where voids are embedded. These results shed some light to\nthe origin of nonlinearities in voids, going beyond the fact that voids just\nquickly becomes nonlinear as they become emptier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 12:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

Human computation for citizen science\nprojects consists in designing systems that allow large crowds of volunteers to\ncontribute to scientific research by executing human computation tasks.\nExamples of successful projects are Galaxy Zoo and FoldIt. A key feature of\nthis kind of project is its capacity to engage volunteers. An important\nrequirement for the proposal and evaluation of new engagement strategies is\nhaving a clear understanding of the typical engagement of the volunteers;\nhowever, even though several projects of this kind have already been completed,\nlittle is known about this issue. In this paper, we investigate the engagement\npattern of the volunteers in their interactions in human computation for\ncitizen science projects, how they differ among themselves in terms of\nengagement, and how those volunteer engagement features should be taken into\naccount for establishing the engagement encouragement strategies that should be\nbrought into play in a given project. To this end, we define four quantitative\nengagement metrics to measure different aspects of volunteer engagement, and\nuse data mining algorithms to identify the different volunteer profiles in\nterms of the engagement metrics. Our study is based on data collected from two\nprojects: Galaxy Zoo and The Milky Way Project. The results show that the\nvolunteers in such projects can be grouped into five distinct engagement\nprofiles that we label as follows: hardworking, spasmodic, persistent, lasting,\nand moderate. The analysis of these profiles provides a deeper understanding of\nthe nature of volunteers' engagement in human computation for citizen science\nprojects\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 13:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

Longitudinal data represent an interesting field of\napplication of such models; due to their peculiar features, they represent a\nsubstantial challenge, in that the standard, cross-sectional, model\nrepresentation needs to be extended for dealing with such kind of data. In\nfact, repeated observations from the same statistical unit poses a problem of\ndependence; in a conditional perspective, this dependence could be ascribed to\nsources of unobserved, individual-specific, heterogeneity. Along these lines,\nquantile regression models have recently been extended to the analysis of\nlongitudinal, continuous, responses, by modelling dependence via time-constant\nor time-varying random effects. In this manuscript, we introduce a general\nquantile regression model for longitudinal, continuous, responses where\ntime-varying and time-constant random parameters are jointly taken into\naccount. A further feature of longitudinal designs is the presence of partially\nincomplete sequences, due to some individuals leaving the study before its\ndesigned end. The missing data process may produce a selection of units which\ncan be informative with respect to the parameters of the longitudinal data\nmodel. To deal with the case of irretrievable drop-out, we introduce a pattern\nmixture version of the linear quantile hidden Markov model, where we account\nfor time-varying heterogeneity and for changes in the fixed effect vector due\nto differential propensities to stay in the study. The proposed models are\nillustrated using a well known benchmark dataset on longitudinal dynamics of\nCD4 cells and by means of a large scale simulation study, entailing different\nquantiles and both complete and partially complete (ie subject to drop-out)\nindividual sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 14:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 08:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-30"}

Attiya and Welch\nproved that using strong consistency criteria such as atomicity is costly as\neach operation may need an execution time linear with the latency of the\ncommunication network. Weaker consistency criteria like causal consistency and\nPRAM consistency do not ensure convergence. The different replicas are not\nguaranteed to converge towards a unique state. Eventual consistency guarantees\nthat all replicas eventually converge when the participants stop updating.\nHowever, it fails to fully specify the semantics of the operations on shared\nobjects and requires additional non-intuitive and error-prone distributed\nspecification techniques. This paper introduces and formalizes a new\nconsistency criterion, called update consistency, that requires the state of a\nreplicated object to be consistent with a linearization of all the updates. In\nother words, whereas atomicity imposes a linearization of all of the\noperations, this criterion imposes this only on updates. Consequently some read\noperations may return out-dated values. Update consistency is stronger than\neventual consistency, so we can replace eventually consistent objects with\nupdate consistent ones in any program. Finally, we prove that update\nconsistency is universal, in the sense that any object can be implemented under\nthis criterion in a distributed system where any number of nodes may crash.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 15:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

Binary host stars\nof similar type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of planets on\nhost star abundances. Here we present a differential elemental abundance\nanalysis of the XO-2 stellar binary, in which both G9 stars host giant planets,\none of which is transiting. Building on our previous work, we report 16\nelemental abundances and compare the $\\Delta$(XO-2N-XO-S) values to elemental\ncondensation temperatures. The $\\Delta$(N-S) values and slopes with\ncondensation temperature resulting from four different pairs of stellar\nparameters are compared to explore the effects of changing the relative\ntemperature and gravity of the stars. We find that most of the abundance\ndifferences between the stars depend on the chosen stellar parameters, but that\nFe, Si, and potentially Ni are consistently enhanced in XO-2N regardless of the\nchosen stellar parameters. This study emphasizes the power of binary host star\nabundance analysis for probing the effects of giant planet formation, but also\nillustrates the potentially large uncertainties in abundance differences and\nslopes induced by changes in stellar temperature and gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 15:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 14:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

However, these systems are prone to partitioning, which\nby Brewer's CAP theorem [1] makes it impossible to use a strong consistency\ncriterion like atomicity. Eventual consistency [2] guaranties that all replicas\neventually converge to a common state when the participants stop updating.\nHowever, it fails to fully specify shared objects and requires additional\nnon-intuitive and error-prone distributed specification techniques, that must\ntake into account all possible concurrent histories of updates to specify this\ncommon state [3]. This approach, that can lead to specifications as complicated\nas the implementations themselves, is limited by a more serious issue. The\nconcurrent specification of objects uses the notion of concurrent events. In\nmessage-passing systems, two events are concurrent if they are enforced by\ndifferent processes and each process enforced its event before it received the\nnotification message from the other process. In other words, the notion of\nconcurrency depends on the implementation of the object, not on its\nspecification. Consequently, the final user may not know if two events are\nconcurrent without explicitly tracking the messages exchanged by the processes.\nA specification should be independent of the system on which it is implemented.\nWe believe that an object should be totally specified by two facets: its\nabstract data type, that characterizes its sequential executions, and a\nconsistency criterion, that defines how it is supposed to behave in a\ndistributed environment. Not only sequential specification helps repeal the\nproblem of intention, it also allows to use the well studied and understood\nnotions of languages and automata. This makes possible to apply all the tools\ndeveloped for sequential systems, from their simple definition using structures\nand classes to the most advanced techniques like model checking and formal\nverification. Eventual consistency (EC) imposes no constraint on the convergent\nstate, that very few depends on the sequential specification. For example, an\nimplementation that ignores all the updates is eventually consistent, as all\nreplicas converge to the initial state. We propose a new consistency criterion,\nupdate consistency (UC), in which the convergent state must be obtained by a\ntotal ordering of the updates, that contains the sequential order of each\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 15:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

Due to nonlinear localisation of energy,\nthis system exhibits extreme events in the sense that individual elements of\nthe chain show very large excitations. A detailed statistical analysis of\nextremes in this system reveals some unexpected properties, e.g., a pronounced\npattern in the inter event interval statistics. We relate these statistical\nproperties to underlying system dynamics, and notice that often when extreme\nevents occur the system dynamics adopts (at least locally) an oscillatory\nbehaviour, resulting in, for example, a quick succession of such events. The\nmodel therefore might serve as a paradigmatic model for the study of the\ninterplay of nonlinearity, energy transport, and extreme events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 12:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

This paper studies this variation based on consideration of basic\nspacetime symmetry in physics. Both laboratory $\\alpha_0$ and distant\n$\\alpha_z$ are deduced from relativistic spectrum equations of atoms\n(e.g.,hydrogen atom) defined in inertial reference system. When Einstein's\n$\\Lambda\\neq 0$, the metric of local inertial reference systems in SM of\ncosmology is Beltrami metric instead of Minkowski, and the basic spacetime\nsymmetry has to be de Sitter (dS) group. The corresponding special relativity\n(SR) is dS-SR. A model based on dS-SR is suggested. Comparing the predictions\non $\\alpha$-varying with the data, the parameters are determined. The best-fit\ndipole mode in $\\alpha$'s spatial varying is reproduced by this dS-SR model.\n$\\alpha$-varyings in whole sky is also studied. The results are generally in\nagreement with the estimations of observations. The main conclusion is that the\nphenomenon of $\\alpha$-varying cosmologically with dipole mode dominating is\ndue to the de Sitter (or anti de Sitter) spacetime symmetry with a Minkowski\npoint in an extended special relativity called de Sitter invariant special\nrelativity (dS-SR) developed by\nDirac-In\\\"{o}n\\\"{u}-Wigner-G\\\"{u}rsey-Lee-Lu-Zou-Guo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 08:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}
