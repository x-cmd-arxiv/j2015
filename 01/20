The radial velocity of one\nof the HeI 5875 components closely follows the donor radial velocity,\nsuggesting that the line is formed in a wind emerging near the stream-disc\ninteracting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 16:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We argue that modeling the fine depth details\nis easier after a coarse depth map has been computed. We express a global\n(coarse) depth map of an image as a linear combination of a depth basis learned\nfrom training examples. The depth basis captures spatial and statistical\nregularities and reduces the problem of global depth estimation to the task of\npredicting the input-specific coefficients in the linear combination. This is\nformulated as a regression problem from a holistic representation of the image.\nCrucially, the depth basis and the regression function are {\\bf coupled} and\njointly optimized by our learning scheme. We demonstrate that this results in a\nsignificant improvement in accuracy compared to direct regression of depth\npixel values or approaches learning the depth basis disjointly from the\nregression function. The global depth estimate is then used as a guidance by a\nlocal refinement method that introduces depth details that were not captured at\nthe global level.

Intuitively, one considers given\nmeasurements to be incompatible within a framework of a physical theory, if\ntheir simultaneous implementation on a single physical device is prohibited by\nthe theory itself. In the mathematical language of quantum theory, measurements\nare described by POVMs (positive operator valued measures), and given POVMs are\nby definition incompatible if they cannot be obtained via coarse-graining from\na single common POVM; this notion generalizes noncommutativity of projective\nmeasurements. In quantum theory, incompatibility can be regarded as a resource\nnecessary for manifesting phenomena such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)\nBell inequality violations or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering which do\nnot have classical explanation. We define operational ways of quantifying this\nresource via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the\nmeasurements compatible, i.e., useless as a resource. In analogy to\nentanglement measures, we generalize this idea by introducing the concept of\nincompatibility measure, which is monotone in local operations. In this paper,\nwe restrict our consideration to binary measurements, which are already\nsufficient to explicitly demonstrate nontrivial features of the theory. In\nparticular, we construct a family of incompatibility monotones operationally\nquantifying violations of certain scaled versions of the CHSH Bell inequality,\nprove that they can be computed via a semidefinite program, and show how the\nnoise-based quantities arise as special cases. We also determine maximal\nviolations of the new inequalities, demonstrating how Tsirelson's bound appears\nas a special case. The resource aspect is further motivated by simple quantum\nprotocols where our incompatibility monotones appear as relevant figures of\nmerit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 16:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 17:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 14:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

A projection from a low-level feature space to the semantic\nrepresentation space is learned from the auxiliary dataset and is applied\nwithout adaptation to the target dataset. In this paper we identify two\ninherent limitations with these approaches. First, due to having disjoint and\npotentially unrelated classes, the projection functions learned from the\nauxiliary dataset/domain are biased when applied directly to the target\ndataset/domain. We call this problem the projection domain shift problem and\npropose a novel framework, transductive multi-view embedding, to solve it. The\nsecond limitation is the prototype sparsity problem which refers to the fact\nthat for each target class, only a single prototype is available for zero-shot\nlearning given a semantic representation. To overcome this problem, a novel\nheterogeneous multi-view hypergraph label propagation method is formulated for\nzero-shot learning in the transductive embedding space. It effectively exploits\nthe complementary information offered by different semantic representations and\ntakes advantage of the manifold structures of multiple representation spaces in\na coherent manner. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that the\nproposed approach (1) rectifies the projection shift between the auxiliary and\ntarget domains, (2) exploits the complementarity of multiple semantic\nrepresentations, (3) significantly outperforms existing methods for both\nzero-shot and N-shot recognition on three image and video benchmark datasets,\nand (4) enables novel cross-view annotation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 17:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 04:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

An iconic question standing for\nsuch a challenge is how many variables are needed to define $k$-Clique in\nfirst-order logic on the class of finite ordered graphs? If $k$ variables are\nnecessary, as widely believed, it would imply that the bounded (or finite)\nvariable hierarchy in first-order logic is strict on the class of finite\nordered graphs. In 2008, Rossman made a breakthrough by establishing an optimal\naverage-case lower bound on the size of constant-depth unbounded fan-in\ncircuits computing $k$-Clique. In terms of logic, this means that it needs\ngreater than $\\lfloor\\frac{k} {4}\\rfloor$ variables to describe the $k$-Clique\nproblem in first-order logic on the class of finite ordered graphs, even in the\npresence of arbitrary arithmetic predicates. It follows, with an unpublished\nresult of Immerman, that the bounded variable hierarchy in first-order logic is\nindeed strict. However, Rossman's methods come from circuit complexity and a\nnovel notion of sensitivity by himself. And the challenge before finite model\ntheory remains there. In this paper, we give an alternative proof for the\nstrictness of bounded variable hierarchy in $\\fo$ using pure model-theoretic\ntoolkit, and anwser the question completely for first-order logic, i.e.\n$k$-variables are indeed needed to describe $k$-Clique in this logic. In\ncontrast to Rossman's proof, our proof is purely constructive. Then we embed\nthe main structures into a pure arithmetic structure to show a similar result\nwhere arbitrary arithmetic predicates are presented.

They do so while swimming forward at\nhigh speed, hence their whiskers are sensitive enough to detect small-scale\nchanges in the external flow field, while rejecting self-generated flow noise.\nHere we identify and illustrate a novel flow mechanism that allows artificial\nwhiskers with the identical unique geometry as those of the harbor seal to\ndetect the features of minute flow fluctuations in wakes produced by objects\nfar away. This is shown through the study of a model problem, consisting of a\nharbor seal whisker model interacting with the wake of an upstream circular\ncylinder. We show that whereas in open water the whisker geometry results in\nvery low vibration, once it enters a wake it oscillates with large amplitude\nand, remarkably, its response frequency coincides with the Strouhal frequency\nof the upstream cylinder, thus making the detection of an upstream wake as well\nas an estimation of the size and shape of the wake-generating body possible. An\nenergy flow extraction mechanism causes the large amplitude whisker\noscillations to lock in to the frequency of the oncoming wake, characterized by\na slaloming motion among the oncoming wake vortices. This passive mechanism has\nsome similarities with the flow mechanisms observed in actively controlled\npropulsive foils within upstream wakes and trout swimming behind bluff\ncylinders in a stream, but also differences due to the remarkable whisker\nmorphology which causes it to operate passively and within a much wider\nparametric range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 18:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

We believe that a major hurdle that hinders the\napplication of CNN to visual tracking is the lack of properly labeled training\ndata. While existing applications that liberate the power of CNN often need an\nenormous amount of training data in the order of millions, visual tracking\napplications typically have only one labeled example in the first frame of each\nvideo. We address this research issue here by pre-training a CNN offline and\nthen transferring the rich feature hierarchies learned to online tracking. The\nCNN is also fine-tuned during online tracking to adapt to the appearance of the\ntracked target specified in the first video frame. To fit the characteristics\nof object tracking, we first pre-train the CNN to recognize what is an object,\nand then propose to generate a probability map instead of producing a simple\nclass label. Using two challenging open benchmarks for performance evaluation,\nour proposed tracker has demonstrated substantial improvement over other\nstate-of-the-art trackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 18:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 06:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Beltrami equation is the eigenstate equation for the first order\nLaplace-Beltrami operator *d, which we solve by using harmonic analysis. Taking\ntorus T^3 constructed as R^3/L, where L is a crystallographic lattice, we\npresent a general algorithm to construct solutions of Beltrami equation which\nutilizes as main ingredient the orbits under the action of the point group P_L\nof three-vectors in the momentum lattice L*. We introduce the new notion of a\nUniversal Classifying Group GU_L which contains all crystallographic space\ngroups as proper subgroups. We show that the *d-eigenfunctions are naturally\narranged into irreducible representations of GU_L and by means of a systematic\nuse of the branching rules with respect to various possible subgroups H of GU_L\nwe search and find Beltrami fields with non trivial hidden symmetries. In the\ncase of the cubic lattice the point group P_L is the proper octahedral group\nO_24 and the Universal Classifying Group is finite group G_1536 of order 1536\nwhich we study in full detail deriving all of its 37 irreducible\nrepresentations and the associated character table. We show that the O_24\norbits in the cubic lattice are arranged into 48 equivalence classes, the\nparameters of the corresponding Beltrami vector fields filling all the 37\nirreducible representations of G_1536. In this way we obtain an exhaustive\nclassification of all generalized ABC-flows and of their hidden symmetries. We\nmake several conceptual comments about the possible relation of Arnold-Beltrami\nflows with (supersymmetric) Chern-Simons gauge theories. We also suggest linear\ngeneralizations of Beltrami equation to higher odd-dimensions that possibly\nmake contact with M-theory and the geometry of flux-compactifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 19:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

Methods: To better\nspecify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the\nproposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside\nhuman brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with\nimposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain\nactivity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a\nrealistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head\nand includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity\nvalues.

Along with an accompanying core MM2, SDC335 appears to be in\nthe early stages of its star formation process. In this paper we aim to\nconstrain the properties of the stars forming within these two massive\nmillimetre sources. Observations of SDC335 at 6, 8, 23 and 25GHz were made with\nthe ATCA. We report the results of these continuum measurements, which combined\nwith archival data, allow us to build and analyse the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of the compact sources in SDC335. Three HCHII regions\nwithin SDC335 are identified, two within the MM1 core. For each HCHII region, a\nfree-free emission curve is fit to the data allowing the derivation of the\nsources' emission measure, ionising photon flux and electron density. Using\nthese physical properties we assign each HCHII region a ZAMS spectral type,\nfinding two protostars with characteristics of spectral type B1.5 and one with\na lower limit of B1-B1.5. Ancillary data from infrared to mm wavelength are\nused to construct free-free component subtracted SEDs for the mm-cores,\nallowing calculation of the bolometric luminosities and revision of the\nprevious gas mass estimates. The measured luminosities for the two mm-cores are\nlower than expected from accreting sources displaying characteristics of the\nZAMS spectral type assigned to them. The protostars are still actively\naccreting, suggesting that a mechanism is limiting the accretion luminosity, we\npresent the case for two different mechanisms capable of causing this. Finally,\nusing the ZAMS mass values as lower limit constraints, a final stellar\npopulation for SDC335 was synthesised finding SDC335 is likely to be in the\nprocess of forming a stellar cluster comparable to the Trapezium Cluster and\nNGC6334 I(N).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 21:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}

Type Ia supernovae serve as distance\nindicators that led to the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the\nUniverse. The exact nature of their progenitor systems however remain unclear.\nRadio emission from the interaction between the explosion shock front and its\nsurrounding CSM or ISM provides an important probe into the progenitor star's\nlast evolutionary stage. No radio emission has yet been detected from Type Ia\nsupernovae by current telescopes. The SKA will hopefully detect radio emission\nfrom Type Ia supernovae due to its much better sensitivity and resolution.\nThere is a 'supernovae rate problem' for the core collapse supernovae because\nthe optically dim ones are missed due to being intrinsically faint and/or due\nto dust obscuration. A number of dust-enshrouded optically hidden supernovae\nshould be discovered via SKA1-MID/survey, especially for those located in the\ninnermost regions of their host galaxies. Meanwhile, the detection of\nintrinsically dim SNe will also benefit from SKA1. The detection rate will\nprovide unique information about the current star formation rate and the\ninitial mass function. A supernova explosion triggers a shock wave which expels\nand heats the surrounding CSM and ISM, and forms a supernova remnant (SNR). It\nis expected that more SNRs will be discovered by the SKA. This may decrease the\ndiscrepancy between the expected and observed numbers of SNRs.

The hierarchical distribution of the\nuniverse, with its galaxies, clusters and super-clusters of galaxies indicates\nthe absence of a natural length scale. In the Newtonian formulation, numerical\nsimulations of a one-dimensional system permit us to precisely follow the\nevolution of an ensemble of particles starting with an initial perturbation in\nthe Hubble flow. The limitation of the investigation to one dimension removes\nthe necessity to make approximations in calculating the gravitational field\nand, on the whole, the system dynamics. It is then possible to accurately\nfollow the trajectories of particles for a long time. The simulations show the\nemergence of a self-similar hierarchical structure in both the phase space and\nthe configuration space and invites the implementation of a multifractal\nanalysis. Here, after showing that symmetry considerations leads to the\nconstruction of a family of equations of motion of the one-dimensional\ngravitational system, we apply four different methods for computing generalized\ndimensions $D_q$ of the distribution of particles in configuration space. We\nfirst employ the conventional box counting and correlation integral methods\nbased on partitions of equal size and then the less familiar nearest-neighbor\nand k-neighbor methods based on partitions of equal mass.

In the past decade, many\nalgorithms have been developed to detect the communities in a network using\nconnections between nodes. However in many real world networks, the locations\nof nodes have great influence on the community structure. For example, in a\nsocial network, more connections are established between geographically\nproximate users. The impact of locations on community has not been fully\ninvestigated by the research literature. In this paper, we propose a community\ndetection method which takes locations of nodes into consideration. The goal is\nto detect communities with both geographic proximity and network closeness. We\nanalyze the distribution of the distances between connected and unconnected\nnodes to measure the influence of location on the network structure on two real\nlocation-tagged social networks. We propose a method to determine if a\nlocation-based community detection method is suitable for a given network.

Such recognition is essential for estimation of\nfill-level, volume and phase-boundaries as well as for tracking of such\nchemical processes as precipitation, crystallization, condensation, evaporation\nand phase-separation. The problem of material boundary recognition in images is\nparticularly complex for materials with non-flat surfaces, i.e., solids,\npowders and viscous fluids, in which the material interfaces have unpredictable\nshapes. This work demonstrates a general method for finding the boundaries of\nmaterials inside transparent containers in images. The method uses an image of\nthe transparent vessel containing the material and the boundary of the vessel\nin this image. The recognition is based on the assumption that the material\nboundary appears in the image in the form of a curve (with various constraints)\nwhose endpoints are both positioned on the vessel contour. The probability that\na curve matches the material boundary in the image is evaluated using a cost\nfunction based on some image properties along this curve. Several image\nproperties were examined as indicators for the material boundary. The optimal\nboundary curve was found using Dijkstra's algorithm. The method was\nsuccessfully examined for recognition of various types of phase-boundaries,\nincluding liquid-air, solid-air and solid-liquid interfaces, as well as for\nvarious types of glassware containers from everyday life and the chemistry\nlaboratory (i.e., bottles, beakers, flasks, jars, columns, vials and\nseparation-funnels).

Our proposed algorithm is based on a trainable CPA model, which\nlearns appearance evidence of individual parts and a tree-structured shape\nconfiguration among different parts. Given a probe face, CPA simultaneously\naligns all its parts by fitting them to the appearance evidence with\nconsideration of the constraint from the tree-structured shape configuration.\nThis objective is formulated as a norm minimization problem regularized by\ngraph likelihoods. CPA can be easily integrated with many existing classifiers\nto perform part-based face recognition. Extensive experiments on benchmark face\ndatasets show that CPA outperforms or is on par with existing methods for\nrobust face recognition across pose, expression, and/or illumination changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 06:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

A crucial problem is therefore to find precise criteria for a\ngiven contact to remain stable or to break. For rigid surface contacts, the\nmost general criterion is the Contact Wrench Condition (CWC). To check whether\na motion satisfies the CWC, existing approaches take into account a large\nnumber of individual contact forces (for instance, one at each vertex of the\nsupport polygon), which is computationally costly and prevents the use of\nefficient inverse-dynamics methods. Here we argue that the CWC can be\nexplicitly computed without reference to individual contact forces, and give\nclosed-form formulae in the case of rectangular surfaces -- which is of\npractical importance.

The MOS\ncase draws on all fields of contemporary astronomy, from extra-solar planets,\nto the study of the halo of the Milky Way and its satellites, and from resolved\nstellar populations in nearby galaxies out to observations of the earliest\n'first-light' structures in the partially-reionised Universe. The material\npresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over the\npast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a common\nstrategy toward realising a MOS capability on the E-ELT. The cases have been\ndistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define the\nMOSAIC instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and\n'high definition'). When combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of the\nE-ELT, MOSAIC will be the world's leading MOS facility. In analysing the\nrequirements we also identify a high-multiplex MOS for the longer-term plans\nfor the E-ELT, with an even greater multiplex (>1000 targets) to enable studies\nof large-scale structures in the high-redshift Universe. Following the green\nlight for the construction of the E-ELT the MOS community, structured through\nthe MOSAIC consortium, is eager to realise a MOS on the E-ELT as soon as\npossible. We argue that several of the most compelling cases for ELT science,\nin highly competitive areas of modern astronomy, demand such a capability. For\nexample, MOS observations in the early stages of E-ELT operations will be\nessential for follow-up of sources identified by the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). In particular, multi-object adaptive optics and accurate sky\nsubtraction with fibres have both recently been demonstrated on sky, making\nfast-track development of MOSAIC feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 07:45:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 13:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Distinct isomers of acyclic hydrocarbons (polyenes) are now under\nfocus.

Recently, distributed data association that\ninvolves only local information processing on each camera node and mutual\ninformation exchanging between neighboring cameras has attracted many research\ninterests due to its superiority in large scale applications. In this paper, we\nformulate the problem of data association in smart camera networks as an\nInteger Programming problem by introducing a set of linking variables, and\npropose two distributed algorithms, namely L-DD and Q-DD, to solve the Integer\nProgramming problem using dual decomposition technique. In our algorithms, the\noriginal IP problem is decomposed into several sub-problems, which can be\nsolved locally and efficiently on each smart camera, and then different\nsub-problems reach consensus on their solutions in a rigorous way by adjusting\ntheir parameters based on projected sub-gradient optimization. The proposed\nmethods are simple and flexible, in that (i) we can incorporate any feature\nextraction and matching technique into our framework to measure the similarity\nbetween two observations, which is used to define the cost of each link, and\n(ii) we can decompose the original problem in any way as long as the resulting\nsub-problem can be solved independently on individual camera. We show the\ncompetitiveness of our methods in both accuracy and speed by theoretical\nanalysis and experimental comparison with state of the art algorithms on two\nreal data sets collected by camera networks in our campus garden and office\nbuilding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 10:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

Various metrics have been proposed to\nmeasure the efficacy of the repair of a failed node, such as the amount of data\ndownload needed to repair (also known as the repair bandwidth), the amount of\ndata accessed at the helper nodes, and the number of helper nodes contacted.\nClearly, the amount of data accessed can never be smaller than the repair\nbandwidth. In the case of a help-by-transfer code, the amount of data accessed\nis equal to the repair bandwidth. It follows that a help-by-transfer code\npossessing optimal repair bandwidth is access optimal.

But the sub-packetization level required\nis $r^k$ where $r$ is the number of parities and $k$ is the number of\nsystematic nodes. To date, the best known achievable sub-packetization level\nfor access-optimal codes is $r^{k/r}$ in a MISER-code-based construction by\nCadambe et al. in which only the systematic nodes are repaired and where the\nlocation of symbols transmitted by a helper node depends only on the failed\nnode and is the same for all helper nodes. Under this set-up, it turns out that\nthis sub-packetization level cannot be improved upon. In the present paper, we\npresent an alternate construction under the same setup, of an access-optimal\ncode repairing systematic nodes, that is inspired by the zigzag code\nconstruction and that also achieves a sub-packetization level of $r^{k/r}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 11:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

To start with,\nwe consider the dynamics of scalar BECs in a time independent harmonic trap and\nobserve that the scattering length (SL) can be suitably manipulated either to\ncompress the bright solitons to attain peak matter wave density without causing\ntheir explosion or to broaden the width of the condensates without diluting\nthem. When the harmonic trap frequency becomes time dependent, we notice that\none can stabilize the condensates in the confining domain while the density of\nthe condensates continue to increase in the expulsive region. We also observe\nthat the trap frequency and the temporal SL can be maneuvered to generate\nmatter wave interference patterns indicating the coherent nature of the atoms\nin the condensates. We also notice that a small repulsive three body\ninteraction when reinforced with attractive binary interaction can extend the\nregion of stability of the condensates in the quasi-one dimensional regime. On\nthe other hand, the investigation of two component BECs in a time dependent\nharmonic trap suggests that it is possible to switch matter wave energy from\none mode to the other confirming the fact that vector BECs are long lived\ncompared to scalar BECs. The Feshbach resonance management of vector BECs\nindicates that the two component BECs in a time dependent harmonic trap are\nmore stable compared to the condensates in a time independent trap. The\nintroduction of weak time dependent Rabi coupling rapidly compresses the bright\nsolitons which however can be again stabilized through Feshbach resonance or by\nfinetuning the Rabi coupling while the spatial coupling of vector BECs\nintroduces a phase difference between the condensates which subsequently can be\nexploited to generate interference pattern in the bright or dark solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 11:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

Under the uplink\ncommunication setup, we propose a new \"spatial-compression-and-forward (SCF)\"\nscheme, where each RRH first performs a linear spatial filtering to denoise and\nmaximally compress its received signals from multiple users to a reduced number\nof dimensions, then conducts uniform scalar quantization over each of the\nresulting dimensions in parallel, and finally sends the total quantized bits to\nthe baseband unit (BBU) via a finite-rate fronthaul link for joint information\ndecoding. Under this scheme, we maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all users at the BBU by a\njoint resource allocation over the wireless transmission and fronthaul links.\nSpecifically, each RRH determines its own spatial filtering solution in a\ndistributed manner to reduce the signalling overhead with the BBU, while the\nBBU jointly optimizes the users' transmit power, the RRHs' fronthaul bits\nallocation, and the BBU's receive beamforming with fixed spatial filters at\nindividual RRHs.

As a result of symmetry,\nthe global sparse matrix also contains non-zero elements only in its lower\ntriangular part, which reduces the assembly operations and memory usage.

A large source of difficulty comes from the fact that\nthe development of skills in infants results from the interactions of multiple\nmechanisms at multiple spatio-temporal scales. The concepts of \"innate\" or\n\"acquired\" are not any more adequate tools for explanations, which call for a\nshift from reductionist to systemic accounts. To address this challenge,\nbuilding and experimenting with robots modeling the growing infant brain and\nbody is crucial. Systemic explanations of pattern formation in sensorimotor,\ncognitive and social development, viewed as a complex dynamical system, require\nthe use of formal models based on mathematics, algorithms and robots.\nFormulating hypothesis about development using such models, and exploring them\nthrough experiments, allows us to consider in detail the interaction between\nmany mechanisms and parameters. This complements traditional experimental\nmethods in psychology and neuroscience where only a few variables can be\nstudied at the same time. Furthermore, the use of robots is of particular\nimportance. The laws of physics generate everywhere around us spontaneous\npatterns in the inorganic world. They also strongly impact the living, and in\nparticular constrain and guide infant development through the properties of its\n(changing) body in interaction with the physical environment. Being able to\nconsider the body as an experimental variable, something that can be\nsystematically changed in order to study the impact on skill formation, has\nbeen a dream to many developmental scientists. This is today becoming possible\nwith developmental robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 13:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

Baryogenesis below the\nelectroweak scale may then need to be implemented in these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 14:06:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 15:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

In this paper,\nwe propose using the Dantzig selector model incorporating an overcomplete\ndictionary to separate a noisy undersampled collection of composite signals,\nand present an algorithm to efficiently solve the model.\n  The Dantzig selector is a statistical approach to finding a solution to a\nnoisy linear regression problem by minimizing the $\\ell_1$ norm of candidate\ncoefficient vectors while constraining the scope of the residuals.

To\nthis end, we have developed new chemical reaction sets for both gas-phase and\ngrain-surface chemistry, including the deuterated forms of species with up to\nsix atoms and the spin-state chemistry of light ions and of the species\ninvolved in the ammonia and water formation networks.

We find that the ortho/para ratios\nof ammonia and water are similar in both gas-phase and gas-grain models, at\nlate times in particular, implying that the ratios are determined by gas-phase\nprocesses. We derive late-time ortho/para ratios of ~0.5 and ~1.6 for ammonia\nand water, respectively. We find that including or excluding deuterium in the\ncalculations has little effect on the abundances of non-deuterated species and\non the ortho/para ratios of ammonia and water, especially in gas-phase models\nwhere deuteration is naturally hindered owing to the presence of abundant heavy\nelements. Although we study a rather narrow temperature range (10-20 K), we\nfind strong temperature dependence in, e.g., deuteration and nitrogen\nchemistry. For example, the depletion timescale of ammonia is significantly\nreduced when the temperature is increased from 10 to 20 K; this is because the\nincrease in temperature translates into increased accretion rates, while the\nvery high binding energy of ammonia prevents it from being desorbed at 20 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 14:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

In computability theory the notion of\nencoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as\nfor comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much\nattention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions.\n  A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective\nencoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but\nits pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the\naffirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective\nencoding f such that for every language L in C its image f[L] is regular.\n  Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences.\nFirstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect\nto a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not\nrequired to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented,\nin this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence\ndeterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine\ndeciders.\n  A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers\nvia number representations and finite automata. A set of numbers is said to be\nrecognizable with respect to a representation if an automaton accepts the\nlanguage of representations. Our result entails that there is one number\nrepresentation with respect to which every recursive set is recognizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 14:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

Several\nissues prevent this task to be straightforwardly achieved. Such features are\ndesigned for analysis and not for synthesis, thus favoring high-level\ndescription over easily inverted acoustic representation. Whereas some previous\nstudies already considered the problem of synthesizing audio from features such\nas Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, they mainly relied on the explicit\nformula used to compute those features in order to inverse them. Here, we\ninstead adopt a simple blind approach, where arbitrary sets of features can be\nused during synthesis and where reconstruction is exemplar-based. After testing\nthe approach on a speech synthesis from well known features problem, we apply\nit to the more complex task of inverting songs from the Million Song Dataset.\nWhat makes this task harder is twofold.

Second\nthe exact method used to compute these features is unknown, although the\nfeatures for new audio can be computed using their API as a black-box. In this\npaper, we detail these difficulties and present a framework to nonetheless\nattempting such synthesis by concatenating audio samples from a training\ndataset, whose features have been computed beforehand. Samples are selected at\nthe segment level, in the feature space with a simple nearest neighbor search.\nAdditionnal constraints can then be defined to enhance the synthesis\npertinence.

A one dimensional spring- mass rotary system is numerically solved\nunder the quasistatic condition with the rate and state dependent friction\nmodel. It is established that torque of frictional strength as well as torque\nof steady dynamic stress increases with radius and found to be maximum at the\nperiphery of the disc. Torque corresponding to frictional strength estimated\nusing the analytical solution matches closely with the simulation only in the\ncase of high stiffness of the connecting spring. In steady relaxation\nsimulation, a steadily rotating disc is suddenly stopped and relaxational\nangular velocity and corresponding frictional torque decreases with both steady\nangular velocity and stiffness of the connecting spring in the velocity\nstrengthening regime. In velocity weakening regime, in contrast, torque of\nrelaxation stress deceases but relaxation velocity increases. The reason for\nthe contradiction is explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 08:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}

We characterize the\nspectra quantitatively and built the detailed \"three-dimensional\" picture of\nspectral variations with pulse phase and throughout the outburst. We show that\nall spectral parameters are strongly variable with the pulse phase, and the\npattern of this variability significantly changes with luminosity directly\nreflecting the associated changes in the structure of emission regions and\ntheir beam patterns. Obtained results are qualitatively discussed in terms of\nthe recently developed reflection model for the formation of cyclotron lines in\nthe spectra of X-ray pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
