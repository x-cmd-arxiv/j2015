While great efforts\nhave been spent to improve tracking performance, a simple yet reliable prior\nknowledge is left unexploited: the target object in tracking must be an object\nother than non-object. The recently proposed and popularized objectness measure\nprovides a natural way to model such prior in visual tracking. Thus motivated,\nin this paper we propose to adapt objectness for visual object tracking.\nInstead of directly applying an existing objectness measure that is generic and\nhandles various objects and environments, we adapt it to be compatible to the\nspecific tracking sequence and object. More specifically, we use the newly\nproposed BING objectness as the base, and then train an object-adaptive\nobjectness for each tracking task. The training is implemented by using an\nadaptive support vector machine that integrates information from the specific\ntracking target into the BING measure. We emphasize that the benefit of the\nproposed adaptive objectness, named ADOBING, is generic. To show this, we\ncombine ADOBING with seven top performed trackers in recent evaluations. We run\nthe ADOBING-enhanced trackers with their base trackers on two popular\nbenchmarks, the CVPR2013 benchmark (50 sequences) and the Princeton Tracking\nBenchmark (100 sequences). On both benchmarks, our methods not only\nconsistently improve the base trackers, but also achieve the best known\nperformances. Noting that the way we integrate objectness in visual tracking is\ngeneric and straightforward, we expect even more improvement by using\ntracker-specific objectness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 16:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

To fully exploit the energy beamforming gain at\nthe energy transmitter (ET), the knowledge of channel state information (CSI)\nis essential, which, however, is difficult to be obtained in practice due to\nthe hardware limitation of the energy receiver (ER). To overcome this\ndifficulty, under a point-to-point MIMO WET setup, this paper proposes a\ngeneral design framework for a new type of channel learning method based on the\nER's energy measurement and feedback. Specifically, the ER measures and encodes\nthe harvested energy levels over different training intervals into bits, and\nsends them to the ET via a feedback link of limited rate. Based on the\nenergy-level feedback, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in subsequent\ntraining intervals and obtains refined estimates of the MIMO channel by\nleveraging the technique of analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM) in\nconvex optimization. Under this general design framework, we further propose\ntwo specific feedback schemes termed energy quantization and energy comparison,\nwhere the feedback bits at each interval are generated at the ER by quantizing\nthe measured energy level at the current interval and comparing it with those\nin the previous intervals, respectively. Numerical results are provided to\ncompare the performance of the two feedback schemes.

We combine polarization data from Planck with\nrotation measure (RM) observations towards a massive star-forming region, the\nRosette Nebula in the Monoceros molecular cloud, to study its magnetic field\nstructure and the impact of an expanding HII region on the morphology of the\nfield. We derive an analytical solution for the magnetic field, assumed to\nevolve from an initially uniform configuration following the expansion of\nionized gas and the formation of a shell of swept-up ISM. From the RM data we\nestimate a mean value of the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field of\nabout 3microG (towards the observer) in the Rosette Nebula, for a uniform\nelectron density of about 12cm-3. The dust shell that surrounds the Rosette HII\nregion is clearly observed in the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz, with a\npolarization signal significantly different from that of the local background\nwhen considered as a whole. The Planck observations constrain the\nplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the Rosette's parent\nmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along the\nGalactic plane. The Planck data are compared with the analytical model, which\npredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shell\nfor a given orientation of the field. This comparison leads to an upper limit\nof about 45degr on the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field\nin the Rosette complex, for an assumed intrinsic dust polarization fraction of\n4%. This field direction can reproduce the RM values detected in the ionized\nregion if the magnetic field strength in the Monoceros molecular cloud is in\nthe range 6.5--9microG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 16:54:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 13:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

(2014)\nregarding the extreme value theory and statistics in case of earthquake\nmagnitudes. The link between the generalized extreme value distribution (GEVD)\nas an asymptotic model for the block maxima of a random variable and the\ngeneralized Pareto distribution (GPD) as a model for the peak over thresholds\n(POT) of the same random variable is presented more clearly. Pisarenko et al.\n(2014) have inappropriately neglected that the approximations by GEVD and GPD\nwork only asymptotically in most cases. This applies particularly for the\ntruncated exponential distribution (TED), being a popular distribution model\nfor earthquake magnitudes. I explain why the classical models and methods of\nthe extreme value theory and statistics do not work well for truncated\nexponential distributions. As a consequence, the classical methods should be\nused for the estimation of the upper bound magnitude and corresponding\nparameters. Furthermore, different issues of statistical inference of Pisarenko\net al. (2014) are commented on and alternatives are proposed.

We show that the existence of a pressure gradient force in the\nfluid description does not violate Ehrenfest's theorem since its expectation\nvalue is zero.

Next we relate to the hydrodynamic description a thermodynamic\ncounterpart, taking the classical behavior of an adiabatic barotopric flow as a\nreference. We show that while the Bohm potential is not a positive definite\nquantity, as is expected from internal energy, its expectation value is\nproportional to the Fisher information whose integrand is positive definite.\nMoreover, this integrand is exactly equal to half of the square of the\nimaginary part of the momentum, as the integrand of the kinetic energy is equal\nto half of the square of the real part of the momentum. This suggests a\nrelation between the Fisher information and the thermodynamic like internal\nenergy of the Madelung fluid.

These\ngates can be directly employed in quantum repeater networks to facilitate\nnear-ideal entanglement swapping, thus greatly speeding up the entanglement\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 19:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 08:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 13:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

At all stages of our dynamical study, we\nprecisely propagate in time the observational uncertainties of cometary orbits.\nFor the first time in our calculations, we fully take into account individual\nperturbations from all known stars or stellar systems that closely (less than\n3.5 pc) approach the Sun during the cometary motion in the investigated time\ninterval of several million years. This is done by means of a direct numerical\nintegration of the N-body system comprising of a comet, the Sun and 90\npotential stellar perturbers. We show a full review of various examples of\nindividual stellar action on cometary motion. We conclude that perturbations\nfrom all known stars or stellar systems do not change the overall picture of\nthe past orbit evolution of long-period comets (LPCs).The future motion of them\nmight be seriously perturbed during the predicted close approach of Gliese 710\nstar but we do not observe significant energy changes. The importance of\nstellar perturbations is tested on the whole sample of 108 comets investigated\nby us so far and our previous results, obtained with only Galactic\nperturbations included, are fully confirmed.We present how our results can be\nused to discriminate between dynamically new and old near-parabolic comets and\ndiscuss the relevance of the so-called Jupiter-Saturn barrier phenomenon.\nFinally, we show how the Oort spike in the 1/a-distribution of near-parabolic\ncomets is built from both dynamically new and old comets. We also point out\nthat C/2007 W1 seems to be the first serious candidate for interstellar\nprovenience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 19:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Doing so\nallows us to draw quantitatively strong conclusions about the evolution of\ncultural perception of a given topic, such as time or gender. However, the\nGoogle Books corpus suffers from a number of limitations which make it an\nobscure mask of cultural popularity. A primary issue is that the corpus is in\neffect a library, containing one of each book. A single, prolific author is\nthereby able to noticeably insert new phrases into the Google Books lexicon,\nwhether the author is widely read or not. With this understood, the Google\nBooks corpus remains an important data set to be considered more lexicon-like\nthan text-like. Here, we show that a distinct problematic feature arises from\nthe inclusion of scientific texts, which have become an increasingly\nsubstantive portion of the corpus throughout the 1900s. The result is a surge\nof phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general, such as\nreferences to time in the form of citations. We highlight these dynamics by\nexamining and comparing major contributions to the statistical divergence of\nEnglish data sets between decades in the period 1800--2000. We find that only\nthe English Fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not\nheavily affected by professional texts, in clear contrast to the first version\nof the fiction data set and both unfiltered English data sets.

Probably the most intriguing\nof all spider silks is the araneid capture thread, covered with tiny\nglycoprotein glue droplets. Even if compressed, this thread remains\nsurprisingly taut, a property shared with pure liquid films, allowing both\nthread and web to be in a constant state of tension. Vollrath and Edmonds\nproposed that the glue droplets would act as small windlasses and be\nresponsible for the tension, but other explanations have also been suggested,\ninvolving for example the macromolecular properties of the flagelliform silk\ncore filaments. Here we show that the nanolitre glue droplets of the capture\nthread indeed induce buckling and coiling of the core filaments: microscopic\nin-vivo observations reveal that the slack fibre is spooled into and within the\ndroplets. We model windlass activation as a structural phase transition, and\nshow that fibre spooling essentially results from the interplay between\nelasticity and capillarity. This is demonstrated by reproducing artificially\nthe mechanism on a synthetic polyurethane thread/silicone oil droplet system.\nFibre size is the key in natural and artificial setups which both require\nmicrometer-sized fibres to function. The spools and coils inside the drops are\nfurther shown to directly affect the mechanical response of the thread,\nevidencing the central role played by geometry in spider silk mechanics. Beside\nshedding light on araneid capture thread functionality, we argue that the\nproperties of this biological system provide novel insights for bioinspired\nsynthetic actuators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 20:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

It is\nkept deliberately mathematically simple to help explain the transactional\ntechnique. The emphasis is on a clear understanding of how the instantaneous\n\"collapse\" of the wave function due to a measurement at a specific time and\nplace may be reinterpreted as a gradual collapse over the entire path of the\nphoton and over the entire transit time from slit to detector. This is made\npossible by the use of a retarded offer wave, which is thought to travel from\nthe slits (or rather the small region within the parametric crystal where\ndown-conversion takes place) to the detector and an advanced counter wave\ntraveling backward in time from the detector to the slits. The point here is to\nmake clear how simple the Cramer transactional picture is and how much more\nintuitive the collapse of the wave function becomes if viewed in this way. Also\nany confusion about possible retro-causal signaling is put to rest. A delayed\nchoice quantum eraser does not require any sort of backward in time\ncommunication. This paper makes the point that it is preferable to use the\nTransactional Interpretation (TI) over the usual Copenhagen Interpretation (CI)\nfor a more intuitive understanding of the quantum eraser delayed choice\nexperiment. Both methods give exactly the same end results and can be used\ninterchangeably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 20:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 00:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 23:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 20:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 21:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

When this happens, the received packets are discarded and\nretransmissions are required, which is a waste of power and bandwidth. In such\na situation one of the most important objectives is to find techniques to\nimprove these protocols to reduce the number of collisions or to avoid them.\nSeveral studies have contributed to this problem. In this paper, we propose a\nnew approach named ZigZag decoding to enhance slotted Aloha mechanism by\nreducing the loss rate of packets colliding. We model the system by a Markov\nchain witch the number of backlogged packets is taken as the system state. We\nuse a stochastic game to achieve our objective. We evaluate and compare the\nperformances parameters of the proposed approach with those of slotted Aloha\nmechanism.

This galaxy\nbelongs to the class of molecular hydrogen emission galaxies (MOHEGs) that have\nvery luminous emission from warm molecular hydrogen. In radio galaxies, the\nmolecular gas appears to be heated by jet-driven shocks, but exactly how this\nmechanism works is still poorly understood. With Chandra, we observe X-ray\nemission from the jets within the host galaxy and along the 100 kpc radio jets.\nWe model the X-ray spectra of the nucleus, the inner jets, and the X-ray\nfeatures along the extended radio jets. Both the nucleus and the inner jets\nshow evidence of 10^7 K shock-heated gas. The kinetic power of the jets is more\nthan sufficient to heat the X-ray emitting gas within the host galaxy. The\nthermal X-ray and warm H2 luminosities of 3C293 are similar, indicating similar\nmasses of X-ray hot gas and warm molecular gas. This is consistent with a\npicture where both derive from a multiphase, shocked interstellar medium (ISM).\nWe find that radio-loud MOHEGs that are not brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs),\nlike 3C293, typically have LH2/LX~1 and MH2/MX~1, whereas MOHEGs that are BCGs\nhave LH2/LX~0.01 and MH2/MX~0.01. The more massive, virialized, hot atmosphere\nin BCGs overwhelms any direct X-ray emission from current jet-ISM interaction.\nOn the other hand, LH2/LX~1 in the Spiderweb BCG at z=2, which resides in an\nunvirialized protocluster and hosts a powerful radio source. Over time, jet-ISM\ninteraction may contribute to the establishment of a hot atmosphere in BCGs and\nother massive elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 21:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this work, we study the mass\nsegregation that emerges after the initial violent dynamical evolution. At this\nscope, we ran a set of high precision N-body simulations of isolated clusters\nby means of HiGPUs, our direct summation N-body code. After the collapse, the\nsystem shows a clear mass segregation. This (quick) mass segregation occurs in\ntwo phases: the first shows up in clumps originated by sub-fragmentation before\nthe deep overall collapse; this segregation is partly erased during the deep\ncollapse to re-emerge, abruptly, during the second phase, that follows the\nfirst bounce of the system. In this second stage, the proper clock to measure\nthe rate of segregation is the dynamical time after virialization, which (for\ncold and cool systems) may be significantly different from the crossing time\nevaluated from initial conditions. This result is obtained for isolated\nclusters composed of stars of two different masses (in the ratio $m_h/m_l=2$),\nat varying their number ratio, and is confirmed also in presence of a massive\ncentral object (simulating a black hole of stellar size). Actually, in stellar\nsystems starting their dynamical evolution from cool conditions, the fast mass\nsegregation adds to the following, slow, secular segregation which is\ncollisionally induced. The violent mass segregation is an effect persistent\nover the whole range of N ($128 \\leq N \\leq 1024$) investigated, and is an\ninteresting feature on the astronomical-observational side, too. The\nsemi-steady state reached after virialization corresponds to a mass segregated\ndistribution function rather than that of equipartition of kinetic energy per\nunit mass as it should result from violent relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 23:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 13:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 18:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-12"}

Differences in the colours, morphologies, star formation\nrates and gas fractions amongst galaxies of equal stellar/baryon mass M are\npotentially widely explained by variations in their specific stellar/baryon\nangular momentum j. The enormous potential of angular momentum science is only\njust being realised, thanks to the emergence of the first simulations of\ngalaxies with converged spins, paralleled by a dramatic increase in kinematic\nobservations. Such observations are still challenged by the fact that most of\nthe stellar/baryon angular momentum resides at large radii. In fact, the radius\nthat maximally contributes to the angular momentum of an exponential disk\n(3Re-4Re) is twice as large as the radius that maximally contributes to the\ndisk mass; thus converged measurements of angular momentum require either\nextremely deep IFS data or, alternatively, kinematic measurements of neutral\natomic hydrogen (HI), which naturally resides at the large disk radii that\ndominate the angular momentum. The SKA has a unique opportunity to become the\nworld-leading facility for angular momentum studies due to its ability to\nmeasure the resolved and/or global HI kinematics in very large and\nwell-characterised galaxy samples. These measurements will allow, for example,\n(1) a very robust determination of the two-dimensional distribution of galaxies\nin the (M,j)-plane, (2) the largest, systematic measurement of the relationship\nbetween M, j, and tertiary galaxy properties, and (3) the most accurate\nmeasurement of the large-scale distribution and environmental dependence of\nangular momentum vectors, both in terms of norm and orientation. All these\nmeasurements will represent exquisite tools to build a next generation of\ngalaxy evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 00:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

It is possible to measure the\nturbulence of the hot gas in clusters by estimating the velocity widths of\ntheir X-ray emission lines.

The new observations improve the\nquality of the archival data and allow us to place constraints for some\nclusters, which were not accessible in previous work. One-half of the sample\nshows upper limits on turbulence less than 500km/s. For several sources, our\ndata are consistent with relatively strong turbulence with upper limits on the\nvelocity widths that are larger than 1000km/s. The NGC507 group of galaxies\nshows transonic velocities, which are most likely associated with the merging\nphenomena and bulk motions occurring in this object. Where both low- and\nhigh-ionization emission lines have good enough statistics, we find larger\nupper limits for the hot gas, which is partly due to the different spatial\nextents of the hot and cool gas phases. Our upper limits are larger than the\nMach numbers required to balance cooling, suggesting that dissipation of\nturbulence may prevent cooling, although other heating processes could be\ndominant.

One of the most fundamental,\nbut unanswered questions in the evolution of galaxies is how gas circulates in\nand around galaxies and how it enters the galaxies to support star formation.\nWe have several lines of evidence that the observed evolution of star formation\nrequires gas accretion from the IGM at all times and on all cosmic scales. This\ngas remains largely unaccounted for and the outstanding questions are where\nthis gas resides and what the physical mechanisms of accretion are. The gas is\nexpected to be embedded in an extended cosmic web made of sheets and filaments.\nSuch large-scale filaments of gas are expected by cosmological numerical\nsimulations, which have made significant progress in recent years. Such\nsimulations do not only model the large scale structure of the cosmic web, but\nalso investigate the neutral gas component. To truly make significant progress\nin understanding the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, column\ndensities of NHI=10^18 cm-2 and below have to be probed over large areas on the\nsky at sub-arcminute resolution.

Two important questions are how far do these reservoirs cool and\nif cold gas is abundant what is the cause of the low star formation efficiency?\nHeating and excitation of the filaments from collisions and mixing of hot\nparticles in the surrounding X-ray gas describes well the optical and near\ninfra-red line ratios observed in the filaments. In this paper we examine the\ntheoretical properties of dense, cold clouds emitting in the far infra-red and\nsubmillimeter through the bright lines of [C II]157 \\mu m , [O I]63 \\mu m and\nCO, exposed to these energetic ionising particles. While some emission lines\nmay be optically thick we find this is not sufficient to model the emission\nline ratios. Models where the filaments are supported by thermal pressure\nsupport alone also cannot account for the cold gas line ratios but a very\nmodest additional pressure support, either from turbulence or magnetic fields\ncan fit the observed [O I]/[C II] line ratios by decreasing the density of the\ngas. This may also help stabilise the filaments against collapse leading to the\nlow rates of star formation. Finally we make predictions for the line ratios\nexpected from cold gas under these conditions and present diagnostic diagrams\nfor comparison with further observations. We provide our code as an Appendix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 05:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

These\nmultiwavelength datasets will enable studies to move beyond an understanding of\nHI gas in isolation to instead understand HI as an integral part of the highly\ncomplex baryonic processes that drive galaxy evolution.\n  As they evolve, galaxies experience a host of environmental and feedback\ninfluences, many of which can radically impact their gas content. Important\nprocesses include: accretion (hot and cold mode, mergers), depletion (star\nformation, galactic winds, AGN), phase changes (ionised/atomic/molecular), and\nenvironmental effects (ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, strangulation).\nGoverning all of these to various extents is the underlying dark matter\ndistribution. In turn, the result of these processes can significantly alter\nthe baryonic states in which material is finally observed (stellar populations,\ndust, chemistry) and its morphology (galaxy type, bulge/disk ratio, bars,\nwarps, radial profile). To fully understand the evolution of HI and the role it\nplays in galactic evolution requires the ability to quantify each of these\nseparate processes, and hence to coordinate SKA HI surveys with extensive\nmulti-band photometric and spectroscopic campaigns. In addition,\nmultiwavelength data is essential for statistical methods of HI analysis such\nas HI stacking and intensity mapping cross-correlations.\n  In this chapter, we examine some of the principal science motivations for\nacquiring multiwavelength data to match that from the extragalactic SKA HI\nsurveys, and review the currently planned capacity to achieve this (eg.

To test this prediction, we\nmodel local dispersal of haploid individuals on a two-dimensional torus using\nfour dispersal kernels: Rayleigh, exponential, half-normal and triangular.

Here we verify their planetary nature by validating them\nstatistically using the BLENDER technique, which simulates large numbers of\nfalse positives and compares the resulting light curves with the Kepler\nphotometry. This analysis was supplemented with new follow-up observations\n(high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, adaptive optics\nimaging, and speckle interferometry), as well as an analysis of the flux\ncentroids. For eleven of them (KOI-0571.05, 1422.04, 1422.05, 2529.02, 3255.01,\n3284.01, 4005.01, 4087.01, 4622.01, 4742.01, and 4745.01) we show that the\nlikelihood they are true planets is far greater than that of a false positive,\nto a confidence level of 99.73% (3 sigma) or higher. For KOI-4427.01 the\nconfidence level is about 99.2% (2.6 sigma). With our accurate characterization\nof the GKM host stars, the derived planetary radii range from 1.1 to 2.7\nR_Earth. All twelve objects are confirmed to be in the HZ, and nine are small\nenough to be rocky. Excluding three of them that have been previously validated\nby others, our study doubles the number of known rocky planets in the HZ.\nKOI-3284.01 (Kepler-438b) and KOI-4742.01 (Kepler-442b) are the planets most\nsimilar to the Earth discovered to date when considering their size and\nincident flux jointly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 07:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 19:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This subject is an open\nproblem in signal processing for more than 50 years. Local methods suggested in\nrecent years, have obtained better results than global methods. However by more\nintelligent training in such a way that first, important data is more effective\nfor training, second, clustering in such way that training blocks lie in\nlow-rank subspaces, we can design a dictionary applicable for image de-noising\nand obtain results near the state of the art local methods. In the present\npaper, we suggest a method based on global clustering of image constructing\nblocks. As the type of clustering plays an important role in clustering-based\nde-noising methods, we address two questions about the clustering. The first,\nwhich parts of the data should be considered for clustering? and the second,\nwhat data clustering method is suitable for de-noising.? Then clustering is\nexploited to learn an over complete dictionary. By obtaining sparse\ndecomposition of the noisy image blocks in terms of the dictionary atoms, the\nde-noised version is achieved. In addition to our framework, 7 popular\ndictionary learning methods are simulated and compared. The results are\ncompared based on two major factors: (1) de-noising performance and (2)\nexecution time. Experimental results show that our dictionary learning\nframework outperforms its competitors in terms of both factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 08:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

The light curves showed\nsignificant and rapid variation in source flux during entire observation. We\ndid not find any signature of pulsations in the light curves.

To this end, we use SU(3) Polyakov linear sigma-model and assume that\nthe external magnetic field eB adds some restrictions to the quarks energy due\nto the existence of free charges in the plasma phase. In doing this, we apply\nthe Landau theory of quantization. This requires an additional temperature to\ndrive the system through the chiral phase-transition. Accordingly, the\ndependence of the critical temperature of chiral and confinement\nphase-transitions on the magnetic field is characterized. Based on this, we\nhave studied the thermal evolution of thermodynamic quantities and the first\nfour higher-order moment of particle multiplicity. Having all these\ncalculations, we have studied the effects of magnetic field on chiral\nphase-transition. We found that both critical temperature T_c and critical\nchemical potential increase with increasing the magnetic field eB. Last but not\nleast, the magnetic effects of the thermal evolution of four scalar and four\npseudoscalar meson states are studied. We concluded that the meson masses\ndecrease as the temperature increases till T_c. Then, the vacuum effect becomes\ndominant and rapidly increases with the temperature T. At low T, the scalar\nmeson masses normalized to the lowest Matsubara frequency rapidly decreases as\nT increases. Then, starting from T_c, we find that the thermal dependence\nalmost vanishes. Furthermore, the meson masses increase with increasing\nmagnetic field. This gives characteristic phase diagram of T vs. external\nmagnetic field $B. At high T, we find that the masses of almost all meson\nstates become temperature independent. It is concluded that the various meson\nstates likely have different T_c's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 10:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-30"}

The increased sensitivity and high spectral resolution of millimeter\ntelescopes allow the detection of an increasing number of isotopically\nsubstituted molecules in the interstellar medium.

We want to\ncheck the underlying hypothesis that the 13C/ 12C ratio of nitriles and\nisonitriles is equal to the elemental value via a chemical time dependent gas\nphase chemical model. Methods. We have built a chemical network containing D,\n13C and 15N molecular species after a careful check of the possible\nfractionation reactions at work in the gas phase. Results. Model results\nobtained for 2 different physical conditions corresponding respectively to a\nmoderately dense cloud in an early evolutionary stage and a dense depleted\npre-stellar core tend to show that ammonia and its singly deuterated form are\nsomewhat enriched in 15N, in agreement with observations. The 14N/ 15N ratio in\nN2H+ is found to be close to the elemental value, in contrast to previous\nmodels which obtain a significant enrichment, as we found that the\nfractionation reaction between 15N and N2H+ has a barrier in the entrance\nchannel.

The code performed a 2D spatially coupled inversion on\nthe Stokes spectra, allowing the retrieval of gradients in optical depth within\nthe atmosphere of each pixel, whilst accounting for the effects of the\ninstrument's PSF.

The\ninversion results reveal that plage is composed of magnetic flux concentrations\n(MFCs) with typical field strengths of 1520 G at log(\\tau)=-0.9 and\ninclinations of 10-15 degrees. The MFCs expand by forming magnetic canopies\ncomposed of weaker and more inclined magnetic fields.

The methodology is based on measuring the\nenergy absorbed by the electronic system from alternating electromagnetic\nfields as function of their frequency. Experiments on three-dimensional (3D)\namorphous indium-oxide films suggest that, in the strongly localized regime,\nthe energy spectrum is discrete and inelastic electron-electron events are\nstrongly suppressed. These results imply that, at low temperatures, electron\nthermalization and finite conductivity depend on coupling to the phonon bath.\nThe situation is different for samples nearing the metal-insulator transition;\nin insulating samples that are close to the mobility-edge, energy absorption\npersists to much higher frequencies. Comparing these results with previously\nstudied 2D samples [Ovadyahu, Phys. Rev.

The low level of energy-flux necessary to\ninduce an appreciable effect seems surprising given the high\ncarrier-concentration n of these ternary alloys. On the other hand, their high\ndensity of carriers makes GeSbTe films favorable candidates for exhibiting\nintrinsic electron-glass effects with long relaxation times. These are indeed\nobserved in GeSbTe thin-films that are Anderson-localized. In particular, a\nmemory-dip is observed in samples with sheet resistances larger than app. 100\nkOhms at T=4K with similar characteristics as in other systems that exhibit\nintrinsic electron-glass effects. Persistent-photoconductivity however is\nobservable in GeSbTe films even for sheet resistances of the order of 1 kOhm,\nwell below the range of disorder required for observing electron-glass effects.\nThese two non-equilibrium phenomena, PPC and electron-glass, are shown to be of\ndifferent nature in terms of other aspects as well. In particular, their\nrelaxation dynamics is qualitatively different; the excess conductance dG/G\nassociated with PPC decays with time as a stretched exponential whereas a\nlogarithmic relaxation law characterizes dG(t) of all electron-glasses studied\nto date. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the memory-dip is enhanced when the\nsystem is in the PPC state. This counter-intuitive result may be related to the\ncompositional disorder in these materials extending over mesoscopic scales.\nEvidence in support of this scenario is presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 12:37:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 20:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

However,\nusing radial velocities from interstellar molecular clouds, which is common in\nrotation curve determination, seems to be incorrect and may lead to incorrectly\ninferring that the rotation curve is flat indeed. Tests basing on photometric\nand spectral observations of bright stars may be misleading. The rotation\ntracers (OB stars) are affected by motions around local gravity centers and\npulsation effects seen in such early type objects. To get rid of the latter a\nlot of observing work must be involved. We introduce a method of studying the\nkinematics of the thin disc of our Galaxy outside the solar orbit in a way that\navoids these problems. We propose a test based on observations of interstellar\nCaII H and K lines that determines both radial velocities and distances. We\nimplemented the test using stellar spectra of thin disc stars at galactic\nlongitudes of 135{\\degr} and 180{\\degr}. Using this method, we constructed the\nrotation curve of the thin disc of the Galaxy. The test leads to the obvious\nconclusion that the rotation curve of the thin gaseous galactic disk,\nrepresented by the CaII lines, is Keplerian outside the solar orbit rather than\nflat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 14:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper, we continue our study by investigating the\ndetailed properties of wind, such as mass flux and poloidal speed, and the\nmechanism of wind production. For this aim, we make use of a three dimensional\nGRMHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. The\nsimulation is designed so that the magnetic flux is not accumulated\nsignificantly around the black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent\noutflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Largrangian particles from\nsimulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a quasi-relativistic\njet close to the axis and a sub-relativistic wind subtending a much larger\nsolid angle. Most of the wind originates from the surface layer of the\naccretion flow. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are\nproduced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows $v_{\\rm p,\nwind}(r)\\approx 0.25 v_k(r)$. The mass flux of jet is much lower but the speed\nis much higher, $v_{\\rm p,jet}\\sim (0.3-0.4) c$. Consequently, both the energy\nand momentum fluxes of the wind are much larger than those of the jet. We find\nthat the wind is produced and accelerated primarily by the combination of\ncentrifugal force and magnetic pressure gradient, while the jet is mainly\naccelerated by magnetic pressure gradient. Finally, we find that the wind\nproduction efficiency $\\epsilon_{\\rm wind}\\equiv\\dot{E}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nBH}c^2\\sim 1/1000$, in good agreement with the value required from large-scale\ngalaxy simulations with AGN feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 15:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The aim of\nthis paper is to show the existence of orbits whose angular momentum performs\narbitrary excursions in a large region. In particular, there exist diffusive\norbits, that is, with a large variation of angular momentum.\n  The leading idea of the proof consists in analysing parabolic motions of the\ncomet. By a well-known result of McGehee, the union of future (resp. past)\nparabolic orbits is an analytic manifold. In a properly chosen coordinate\nsystem these manifolds are stable (resp. unstable) manifolds of a manifold at\ninfinity $P_\\infty$, which we call manifold at parabolic infinity.\n  On this manifold, it is possible to define two scattering maps, which contain\nthe map structure of the homoclinic trajectories to it, i.e. orbits parabolic\nboth in the future and the past. Since the inner dynamics inside $P_\\infty$ is\ntrivial, two different scattering maps are used. The combination of these two\nscattering maps permits the design of the desired diffusive pseudo-orbits.\nUsing shadowing techniques and these pseudo orbits we show the existence of\ntrue trajectories of the RPETBP whose angular momentum varies in any\npredetermined fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 15:58:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 22:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Aug 2018 18:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}
