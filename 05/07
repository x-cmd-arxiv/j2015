The in-medium energy\nloss of heavy quarks is described using our modified Langevin equation that\nincorporates both quasi-elastic scatterings and the medium-induced gluon\nradiation. The space-time profiles of the fireball is described by a\n(2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics simulation. A hybrid model of fragmentation and\ncoalescence is utilized for heavy quark hadronization, after which the produced\nheavy mesons together with the soft hadrons produced from the bulk QGP are fed\ninto the hadron cascade UrQMD model to simulate the subsequent hadronic\ninteractions. We find that the medium-induced gluon radiation contributes\nsignificantly to heavy quark energy loss at high $p_\\mathrm{T}$; heavy-light\nquark coalescence enhances heavy meson production at intermediate\n$p_\\mathrm{T}$; and scatterings inside the hadron gas further suppress the $D$\nmeson $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ at large $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and enhance its $v_2$.

Observational evidence provides\nsupport to the idea that SGRBs originate from the merger of compact binaries,\nconsisting of two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole (BH).\nTheoretical models and numerical simulations seem to converge to an explanation\nin which the central engine of SGRBs is given by a spinning BH surrounded by a\nhot accretion torus. Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events. The long durations of these\nafterglows (from minutes to several hours) cannot be explained by the\n$\\sim\\text{s}$ accretion timescale of the torus onto the BH, and, instead,\nsuggest a long-lived NS as the persistent source of radiation. Yet, if the\nmerger results in a massive NS the conditions to generate a relativistic jet\nand thus the prompt SGRB emission are hardly met. Here we consider an\nalternative scenario that can reconcile the two aspects and account for both\nthe prompt and the X-ray afterglow emission.

We\nderive the radial velocity of all stars, and the atmospheric chemical mix\n([Fe/H], C/O, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, Al, Si, Ti, and Y) where possible.

Importantly, we show that postquantum steering is a\ngenuinely new phenomenon, fundamentally different from postquantum nonlocality.\nOur results provide new insight into the nonlocal correlations of multipartite\nquantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 16:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2015 15:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-09"}

On this random\ngraph we are executing a process, which one-by-one probes the edges and\ngradually constructs a matching. The process is constrained in two ways: once\nan edge is taken it cannot be removed from the matching, and the timeout of\nnode $v$ upper-bounds the number of edges incident to $v$ that can be probed.\nThe goal is to maximize the expected profit of the constructed matching.\n  For this problem Bansal et al.

The matrix that specifies the system\ndynamics is the transpose of the network Laplacian matrix, which codes the\nconnectivity of the network. Our analysis shows that for any nonzero complex\neigenvalue $\\lambda$ of this matrix, the following inequality holds:\n$\\frac{|\\Im \\lambda |}{|\\Re \\lambda |} \\leq \\cot\\frac{\\pi}{n}$.

In the regime of $^3$He concentrations $\\tilde <\n10^{-9}$ and temperatures $\\sim 0.5$ K, the phonons comprising the heat current\nare kept in a flowing local equilibrium by small angle phonon-phonon\nscattering, while they transfer momentum to the walls via the $^4$He first\nviscosity. On the other hand, the phonon wind drives the $^3$He out of local\nequilibrium via phonon-$^3$He scattering. For temperatures below $0.5$ K, both\nthe phonon and $^3$He mean free paths can reach the centimeter scale, and we\ncalculate the effects on the transport coefficients. We derive the relevant\ntransport coefficients, the phonon thermal conductivity and the $^3$He\ndiffusion constants from the Boltzmann equation. We calculate the effect of\nscattering from the walls of the pipe and show that it may be characterized by\nthe average distance from points inside the pipe to the walls. The temporal\nevolution of the spatial distribution of the $^3$He atoms is determined by the\ntime dependent $^3$He diffusion equation, which describes the competition\nbetween advection by the phonon wind and $^3$He diffusion. As a consequence of\nthe thermal diffusivity being small compared with the $^3$He diffusivity, the\nscale height of the final $^3$He distribution is much smaller than that of the\ntemperature gradient.

The mass fraction in the smooth component is\n60 - 90 %, insensitive to redshift or halo mass. The simulations with strong\nfeedback show clear signs of reaccretion due to recycling of galactic winds.\nThe mean accretion rate for the mergers is a factor 2 - 3 larger than that of\nthe smooth component. The standard deviation of the accretion rate is 0.2 - 0.3\ndex, showing no trend with mass or redshift. For the smooth component it is\n0.12 - 0.24 dex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 20:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 16:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Aside from field stars, the Sgr dSph is suspected to have\nlost a number of globular clusters (GC). Many Galactic GC are suspected to have\noriginated in the Sgr dSph. While for some candidates an origin in the Sgr dSph\nhas been confirmed due to chemical similarities, others exist whose chemical\ncomposition has never been investigated. NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 are two among\nthese scarcely studied Sgr dSph candidate-member clusters. To characterize\ntheir composition we analyzed one giant star in NGC 5053, and two in NGC 5634.\nWe analize high-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra by means of the MyGIsFOS\ncode, determining atmospheric parameters and abundances for up to 21 species\nbetween O and Eu. The abundances are compared with those of MW halo field\nstars, of \"unassociated\" MW halo globulars, and of the metal poor Sgr dSph main\nbody population.\n  We derive a metallicity of [FeII/H]=-2.26+-0.10 for NGC 5053, and of\n[FeI/H]=-1.99+-0.075 and -1.97+-0.076 for the two stars in NGC 5634. This makes\nNGC 5053 one of the most metal poor globular clusters in the MW. Both clusters\ndisplay an alpha enhancement similar to the one of the halo at comparable\nmetallicity. The two stars in NGC 5634 clearly display the Na-O anticorrelation\nwidespread among MW globulars. Most other abundances are in good agreement with\nstandard MW halo trends. The chemistry of the Sgr dSph main body populations is\nsimilar to the one of the halo at low metallicity. It is thus difficult to\ndiscriminate between an origin of NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 in the Sgr dSph, and\none in the MW. However, the abundances of these clusters do appear closer to\nthat of Sgr dSph than of the halo, favoring an origin in the Sgr dSph system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 20:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 19:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

Given\ndifferent parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric S/N\nratios, SED fitting errors, systematic effects, the inherent degeneracies and\ncorrelated errors), we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to\nquantify these effects individually. We studied the sensitivity of stellar mass\nestimates to the codes/methods used, population synthesis models, star\nformation histories, nebular emission line contributions, photometric\nuncertainties, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the difference\nbetween the input stellar masses and those estimated using different simulation\ncatalogs, $\\Delta\\log(M)$, was calculated and used to identify the most\nfundamental parameters affecting stellar masses. We measured different\ncomponents of the error budget, with the results listed as follows: (1). no\nsignificant bias was found among different codes/methods, with all having\ncomparable scatter; (2). A source of error is found to be due to photometric\nuncertainties and low resolution in age and extinction grids; (3). The median\nof stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the mass\nassociated with any given galaxy; (4). The deviations in stellar mass strongly\ncorrelate with those in age, with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5).\nthe scatter in the stellar masses due to free parameters are quantified, with\nthe sensitivity of the stellar mass to both the population synthesis codes and\ninclusion of nebular emission lines studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 20:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Previous studies have shown that such coherent\neffects are suppressed when reciprocity is broken. Here we show that by\nbreaking reciprocity in a controlled manner, we can tune, rather than simply\nsuppress, these phenomena. In particular, we manipulate coherent backscattering\nof light, also known as weak localization. By utilizing a non-reciprocal\nmagneto-optical effect, we control the interference between time-reversed paths\ninside a multimode fiber with strong mode mixing, and realize a continuous\ntransition from the well-known peak to a dip in the backscattered intensity.\nOur results may open new possibilities for coherent control of classical and\nquantum waves in complex systems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 20:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Here we survey recent results on how simple\nhashing schemes based on tabulation provide unexpectedly strong guarantees.\n  Simple tabulation hashing dates back to Zobrist [1970]. Keys are viewed as\nconsisting of $c$ characters and we have precomputed character tables\n$h_1,...,h_c$ mapping characters to random hash values. A key $x=(x_1,...,x_c)$\nis hashed to $h_1[x_1] \\oplus h_2[x_2].....\\oplus h_c[x_c]$. This schemes is\nvery fast with character tables in cache. While simple tabulation is not even\n4-independent, it does provide many of the guarantees that are normally\nobtained via higher independence, e.g., linear probing and Cuckoo hashing.\n  Next we consider twisted tabulation where one input character is \"twisted\" in\na simple way. The resulting hash function has powerful distributional\nproperties: Chernoff-Hoeffding type tail bounds and a very small bias for\nmin-wise hashing. This also yields an extremely fast pseudo-random number\ngenerator that is provably good for many classic randomized algorithms and\ndata-structures.\n  Finally, we consider double tabulation where we compose two simple tabulation\nfunctions, applying one to the output of the other, and show that this yields\nvery high independence in the classic framework of Carter and Wegman [1977]. In\nfact, w.h.p., for a given set of size proportional to that of the space\nconsumed, double tabulation gives fully-random hashing. We also mention some\nmore elaborate tabulation schemes getting near-optimal independence for given\ntime and space.\n  While these tabulation schemes are all easy to implement and use, their\nanalysis is not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 21:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 10:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 17:12:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 16:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

The availability of asteroseismic constraints for a large sample of\nred giant stars from the CoRoT and Kepler missions paves the way for various\nstatistical studies of the seismic properties of stellar populations.\n  Aims. We use the first detailed spectroscopic study of 19 CoRoT red-giant\nstars (Morel et al 2014) to compare theoretical stellar evolution models to\nobservations of the open cluster NGC 6633 and field stars.\n  Methods. In order to explore the effects of rotation-induced mixing and\nthermohaline instability, we compare surface abundances of carbon isotopic\nratio and lithium with stellar evolution predictions. These chemicals are\nsensitive to extra-mixing on the red-giant branch.\n  Results. We estimate mass, radius, and distance for each star using the\nseismic constraints. We note that the Hipparcos and seismic distances are\ndifferent. However, the uncertainties are such that this may not be\nsignificant. Although the seismic distances for the cluster members are self\nconsistent they are somewhat larger than the Hipparcos distance. This is an\nissue that should be considered elsewhere. Models including thermohaline\ninstability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the seismically\ndetermined masses can explain the chemical properties of red-giants targets.\nHowever, with this sample of stars we cannot perform stringent tests of the\ncurrent stellar models. Tighter constraints on the physics of the models would\nrequire the measurement of the core and surface rotation rates, and of the\nperiod spacing of gravity-dominated mixed modes. A larger number of stars with\nlonger times series, as provided by Kepler or expected with Plato, would help\nfor ensemble asteroseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 22:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

When the\nmagnetization direction of the ferromagnet is suitably chosen, two\nsupercurrents experience opposite phase shifts from the conventional sinusoidal\ncurrent-phase relation.

One hypothesis states that toxicity arises from the aggregation of\namyloid-beta into a pore structure, which can then puncture the brain cell\nmembrane; this allow toxic calcium ions to flood through the opening, causing\neventual cell death. In 2007, neurobiologist Ruth Nussinov calculated the three\npore sizes most likely to occur within the brain. Based on her findings, we\nconstructed a method to determine the time it takes for a cell to die after the\ncell is punctured by the pore. Our findings have shown that cell death occurs\nwithin one second after the oligomer makes contact with the cell. We believe\nthis is important because instant cell death has been one criticism of\nNussinov's model, and we have calculated a concrete time value for that\ncriticism.

Each of the standard scenarios proposed, involving rapid\naccretion of seed black holes or black hole mergers, faces severe theoretical\ndifficulties in explaining the short-time formation of supermassive objects. In\nthis work we propose an alternative scenario for the formation of SMBH in the\nearly Universe, in which energy transfer from superconducting cosmic strings\npiercing small seed black holes is the main physical process leading to rapid\nmass increase. As a toy model, the accretion rate of a seed black hole pierced\nby two antipodal strings carrying constant current is considered. Using an\neffective action approach, which phenomenologically incorporates a large class\nof superconducting string models, we estimate the minimum current required to\nform SMBH with masses of order $M = 2 \\times 10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ by $z = 7.085$.\nThis corresponds to the mass of the central black hole powering the quasar ULAS\nJ112001.48+064124.3 and is taken as a test case scenario for early-epoch SMBH\nformation. For GUT scale strings, the required fractional increase in the\nstring energy density, due to the presence of the current, is of order\n$10^{-7}$, so that their existence remains consistent with current\nobservational bounds on the string tension. In addition, we consider an\n\"exotic\" scenario, in which an SMBH is generated when a small seed black hole\nis pierced by a higher-dimensional $F-$string, predicted by string theory. We\nfind that both topological defect strings and fundamental strings are able to\ncarry currents large enough to generate early-epoch SMBH via our proposed\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 04:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 07:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 08:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 07:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 04:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-08"}

Recent observations reveal that the Stream's mass\nis in fact dominated (3:1) by its ionised component. Here we revisit the origin\nof the mysterious H-alpha recombination emission observed along much of its\nlength that is overly bright (~150-200 milli-Rayleigh) for the known Galactic\nultraviolet background (~20-40 mR / [d/55 kpc]^2). In an earlier model, we\nproposed that a slow shock cascade was operating along the Stream due to its\ninteraction with the extended Galactic hot corona. We find that, for a smooth\ncoronal density profile, this model can explain the bright H-alpha emission if\nthe coronal density satisfies 2 < (n / 10^{-4} cm^{-3}) < 4 at d = 55 kpc. But\nin view of updated parameters for the Galactic halo and mounting evidence that\nmost of the Stream must lie far beyond the Magellanic Clouds (d>55 kpc), we\nrevisit the shock cascade model in detail. At lower densities, the HI gas is\nbroken down by the shock cascade but mostly mixes with the hot corona without\nsignificant recombination. At higher densities, the hot coronal mass (including\nthe other baryonic components) exceeds the baryon budget of the Galaxy. If the\nH-alpha emission arises from the shock cascade, the upper limit on the smooth\ncoronal density constrains the Stream's mean distance to < 75 kpc. If, as some\nmodels indicate, the Stream is even further out, either the shock cascade is\noperating in a regime where the corona is substantially mass-loaded with recent\ngas debris, or an entirely different ionization mechanism is responsible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 04:44:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 08:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

The template fit method also provides spectral\nclassification to half a subtype, classifies the stars along the dwarf-subdwarf\nmetallicity sequence, and provides improved metallicity/gravity information on\na finer scale. The automated search and classification is performed using a set\nof cool star templates assembled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nspectroscopic database.

In this paper, we point out\nthat, when applied to the multidimensional data, the adaptively generated\nfilters exhibit symmetry properties resulting from the bisymmetric nature of\nthe lag-covariance matrices. The eigenvectors of the lag-covariance matrix are\neither symmetric or antisymmetric, and for the 2D image data, these lead to the\ndifferential-type filters with even- or odd-order derivatives.

Spin qubits based on bismuth\ndonors in silicon have tunable interactions with nuclear spin baths and are\nfirst-order insensitive to magnetic noise at so-called clock-transitions (CTs).\nThis system is therefore ideal for studying the quantum/classical nature of\nnuclear spin baths since the qubit-bath interaction strength determines the\nback-action on the baths and hence the adequacy of a classical noise model. We\ndevelop a Gaussian noise model with noise correlations determined by quantum\ncalculations and compare the classical noise approximation to the full quantum\nbath theory. We experimentally test our model through dynamical decoupling\nsequence of up to 128 pulses, finding good agreement with simulations and\nmeasuring electron spin coherence times approaching one second - notably using\nnatural silicon. Our theoretical and experimental study demonstrates that the\nnoise from a nuclear spin bath is analogous to classical Gaussian noise if the\nback-action of the qubit on the bath is small compared to the internal bath\ndynamics, as is the case close to CTs. However, far from the CTs, the\nback-action of the central spin on the bath is such that the quantum model is\nrequired to accurately model spin decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 07:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The switching transition is driven by a\nconformational change of a small fraction of minority chains, which are\nattracted by the substrate. Depending on the strength of the attractive\ninteraction, the minority chains assume one of two states: An exposed state\ncharacterized by a stem-crown-like conformation, and an adsorbed state\ncharacterized by a flat two-dimensional structure. Comparing the Monte Carlo\nsimulations, which use an Edwards-type Hamiltonian with density dependent\ninteractions, with the predictions from self-consistent-field theory based on\nthe same Hamiltonian, we find that thermal density fluctuations affect the\nsystem in two different ways. First, they renormalize the excluded volume\ninteraction parameter $v_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$ inside the brush. The properties\nof the brushes can be reproduced by self-consistent field theory if one\nreplaces $v_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$ by an effective parameter $v_{\\mathrm{\\tiny\neff}}$, where the ratio of second virial coefficients $B_{\\mathrm{\\tiny\neff}}/B_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$ depends on the range of monomer interactions, but\nnot on the grafting density, the chain length, and $v_\\mathrm{\\tiny bare}$.\nSecond, density fluctuations affect the conformations of chains at the brush\nsurface and have a favorable effect on the characteristics of the switching\ntransition: In the interesting regime where the transition is sharp, they\nreduce the free energy barrier between the two states significantly. The\nscaling behavior of various quantities is also analyzed and compared with\nanalytical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 08:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

To reflect the physical\nconstraints of the imaging device, we introduce the notion of blocks of\nmeasurements: the sensing scheme is not a set of isolated measurements anymore,\nbut a set of groups of measurements which may represent any arbitrary shape\n(parallel or radial lines for instance). Structured acquisition with blocks of\nmeasurements are easy to implement, and provide good reconstruction results in\npractice.

Prominent examples include online encyclopedias such as (Semantic)\nMediaWikis, Question and Answering portals such as StackOverflow, and many\nothers. Only a small fraction of these systems manage to reach self-sustaining\nactivity, a level of activity that prevents the system from reverting to a\nnon-active state. In this paper, we model and analyze activity dynamics in\nsynthetic and empirical collaboration networks. Our approach is based on two\nopposing and well-studied principles: (i) without incentives, users tend to\nlose interest to contribute and thus, systems become inactive, and (ii) people\nare susceptible to actions taken by their peers (social or peer influence).\nWith the activity dynamics model that we introduce in this paper we can\nrepresent typical situations of such collaboration networks. For example,\nactivity in a collaborative network, without external impulses or investments,\nwill vanish over time, eventually rendering the system inactive. However, by\nappropriately manipulating the activity dynamics and/or the underlying\ncollaboration networks, we can jump-start a previously inactive system and\nadvance it towards an active state. To be able to do so, we first describe our\nmodel and its underlying mechanisms. We then provide illustrative examples of\nempirical datasets and characterize the barrier that has to be breached by a\nsystem before it can become self-sustaining in terms of critical mass and\nactivity dynamics. Additionally, we expand on this empirical illustration and\nintroduce a new metric p---the Activity Momentum---to assess the activity\nrobustness of collaboration networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 09:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 13:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

In addition, we studied some features of the B-streaks\nin impulsive and long-duration flares and demonstrated that B-streaks in\nseveral consecutive EUVI images can be used to reconstruct a probable time\nhistory of strong far-side flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 10:11:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 10:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Here, we show that in order for Lieb's theorem to\nbe satisfied, a more complex mean-field approach should be followed in the case\nof bipartite lattices or other lattices whose unit cells contain more than two\ntypes of atoms. In the case of the Lieb lattice, we show that, by allowing the\nsystem to modulate the magnetization and charge density between sublattices,\nthe difference in the absolute values of the magnetization of the sublattices,\n$m_{\\text{Lieb}}$, at half-filling, saturates at the exact value $1/2$ for any\nvalue of $U$, as predicted by Lieb. Additionally, Lieb's relation,\n$m_{\\text{Lieb}}=1/2$, is verified approximately for large $U$, in the $n \\in\n[2/3,4/3]$ range. This range includes not only the ferromagnetic region of the\nphase diagram of the Lieb lattice (see Ref.~\\onlinecite{Gouveia2015}), but also\nthe adjacent spiral regions. In fact, in this lattice, below or at\nhalf-filling, $m_{\\text{Lieb}}$ is simply the filling of the quasi-flat bands\nin the mean-field energy dispersion both for large and small $U$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 10:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

However, for some\nspecial families of curves the bound could be improved substantially. In this\npaper, we focus on the Hasse-Weil bound for the curve defined by $y^p-y=f(x)$\nover the finite field $\\F_q$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\\F_q$.\nRecently, Kaufman and Lovett \\cite[FOCS2011]{KL11} showed that the Hasse-Weil\nbound can be improved for this family of curves with $f(x)=g(x)+h(x)$, where\n$g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $\\ll \\sqrt{q}$ and $h(x)$ is a sparse\npolynomial of arbitrary degree but bounded weight degree. The other recent\nimprovement by Rojas-Leon and Wan \\cite[Math. Ann. 2011]{RW11} shows that an\nextra $\\sqrt{p}$ can be removed for this family of curves if $p$ is very large\ncompared with polynomial degree of $f(x)$ and $\\log_pq$.\n  In this paper, we show that the Hasse-Weil bound for this special family of\ncurves can be improved if $q=p^n$ with odd $n$ which is the same case where\nSerre \\cite{Se85} improved the Hasse-Weil bound. However, our improvement is\ngreater than Serre's one for this special family of curves. Furthermore, our\nimprovement works for small $p$ as well compared with the requirement of large\n$p$ by Rojas-Leon and Wan. In addition, our improvement finds interesting\napplications to character sums, cryptography and coding theory. The key idea\nbehind is that this curve has the Hasse-Witt invariant $0$ and we show that the\nHasse-Weil bound can be improved for any curves with the Hasse-Witt invariant\n$0$. The main tool used in our proof involves Newton polygon and some results\nin algebraic geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 13:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}

The momentum\nthickness profiles show lower momentum thickness values for the stratified late\nwake compared to the non-stratified wake, implying that the drag on an\naccelerating hydrofoil in a stratified medium is reduced at the acceleration\nstage.

Specifically, the limited number of contention preambles\nand the limited amount of uplink grants per random access response are crucial\nto consider when dimensioning LTE networks for MTC. We propose a low-complexity\nmodel of LTE's access reservation protocol that encompasses these two\nlimitations and allows us to evaluate the outage probability at click-speed.\nThe model is based chiefly on closed-form expressions, except for the part with\nthe feedback impact of retransmissions, which is determined by solving a fixed\npoint equation. Our model overcomes the incompleteness of the existing models\nthat are focusing solely on the preamble collisions.

Disk accretion onto weakly magnetized stars leads to the formation\nof a boundary layer (BL) where the gas loses its excess kinetic energy and\nsettles onto the star. There are still many open questions concerning the BL,\nfor instance the transport of angular momentum (AM) or the vertical structure.\nAims. It is the aim of this work to investigate the AM transport in the BL\nwhere the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is not operating owing to the\nincreasing angular velocity $\\Omega(r)$ with radius. We will therefore search\nfor an appropriate mechanism and examine its efficiency and implications.\nMethods. We perform 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations in a cylindrical\ncoordinate system $(r, \\varphi)$ for a thin, vertically inte- grated accretion\ndisk around a young star. We employ a realistic equation of state and include\nboth cooling from the disk surfaces and radiation transport in radial and\nazimuthal direction. The viscosity in the disk is treated by the\n{\\alpha}-model; in the BL there is no viscosity term included. Results. We find\nthat our setup is unstable to the sonic instability which sets in shortly after\nthe simulations have been started. Acoustic waves are generated and traverse\nthe domain, developing weak shocks in the vicinity of the BL. Furthermore, the\nsystem undergoes recurrent outbursts where the activity in the disk increases\nstrongly. The instability and the waves do not die out for over 2000 orbits.\nConclusions. There is indeed a purely hydrodynamical mechanism that enables AM\ntransport in the BL. It is efficient and wave mediated; however, this renders\nit a non-local transport method, which means that models of a effective local\nviscosity like the {\\alpha}-viscosity are probably not applicable in the BL. A\nvariety of further implications of the non-local AM transport are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 14:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

It has\nbeen shown to outperform many of the existing feature selection methods for a\nvariety of applications. Though, better than many existing approaches, the\nrunning time complexity of QPFS is cubic in the number of features, which can\nbe quite computationally expensive even for moderately sized datasets. In this\npaper we propose a novel method for feature selection by integrating k-means\nclustering with QPFS. The basic variant of our approach runs k-means to bring\ndown the number of features which need to be passed on to QPFS. We then enhance\nthis idea, wherein we gradually refine the feature space from a very coarse\nclustering to a fine-grained one, by interleaving steps of QPFS with k-means\nclustering. Every step of QPFS helps in identifying the clusters of irrelevant\nfeatures (which can then be thrown away), whereas every step of k-means further\nrefines the clusters which are potentially relevant. We show that our iterative\nrefinement of clusters is guaranteed to converge. We provide bounds on the\nnumber of distance computations involved in the k-means algorithm. Further,\neach QPFS run is now cubic in number of clusters, which can be much smaller\nthan actual number of features. Experiments on eight publicly available\ndatasets show that our approach gives significant computational gains (both in\ntime and memory), over standard QPFS as well as other state of the art feature\nselection methods, even while improving the overall accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 14:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 18:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

We show\nthat the radiative power losses from a point charge turn out to be proportional\nto the scalar product of the instantaneous velocity and the first\ntime-derivative of the acceleration of the charge. This may seem to be in\ndiscordance with the familiar Larmor's formula where the instantaneous power\nradiated from a charge is proportional to the square of acceleration. However,\nit seems that the root cause of the discrepancy actually lies in the Larmor's\nformula which is derived using the acceleration fields but without a due\nconsideration for the Poynting flux associated with the velocity-dependent\nself-fields \"co-moving\" with the charge. Further, while deriving Larmor's\nformula one equates the Poynting flux through a surface at some later time to\nthe radiation loss by the enclosed charge at the retarded time. Poynting's\ntheorem, on the other hand, relates the outgoing radiation flux from a closed\nsurface to the rate of energy decrease within the enclosed volume, all\ncalculated {\\em for the same given instant} only. Here we explicitly show the\nabsence of any Poynting flux in the neighbourhood of an instantly stationary\npoint charge, implying no radiative losses from such a charge, which is in\ncomplete conformity with energy conservation. We further show how Larmor's\nformula is still able to serve our purpose in vast majority of cases. It is\nfurther shown that Larmor's formula in general violates momentum conservation\nand in the case of synchrotron radiation leads to a potentially wrong\nconclusion about the pitch angle changes of the radiating charges, and that\nonly the radiation reaction formula yields a correct result, consistent with\nthe special relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 15:16:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 16:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2015 07:19:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 14:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

This projection is achieved by\niteratively projecting onto each of the convex sets individually, following\nDyktra's scheme. The sequence thus obtained is guaranteed to converge to the\nsought projection. Thanks to the preliminary matrix decomposition and variable\nsubstitution, the projection is implemented intrinsically in a subspace, whose\ndimension is very often much lower than the number of bands. A benefit of this\nstrategy is that the order of the computational complexity for each projection\nis decreased from quadratic to linear time.

In our agent-based model, firms are\nlocated in a metric knowledge space. The interaction rules incorporate an\nexploration phase and a knowledge transfer phase, during which firms search for\na new partner and then evaluate whether they can establish an alliance to\nexchange their knowledge stocks. The model parameters determining the overall\nsystem properties are the rate at which alliances form and dissolve and the\nagents' interaction radius. Next, we define a novel indicator of performance,\nbased on the distance traveled by the firms in the knowledge space. Remarkably,\nwe find that - depending on the alliance formation rate and the interaction\nradius - firms tend to cluster around one or more attractors in the knowledge\nspace, whose position is an emergent property of the system. And, more\nimportantly, we find that there exists an inverted U-shaped dependence of the\nnetwork performance on both model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 15:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 08:30:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 12:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}
