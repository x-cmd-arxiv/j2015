In\nthis work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to investigate a\nspecific real-world phishing campaign and quantify attributes that indicate a\ntargeted spear phishing attack.

The campaign was found to\nexclusively target specific demographics within our institution. Performing a\nsemantic similarity analysis between the senders' CV attachments and the\nrecipients' LinkedIn profiles, we conclude with high statistical certainty (p\n$< 10^{-4}$) that the attachments contain targeted rather than randomly\nselected material. Latent Semantic Analysis further demonstrates that\nindividuals who were a primary focus of the campaign received CVs that are\nhighly topically clustered.

Recent observations of long-lasting X-ray\nafterglows of SGRBs challenge standard paradigms and indicate that in a large\nfraction of events a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a\nblack hole. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these afterglows is\nnecessary in order to address the open questions concerning the nature of SGRB\ncentral engines. However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the\nfact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are\ninaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed\nmodel to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and\nthe relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in\na long-lived NS.

In this paper, we obtain several new and tight results in this\narea. Let $G$ be a graph with minimum degree at least $k+1$. We prove that if\n$G$ is bipartite, then there are $k$ cycles in $G$ whose lengths form an\narithmetic progression with common difference two. For general graph $G$, we\nshow that $G$ contains $\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor$ cycles with consecutive even\nlengths and $k-3$ cycles whose lengths form an arithmetic progression with\ncommon difference one or two. In addition, if $G$ is 2-connected and\nnon-bipartite, then $G$ contains $\\lfloor k/2\\rfloor$ cycles with consecutive\nodd lengths.\n  Thomassen (1983) made two conjectures on cycle lengths modulo a fixed integer\n$k$: (1) every graph with minimum degree at least $k+1$ contains cycles of all\neven lengths modulo $k$; (2) every 2-connected non-bipartite graph with minimum\ndegree at least $k+1$ contains cycles of all lengths modulo $k$. These two\nconjectures, if true, are best possible. Our results confirm both conjectures\nwhen $k$ is even. And when $k$ is odd, we show that minimum degree at least\n$k+4$ suffices. This improves all previous results in this direction. Moreover,\nour results derive new upper bounds of the chromatic number in terms of the\nlongest sequence of cycles with consecutive (even or odd) lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 16:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

Such types of conditions are for example\nconsidered in the Spanish and Portuguese day-ahead markets. This helps\ndescribing the recovery of start-up costs of a power plant, or analogously for\na large consumer, utility reduced by a constant term. A new market model is\nproposed with a corresponding MILP formulation for uniform locational price\nday-ahead auctions, handling bids with a minimum profit or maximum payment\ncondition in a uniform and computationally-efficient way. An exact\ndecomposition procedure with sparse strengthened Benders cuts derived from the\nMILP formulation is also proposed. The MILP formulation and the decomposition\nprocedure are similar to computationally-efficient approaches previously\nproposed to handle so-called block bids according to European market rules,\nthough the clearing conditions could appear different at first sight. Both\nsolving approaches are also valid to deal with both kinds of bids\nsimultaneously, as block bids with a minimum acceptance ratio, generalizing\nfully indivisible block bids, are but a special case of the MP bids introduced\nhere. We argue in favour of the MP bids by comparing them to previous models\nfor minimum profit conditions proposed in the academic literature, and to the\nmodel for minimum income conditions used by the Spanish power exchange OMIE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 19:25:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 15:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 15:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 18:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Analog processing techniques can be\nused on receive to reduce the number of measurements to N, the number of\npotential delay bins. If the scene interrogated by the radar is assumed to be\nsparse consisting of K point targets, results from compressive sensing suggest\nthat number of measurements can be further reduced to scale with K logN for\nstable recovery of a sparse scene from measurements with additive noise. While\nunstructured random projectors guarantee successful recovery under sparsity\nconstraints, they cannot be implemented in the radar hardware in practice.\nRecently, structured random Toeplitz and Circulant matrices that result from\nusing stochastic waveforms in time delay estimation setting have been shown to\nyield recovery guarantees similar to unstructured sensing matrices.

In this paper, we propose an alternative low\ncomplexity compressive wideband radar sensor which combines multitone signal\nchirp waveform on transmit with a receiver that utilizes an analog mixer\nfollowed with a uniform sub-Nyquist sampling stage.

Clear evidence for the chemical\nenrichment of r-process elements is seen in the stellar abundances of extremely\nmetal poor stars in the Galactic halo. However, small-mass galaxies are the\nideal testbed for studying the evolutionary features of r-process enrichment\ngiven the potential rarity of production events yielding heavy r-process\nelements. Their occurrences become countable and thus an enrichment path due to\neach event can be found in the stellar abundances.

One major problem is that most galaxy shape measurement methods\nare subject to bias due to pixel noise in the images (\"noise bias\"). Noise bias\nis usually characterized using uncorrelated noise fields; however, real images\ntypically have low-level noise correlations due to galaxies below the detection\nthreshold, and some types of image processing can induce further noise\ncorrelations. We investigate the effective detection significance and its\nimpact on noise bias in the presence of correlated noise for one method of\ngalaxy shape estimation. For a fixed noise variance, the biases in galaxy shape\nestimates can differ substantially for uncorrelated versus correlated noise.\nHowever, use of an estimate of detection significance that accounts for the\nnoise correlations can almost entirely remove these differences, leading to\nconsistent values of noise bias as a function of detection significance for\ncorrelated and uncorrelated noise. We confirm the robustness of this finding to\nproperties of the galaxy, the PSF, and the noise field, and quantify the impact\nof anisotropy in the noise correlations. Our results highlight the importance\nof understanding the pixel noise model and its impact on detection\nsignificances when correcting for noise bias on weak lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 20:14:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 03:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

At any luminosity probed, the disc in the\nhard state is intrinsically more variable than in the soft state. However, the\nfast decrease of disc variability as a function of luminosity, combined with\nthe increase of disc intensity, causes a net drop of fractional variability at\nhigh luminosities and low energies, which reminds the well-known behaviour of\ndisc-dominated energy bands in the soft state. The peak-frequency of the\nhigh-frequency Lorentzian (likely corresponding to the high-frequency break\nseen in active galactic nuclei, AGN) scales with luminosity, but we do not find\nevidence for a linear scaling. In addition, we observe that this characteristic\nfrequency is energy-dependent. We find that the normalization of the PSD at the\npeak of the high-frequency Lorentzian decreases with luminosity at all\nenergies, though in the soft band this trend is steeper. Together with the\nfrequency shift, this yields quasi-constant high frequency (5-20 Hz) fractional\nrms at high energies, with less than 10 percent scatter. This reinforces\nprevious claims suggesting that the high frequency PSD solely scales with BH\nmass. On the other hand, this constancy breaks down in the soft band (where the\nscatter increases to ~30 percent). This is a consequence of the additional\ncontribution from the disc component, and resembles the behaviour of optical\nvariability in AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 20:24:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Incoming AMS-02\nmeasurements of cosmic rays antiprotons will help to clarify the conundrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 20:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

A challenge in answering this question is that the bifurcation\nbehavior of certain Arctic energy balance models have been shown to be\nsensitive to how ice-albedo feedback is parameterized. We analyze an Arctic\nenergy balance model in the limit as a smoothing parameter associated with\nice-albedo feedback tends to zero, which introduces a discontinuity boundary to\nthe dynamical systems model. Our analysis provides a case study where we use\nthe system in this limit to guide the investigation of bifurcation behavior of\nthe original albedo-smoothed system. In this case study, we demonstrate that\ncertain qualitative bifurcation behaviors of the albedo-smoothed system can\nhave counterparts in the limit with no albedo smoothing. We use this\nperspective to systematically explore the parameter space of the model. For\nexample, we uncover parameter sets for which the largest transition, with\nincreasing greenhouse gases, is from a perennially ice-covered Arctic to a\nseasonally ice-free state, an unusual bifurcation scenario that persists even\nwhen albedo-smoothing is reintroduced. This analysis provides an alternative\nperspective on how parameters of the model affect bifurcation behavior. We\nexpect our approach, which exploits the width of repelling sliding intervals\nfor understanding the hysteresis loops, would carry over to other positive\nfeedback systems with a similar natural piecewise-smooth limit, and when the\nfeedback strength is likewise modulated with seasons or other periodic forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 20:44:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 00:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

This shift in network\narchitecture requires network devices to become more autonomous and,\npotentially, cooperate with one another. Such cooperation can, for example,\ntake place between interfering small access points that seek to coordinate\ntheir radio resource allocation, nearby single-antenna users that can\ncooperatively perform virtual MIMO communications, or even unlicensed users\nthat wish to cooperatively sense the spectrum of the licensed users. Such\ncooperative mechanisms involve the simultaneous sharing and distribution of\nresources among a number of overlapping cooperative groups or coalitions. In\nthis paper, a novel mathematical framework from cooperative games, dubbed\n\\emph{overlapping coalition formation games} (OCF games), is introduced to\nmodel and solve such cooperative scenarios. First, the concepts of OCF games\nare presented, and then, several algorithmic aspects are studied for two main\nclasses of OCF games. Subsequently, two example applications, namely,\ninterference management and cooperative spectrum sensing, are discussed in\ndetail to show how the proposed models and algorithms can be used in the future\nscenarios of wireless systems. Finally, we conclude by providing an overview on\nfuture directions and applications of OCF games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 21:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

Second, a\nconditional optimisation scheme computes nonlocal pairwise as well as\npattern-based clique potentials from the manifold subspace to recognise regions\nwith similar labelings and to incorporate global consistency in the\nsegmentation process.

As such, RDF (Resource\nDescription Framework) triples described the same real-world entity can be\nobtained from multiple sources; it inevitably results in conflicting objects\nfor a certain predicate of a real-world entity. The objective of this study is\nto identify one truth from multiple conflicting objects for a certain predicate\nof a real-world entity. An intuitive principle based on common sense is that an\nobject from a reliable source is trustworthy; thus, a source that provide\ntrustworthy object is reliable. Many truth discovery methods based on this\nprinciple have been proposed to estimate source reliability and identify the\ntruth. However, the effectiveness of existing truth discovery methods is\nsignificantly affected by the number of objects provided by each source.\nTherefore, these methods cannot be trivially extended to resolve conflicts in\nLinked Data with a scale-free property, i.e., most of the sources provide few\nconflicting objects, whereas only a few sources have many conflicting objects.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called TruthDiscover to\nidentify the truth in Linked Data with a scale-free property. Two strategies\nare adopted in TruthDiscover to reduce the effect of the scale-free property on\ntruth discovery. First, this approach leverages the topological properties of\nthe Source Belief Graph to estimate the priori beliefs of sources, which are\nutilized to smooth the trustworthiness of sources. Second, this approach\nutilizes the Hidden Markov Random Field to model the interdependencies between\nobjects to estimate the trust values of objects accurately.

This yields a significant improvement over the earlier\nalgorithm of Demaine et al. [DIMV14] that uses exponentially larger number of\npasses. We complement this result by showing that the tradeoff between the\nnumber of passes and space exhibited by our algorithm is tight, at least when\nthe approximation factor is equal to $1$. Specifically, we show that any\nalgorithm that computes set cover exactly using $({1 \\over 2\\delta}-1)$ passes\nmust use $\\tilde{\\Omega}(mn^{\\delta})$ space in the regime of $m=O(n)$.\nFurthermore, we consider the problem in the geometric setting where the\nelements are points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and sets are either discs, axis-parallel\nrectangles, or fat triangles in the plane, and show that our algorithm (with a\nslight modification) uses the optimal $\\tilde{O}(n)$ space to find a\nlogarithmic approximation in $O(1/\\delta)$ passes.\n  Finally, we show that any randomized one-pass algorithm that distinguishes\nbetween covers of size 2 and 3 must use a linear (i.e., $\\Omega(mn)$) amount of\nspace.

Sosiefication generates sosie\nprograms, i.e., variants of a program in which some statements are deleted,\nadded or replaced but still pass the test suite of the original program. Our\ninvestigation of the influence of test suites on sosiefication exploits the\nfollowing observation: test suites cover the different regions of programs in\nvery unequal ways. Hence, we hypothesize that sosie synthesis has different\nperformances on a statement that is covered by one hundred test case and on a\nstatement that is covered by a single test case. We synthesize 24583 sosies on\n6 popular open-source Java programs. Our results show that there are two\ndimensions for diversification. The first one lies in the specification: the\nmore test cases cover a statement, the more difficult it is to synthesize\nsosies. Yet, to our surprise, we are also able to synthesize sosies on highly\ntested statements (up to 600 test cases), which indicates an intrinsic property\nof the programs we study. The second dimension is in the code: we manually\nexplore dozens of sosies and characterize new types of forgiving code regions\nthat are prone to diversification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 05:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 08:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Dec 2018 17:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-27"}

It is also known that the light bridges appear\nin the assembling process of nascent sunspots. The ultimate goal of this series\nof papers is to reveal the nature of light bridges in developing ARs and the\noccurrence of activity events associated with the light bridge structures from\nboth observational and numerical approaches. In this first paper, exploiting\nthe observational data obtained by Hinode, IRIS, and Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO), we investigate the detailed structure of the light bridge in NOAA AR\n11974 and its dynamic activity phenomena. As a result, we find that the light\nbridge has a weak, horizontal magnetic field, which is transported from the\ninterior by large-scale convective upflow and is surrounded by strong, vertical\nfields of adjacent pores. In the chromosphere above the bridge, a transient\nbrightening occurs repeatedly and intermittently, followed by a recurrent dark\nsurge ejection into higher altitudes. Our analysis indicates that the\nbrightening is the plasma heating due to magnetic reconnection at lower\naltitudes, while the dark surge is the cool, dense plasma ejected from the\nreconnection region. From the observational results, we conclude that the\ndynamic activity observed in a light bridge structure such as chromospheric\nbrightenings and dark surge ejections are driven by magnetoconvective evolution\nwithin the light bridge and its interaction with surrounding magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 09:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

We wish to investigate if, and how much, the interstellar magnetic\nfield can contribute to the shape of an expanding circumstellar bubble around a\nmassive star. We use the MPI-AMRVAC code to make magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulations of bubbles, using a single star model, combined with several\ndifferent field strengths: B = 5, 10, and 20 muG for the interstellar magnetic\nfield. This covers the typical field strengths of the interstellar magnetic\nfields found in the galactic disk and bulge. Furthermore, we present two\nsimulations that include both a 5 muG interstellar magnetic field and a 10,000\nK interstellar medium and two different ISM densities to demonstrate how the\nmagnetic field can combine with other external factors to influence the\nmorphology of the circumstellar bubbles. Our results show that low magnetic\nfields, as found in the galactic disk, inhibit the growth of the circumstellar\nbubbles in the direction perpendicular to the field. As a result, the bubbles\nbecome ovoid, rather than spherical. Strong interstellar fields, such as\nobserved for the galactic bulge, can completely stop the expansion of the\nbubble in the direction perpendicular to the field, leading to the formation of\na tube-like bubble. When combined with a warm, high-density ISM the bubble is\ngreatly reduced in size, causing a dramatic change in the evolution of\ntemporary features inside the bubble. The magnetic field of the interstellar\nmedium can affect the shape of circumstellar bubbles. This effect may have\nconsequences for the shape and evolution of circumstellar nebulae and supernova\nremnants, which are formed within the main wind-blown bubble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 09:34:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 09:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

For this purpose, we apply\ntwo different nonperturbative approaches, consisting in the sum of ladder\ndiagrams and taking the limit of a large number N of fermion flavors. We\nbenefit from the renormalizability that the theory shows in both cases to\ncompute the anomalous scaling dimensions of different operators exclusively in\nterms of the renormalized coupling constant, allowing us to determine the\nprecise location of the singularities signaling the onset of the\nstrong-coupling phases. We show then that the QED of 3D Dirac semimetals has\ntwo competing effects at strong coupling. One of them is the tendency to chiral\nsymmetry breaking and dynamical mass generation, which are analogous to the\nsame phenomena arising in the conventional QED at strong coupling. This trend\nis however outweighed by the strong suppression of electron quasiparticles that\ntakes place at large N, leading to a different type of critical point at\nsufficiently large interaction strength, shared also by the 3D Weyl semimetals.\nOverall, the phase diagram of the 3D Dirac semimetals turns out to be richer\nthan that of their 2D counterparts, displaying a transition to a phase with\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior which may be observed in materials hosting a\nsufficiently large number of Dirac or Weyl points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 10:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

This offline attacker is\nlimited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password.\nKey-stretching tools can help mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making\neach password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However,\nkey-stretching increases authentication costs for a legitimate authentication\nserver. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the\nessential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline\nattacker. We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized\nkey-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be\ncracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized\nauthentication costs for the legitimate authentication server.

We make this\nnotion precise by introducing regularly varying time series. We provide general\nlarge deviation results for functionals acting on a sample path and vanishing\nin some neighborhood of the origin. We study a variety of such functionals,\nincluding large deviations of random walks, their suprema, the ruin functional,\nand further derive weak limit theory for maxima, point processes, cluster\nfunctionals and the tail empirical process. One of the main results of this\npaper concerns bounds for the ruin probability in various heavy-tailed models\nincluding GARCH, stochastic volatility models and solutions to stochastic\nrecurrence equations. 1. Preliminaries and basic motivation In the last\ndecades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory\nfor dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]),\nweakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent\nsequences (Doukhan et al. [23], Samorodnitsky [54]), empirical processes\n(Dehling et al. [22]) and more general structures (Eberlein and Taqqu [25]), to\nname a few references. A smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory\nunder extremal dependence for point processes, maxima, partial sums, tail\nempirical processes. Resnick [49, 50] started a systematic study of the\nrelations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also\nResnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular\nvariation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with\nadvanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are\nunderstood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point\nprocess converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are\ndescribed in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing\n[13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes,\nmaxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes,\ni.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly\nvarying with the same index. Before [13], limit theory for particular regularly\nvarying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean, maxima, sample\nautocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes\nwith iid regularly varying noise and extreme value theory was considered for\nregularly varying ARCH processes and solutions to stochastic recurrence\nequation, see Rootz\\'en [53], Davis and 1991 Mathematics Subject\nClassification.

Both means of WDS and\nEDS mass fractions are close to the reference values. The dispersion of the\nresults was larger at 5 kV than at 15-20 kV owing to the use of the L lines\nrather than K lines and to the lowest collected intensities. There is an\nexception with the case of boron because at the lowest voltage, the excitation\ncondition is more favourable for the production of the K line.

In addition, the\nparamagnetoelectric effect expected from the point group symmetry is confirmed.\nThe emergence of the electric polarization is explained by the cooperation of\nthe local electric polarization on the chiral solitonic spin arrangement and\nthe paramagnetoelectric effect.

A\nWLAN operating under DCB can enjoy a larger bandwidth, when available, and\ntherefore achieve a higher throughput. However, the use of larger bandwidths\nalso increases the contention with adjacent WLANs, which can result in longer\ndelays in accessing the channel and consequently, a lower throughput. In this\npaper, a scenario consisting of multiple WLANs using DCB and operating within\ncarrier-sensing range of one another is considered. An analytical framework for\nevaluating the performance of such networks is presented. The analysis is\ncarried out using a Markov chain model that characterizes the interactions\nbetween adjacent WLANs with overlapping channels. An algorithm is proposed for\nsystematically constructing the Markov chain corresponding to any given\nscenario. The analytical model is then used to highlight and explain the key\nproperties that differentiate DCB networks of WLANs from those operating on a\nsingle shared channel. Furthermore, the analysis is applied to networks of IEEE\n802.11ac WLANs operating under DCB--which do not fully comply with some of the\nsimplifying assumptions in our analysis--to show that the analytical model can\ngive accurate results in more realistic scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 13:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

We propose a fast and accurate approximation method for SVT,\nthat we call fast randomized SVT (FRSVT), with which we avoid direct\ncomputation of SVD. The key idea is to extract an approximate basis for the\nrange of the matrix from its compressed matrix. Given the basis, we compute\npartial singular values of the original matrix from the small factored matrix.\nIn addition, by developping a range propagation method, our method further\nspeeds up the extraction of approximate basis at each iteration. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows the relationship between the approximation bound of\nSVD and its effect to NNM via SVT. Along with the analysis, our empirical\nresults quantitatively and qualitatively show that our approximation rarely\nharms the convergence of the host algorithms.

In contrast to most earlier works\nin the field, our framework has been designed to exploit the appearance\nfeatures, even when they are only sporadically available, or affected by a\nnon-stationary noise, along the sequence of detections. This is done by\nimplementing an iterative hypothesis testing strategy to progressively\naggregate the detections into short trajectories, named tracklets.\nSpecifically, each iteration considers a node, named key-node, and investigates\nhow to link this key-node with other nodes in its neighborhood, under the\nassumption that the target appearance is defined by the key-node appearance\nestimate. This is done through shortest path computation in a temporal\nneighborhood of the key-node. The approach is conservative in that it only\naggregates the shortest paths that are sufficiently better compared to\nalternative paths. It is also multi-scale in that the size of the investigated\nneighborhood is increased proportionally to the number of detections already\naggregated into the key-node. The multi-scale nature of the process and the\nprogressive relaxation of its conservativeness makes it both computationally\nefficient and effective.\n  Experimental validations are performed extensively on a toy example, a 15\nminutes long multi-view basketball dataset, and other monocular pedestrian\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 14:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

We measure\nradial velocities of the object and its approximate spectral type by\ncross-correlating our spectra with those of known red supergiants. Our\nVLT/X-shooter spectrum is best matched by that of early M-type supergiants,\nconfirming the red supergiant nature of the candidate counterpart. The radial\nvelocity of the spectrum, taken on 2014, August 23, is $417 \\pm 4$ km/s. This\nis consistent with the radial velocity measured in our spectrum taken with\nMagellan/MMIRS on 2013, June 28, of $410 \\pm 70$ km/s, although the large error\non the latter implies that a radial velocity shift expected for a black hole of\ntens of $M_\\odot$ can easily be hidden. Using nebular emission lines we find\nthat the radial velocity due to the rotation of NGC 253 is 351 $\\pm$ 4 km/s at\nthe position of the ULX. Thus the radial velocity of the counterpart confirms\nthat the source is located in NGC 253, but also shows an offset with respect to\nthe local bulk motion of the galaxy of 66 $\\pm$ 6 km/s.

It captures natural\napplications in online markets with limited supply and can be used to model\naccess of unreliable channels in wireless networks.\n  If mechanisms satisfy a smoothness guarantee, existing results show that\nlearning outcomes recover a significant fraction of the optimal social welfare.\nThese approaches, however, have serious drawbacks in terms of plausibility and\ncomputational complexity.

A contentious point was the problem of irreversibility:\nthe microscopic equations of motion are reversible, yet friction and viscosity\ncause things always to slow down and warm up, never to speed up and cool down.\nWhat was worse, Boltzmann himself discovered that his transport equation\npredicts special cases in which gases never come to thermal equilibrium, a\nparticular example being that the monopole \"breathe\" mode of gas will never\ndamp if it is confined in 3D to a perfectly isotropic harmonic potential. Such\nabsences of damping were not observed in nature. Nondamping of a monopole mode\nin lower dimensional systems has only very recently been observed, using cold\natoms. Kinoshita et al. and Chevy et al. have experimentally observed\nsuppressed relaxation in highly elongated geometries. The difficulty in\ngenerating sufficiently spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms,\nhowever, has meant that Boltzmann's fully 3D, isotropic case has never been\nobserved. With the development of a new magnetic trap capable of producing\nnear-spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, we have been able to\nmake the first observation of this historically significant oddity. We observe\na monopole mode for which the collisional contribution to damping vanishes, a\nlong-delayed vindication for Boltzmann's microscopic theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 15:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

When $c>1$, the subgroup is found to tend towards\nbehaviors reminiscent of antifragility; when at least one subgroup of the\npopulation has $c\\ge1$, the population as a whole tends towards significantly\nhigher probabilities of \"living forever,\" although it may first suffer a drop\nin population size as less robust, fragile subgroups \"die off.\" In concluding,\nI discuss the limitations and ethics of such a model, notably the implications\nof when an upper limit is placed on the growth constant, requiring a population\nto facilitate an increase in the decay factor to lessen the impact of periods\nof failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 19:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

In this regard, plasmonic\nassisted characterization tools are only relevant in spectroscopic studies of\nnanoscale object in the sub-diffraction limit. We have reported polarized\nresonance Raman spectroscopic (RRS) studies with strong electron-phonon\ncoupling to understand the crystalline orientation of a single AlGaN nanowire\nof diameter about 100 nm. AlGaN nanowire is grown by chemical vapor deposition\ntechnique using the catalyst assisted vapor-liquid-solid process. The results\nare compared with the high resolution transmission electron microscopic\nanalysis. As a matter of fact, optical confinement effect due to the dielectric\ncontrast of nanowire with respect to that of surrounding media assisted with\nelectron-phonon coupling of RRS are useful for the spectroscopic analysis in\nthe sub-diffraction limit of 325 nm (lamda(2N.A.)^(-1)) using an excitation\nwavelength (lamda) of 325 nm and near ultraviolet 40X far field objective with\na numerical aperture (N.A.) value of 0.50.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2015 09:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}
