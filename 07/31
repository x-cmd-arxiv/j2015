We perform an analysis within the mean-field theory for\nDirac electrons, at finite-temperature and finite chemical potential, as well\nas at half filling and zero-temperature, first excluding the possibility of the\ncoexistence of the two orders. In that case, we find the dependence of the\ncritical (more precisely, crossover) temperature and the critical interaction\non the chemical potential. As a result of this analysis, we find that the\nKekule order is preferred over the hidden order at both finite temperature and\nfinite chemical potential. However, when the coexistence of the two\nsuperconducting orders is allowed, using the coupled mean-field gap equations,\nwe find that above a critical value of the attractive interaction a mixed phase\nsets in, in which these orders coexist. We show that the critical value of the\ninteraction for this transition is greater than the critical coupling for the\nhidden superconducting state in the absence of the Kekule order, implying that\nthere is a region in the phase diagram where the Kekule order is favored as a\nresult of the competition with the hidden superconducting order. The latter,\nhowever, eventually sets in and coexists with the Kekule state. According to\nour mean-field calculations, the transition from the Kekule to the mixed phase\nis of the second order, but it may become first order when fluctuations are\nconsidered. Finally, we investigate whether these phases could be possible in\nhoneycomb superlattices of self-assembled semiconducting nanocrystals, which\nhave been recently experimentally realized with CdSe and PbSe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 16:27:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2015 08:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-27"}

As proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n94, 173602 (2005)], by measuring the output-state entanglement for a balanced\nlossless beam splitter, one can quantify the input-state nonclassicality. These\nmeasures of nonclassicality (referred to as entanglement potentials) can be\nbased, in principle, on various entanglement measures, leading to the\nnegativity (NP) and concurrence (CP) potentials, and the potential for the\nrelative entropy of entanglement (REEP). We search for the maximal\nnonclassicality, which can be achieved by comparing two entanglement measures\nfor arbitrary two-qubit states and those which can be generated from a\nphoton-number qubit via a balanced lossless beam-splitter, where the qubit\nbasis states are the vacuum and single-photon states. Surprisingly, we find\nthat the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the REEP for a given value of the\nNP, can be increased (if NP<0.527) by using either a tunable beam splitter or\nby amplitude damping of the output state of the balanced beam splitter. We also\nshow that the maximal nonclassicality, measured by the NP for a given value of\nthe REEP, can be increased by dephasing. The entanglement itself is not\nincreased by these local losses, but the possible ratios of different measures\nare affected. Moreover, we show that partially-mixed states can be more\nnonclassical than both pure states and completely-mixed states, by comparing\nthe NP for a given value of the REEP. This implies that not all entanglement\nmeasures can be used as entanglement potentials. Alternatively, a single\nbalanced lossless beam splitter is not always transferring the whole\nnonclassicality of its input state into the entanglement of its output modes.\nApplying a lossy beam splitter can solve this problem at least for the cases\nanalyzed in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 17:12:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 12:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-11"}

However, as different authors use different\ndefinitions of the Shapley Value, the specific degree of relatedness depends on\nthe specific version of the Shapley Value - it ranges from a high correlation\nindex to equality of the indices. In this note, we first give an overview of\nthe different indices. Then we turn our attention to the mere ranking order\nprovided by either of the indices. We compare the rankings obtained from\ndifferent versions of the Shapley Value for a phylogenetic tree of European\namphibians and illustrate their differences.

We consider the opening of stellar magnetic flux due to differential\nrotation along field lines coupling the star and disk, using a simple model for\nthe disk-opened flux, the torques exerted on the star by the magnetosphere, and\nthe power extracted by the electromagnetic wind. We examine the conditions\nunder which the system enters an equilibrium spin state, in which the accretion\ntorque is instantaneously balanced by the pulsar wind torque alone. For\nmagnetic moments, spin frequencies, and accretion rates relevant to accreting\nmillisecond pulsars, the spin-down torque from this enhanced pulsar wind can be\nsubstantially larger than that predicted by existing models of the\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction, and is in principle capable of maintaining spin\nequilibrium at frequencies less than 1 kHz.

Understanding their secular\ndynamics is of primary importance. Apart from enabling mass accretion via the\ntransport of angular momentum, the turbulence affects the long-term evolution\nof the embedded magnetic flux, which in turn regulates the efficiency of the\ntransport. In this paper, we take a comprehensive next step towards an\neffective mean-field model for turbulent astrophysical disks by systematically\nstudying the key properties of magnetorotational turbulence in\nvertically-stratified, isothermal shearing boxes. This allows us to infer\nemergent properties of the ensuing chaotic flow as a function of the shear\nparameter as well as the amount of net-vertical flux. Using the test-field\nmethod, we furthermore characterize the mean-field dynamo coefficients that\ndescribe the long-term evolution of large-scale fields. We simultaneously infer\nthe vertical shape and the spectral scale dependence of these closure\ncoefficients, with the latter describing non-local contributions to the\nturbulent electromotive force. Based on this, we infer a scale-separation ratio\nof about ten for the large-scale dynamo. We finally determine scaling\nproperties of the mean-field dynamo coefficients.

As\nin most GWASs, most of the heritability analyses are performed using univariate\napproaches i.e. considering each phenotype independently. In this study, we\npropose a Bayesian matrix-variate mixed model that takes into account the\ngenetic correlation between phenotypes in addition to the genetic correlation\nbetween individuals which is usually modelled via a relatedness matrix. We\nshowed that when the relatedness matrix is estimated using all the genome-wide\nSNPs, our model is equivalent to a matrix normal regression with matrix normal\nprior on the effect sizes. Using real data we demonstrate that there is a boost\nin the heritability explained when phenotypes are jointly modelled (25-35%\nincrease). In fact based on their standard error, the joint modelling provides\nmore accurate estimates of the heritability over the univariate modelling.\nMoreover, our Bayesian approach provides slightly higher estimates of\nheritability compared to the maximum likelihood method. On the other hand,\nalthough our method performs less well in phenotype prediction, we note that an\ninitial imputation step relatively increases the prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 19:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

In its simplest incarnation,\nthe relaxion mechanism requires nothing beyond the standard model other than an\naxion (the relaxion field) and an inflaton. In this note, we critically\nre-examine the requirements for successfully realizing the relaxion mechanism\nand point out that parametrically larger field excursions can be obtained for a\ngiven number of e-folds by simply requiring that the background break exact de\nSitter invariance. We discuss several corollaries of this observation,\nincluding the interplay between the upper bound on the scale $M$ and the order\nparameter $\\epsilon$ associated with the breaking of dS symmetry, and entertain\nthe possibility that the relaxion could play the role of a curvaton.

This is due\nto the fact that their action evaluated on a classical solution is not finite\nand its first variation does not vanish for all consistent boundary conditions.\nThese problems can be dealt with by adding a counterterm to the classical\naction, which is a solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation.\n  In this work we study the effects of polymer quantization on a mechanical\nmodel presenting the aforementioned difficulties and contrast it with the above\ncounterterm method. This type of quantization for mechanical models is\nmotivated by the loop quantization of gravity which is known to play a role in\nthe thermodynamics of black hole systems.\n  The model we consider is a nonrelativistic particle in an inverse square\npotential, and analyze two polarizations of the polymer quantization in which\neither the position or the momentum is discrete.

In integrable potentials---where all orbits are regular---tidal\ndebris phase-mixes close to the orbit of the progenitor system. However, the\nMilky Way's dark matter halo is expected not to be fully integrable; an\nappreciable fraction of orbits will be chaotic. This paper examines the\ninfluence of chaos on the phase-space morphology of cold tidal streams. Streams\neven in weakly chaotic regions look very different from those in regular\nregions. We find that streams can be sensitive to chaos on a much shorter\ntime-scale than any standard prediction (from the Lyapunov or\nfrequency-diffusion times). For example, on a weakly chaotic orbit with a\nchaotic timescale predicted to be $>$1000 orbital periods ($>$1000 Gyr), the\nresulting stellar stream is, after just a few 10's of orbits, substantially\nmore diffuse than any formed on a nearby but regular orbit. We find that the\nenhanced diffusion of the stream stars can be understood by looking at the\nvariance in orbital frequencies of orbit ensembles centered around the parent\n(progenitor) orbit. Our results suggest that long, cold streams around our\nGalaxy must exist only on regular (or very nearly regular) orbits; they\npotentially provide a map of the regular regions of the Milky Way potential.\nThis suggests a promising new direction for the use of tidal streams to\nconstrain the distribution of dark matter around our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 20:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 19:24:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

We obtain good photometry to an equivalent\nlimiting magnitude of $r\\sim 20.5$. Studying the optical variability of X-ray\ndetected sources in the XMM-COSMOS field, we find that the survey is\n$\\sim75-80$% complete to magnitudes $r\\sim20$, and $\\sim67$% complete to a\nmagnitude $r\\sim21$. The determination and parameterization of the structure\nfunction (${SF}_{norm}(\\tau) = A \\tau^{\\gamma}$) of the variable sources shows\nthat most BL AGN are characterized by $A > 0.1$ and $\\gamma > 0.025$. It is\nfurther shown that variable NL AGN and GAL sources occupying the same parameter\nspace in $A$ and $\\gamma$ are very likely to correspond to obscured or low\nluminosity AGN. Our samples are, however, small, and we expect to revisit these\nresults using larger samples with longer light curves obtained as part of our\nongoing survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 20:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

Classical work with smaller dimensional problems dating\nback to Huber and Bickel has illustrated the benefits of efficient loss\nfunctions. When the number of parameters $p$ is of the same order as the sample\nsize $n$, $p \\approx n$, an efficiency pattern different from the one of Huber\nwas recently established. In this work, we consider the effects of model\nselection on the estimation efficiency of penalized methods. In particular, we\nexplore whether sparsity, results in new efficiency patterns when $p > n$. In\nthe interest of deriving the asymptotic mean squared error for regularized\nM-estimators, we use the powerful framework of approximate message passing. We\npropose a novel, robust and sparse approximate message passing algorithm\n(RAMP), that is adaptive to the error distribution. Our algorithm includes many\nnon-quadratic and non-differentiable loss functions. We derive its asymptotic\nmean squared error and show its convergence, while allowing $p, n, s \\to\n\\infty$, with $n/p \\in (0,1)$ and $n/s \\in (1,\\infty)$. We identify new\npatterns of relative efficiency regarding a number of penalized $M$ estimators,\nwhen $p$ is much larger than $n$. We show that the classical information bound\nis no longer reachable, even for light--tailed error distributions. We show\nthat the penalized least absolute deviation estimator dominates the penalized\nleast square estimator, in cases of heavy--tailed distributions. We observe\nthis pattern for all choices of the number of non-zero parameters $s$, both $s\n\\leq n$ and $s \\approx n$. In non-penalized problems where $s =p \\approx n$,\nthe opposite regime holds. Therefore, we discover that the presence of model\nselection significantly changes the efficiency patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 01:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

Below T*, a\nso-called 'Knight shift anomaly' is first observed in FeSCs, which exhibits a\nscaling behavior similar to f-electron HF materials. Furthermore, the scaling\nrule also regulates the manifestation of magnetic fluctuation. These results\nundoubtedly support an emergent Kondo scenario for the d-electron HF behavior,\nwhich suggests the AFe2As2 (A = K, Rb, Cs) as the first material realization of\nd-electron HF superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 02:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 01:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

In the neuronal hierarchy, the response\nproperties of single neurons are determined by neurons located one level below,\nand in turn, determine the responses of neurons located one level above.\nTherefore in modeling receptive fields, it is essential to ensure that the\nresponse properties of neurons in a given level can be generated by combining\nthe response models of neurons in its input levels. However, existing response\nmodels of neurons in the motion cortex do not inherently yield the temporal\nfrequency filtering gradient (TFFG) property that is known to emerge along the\nprimary visual cortex (V1) to middle temporal (MT) motion processing stream.\nTFFG is the change from predominantly lowpass to predominantly bandpass\ntemporal frequency filtering character along the V1 to MT pathway (Foster et al\n1985; DeAngelis et al 1993; Hawken et al 1996). We devised a new model, the\nsinc wavelet model (Odaibo, 2014), which logically and efficiently generates\nthe TFFG.

Although the surrender feature is quite common in\nvariable annuity contracts, there appears to be no published analysis and\nresults for this feature in GMWB under optimal policyholder behaviour - results\nfound in the literature so far are consistent with the absence of such a\nfeature. Also, it is of practical interest to see how the much simpler\nbang-bang strategy, although not optimal for GMWB, compares with optimal GMWB\nstrategy with surrender option.\n  In this paper we extend our recently developed algorithm (Luo and Shevchenko\n2015a) to include surrender option in GMWB and compare prices under different\npolicyholder strategies: optimal, static and bang-bang.

It is proved that the ellipticity condition for general\nfully nonlinear boundary value problems depends not only on differential\noperators, but also sensitively on the external force field. The homogenous\nhyper-elasticity for general anti-plane shear deformation must be governed by\nthe generalized neo-Hookean model. Knowles' over-determined system is simply\ndue to a pseudo-Lagrange multiplier and two extra equilibrium conditions in the\nplane. The constitutive condition in his theorems is naturally satisfied with\n$b = \\lambda/2$. His ellipticity condition is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor general homogeneous materials to admit nontrivial states of anti-plane\nshear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 04:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 07:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 00:06:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 07:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 03:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-28"}

In many of these applications, the details of\ntheir electronic structure near the Fermi level are critically important for\ntheir properties. We propose a first-principles based computational methodology\nfor the accurate prediction of oxygen charge transfer in TM oxides and lithium\nTM (Li-TM) oxides. To obtain accurate electronic structures, the\nHeyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional is adopted and the amount of\nexact Hartree-Fock exchange (mixing parameter) is adjusted to reproduce\nreference band gaps. We show that the HSE06 functional with optimal mixing\nparameter yields not only improved electronic densities of states but also\nbetter energetics (Li-intercalation voltages) for LiCoO2 and LiNiO2 as compared\nto GGA, GGA+U and standard HSE06. We find that the optimal mixing parameters\nfor TM oxides are system-specific and correlate with the covalency (ionicity)\nof the TM species. Strong covalent (ionic) nature of TM-O bonding leads to\nlower (higher) optimal mixing parameters. We find that optimized HSE06\nfunctionals predict stronger hybridization of the Co 3d and O 2p orbitals than\nGGA, resulting in a greater contribution from oxygen states to charge\ncompensation upon delithiation in LiCoO2. We also find that the band gaps of\nLi-TM oxides increase linearly with the mixing parameter, enabling the\nstraightforward determination of optimal mixing parameters based on GGA\n({\\alpha} = 0.0) and HSE06 ({\\alpha} = 0.25) calculations. Our results also\nshow that G0W0@GGA+U band gaps of TM oxides (MO, M = Mn, Co, Ni) and LiCoO2\nagree well with experimental references, suggesting that G0W0 calculations can\nbe used as a reference for the calibration of the mixing parameter in case no\nexperimental band gap has been reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 06:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

This is an indication that in the low column density\nregime, the critical condition for the formation of stars may be reached only\nlocally and this condition is not a global property of the filament. Finally,\nin Lupus we find multiple observational evidences of the key role that the\nmagnetic field plays in forming filaments, and determining their confinement\nand dynamical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The existing wealth of observations allows us to\nstudy the reliability of the theoretical white dwarf cooling sequences of low\nmetallicity progenitors,to determine its age and the percentage of unresolved\nbinaries, and to assess other important characteristics of the cluster, like\nthe slope of the initial mass function, or the fraction of white dwarfs with\nhydrogen deficient atmospheres. We present a population synthesis study of the\nwhite dwarf population of NGC 6397. In particular, we study the shape of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram, and the corresponding magnitude and color\ndistributions. We do this using an up-to-date Monte Carlo code that\nincorporates the most recent and reliable cooling sequences and an accurate\nmodeling of the observational biases. We find a good agreement between our\ntheoretical models and the observed data. In particular, we find that this\nagreement is best for those cooling sequences that take into account residual\nhydrogen burning. This result has important consequences for the evolution of\nprogenitor stars during the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase,\nsince it implies that appreciable third dredge-up in low-mass, low-metallicity\nprogenitors is not expected to occur. Using a standard burst duration of 1.0\nGyr, we obtain that the age of the cluster is 12.8+0.50-0.75 Gyr. Larger ages\nare also compatible with the observed data, but then realistic longer durations\nof the initial burst of star formation are needed to fit the luminosity\nfunction. We conclude that a correct modeling of the white dwarf opulation of\nglobular clusters, used in combination with the number counts of main sequence\nstars provides an unique tool to model the properties of globular clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 09:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

However, the eccentricity evolution in the {\\it in situ}\naccretion model has not been studied in detail. Here, we investigate the\neccentricity evolution through {\\it N}-body simulations. We have found that the\nmerged planets tend to have much smaller eccentricities than the escape\neccentricities due to very efficient collision damping. If the protoplanet\norbits are initially well separated and their eccentricities are securely\nincreased, an inner protoplanet collides at its apocenter with an outer\nprotoplanet at its pericenter. The eccentricity of the merged body is the\nsmallest for such configuration.

From the self-consistent spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis of the\nultra-smooth CH3NH3PbI3 layers, we find that the absorption coefficients of\nCH3NH3PbI3 (alpha = 3.8 x 10^4 cm-1 at 2.0 eV) are comparable to those of\nCuInGaSe2 and CdTe, and high alpha values reported in earlier studies are\noverestimated seriously by extensive surface roughness of CH3NH3PbI3 layers.\nThe polarization-dependent DFT calculations show that CH3NH3+ interacts\nstrongly with the PbI3- cage, modifying the CH3NH3PbI3 dielectric function in\nthe visible region rather significantly. When the effect of CH3NH3+ on the\noptical transition is eliminated in the DFT calculation, CH3NH3PbI3 dielectric\nfunction deduced from DFT shows excellent agreement with the experimental\nresult.

There is thus a clear need for further theoretical understanding\nand observational tests.\n  Aims. The aim is to determine how the observed modes are affected by the\nconvection.\n  Methods. I use HMI velocity and intensity images to construct k-$\\omega$\ndiagrams showing how the oscillation amplitude and phase depend on the local\ngranulation intensity.\n  Results. There is a clear and significant dependence of the observed\nproperties of the oscillations on the local convection state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 12:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

The understanding and\nidentification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for\nadvertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection\nmechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development\nof independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems\nare missing today and needed by both industry and regulators.\n  In this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. Using\nour tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major\nonline video portals. Our results reveal that YouTube's detection system\nsignificantly outperforms all the others. Despite this, a systematic evaluation\nindicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. Furthermore, we\nfind that YouTube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters\ndifferently, the former being more aggressive. This means that views identified\nas fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. We\nspeculate that even though YouTube's policy puts in lots of effort to\ncompensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden\nof the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 13:24:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

Here, we develop a method to\nconstruct thermodynamic spectrum (TDS) charts based on the EVE spectral lines.\nThis tool could be potentially useful to the EUV astronomy to learn the\neruptive activities on the distant astronomical objects. Through several cases,\nwe illustrate what we can learn from the TDS charts. Furthermore, we apply the\nTDS method to 74 flares equal to or greater than M5.0-class, and reach the\nfollowing statistical results. First, EUV peaks are always behind the soft\nX-ray (SXR) peaks and stronger flares tend to have a faster cooling rate. There\nis a power law correlation between the peak delay times and the cooling rates,\nsuggesting a coherent cooling process of flares from SXR to EUV emissions.\nSecond, there are two distinct temperature drift patterns, called Type I and\nType II. For Type I flares, the enhanced emission drifts from high to low\ntemperature like a quadrilateral, whereas for Type II flares, the drift pattern\nlooks like a triangle. Statistical analysis suggests that Type II flares are\nmore impulsive than Type I flares. Third, for late-phase flares, the peak\nintensity ratio of the late phase to the main phase is roughly correlated with\nthe flare class, and the flares with a strong late phase are all confined. We\nbelieve that the re-deposition of the energy carried by a flux rope, that\nunsuccessfully erupts out, into thermal emissions is responsible for the strong\nlate phase found in a confined flare. Besides, with some cases we illustrate\nthe signatures of the flare thermodynamic process in the chromosphere and\ntransition region in TDS charts.

We demonstrate\nthat the discontinuity at the cut-off distance in the first derivative of the\npotential (corresponding to the interparticle force) leads to the appearance of\ncut-off nonlinearities. These cut-off nonlinearities persist into the\nvery-low-temperature regime thereby affecting low-temperature thermal\nvibrations, which leads to a breakdown of the harmonic approximation for many\neigen modes, particularly for low-frequency vibrational modes. Furthermore,\nwhile expansion nonlinearities which are due to higher order terms in the\nTaylor expansion of the interaction potential are usually ignored at low\ntemperatures and show up as the temperature increases, cut-off nonlinearities\ncan become most significant at the lowest temperatures. Anharmonic effects\nreadily show up in the elastic moduli which not only depend on the eigen\nfrequencies, but are crucially sensitive to the eigen vectors of the normal\nmodes. Whereas, those observables that rely mainly on static structural\ninformation or just the eigen frequencies, such as the vibrational density of\nstates, total potential energy, and specific heat, show negligible dependence\non the presence of the cut-off. Similar aspects of nonlinear behavior have\nrecently been reported in model granular materials, where the constituent\nparticles interact through finite-range, purely-repulsive potentials.

Then, we establish the effective capacity region\nthat provides the maximum allowable sustainable arrival rate region at the\ntransmitters' buffers under QoS guarantees. Assuming limited transmission power\nbudgets at the transmitters, we attain the power allocation policies that\nmaximize the effective capacity region. As for the decoding order at the\nreceiver, we characterize the optimal decoding order regions in the plane of\nchannel fading parameters for given power allocation policies. In order to\naccomplish the aforementioned objectives, we make use of the relationship\nbetween the minimum mean square error and the first derivative of the mutual\ninformation with respect to the power allocation policies. Through numerical\nresults, we display the impact of input signal distributions on the effective\ncapacity region performance of this two-user multiple access fading channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 15:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

We apply HMM for identifying genes\nencoding the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) in the genomes of Trypanosoma\nbrucei (T. brucei) and other African trypanosomes. These are parasitic protozoa\ncausative agents of sleeping sickness and several diseases in domestic and wild\nanimals. These parasites have a peculiar strategy to evade the host's immune\nsystem that consists in periodically changing their predominant cellular\nsurface protein (VSG). The motivation for using patterns recognition methods to\nidentify these genes, instead of traditional homology based ones, is that the\nlevels of sequence identity (amino acid and DNA sequence) amongst these genes\nis often below of what is considered reliable in these methods. Among pattern\nrecognition approaches, HMM are particularly suitable to tackle this problem\nbecause they can handle more naturally the determination of gene edges. We\nevaluate the performance of the model using different number of states in the\nMarkov model, as well as several performance metrics. The model is applied\nusing public genomic data. Our empirical results show that the VSG genes on T.\nbrucei can be safely identified (high sensitivity and low rate of false\npositives) using HMM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 14:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 19:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

We investigate the relationship between the\nservices' functionalities and the organizational requirement of these services\nrepresented by the coordination. We also consider the organizational\ntransformation driven by servitization and emphasize its impact on the act of\ncoordination. We highlight the tight correlation between the functionalities\nand the requirement in organic forms which suggests a successful deployment in\nsuch enterprises.
