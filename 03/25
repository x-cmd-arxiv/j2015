Although significant\ndifference of the in-plane resistivity $\\rho_{xx}(I\\parallel a)$ and\n$\\rho_{xx}(I\\parallel b)$ with the uniaxial pressure along $b$-axis was\nobserved, the transverse resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ shows a surprisingly isotropic\nbehavior. Detailed analysis reveals that the Hall coefficient $R_\\mathrm{H}$\nmeasured in the two orthogonal configurations ($I\\parallel a$-axis and\n$I\\parallel b$-axis) coincide very well and exhibit a deviation from the high\ntemperature background at around the structural transition temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Furthermore, the magnitude of $R_\\mathrm{H}$ increases\nremarkably below the structural transition temperature. This enhanced Hall\ncoefficient is accompanied by the non-linear transverse resistivity versus\nmagnetic field and enhanced magnetoresistance, which can be explained very well\nby the two band model with anisotropic mobilities of each band. Our results\ntogether with the two band model analysis clearly show that the anisotropic\nin-plane resistivity in the nematic state is closely related to the distinct\nquasiparticle mobilities when they are moving parallel or perpendicular to the\ndirection of the uniaxial pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 16:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-21"}

Conversely, the 2DEG potential can tune the\ngraphene Fermi energy. Graphene-defined quantum point contacts in the 2DEG show\nhalf-plateaus of quantized conductance in finite bias spectroscopy and display\nthe 0.7 anomaly for a large range of densities in the constriction, testifying\nto their good electronic properties.

How such clones expand within the\nspatially-constrained three dimensional architecture of a tumor, and come to\ndominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has never been explained.

We have used single crystal and powder neutron diffraction to obtain\ndetailed solutions for the crystal and magnetic structures of\n(NH4)2[FeCl5(H2O)], from which we determined the mechanism of multiferroicity.\nFrom the crystal structure analysis, we observed an order-disorder phase\ntransition related to the ordering of the ammonium counterion. We have\ndetermined the magnetic structure below TN, at 2K and zero magnetic field,\nwhich corresponds to a cycloidal spin arrangement with magnetic moments\ncontained in the ac-plane, propagating parallel to the c-axis.

By\nanalyzing the joint evolution of the spreading dynamics \"in the network\" and\nthe structural dynamics \"of the network\", we derive conditions on the\nadaptation law to control the dynamics of the spread in the resulting switching\nnetwork. In contrast with the results in the literature, we allow the initial\ntopology of the network to be an arbitrary graph. Furthermore, assuming there\nis a cost associated to switching edges in the network, we propose an\noptimization framework to find the cost-optimal network adaptation law, i.e.,\nthe cost-optimal edge switching probabilities.

For better understanding this theory, we discuss here in more\ndetails the new concept of Misrepair and the concept of accumulation of\nMisrepairs. I. Aging takes place uniquely on the systems that have a\nwell-defined structure: an organization of its sub-structures. Aging of a\nnon-living system is a result of accumulation of injuries (damage) of its\nstructure. II. A generalized concept of Misrepair is important for reaching to\na unified understanding of aging changes. In the situation of a severe injury,\nincorrect repair is a repair essential for maintaining structural integrity for\nincreasing the surviving chance of an organism. With the same mechanism as that\nin \"Misrepair of DNA\" , the term of \"Misrepair\" can be used for describing all\nkinds of incorrect repairs on different types of living structures, including\nmolecules, cells and tissues. A new concept of Misrepair is therefore proposed\nand defined as incorrect reconstruction of an injured living structure.\nMisrepair mechanism is beneficial for the survival of an organism, and it is\nessential for the survival of a species. III. Alteration of structure made by\nMisrepair is irreversible; therefore Misrepairs accumulate and disorganize\ngradually a structure, which appears as aging of it. Accumulation of Misrepairs\ntakes place on molecular, cellular and tissue levels respectively: on tissue\nlevel, it appears as disorganization of cells and extracellular matrixes\n(ECMs); on cellular level, it appears as deformation of cytoskeleton and change\nof cell shape; and on DNA, it appears as accumulation of DNA mutations and\nalteration of DNA sequence. An essential change in aging of an organism is an\nirreversible change of the spatial relationship between cells/ECMs in a tissue.\nIn conclusion, aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of Misrepairs\non tissue level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 19:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 15:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 15:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Controlled disorder can be introduced to explore\nsuppression of quantum diffusion in the absence of conventional dephasing\nmechanisms such as phonons, which are unavoidable in experiments on electronic\nsolids. Recent experiments use transport of degenerate Fermi gases in optical\nlattices (Kondov et al. Phys. Rev.

As a result, UAV traffic management systems are needed to\nsupport potentially thousands of UAVs flying simultaneously in the airspace, in\norder to ensure their liveness and safety requirements are met. Hamilton-Jacobi\n(HJ) reachability is a powerful framework for providing conditions under which\nthese requirements can be met, and for synthesizing the optimal controller for\nmeeting them. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, HJ reachability is\nonly tractable for a small number of vehicles if their set of maneuvers is\nunrestricted. In this paper, we define a platoon to be a group of UAVs in a\nsingle-file formation. We model each vehicle as a hybrid system with modes\ncorresponding to its role in the platoon, and specify the set of allowed\nmaneuvers in each mode to make the analysis tractable. We propose several\nliveness controllers based on HJ reachability, and wrap a safety controller,\nalso based on HJ reachability, around the liveness controllers.

Their proof was\nnon-constructive, using a sophisticated symmetrization argument and tools from\napproximation theory.\n  More recently, several open problems in the study of approximate degree have\nbeen resolved via the construction of dual polynomials. These are explicit dual\nsolutions to an appropriate linear program that captures the approximate degree\nof any function. We reprove Aaronson and Shi's results by constructing explicit\ndual polynomials for the Collision and Element Distinctness functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 02:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

The\nenhancement is predicted for the excitation regime when the microwave magnetic\nfield is induced inside the multilayer by the transducer of a stripline\nBroadband Ferromagnetic Resonance (BFMR) setup. By means of a rigorous\nnumerical solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation consistently with\nthe Maxwell's equations, we investigate the magnetisation dynamics in the\nmultilayer. We reveal a strong photon-magnon coupling, which manifests itself\nas anti-crossing of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) magnon mode supported by\nthe YIG layer and the electromagnetic resonance mode supported by the whole\nmultilayered structure. The frequency of the magnon mode depends on the\nexternal static magnetic field, which in our case is applied tangentially to\nthe multilayer in the direction perpendicular to the microwave magnetic field\ninduced by the stripline of the BFMR setup. The frequency of the\nelectromagnetic mode is independent of the static magnetic field. Consequently,\nthe predicted photon-magnon coupling is sensitive to the applied magnetic field\nand thus can be used in magnetically tuneable metamaterials based on\nsimultaneously negative permittivity and permeability achievable thanks to the\nYIG layer. We also suggest that the predicted photon-magnon coupling may find\napplications in microwave quantum information systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 05:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

With background\ncontamination that mimics the WIMP signal's energy distribution, the\nperformance is found to decrease at a rate less than the decrease of signal\npurity. The WIMP-mass dependence of the performance of a detector with various\nenergy thresholds that uses gaseous xenon as target material is reported. We\nfind that with a $5\\times 10^{-46} \\mathrm{cm}^2$ spin-independent WIMP-nucleon\ncross-section and a 30 GeV WIMP, a $770$ kg$\\cdot$year's exposure with a polar\ndetector of 10 keV threshold can make a three sigma discovery of directional\nWIMPs in the isothermal galactic dark matter halo. For a columnar recombination\ndetector, experimental considerations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 10:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 06:18:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 08:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

It is assumed that the introduction of stochastic in mathematical\nmodel makes it more adequate. But there is virtually no methods of coordinated\n(depended on structure of the system) stochastic introduction into\ndeterministic models. Authors have improved the method of stochastic models\nconstruction for the class of one-step processes and illustrated by models of\npopulation dynamics. Population dynamics was chosen for study because its\ndeterministic models were sufficiently well explored that allows to compare the\nresults with already known ones.\n  Purpose. To optimize the models creation as much as possible some routine\noperations should be automated. In this case, the process of drawing up the\nmodel equations can be algorithmized and implemented in the computer algebra\nsystem. Furthermore, on the basis of these results a set of programs for\nnumerical experiment can be obtained.\n  Method. The computer algebra system Axiom is used for analytical calculations\nimplementation. To perform the numerical experiment FORTRAN and Julia languages\nare used. The method Runge--Kutta method for stochastic differential equations\nis used as numerical method.\n  Results. The program compex for creating stochastic one-step processes models\nis constructed. Its application is illustrated by the predator-prey population\ndynamic system.\n  Conclusions. Computer algebra systems are very convenient for the purposes of\nrapid prototyping in mathematical models design and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 11:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

The incorporation of\nchondrules into asteroidal bodies must be an important step in planet\nformation, but the mechanism is not understood. We show that the main growth of\nasteroids can result from gas-drag-assisted accretion of chondrules. The\nlargest planetesimals of a population with a characteristic radius of 100 km\nundergo run-away accretion of chondrules within ~3 Myr, forming planetary\nembryos up to Mars sizes along with smaller asteroids whose size distribution\nmatches that of main belt asteroids. The aerodynamical accretion leads to\nsize-sorting of chondrules consistent with chondrites. Accretion of mm-sized\nchondrules and ice particles drives the growth of planetesimals beyond the ice\nline as well, but the growth time increases above the disk life time outside of\n25 AU. The contribution of direct planetesimal accretion to the growth of both\nasteroids and Kuiper belt objects is minor. In contrast, planetesimal accretion\nand chondrule accretion play more equal roles for the formation of Moon-sized\nembryos in the terrestrial planet formation region. These embryos are isolated\nfrom each other and accrete planetesimals only at a low rate. However, the\ncontinued accretion of chondrules destabilizes the oligarchic configuration and\nleads to the formation of Mars-sized embryos and terrestrial planets by a\ncombination of direct chondrule accretion and giant impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 11:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

We show that generating the same operator ideal\nis necessary but not sufficient for two compact operators to be equivalent\nafter extension. In analogy with the necessary and sufficient conditions on the\nsingular values for compact Hilbert space operators that are equivalent after\nextension, we prove the necessity of similar relationships between the\n$s$-numbers of two compact Banach space operators that are equivalent after\nextension, for arbitrary $s$-functions.\n  We investigate equivalence after extension for operators on\n$\\ell^{p}$-spaces. We show that two operators that act on different\n$\\ell^{p}$-spaces cannot be equivalent after one-sided extension. Such\noperators can still be equivalent after extension, for instance all invertible\noperators are equivalent after extension, however, if one of the two operators\nis compact, then they cannot be equivalent after extension. This contrasts the\nHilbert space case where equivalence after one-sided extension and equivalence\nafter extension are, in fact, identical relations.\n  Finally, for general Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, we investigate consequences\nof an operator on $X$ being equivalent after extension to a compact operator on\n$Y$. We show that, in this case, a closed finite codimensional subspace of $Y$\nmust embed into $X$, and that certain general Banach space properties must\ntransfer from $X$ to $Y$.

The jet consists\nof a chain of knots, bow shocks, and sinuous structures in between. As compared\nto that seen in our previous observations with the Submillimeter Array, it\nappears to be more continuous, especially in the northern part. Some of the\nknots are now seen associated with small bow shocks, with their bow wings\ncurving back to the jet axis, as seen in pulsed jet simulations. Two of them\nare reasonably resolved, showing kinematics consistent with sideways ejection,\npossibly tracing the internal working surfaces formed by a temporal variation\nin the jet velocity. In addition, nested shells are seen in CO around the jet\naxis connecting to the knots and bow shocks, driven by them. The proper motion\nof the jet is estimated to be ~ 115+-50 km/s, comparing to our previous\nobservations. The jet has a small semi-periodical wiggle, with a period of ~ 93\nyrs. The amplitude of the wiggle first increases with the distance from the\ncentral source and then stays roughly constant. One possible origin of the\nwiggle could be the kink instability in a magnetized jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 12:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The\n$\\ell$-link graph $\\mathbb{L}_\\ell(G)$ of $G$ is defined to have vertices the\n$\\ell$-links of $G$, such that two vertices of $\\mathbb{L}_\\ell(G)$ are\nadjacent if their corresponding $\\ell$-links are the initial and final\nsubsequences of an $(\\ell + 1)$-link of $G$.

In this paper, we\npropose a new distance between two finite metric graphs, called the\npersistence-distortion distance, which draws upon a topological idea. This\ntopological perspective along with the metric space viewpoint provide a new\nangle to the graph matching problem. Our persistence-distortion distance has\ntwo properties not shared by previous methods: First, it is stable against the\nperturbations of the input graph metrics. Second, it is a continuous distance\nmeasure, in the sense that it is defined on an alignment of the underlying\nspaces of input graphs, instead of merely their nodes. This makes our\npersistence-distortion distance robust against, for example, different\ndiscretizations of the same underlying graph. Despite considering the input\ngraphs as continuous spaces, that is, taking all points into account, we show\nthat we can compute the persistence-distortion distance in polynomial time.

The `nuclear' role of the observational laws and the\ndifferentiations from these nucleus, reproducing the general cases of\nphenomena, reveals the memory art's heritage in the theories. Here in this\npaper we argue that this design is also present in special relativity and in\nquantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 21:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}
