The\nconventional solutions are to handover high speed mobiles to macro base\nstations or multicast traffic to multiple base stations.

In\nthis paper we propose a set of solutions to systematically solve the technical\nchallenges of mobile dense networks.

We discuss\nseveral results, but the most striking is the systematic offset of the\nHI-massive sample above the BTF. These galaxies have both more gas and more\nstars in their disks than the typical disk galaxy of similar rotational\nvelocity. The \"condensed\" baryon fraction, $f_C$, the fraction of the baryons\nin a dark matter halo that settle either as cold gas or stars into the disk, is\ntwice as high in the HI-massive sample than typical, and almost reaches the\nuniversal baryon fraction in some cases, suggesting that the most extreme of\nthese galaxies have little in the way of a hot baryonic component or cold\nbaryons distributed well outside the disk. In contrast, the star formation\nefficiency, measured as the ratio of the mass in stars to that in both stars\nand gas, shows no difference between the HI-massive sample and the typical disk\ngalaxies. We conclude that the star formation efficiency is driven by an\ninternal, self-regulating process, while $f_C$ is affected by external factors.\nWe also found that the most massive HI detected galaxies are located\npreferentially in filaments.

Transverse waves propagating in opposite\ndirections cause an interference pattern with complex apparent phase speeds.\nThe relationship between fibrils and field lines is complex.

Field\nlines are visible where they lie close to the optical depth unity surface.

The forecast ensemble members at each\nstep are used to estimate the background error covariance matrix via the\nRao-Blackwell Ledoit and Wolf estimator, which has been developed specifically\ndeveloped to approximate high-dimensional covariance matrices using a small\nnumber of samples. Additional samples are taken from the normal distribution\ndescribed by the background ensemble mean and the estimated background\ncovariance matrix in order to increase the size of the ensemble and reduce the\nsampling error of the filter. This increase in the size of the ensemble is\nobtained without running the forward model. After the assimilation step, the\nadditional samples are discarded and only the initial members are propagated.\nTwo implementations are considered. In the EnKF Full-Space (EnKF-FS) approach\nthe assimilation process is performed in the model space, while the EnKF\nReduce-Space (EnKF-RS) formulation performs the analysis in the subspace\nspanned by the ensemble members.

Extracting robust and effective features\nis a crucial step towards solving these problems. However the existing\napproaches suffer from the sensitivity to either varying illumination, or\nviewpoint changing, or even camera motion, and/or the lack of spatial\ninformation. Inspired by the success of deep structures in image\nclassification, we attempt to leverage a deep structure to extract feature for\ndynamic texture and scene classification. To tackle with the challenges in\ntraining a deep structure, we propose to transfer some prior knowledge from\nimage domain to video domain. To be specific, we propose to apply a\nwell-trained Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) as a mid-level feature\nextractor to extract features from each frame, and then form a representation\nof a video by concatenating the first and the second order statistics over the\nmid-level features. We term this two-level feature extraction scheme as a\nTransferred ConvNet Feature (TCoF). Moreover we explore two different\nimplementations of the TCoF scheme, i.e., the \\textit{spatial} TCoF and the\n\\textit{temporal} TCoF, in which the mean-removed frames and the difference\nbetween two adjacent frames are used as the inputs of the ConvNet,\nrespectively. We evaluate systematically the proposed spatial TCoF and the\ntemporal TCoF schemes on three benchmark data sets, including DynTex, YUPENN,\nand Maryland, and demonstrate that the proposed approach yields superior\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 20:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

Recent work demonstrated that high-quality clusters can be\ngenerated by representing the data points using high-dimensional vectors that\nreflect textual content and social network information. Due to the high cost of\nsimilarity computation, sequential implementations of even single-pass\nalgorithms cannot keep up with the speed of real-world streams. This paper\npresents our efforts to meet the constraints of real-time social stream\nclustering through parallelization. We focus on two system-level issues. Most\nstream processing engines like Apache Storm organize distributed workers in the\nform of a directed acyclic graph, making it difficult to dynamically\nsynchronize the state of parallel workers. We tackle this challenge by creating\na separate synchronization channel using a pub-sub messaging system. Due to the\nsparsity of the high-dimensional vectors, the size of centroids grows quickly\nas new data points are assigned to the clusters. Traditional synchronization\nthat directly broadcasts cluster centroids becomes too expensive and limits the\nscalability of the parallel algorithm. We address this problem by communicating\nonly dynamic changes of the clusters rather than the whole centroid vectors.\nOur algorithm under Cloud DIKW can process the Twitter 10% data stream in\nreal-time with 96-way parallelism. By natural improvements to Cloud DIKW,\nincluding advanced collective communication techniques developed in our Harp\nproject, we will be able to process the full Twitter stream in real-time with\n1000-way parallelism. Our use of powerful general software subsystems will\nenable many other applications that need integration of streaming and batch\ndata analytics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 21:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Avail-able\nmethods for better localization often use visual information by using query\nimages acquired with camera-equipped mobile devices and applying image\nretrieval techniques to find the closest match in a GPS-referenced image data\nset. The search areas required for reliable search are about 1-2 sq. Km and the\naccuracy is typically 25-100 meters. Here we describe a method based on image\nretrieval where a reliable search can be confined to areas of 0.01 sq. Km and\nthe accuracy in our experiments is less than 10 meters. To test our procedure\nwe created a database by acquiring all Google Street View images close to what\nis seen by a pedestrian in a large region of downtown Chicago and saved all\ncoordinates and orientation data to be used for confining our search region.\nPrior knowledge from approximate position of query image is leveraged to\naddress complexity and accuracy issues of our search in a large scale\ngeo-tagged data set.

Networks can be visualized and explored\nwithin seconds by simply drag-and-dropping a graph file into the web browser.\nThe structure, properties, and patterns of the network are computed\nautomatically and can be instantly explored in real-time. At the heart of\nGraphVis lies a multi-level interactive network visualization and analytics\nengine that allows for real-time graph mining and exploration across multiple\nlevels of granularity simultaneously. Both the graph analytic and visualization\ntechniques (at each level of granularity) are dynamic and interactive, with\nimmediate and continuous visual feedback upon every user interaction (e.g.,\nchange of a slider for filtering). Furthermore, nodes, edges, and subgraphs are\neasily inserted, deleted or exported via a number of novel techniques and tools\nthat make it extremely easy and flexible for exploring, testing hypothesis, and\nunderstanding networks in real-time over the web. A number of interactive\nvisual graph analytic techniques are also proposed including interactive role\ndiscovery methods, community detection, as well as a number of novel block\nmodels for generating graphs with community structure.

This approach shows that, for a given sample\nsize $M$, not all states observed in the sample can be distinguished. Rather,\nonly a partition of the sampled states $s$ can be resolved. Such partition\ndefines an {\\em emergent} classification $q_s$ of the states that becomes finer\nand finer as the sample size increases, through a process of {\\em symmetry\nbreaking} between states. This allows us to distinguish between the\n$resolution$ of a given representation of the observer defined states $s$,\nwhich is given by the entropy of $s$, and its $relevance$ which is defined by\nthe entropy of the partition $q_s$. Relevance has a non-monotonic dependence on\nresolution, for a given sample size.

This\ngives way to an accurate modeling of the connectivity of the neuronal network.\nThe timing is the all important feature in the peripheral neuronal auditory\npathway. The primary auditory neurons e.g. phase lock to periodic sounds with\nimportant interactions with respect to both the refractory periods of the\nneurons and to the time delays caused by traveling times along the basilar\nmembrane or through a synaptic connection.

This curious\ngap in one-dimensional geometric random graphs is in sharp contrast to the\nprevalent phenomenon in many other random graphs such as two-dimensional\ngeometric random graphs, Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, and random intersection\ngraphs, all of which in the asymptotic sense become connected as soon as there\nis no isolated node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 09:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 03:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-20"}

However, up to now it has been hard to\nself-consistently simulate a disc galaxy that sustains two nested stellar bars\nfor longer than a few rotation periods. N-body/hydrodynamical simulations\nincluding star formation recipes have been performed. Their properties have\nbeen compared with the most recent observational data in order to prove that\nthey are representative of double-barred galaxies, even SB0. Overlaps in\ndynamical resonances and bar modes have been looked for using Fourier\nspectrograms. Double-barred galaxies have been successfully simulated with\nlifetimes as long as 7 Gyr. The stellar population of the secondary bar is\nyounger on average than for the primary large-scale bar. An important feature\nof these simulations is the absence of any resonance overlap for several Gyr.\nIn particular, there is no overlap between the primary bar ILR and the\nsecondary bar corotation. Therefore, mode coupling cannot sustain the secondary\nbar mode. Star formation is identified here as possibly being responsible for\nbringing energy to the nuclear mode. Star formation is also responsible for\nlimiting the amount of gas in the central region which prevents the orbits\nsustaining the secondary bar from being destroyed. Therefore, the secondary bar\ncan dissolve but reappear after approx. 1 Gyr. When star formation is switched\noff the dynamical perturbation associated with the secondary bar needs several\nGyr to fully vanish. Double-bars can be long-lived in numerical simulations\nwith a gaseous component, even in the absence of overlap of resonances or mode\ncoupling, provided that star formation remains active in the central region\nwhere the nuclear bar lies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 09:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We give the\nanalytic formulation of the total work. For the fermion SQSZE, the work might\nbe absorbed from the environment, and the change rate of the work with\ntemperature exhibits periodicity and even-odd oscillation, which is a\ngeneralization of a spinless QSZE. It is interesting that the average absorbed\nwork oscillates regularly and periodically in a large-number limit, which\nimplies that the average absorbed work in a fermion SQSZE is neither an\nintensive quantity nor an extensive quantity. The phase diagrams of both\nfermion and boson SQSZEs give the SQSZE doing positive or negative work in the\nparameter space of the temperature and the particle number of the system, but\nthey have different behaviors because the spin degrees of the fermion and the\nboson play different roles in their configuration states and corresponding\nstatistical properties.

An\nimportant line of research in this regard is to shrink the extreme spectrum of\nthe covariance matrix estimators. A separate line of research in the literature\nhas considered sparse inverse covariance estimation which in turn gives rise to\ngraphical models. In practice, however, a sparse covariance or inverse\ncovariance matrix which is simultaneously well-conditioned and at the same time\ncomputationally tractable is desired.

When the loss function can be decomposed\nas a sum of an orthogonally invariant function of the estimate and its inner\nproduct with a function of the sample covariance matrix, we show that a\nsolution path algorithm can be derived, involving a series of ordinary\ndifferential equations. The path algorithm is attractive because it provides\nthe entire family of estimates for all possible values of the condition number\nbound, at the same computational cost of a single estimate with a fixed upper\nbound. An important finding is that the proximal operator for the condition\nnumber constraint, which turns out to be very useful in regularizing loss\nfunctions that are not orthogonally invariant and may yield\nnon-positive-definite estimates, can be efficiently computed by this path\nalgorithm.

While\nsparse representation based classification (SRC) has been shown promising\nperformance in laboratory conditions (i.e. noiseless or random pixel\ncorrupted), it performs much worse in practical scenarios. In this paper, we\nconsider the practical face recognition problem, where the occlusions are\npredictable and available for sampling. We propose the structured occlusion\ncoding (SOC) to address occlusion problems. The structured coding here lies in\ntwo folds. On one hand, we employ a structured dictionary for recognition. On\nthe other hand, we propose to use the structured sparsity in this formulation.\nSpecifically, SOC simultaneously separates the occlusion and classifies the\nimage. In this way, the problem of recognizing an occluded image is turned into\nseeking a structured sparse solution on occlusion-appended dictionary. In order\nto construct a well-performing occlusion dictionary, we propose an occlusion\nmask estimating technique via locality constrained dictionary (LCD), showing\nstriking improvement in occlusion sample. On a category-specific occlusion\ndictionary, we replace norm sparsity with the structured sparsity which is\nshown more robust, further enhancing the robustness of our approach. Moreover,\nSOC achieves significant improvement in handling large occlusion in real world.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on public data sets to validate the\nsuperiority of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 13:48:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 06:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Particularly, repeated occurrences of similar features due to repeating\nstructure in the world (e.g., doorways, chairs, etc.) or missing associations\nbetween observations pose critical challenges to visual localization. We\naddress these challenges using a two-step approach. We first estimate a\ncandidate pose using few correspondences between features of the current camera\nframe and the feature map. The initial set of correspondences is established by\nproximity in feature space. The initial pose estimate is used in the second\nstep to guide spatial matching of features in 3D, i.e., searching for\nassociations where the image features are expected to be found in the map. A\nRANSAC algorithm is used to compute a fine estimation of the pose from the\ncorrespondences. Our approach clearly outperforms localization based on feature\nmatching exclusively in feature space, both in terms of estimation accuracy and\nrobustness to failure and allows for global localization in real time (30Hz).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 15:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

This implies that\nselective desorption mechanisms are at work. An astrochemical model of a\ncontracting low-mass molecular cloud core is presented. Ice was treated as\nconsisting of the surface and three subsurface layers (sublayers).\nPhotodesorption, reactive desorption, and indirect reactive desorption were\ninvestigated. The latter manifests itself through desorption from H+H reaction\non grains. Desorption of shallow subsurface species was included. Modeling\nresults suggest the existence of a \"photon-dominated ice\" during the early\nphases of core contraction. Subsurface ice is chemically processed by\ninterstellar photons, which produces complex organic molecules. Desorption from\nthe subsurface layer results in high COM gas-phase abundances at Av =\n2.4...10mag. This may contribute towards an explanation for COM observations in\ndark cores. It was found that photodesorption mostly governs the onset of ice\naccumulation onto grains. Reaction-specific reactive desorption is efficient\nfor small molecules that form via highly exothermic atom-addition reactions.\nHigher reactive desorption efficiency results in lower gas-phase abundances of\nCOMs. Indirect reactive desorption allows to closely reproduce the observed\nH2O:CO:CO2 ratio towards a number of background stars. Presumably this can be\ndone by any mechanism whose efficiency fits with the sequence CO > CO2 >> H2O.\nAfter the freeze-out has ended, the three sublayers represent chemically\ndistinct parts of the mantle. 8...10.5mag is the likely AV threshold for the\nappearance of CO ice.

We give a related proof that an\nirreducible real polynomial has degree 2 or less, Gauss's form of the\nFundamental Theorem of Algebra. It has been debated whether an elementary proof\nfor FTA can be found, using the Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem as its \"analytical\"\ncomponent. In the present case the analytic or topological tool employed is\nBrouwer's Theorem on Invariance of Domain, which derives from his Fixed-Point\nTheorem. A corollary of Domain Invariance is that an injective mapping of one\ncompact manifold to another (connected) one of the same dimension, is in fact\nsurjective and a homeomorphism. The desired result (FTA) comes from the fact\nthat a real sphere and its (quotient) projective space of the same dimension\nare homeomorphic only when this dimension equals 1. This proof joins a class of\nproofs that depend on Euclidean fixed-point theory, and also the class of\nproofs that involve no field extensions or methods of complex analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 22:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}
