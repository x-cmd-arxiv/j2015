The analysis of the H-field at different locations\nduring the \"Carrington-like\" event leads to a re-interpretation of the 1859\nevent. The major conclusions of the paper are the following: (a) the global Dst\nor SYM-H, as indices based on averaging, missed the largest geomagnetic\ndisturbance in the 29 October 2003 event and might have missed the 1859\ndisturbance, since the large spike in the horizontal component (H) of\nterrestrial magnetic field depends strongly on magnetic local time (MLT); (b)\nthe main cause of the large drop in H recorded at Colaba during the Carrington\nstorm was not the ring current but field-aligned currents (FACs), and (c) the\nvery local signatures of the H-spike imply that a Carrington-like event can\noccur more often than expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

However, even if we find Solar system analogues, it is not certain that\na planet in Earth position will have similar circumstances as those of Earth.\nSmall changes in the architecture of the giant planets can lead to orbital\nperturbations which may change the conditions of habitability for a terrestrial\nplanet in the habitable zone (HZ). We present a numerical investigation where\nwe first study the motion of test-planets in a particular Jupiter-Saturn\nconfiguration for which we can expect strong gravitational perturbations on the\nmotion at Earth position according to a previous work. In this study, we show\nthat these strong perturbations can be reduced significantly by the neighboring\nplanets of Earth. In the second part of our study we investigate the motion of\ntest-planets in inclined Jupiter-Saturn systems where we analyze changes in the\ndynamical behavior of the inner planetary system. Moderate values of\ninclination seem to counteract the perturbations in the HZ while high\ninclinations induce more chaos in this region. Finally, we carry out a\nstability study of the actual orbits of Venus, Earth and Mars moving in the\ninclined Jupiter-Saturn systems for which we used the Solar system parameters.\nThis study shows that the three terrestrial planets will only move in\nlow-eccentric orbits if Saturn's inclination is <=10{\\deg}.

Using a paired-end read approach\nwith Illumina sequence data for archaic humans, I identify changes in genome\nstructure that occurred recently in human evolution. Hundreds of rearrangements\nindicate genomic trafficking between the sex chromosomes and autosomes, raising\nthe possibility of sex-specific changes. Additionally, genes adjacent to genome\nstructure changes in Neanderthals are associated with testis-specific\nexpression, consistent with evolutionary theory that new genes commonly form\nwith expression in the testes. I identify one case of new-gene creation through\ntransposition from the Y chromosome to chromosome 10 that combines the 5' end\nof the testis-specific gene Fank1 with previously untranscribed sequence. This\nnew transcript experienced copy number expansion in archaic genomes, indicating\nrapid genomic change. Among rearrangements identified in Neanderthals, 13% are\ntransposition of selfish genetic elements, while 32% appear to be ectopic\nexchange between repeats. In Denisovan, the pattern is similar but numbers are\nsignificantly higher with 18% of rearrangements reflecting transposition and\n40% ectopic exchange between distantly related repeats. There is an excess of\ndivergent rearrangements relative to polymorphism in Denisovan, which might\nresult from non-uniform rates of mutation, possibly reflecting a burst of TE\nactivity in the lineage that led to Denisovan. Finally, loci containing genome\nstructure changes show diminished rates of introgression from Neanderthals into\nmodern humans, consistent with the hypothesis that rearrangements serve as\nbarriers to gene flow during hybridization. Together, these results suggest\nthat this previously unidentified source of genomic variation has important\nbiological consequences in human evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 17:06:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 22:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 17:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Finding observational evidence of very low\nmass classical bulges particularly in barred galaxies including our Milky Way,\nis a challenging task as the bar driven secular evolution might bring\nsignificant dynamical change to these bulges alongside the stellar disk.\n  Using high-resolution N-body simulation, we show that if a cool stellar disk\nis assembled around a non-rotating low-mass classical bulge, the disk rapidly\ngrows a strong bar within a few rotation time scales. Later, the bar driven\nsecular process transform the initial classical bulge into a flattened rotating\nstellar system whose central part also have grown a bar-like component rotating\nin sync with the disk bar. During this time, a boxy/peanut (hereafter, B/P)\nbulge is formed via the buckling instability of the disk bar and the vertical\nextent of this B/P bulge being slightly higher than that of the classical\nbulge, it encompasses the whole classical bulge. The resulting composite bulge\nappears to be both photometrically and kinematically identical to a B/P bulge\nwithout any obvious signature of the classical component. Our analysis suggest\nthat many barred galaxies in the local universe might be hiding such low-mass\nclassical bulges.

However, its physical\njustification was questioned because self-accelerating TCs simulated with the\nsteady TEM seemed to violate the turbulent kinetic energy balance. This\nviolation was considered as a result of very strong sediment erosion that\nconsumes more turbulent kinetic energy than is produced. To confine bed erosion\nand thus remedy this issue, the four-equation model (FEM) was introduced by\nassuming a proportionality between the bed shear stress and the turbulent\nkinetic energy. Here we analytically proof that self-accelerating TCs simulated\nwith the original steady TEM actually never violate the turbulent kinetic\nenergy balance, provided that the bed drag coefficient is not unrealistically\nlow. We find that stronger bed erosion, surprisingly, leads to more production\nof turbulent kinetic energy due to conversion of potential energy of eroded\nmaterial into kinetic energy of the current. Furthermore, we analytically show\nthat, for asymptotically supercritical flow conditions, the original steady TEM\nalways produces self-accelerating TCs if the upstream boundary conditions\n(\"ignition\" values) are chosen appropriately, while it never does so for\nasymptotically subcritical flow conditions. We numerically show that our novel\nmethod to obtain the ignition values even works for Richardson numbers very\nnear to unity.

(\"SST\") with fast and flexible trigger capabilities is\npresented. The SST's objective is to provide multi-GHz sample rates with\nintrinsically-stable timing, Nyquist-rate sampling and high trigger bandwidth,\nwide dynamic range and simple operation. Containing 4 channels of 256 samples\nper channel, the SST is fabricated in an inexpensive 0.25 micrometer CMOS\nprocess and uses a high-performance package that is 8 mm on a side. It has a\n1.9V input range on a 2.5V supply, exceeds 12 bits of dynamic range, and uses\n~128 mW while operating at 2 G-samples/s and full trigger rates. With a\nstandard 50 Ohm input source, the SST exceeds ~1.5 GHz -3 dB bandwidth. The\nSST's internal sample clocks are generated synchronously via a shift register\ndriven by an external LVDS oscillator running at half the sample rate (e.g., a\n1 GHz oscillator yields 2 G-samples/s). Because of its purely-digital\nsynchronous nature, the SST has ps-level timing uniformity that is independent\nof sample frequencies spanning over 6 orders of magnitude: from under 2 kHz to\nover 2 GHz. Only three active control lines are necessary for operation: Reset,\nStart/Stop and Read-Clock. When operating as common-stop device, the time of\nthe stop, modulo 256 relative to the start, is read out along with the sampled\nsignal values. Each of the four channels integrates dual-threshold trigger\ncircuitry with windowed coincidence features. Channels can discriminate signals\nwith ~1mV RMS resolution at >600 MHz bandwidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 19:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

We explore three different\nmethods to extract the H$\\alpha$ + [NII] flux from J-PLUS photometric data: a\ncombination of a broad-band and a narrow-band filter ($r'$ and $F660$), two\nbroad-band and a narrow-band one ($r'$, $i'$ and $F660$), and a SED-fitting\nbased method using 8 photometric points. To test these methodologies, we\nsimulated J-PLUS data from a sample of 7511 SDSS spectra with measured\nH$\\alpha$ flux. Based on the same sample, we derive two empirical relations to\ncorrect the derived H$\\alpha$+[NII] flux from dust extinction and [NII]\ncontamination. We find that the only unbiased method is the SED fitting based\none. The combination of two filters underestimates the measurements of the\nH$\\alpha$ + [NII] flux by a 28%, while the three filters method by a 9%. We\nstudy the error budget of the SED-fitting based method and find that, in\naddition to the photometric error, our measurements have a systematic\nuncertainty of a 4.3%. Several sources contribute to this uncertainty:\ndifferences between our measurement procedure and the one used to derive the\nspectroscopic values, the use of simple stellar populations as templates, and\nthe intrinsic errors of the spectra, which were not taken into account. Apart\nfrom that, the empirical corrections for dust extinction and [NII]\ncontamination add an extra uncertainty of 14%. Given the J-PLUS photometric\nsystem, the best methodology to extract H$\\alpha$ + [NII] flux is the\nSED-fitting based one. Using this method, we are able to recover reliable\nH$\\alpha$ fluxes for thousands of nearby galaxies in a robust and homogeneous\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 20:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 15:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

As the purifier of this radiation, the state of the BH interior\nmust also be in some highly quantum state. So that, within the interior region,\nthe mean-field approximation cannot be valid and the state of the BH cannot be\ndescribed by some semiclassical metric. On this basis, we model the state of\nthe BH interior as a collection of a large number of excitations that are\npacked into closely spaced but single-occupancy energy levels; a sort-of \"Fermi\nsea\" of all light-enough particles. This highly quantum state is surrounded by\na semiclassical region that lies close to the horizon and has a non-vanishing\nenergy density. It is shown that such a state looks like a BH from the outside\nand decays via gravitational pair production in the near-horizon region at a\nrate that agrees with the Hawking rate. We also consider the fate of a\nclassical object that has passed through to the BH interior and show that, once\nit has crossed over the near-horizon threshold, the object meets its demise\nextremely fast. This result cannot be attributed to a \"firewall\", as the trauma\nto the in-falling object only begins after it has passed through the\nnear-horizon region and enters a region where semiclassical spacetime ends but\nthe energy density is still parametrically smaller than Planckian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 20:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Understanding the biophysical basis for protein\npatterning by deciphering the quantitative rules for their formation and motion\nis an important aspect of characterizing immune cell recognition and thence the\nrules for immune system activation. We propose a minimal mathematical model for\nthe physical basis of membrane protein patterning in the IS, which encompass\nmembrane mechanics, protein binding kinetics and motion, and fluid flow in the\nsynaptic cleft. Our theory leads to simple predictions for the spatial and\ntemporal scales of protein cluster formation, growth and arrest as a function\nof membrane stiffness, rigidity and kinetics of the adhesive proteins, and the\nfluid in the synaptic cleft. Numerical simulations complement these scaling\nlaws by quantifying the nucleation, growth and stabilization of proteins\ndomains on the size of the cell. Direct comparison with experiment shows that\npassive elastohydrodynamics and kinetics of protein binding in the synaptic\ncleft can describe the short-time formation and organization of protein\nclusters, without evoking any active processes in the cytoskeleton. Despite the\napparent complexity of the process, our analysis highlights the role of just\ntwo dimensionless parameters that characterize the spatial and temporal\nevolution of the protein pattern: a ratio of membrane elasticity to protein\nelasticity, and the ratio of a hydrodynamic time scale for fluid flow relative\nto the protein binding rate, and we present a simple phase diagram that\nencompasses the variety of patterns that can arise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 20:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Indeed, we show that, the most recent version of the \\halofit\\ formula\ncalibrated on $\\Lambda$CDM simulations can be applied directly to the linear\nCDM power spectrum without requiring additional fitting parameters in the\nmassive case. As a second step, we study the abundance and clustering\nproperties of CDM halos, confirming that, in massive neutrino cosmologies, the\nproper definition of the halo bias should be made with respect to the {\\em\ncold} rather than the {\\em total} matter distribution, as recently shown in the\nliterature. Here we extend these results to the redshift space, finding that,\nwhen accounting for massive neutrinos, an improper definition of the linear\nbias can lead to a systematic error of about 1-$2 \\%$ in the determination of\nthe linear growth rate from anisotropic clustering. This result is quite\nimportant if we consider that future spectroscopic galaxy surveys, as \\eg\\\nEuclid, are expected to measure the linear growth-rate with statistical errors\nless than about $3 \\%$ at $z\\lesssim1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 22:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 00:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 21:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-07"}

In this problem, the robots have to get close\nenough to each other, so that every robot can see all the others, without\ntouching (i.e., colliding with) any other robot. The importance of solving the\nNear-Gathering problem is that it makes it possible to overcome the restriction\nof having robots with limited visibility. Hence it allows to exploit all the\nstudies (the majority, actually) done on this topic in the unlimited visibility\nsetting. Indeed, after the robots get close enough to each other, they are able\nto see all the robots in the system, a scenario that is similar to the one\nwhere the robots have unlimited visibility.\n  We present the first (deterministic) algorithm for the Near-Gathering\nproblem, to the best of our knowledge, which allows a set of autonomous mobile\nrobots to nearly gather within finite time without ever colliding. Our\nalgorithm assumes some reasonable conditions on the input configuration (the\nNear-Gathering problem is easily seen to be unsolvable in general). Further,\nall the robots are assumed to have a compass (hence they agree on the \"North\"\ndirection), but they do not necessarily have the same handedness (hence they\nmay disagree on the clockwise direction).\n  We also show how the robots can detect termination, i.e., detect when the\nNear-Gathering problem has been solved. This is crucial when the robots have to\nperform a generic task after having nearly gathered. We show that termination\ndetection can be obtained even if the total number of robots is unknown to the\nrobots themselves (i.e., it is not a parameter of the algorithm), and robots\nhave no way to explicitly communicate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 01:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

A\nfast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet, with the\nhighest outflow velocities about 0.5kpc from the nucleus, at the location of\nthe brighter hot-spot in the W lobe. The data show that a massive, fast outflow\nwith velocities up to 650 km/s of cold molecular gas is present, in addition to\none detected earlier in warm H2, HI and ionised gas. Both the central AGN and\nthe radio jet could energetically drive the outflow. However, the\ncharacteristics of the outflowing gas point to the radio jet being the main\ndriver. This is important, because IC5063, although one of the most powerful\nSeyfert galaxies, is a relatively weak radio source (P = 3x10^23 W/Hz). All the\nobserved characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jet\nexpanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and\ninflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium.\nThis model is consistent with results obtained by recent simulations such as\nthose of Wagner et al.. A stronger, direct interaction between the jet and a\ngas cloud is present at the location of the brighter W lobe. Even assuming the\nmost conservative values for the conversion factor CO-to-H2, the mass of the\noutflowing gas is between 1.9 and 4.8x10^7 Msun. These amounts are much larger\nthan those of the outflow of warm gas (molecular and ionized) and somewhat\nlarger than of the HI outflow. This suggests that most of the observed cold\nmolecular outflow is due to fast cooling after being shocked. This gas is the\nend product of the cooling process. Our CO observations demonstrate that fast\noutflows of molecular gas can be driven by relativistic jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 05:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

How to predict these\ncascades is highly nontrivial in several vital applications, such as viral\nmarketing, epidemic prevention and traffic management. Most previous works\nmainly focus on predicting the final cascade sizes. As cascades are typical\ndynamic processes, it is always interesting and important to predict the\ncascade size at any time, or predict the time when a cascade will reach a\ncertain size (e.g. an threshold for outbreak). In this paper, we unify all\nthese tasks into a fundamental problem: cascading process prediction. That is,\ngiven the early stage of a cascade, how to predict its cumulative cascade size\nof any later time? For such a challenging problem, how to understand the micro\nmechanism that drives and generates the macro phenomenons (i.e. cascading\nproceese) is essential. Here we introduce behavioral dynamics as the micro\nmechanism to describe the dynamic process of a node's neighbors get infected by\na cascade after this node get infected (i.e. one-hop subcascades). Through\ndata-driven analysis, we find out the common principles and patterns lying in\nbehavioral dynamics and propose a novel Networked Weibull Regression model for\nbehavioral dynamics modeling. After that we propose a novel method for\npredicting cascading processes by effectively aggregating behavioral dynamics,\nand propose a scalable solution to approximate the cascading process with a\ntheoretical guarantee.

The earlier tweaking and other systematic approaches are\nreviewed but none has reached a simple and easily implementable approach for\nany application.

A major obstacle\nto better understanding the healing property is the lack of an atomistic\npicture of the interstitial states near GBs, due to severely separation of the\ntimescale of interstitial segregation from other events and abundance of\ninterstitials at the GB. Here, we report a generic \"self-blocking\" effect of\nthe interstitial cluster (SIAn) near the metallic GB in W, Mo and Fe. Upon\ncreating a SIAn near the GB, it is immediately trapped by the GB during the GB\nstructural relaxation and blocks there, impeding GB's further spontaneous\ntrapping of the SIAn in the vicinity and making these SIAns stuck nearby the\nGB. The SIAn in the stuck state surprisingly owes an exceptionally larger\nnumber of annihilation sites with vacancies near the GB than the SIAn trapped\nat the GB due to maintaining its bulk configuration basically. Besides, it also\nhas an unexpectedly long-ranged repelling interaction with the SIA in the bulk\nregion, which may further affect the GB's trap of the SIAn. The self-blocking\neffect might shed light on more critical and extended role of the GB in healing\nradiation-damage in NCs than previously recognized the GB's limited role based\non GB's trap for the SIA and resulted vacancy-SIA recombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 06:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Thus, it creates a mechanism\nthat can tradeoff some uplink capacity for increased downlink capacity. In this\nwork we quantify this tradeoff and study the exchange ratio between the\nfeedback rate (over the uplink) and the downlink rate. We study both finite and\ninfinite networks, and show that for high enough (but finite) SNR, the uplink\nrate can be exchanged for increased downlink rate with a favorable exchange\nratio. This exchange ratio is an increasing function of the channel coherence\ntime, and a decreasing function of the number of measured base stations. We\nalso show that devoting a constant fraction of the uplink to CSI feedback can\nincrease the downlink multiplexing gain continuously from 0 to 1, in finite\nnetworks. On the other hand, in infinite networks (with infinite connectivity)\nour bounds can only show doubly logarithmic scaling of the rate with SNR. The\npresented results prove that the adaptation of the feedback rate can control\nthe balance between the uplink and downlink rates. This capability is very\nimportant in modern cellular networks, where the operators need to respond to\ncontinuously changing user demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 06:44:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Further the flight tests\ncannot always be conducted in an ideal situation of the process noise and the\nmeasurement noises being white and Gaussian as is generally assumed in the\nKalman filter. The measurements are not available in general with respect to\nthe center of gravity, possess scale and bias factors which will have to be\nmodelled and estimated as well. The coupling between the longitudinal and\nlateral motion brings in added difficulty but makes the problem more\ninteresting. At times the noisy measurements from the longitudinal and lateral\nmotion are input into the longitudinal states. This leads to the resulting\nequations becoming linear with the measurement noise forming the process noise\ninput. At times it turns out that even a parameter that strongly affects the\nairplane dynamics is estimated which vary widely among the approaches. This\nrequires a careful look at the estimates. We also recommend a closer look at\nthe correlation coefficients (that is generally ignored in such studies) of the\nestimated parameters which provide an insight into their subsequent uses.

Notably, we\nfind that the location of the hubs of out-going ($\\sim 180^{\\circ}\\rm{E}$) and\nin-coming ($\\sim 140^{\\circ}\\rm{W}$) links of the climate network coincide with\nthe locations of the Kelvin wave initiation and dissipation, respectively. We\nalso find that this dissipation at $\\sim 140^{\\circ}\\rm{W}$ is much weaker\nduring \\en times. Moreover, the hubs of the off-equatorial network coincide\nwith the locations of westerly wind burst activity and high wind vorticity, two\nmechanisms that were associated with Rossby waves activity. The quantitative\nmethodology and measures developed here can improve the understanding of \\en\ndynamics and possibly its prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 08:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

If the\ngas causing star formation is also responsible for feeding the central black\nhole, then a positive correlation is expected. If powerful AGNs are responsible\nfor the star formation quenching, then a negative correlation is expected.\nObservations so far have mainly found a mild correlation or no correlation at\nall (i.e. a flat relation between star formation rate (SFR) and AGN\nluminosity), raising questions about the whole paradigm of \"AGN feedback\". In\nthis paper, we report the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical model,\nwhich has a very strong coupling between AGN activity and quenching of star\nformation. The predicted SFR-AGN luminosity correlation appears negative in the\nlow AGN luminosity regime, where AGN feedback acts, but becomes strongly\npositive in the regime of the brightest AGN. Our predictions reproduce\nreasonably well recent observations by Rosario et al., yet there is some\ndiscrepancy in the normalisation of the correlation at low luminosities and\nhigh redshifts.

New colored particles predicted in many BSM\nscenarios are expected to be produced with large cross sections thus making\nthem interesting prospects as a doorway to hints of new physics. We consider\nthe resonant production of such a colored particle, the diquark, a particle\nhaving the quantum number of two quarks. The diquark can be either a scalar or\nvector. We focus on the vector diquark which has much larger production cross\nsection compared to the scalar ones. In this work we calculate the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the on-shell vector diquark\nproduction at the LHC produced through the fusion of two quarks as well as the\nNLO corrections to its decay width. We present full analytic results for the\none-loop NLO calculation and do a numerical study to show that the NLO\ncorrections can reduce the scale uncertainties in the cross sections which can\nbe appreciable and therefore modify the expected search limits for such\nparticles. We also use the dijet result from LHC to obtain current limits on\nthe mass and coupling strengths of the vector diquarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 10:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2015 06:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 04:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

Due to\ntheir generally complex morphologies, the stellar Stokes $V$ profiles are\nusually interpreted with elaborate inversion techniques such as Zeeman Doppler\nimaging (ZDI). Here we further develop a new method of interpretation of\ncircular polarisation signatures in spectral lines using cumulative Stokes $V$\nprofiles (anti-derivative of Stokes $V$). This method is complimentary to ZDI\nand can be applied for validation of the inversion results or when the\navailable observational data are insufficient for an inversion. Based on the\nrigorous treatment of polarised line formation in the weak-field regime, we\nshow that, for rapidly rotating stars, the cumulative Stokes $V$ profiles\ncontain information about the spatially resolved longitudinal magnetic field\ndensity. Rotational modulation of these profiles can be employed for a simple,\nqualitative characterisation of the stellar magnetic field topologies. We apply\nthis diagnostic method to the archival observations of the weak-line T Tauri\nstar V410 Tau and Bp He-strong star HD 37776. We show that the magnetic field\nin V410 Tau is dominated by an azimuthal component, in agreement with the ZDI\nmap that we recover from the same data set. For HD 37776 the cumulative Stokes\n$V$ profile variation indicates the presence of multiple regions of positive\nand negative field polarity. This behaviour agrees with the ZDI results but\ncontradicts the popular hypothesis that the magnetic field of this star is\ndominated by an axisymmetric quadrupolar component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 11:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

A common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giant\nstars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotic\ntheory. This pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern,\ndescribes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. We aim to investigate the\ndeviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them in\nterms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium. We also show how\nthis seismic signature depends on stellar evolution.

We identify the modulation component of the radial mode\nfrequency spacings in more than five hundred red giants.

SegNet has several attractive properties; (i) it only requires\nforward evaluation of a fully learnt function to obtain smooth label\npredictions, (ii) with increasing depth, a larger context is considered for\npixel labelling which improves accuracy, and (iii) it is easy to visualise the\neffect of feature activation(s) in the pixel label space at any depth. SegNet\nis composed of a stack of encoders followed by a corresponding decoder stack\nwhich feeds into a soft-max classification layer. The decoders help map low\nresolution feature maps at the output of the encoder stack to full input image\nsize feature maps. This addresses an important drawback of recent deep learning\napproaches which have adopted networks designed for object categorization for\npixel wise labelling. These methods lack a mechanism to map deep layer feature\nmaps to input dimensions. They resort to ad hoc methods to upsample features,\ne.g. by replication. This results in noisy predictions and also restricts the\nnumber of pooling layers in order to avoid too much upsampling and thus reduces\nspatial context. SegNet overcomes these problems by learning to map encoder\noutputs to image pixel labels. We test the performance of SegNet on outdoor RGB\nscenes from CamVid, KITTI and indoor scenes from the NYU dataset. Our results\nshow that SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance even without use of\nadditional cues such as depth, video frames or post-processing with CRF models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 12:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The model comprises a circular\nelastic membrane with a hole at the center that is deformed by the capillary\npressure of simply connected and doubly connected menisci. Using variational\nand spectral methods, stability is related to the slope of equilibrium branches\nin the liquid content versus pressure diagram for the constrained and\nunconstrained problems. The second-variation spectra are separately determined\nfor the membrane and meniscus, showing that the membrane out-of-plane spectrum\nand the in-plane spectrum at large elatocapillary numbers are both positive, so\nthat only meniscus perturbations can cause instability. At small\nelastocapillary numbers, the in-plane spectrum has a negative eigenvalue,\ninducing wrinkling instabilities in thin membranes. In contrast, the smallest\neigenvalue of the meniscus spectrum always changes sign at a pressure turning\npoint where stability exchange occurs in the unconstrained problem. We also\nexamine configurations in which the meniscus and membrane are individually\nstable, while the elastocapillary system as a whole is not; this emphasizes the\nconnection between stability and the coupling of elastic and capillary forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 13:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Our results for Abell 65 confirm recent work\nshowing that it has a close, cool binary companion, though several of our model\nparameters disagree with the recently published values. With our longer time\nbaseline of photometric observations from 1989--2009 we also provide a more\nprecise orbital period of 1.0037577 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 14:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

In previous papers, we studied the\ndetectability of such planets around the Sun seen as an edge-on star. For that\npurpose, we computed the RV and photometric variations induced by solar\nmagnetic activity, using all active structures observed over one entire cycle.\nOur goal is to perform similar studies on stars with different physical and\ngeometrical properties. As a first step, we focus on Sun-like stars seen with\nvarious inclinations, and on estimating detection capabilities with forthcoming\ninstruments. To do so, we first parameterize the solar active structures with\nthe most realistic pattern so as to obtain results consistent with the observed\nones. We simulate the growth, evolution and decay of solar spots, faculae and\nnetwork, using parameters and empiric laws derived from solar observations and\nliterature. We generate the corresponding structure lists over a full solar\ncycle. We then build the resulting spectra and deduce the RV and photometric\nvariations for a `Sun' seen with various inclinations. The produced RV signal\ntakes into account the photometric contribution of structures as well as the\nattenuation of the convective blueshift. The comparison between our simulated\nactivity pattern and the observed one validates our model. We show that the\ninclination of the stellar rotation axis has a significant impact on the time\nseries. RV long-term amplitudes as well as short-term jitters are significantly\nreduced when going from edge-on to pole-on configurations. Assuming spin-orbit\nalignment, the optimal configuration for planet detection is an inclined star\n(i~45{\\deg}).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 15:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

The new\ncontributions are chiral in that they act in opposite directions in plasmas\ncontaining an excess of left- or right-handed quarks and in that they are\nproportional to the coefficient of the axial anomaly. These new contributions\nto the drag force act either parallel to or antiparallel to an external\nmagnetic field or to the vorticity of the fluid plasma. In all these respects,\nthese contributions to the drag force felt by a heavy quark are analogous to\nthe chiral magnetic effect on light quarks. However, the new contribution to\nthe drag force is independent of the electric charge of the heavy quark and is\nthe same for heavy quarks and antiquarks. We show that although the chiral drag\nforce can be non-vanishing for heavy quarks that are at rest in the local fluid\nrest frame, it does vanish for heavy quarks that are at rest in a suitably\nchosen frame. In this frame, the heavy quark at rest sees counterpropagating\nmomentum and charge currents, both proportional to the axial anomaly\ncoefficient, but feels no drag force. This provides strong concrete evidence\nfor the absence of dissipation in chiral transport, something that has been\npredicted previously via consideration of symmetries. Along the way to our\nprincipal results, we provide a general calculation of the corrections to the\ndrag force due to the presence of gradients in the flowing fluid in the\npresence of a nonzero chemical potential. We close with a consequence of our\nresult that is at least in principle observable in heavy ion collisions, namely\nan anticorrelation between the direction of the CME current for light quarks in\na given event and the direction of the kick given to the momentum of all the\nheavy quarks and antiquarks in that event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 15:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 11:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-30"}

Belief function theories\n(e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been\nshown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the\nquantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete\ninformation set. For decision making, the pignistic (from the Latin pignus, a\nbet) probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs\nor basic belief assignments (BBAs) to make decisions. For many systems, one\nneed only address the most-probable elements in the set. For some critical\nsystems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe\nprobability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to\ndecision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above\nthe risk decision threshold. The problem is greatly simplified if most of the\nprobabilities fall below this threshold. Finding a probability transform that\nproperly represents mixes of low- and high-probability events is essential.\nThis article introduces four new pignistic probability transforms with an\nimplementation that uses the latest values of Beliefs, Plausibilities, or BBAs\nto improve the pignistic probability estimates. Some of them assign smaller\nvalues of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets\npignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger\nvalues of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability\ntransforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the\nvalues below the risk threshold. A probability information content (PIC)\nvariable is also introduced that assigns an information content value to any\nset of probability. Four operators are defined to help simplify the\nderivations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 12:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

For appropriately chosen source pairs, we\nshow that full waveform array measurements can be recovered from such intensity\nmeasurements by solving a linear least squares problem. The least squares\nsolution can be used to image with Kirchhoff migration, even if the solution is\ndetermined only up to a known one-dimensional nullspace. The same imaging\nstrategy can be used when the medium is probed with point sources driven by\ncorrelated Gaussian processes and autocorrelations are measured at a single\nlocation. Since autocorrelations are robust to noise, this can be used for\nimaging when the probing wave is drowned in background noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 21:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}

This new approach is based on the\nidea that the price dispersion has its origin in the dynamics of the purchase\nprocess. The price dispersion is determined by the chance that demanded and\nsupplied product units meet in a given price interval. It can be characterized\nby a fat-tailed Laplace distribution for short and by a lognormal distribution\nfor long time horizons. Taking random temporal variations of demanded and\nsupplied units into account both the mean price and also the standard deviation\nof the price dispersion are governed by a lognormal distribution. A comparison\nwith empirical investigations confirms the model statements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 11:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-04"}
