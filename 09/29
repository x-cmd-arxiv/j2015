Attempts to find\nlimits on its redshift include three estimations by modeling gamma-ray\nobservations, and one obtained by analyzing Lyb and Lyg absorption lines\nobserved in the far-UV spectra (from HST/COS) caused by absorbing gas along the\nline of sight. They allowed to constrain the redshift range to 0:6<z<1:19,\nwhich places PKS 1424+240 in the very interesting condition to be one of the\nfew candidates to be the most distant blazars detected at very-high-energy\ngamma rays. Redshift determination of BL-Lac objects are difficult to achieve.\nWe have found that redshift of blazars can be determined by its association to\na galaxy group or cluster. To explore this possibility for PKS 1424+240, we\nhave carried out spectroscopic measurements with the Gemini North telescope of\ngalaxies in its field of view. In this work we present the optical spectrum of\nPKS 1424+240 and show preliminary results of the blazar environment\ncharacterization.

Conventional appearance-based trackers are using increasingly more\ncomplex features in order to be robust. However, complex representations\ntypically not only require more computation for feature extraction, but also\nmake the state inference complicated. We show that with a careful feature\nselection scheme, extremely simple yet discriminative features can be used for\nrobust object tracking. The central component of the proposed method is a\nsuccinct and discriminative representation of the object using discriminative\nnon-orthogonal binary subspace (DNBS) which is spanned by Haar-like features.\nThe DNBS representation inherits the merits of the original NBS in that it\nefficiently describes the object. It also incorporates the discriminative\ninformation to distinguish foreground from background. However, the problem of\nfinding the DNBS bases from an over-complete dictionary is NP-hard. We propose\na greedy algorithm called discriminative optimized orthogonal matching pursuit\n(D-OOMP) to solve this problem. An iterative formulation named iterative D-OOMP\nis further developed to drastically reduce the redundant computation between\niterations and a hierarchical selection strategy is integrated for reducing the\nsearch space of features. The proposed DNBS representation is applied to object\ntracking through SSD-based template matching. We validate the effectiveness of\nour method through extensive experiments on challenging videos with comparisons\nagainst several state-of-the-art trackers and demonstrate its capability to\ntrack objects in clutter and moving background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 16:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

Two recent\nmethodologies suggest that the controllability of complex systems can be\npredicted solely from the graph of interactions between variables, without\nconsidering their dynamics: structural controllability and minimum dominating\nsets. We demonstrate that such structure-only methods fail to characterize\ncontrollability when dynamics are introduced. We study Boolean network\nensembles of network motifs as well as three models of biochemical regulation:\nthe segment polarity network in Drosophila melanogaster, the cell cycle of\nbudding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the floral organ arrangement in\nArabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that structure-only methods both\nundershoot and overshoot the number and which sets of critical variables best\ncontrol the dynamics of these models, highlighting the importance of the actual\nsystem dynamics in determining control. Our analysis further shows that the\nlogic of automata transition functions, namely how canalizing they are, plays\nan important role in the extent to which structure predicts dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 17:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 17:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

[Aim:] Given our doubt about whether the observed\nphenomenon is a coincidence, this study tries to investigate if an increase in\nproduct complexity can result in the abovementioned counter-intuitive trend in\nsoftware development projects.

However, it creates\nenormous confusion and frustration, particularly in the context of geographic\ninformation science, because of scale-related issues such as image resolution,\nand the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). This paper argues that the\nconfusion and frustration mainly arise from Euclidean geometric thinking, with\nwhich locations, directions, and sizes are considered absolute, and it is time\nto reverse this conventional thinking. Hence, we review fractal geometry,\ntogether with its underlying way of thinking, and compare it to Euclidean\ngeometry. Under the paradigm of Euclidean geometry, everything is measurable,\nno matter how big or small. However, geographic features, due to their fractal\nnature, are essentially unmeasurable or their sizes depend on scale. For\nexample, the length of a coastline, the area of a lake, and the slope of a\ntopographic surface are all scale-dependent. Seen from the perspective of\nfractal geometry, many scale issues, such as the MAUP, are inevitable. They\nappear unsolvable, but can be dealt with. To effectively deal with\nscale-related issues, we introduce topological and scaling analyses based on\nstreet-related concepts such as natural streets, street blocks, and natural\ncities. We further contend that spatial heterogeneity, or the fractal nature of\ngeographic features, is the first and foremost effect of two spatial\nproperties, because it is general and universal across all scales.\n  Keywords: Scaling, spatial heterogeneity, conundrum of length, MAUP,\ntopological analysis\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 18:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 10:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 20:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

The key tool is an efficient approximation of the Milstein term by\nparticularly tailored nested derivative-free terms. For the resulting\nderivative-free Milstein scheme the computational cost is, in general,\nconsiderably reduced by some power. Further, a rigorous computational cost\nmodel is considered and the so called effective order of convergence is\nintroduced which allows to directly compare various numerical schemes in terms\nof their efficiency. As the main result, we prove for a broad class of\nstochastic partial differential equations, including equations with operators\nthat do not need to be pointwise multiplicative, that the effective order of\nconvergence of the proposed derivative-free Milstein scheme is significantly\nhigher than for the original Milstein scheme. In this case, the derivative-free\nMilstein scheme outperforms the Euler scheme as well as the original Milstein\nscheme due to the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, we present some\nnumerical examples that confirm the theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 18:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Aug 2018 09:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

In contrast very few results for\nbipartite systems whose subsystems are of arbitrary dimensions, are known. This\nis because a rich variety of (algebraic or geometric) structure is exhibited by\ndifferent sets of orthogonal states owing to which it is difficult to associate\nsome common property underlying them all, i.e., a common property that would\nplay a crucial role in the local distinguishability of these states.

On a theoretical\nground, the response of gas to a bar is generally thought to cause nuclear\nstarbursts and, possibly, AGN activity once the perturbed gas reaches the\ncentral super-massive black hole. By means of high resolution numerical\nsimulations we detail the purely dynamical effects that a forming bar exerts on\nthe gas of an isolated disc galaxy. The galaxy is initially unstable to the\nformation of non-axisymmetric structures, and within 1 Gyr it develops spiral\narms that eventually evolve into a central stellar bar on kpc scale. A first\nmajor episode of gas inflow occurs during the formation of the spiral arms\nwhile at later times, when the stellar bar is establishing, a low density\nregion is carved between the bar co-rotational and inner Lindblad resonance\nradii. The development of such \"dead zone\" inhibits further massive gas\ninflows. Indeed, the gas inflow reaches its maximum during the relatively fast\nbar formation phase and not, as often assumed, when the bar is fully formed. We\nconclude that the low efficiency of long-lived, evolved bars in driving gas\ntoward galactic nuclei is the reason why observational studies have failed to\nestablish an indisputable link between bars and AGNs. On the other hand, the\nhigh efficiency in driving strong gas inflows of the intrinsically transient\nprocess of bar formation suggests that the importance of bars as drivers of AGN\nactivity in disc galaxies has been overlooked so far.

Such models generally assume the existence of\nStandard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later\nconsequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that\nDM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is\ngenerated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not\nnecessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially\nleads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by\nthe late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM\nrelic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would\ntake for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call\nFlooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling\nand hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter\ncontent of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We\nalso show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,\nrelaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the\nimplications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has\ninteresting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and\nbaryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.\nAlternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis\nimplementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time\nreheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of\na lepton asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 20:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 02:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The spectra can be mostly fitted with two different components: a warm\ncomponent with kT=0.3--0.6 keV and a dominant hot component with kT~3 keV. The\nemission measure of the dominant, hot component is not inversely proportional\nto the distance between the two stars. This can be explained by the O star wind\ncolliding before it has reached its terminal velocity, leading to a reduction\nin its wind momentum flux. At phases closer to periastron, we discovered a cool\nplasma component in a recombining phase, which is less absorbed. This component\nmay be a relic of the wind-wind collision plasma, which was cooled down by\nradiation, and may represent a transitional stage in dust formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 20:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

We show that when the objective function is\nnondecreasing and submodular, the $k$-batch greedy strategy satisfies a\nharmonic bound $1/(1+\\alpha_k)$ for a general matroid constraint and an\nexponential bound $\\left(1-(1-{\\alpha}_k/{t})^t\\right)/{\\alpha}_k$ for a\nuniform matroid constraint, where $k$ divides the cardinality of the maximal\nset in the general matroid, $t=K/k$ is an integer, and $K$ is the rank of the\nuniform matroid. We also compare the performance of the $k$-batch greedy\nstrategy with that of the $k_1$-batch greedy strategy when $k_1$ divides $k$.\nSpecifically, we prove that when the objective function is nondecreasing and\nsubmodular, the $k$-batch greedy strategy has better harmonic and exponential\nbounds in terms of the total curvature. Finally, we illustrate our results by\nconsidering a task-assignment problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 21:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 21:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 21:27:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 02:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

GNA finds large conserved regions and produces a\none-to-one node mapping. Given the different outputs of LNA and GNA, when a new\nNA method is proposed, it is compared against existing methods from the same\ncategory. However, both NA categories have the same goal: to allow for\ntransferring functional knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between\nconserved network regions. So, which one to choose, LNA or GNA? To answer this,\nwe introduce the first systematic evaluation of the two NA categories.\n  We introduce new measures of alignment quality that allow for fair comparison\nof the different LNA and GNA outputs, as such measures do not exist.

First, we calculate entropy production in\nhealthy lungs by applying the laws of thermodynamics to the well-known\ntranspulmonary pressure-volume ($P-V$) curves of the lung under the assumption\nthat lung tissue behaves as an entropy spring-like rubber. The bulk modulus,\n$B$, of the lung is also derived from these calculations. Second, we extend\nthis approach to elastic recoil disorders of the lung such as occur in\npulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. These diseases are characterized by\nparticular alterations in the $P-V$ relationship. For example, in fibrotic\nlungs $B$ increases monotonically with disease progression, while in emphysema\nthe opposite occurs. These diseases can thus be mimicked simply by making\nappropriate adjustments to the parameters of the $P-V$ curve. Using Clausius's\nformalism, we show that entropy production, $\\Delta S$, is related to the\nhysteresis area, $\\Delta A$, enclosed by the $P-V$ curve during a breathing\ncycle, namely, $\\Delta S=\\Delta A/T$, where $T$ is the body temperature.\nAlthough $\\Delta A$ is highly dependent on the disease, such formula applies to\nhealthy as well as diseased lungs, regardless of the disease stage. Finally, we\nuse {\\it ansatzs} to predict analytically the entropy produced by the fibrotic\nand emphysematous lungs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 02:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-29"}

String searching\nhas been extensively studied since the inception of computer science.\nIncreasingly many applications have to deal with imprecise strings or strings\nwith fuzzy information in them. String matching becomes a probabilistic event\nwhen a string contains uncertainty, i.e. each position of the string can have\ndifferent probable characters with associated probability of occurrence for\neach character. Such uncertain strings are prevalent in various applications\nsuch as biological sequence data, event monitoring and automatic ECG\nannotations. We explore the problem of indexing uncertain strings to support\nefficient string searching. In this paper we consider two basic problems of\nstring searching, namely substring searching and string listing. In substring\nsearching, the task is to find the occurrences of a deterministic string in an\nuncertain string. We formulate the string listing problem for uncertain\nstrings, where the objective is to output all the strings from a collection of\nstrings, that contain probable occurrence of a deterministic query string.\nIndexing solution for both these problems are significantly more challenging\nfor uncertain strings than for deterministic strings. Given a construction time\nprobability value $\\tau$, our indexes can be constructed in linear space and\nsupports queries in near optimal time for arbitrary values of probability\nthreshold parameter greater than $\\tau$. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first indexing solution for searching in uncertain strings that achieves\nstrong theoretical bound and supports arbitrary values of probability threshold\nparameter. We also propose an approximate substring search index that can\nanswer substring search queries with an additive error in optimal time.

Until now, the most used method of\nprediction involving tens of TNOs/Centaurs was to consider a constant offset\nfor the right ascension and for the declination with respect to a reference\nephemeris. This offset is determined as the difference between the most recent\nobservations of the TNO and the reference ephemeris. This method can be\nsuccessfully applied when the offset remains constant with time. This paper\npresents an alternative method of prediction based on a new accurate orbit\ndetermination procedure, which uses all the available positions of the TNO from\nthe Minor Planet Center database plus sets of new astrometric positions from\nunpublished observations. The orbit determination is performed through a\nnumerical integration procedure (NIMA), in which we develop a specific\nweighting scheme. The NIMA method was applied for 51 selected TNOs/Centaurs.\nFor this purpose, we have performed about 2900 new observations during\n2007-2014. Using NIMA, we succeed in predicting the stellar occultations of 10\nTNOs and 3 Centaurs between 2013 and 2015. By comparing the NIMA and JPL\nephemerides, we highlighted the variation of the offset between them with time.\nGiving examples, we show that the constant offset method could not accurately\npredict 6 out of the 13 observed positive occultations successfully predicted\nby NIMA. The results indicate that NIMA is capable of efficiently refine the\norbits of these bodies. Finally, we show that the astrometric positions given\nby positive occultations can help to further refine the orbit of the TNO and\nconsequently the future predictions. We also provide the unpublished\nobservations of the 51 selected TNOs and their ephemeris in a usable format by\nthe SPICE library.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 10:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

In spite of its large cross section, the\nCEvNS process has never been observed, due to tiny energies of the resulting\nnuclear recoils which are out of reach for standard neutrino detectors. The\nmeasurement of CEvNS has now become feasible, thanks to the development of\nultra-sensitive technology for rare decay and weakly-interacting massive\nparticle (dark matter) searches. The CEvNS cross section is cleanly predicted\nin the standard model; hence its measurement provides a standard model test. It\nis relevant for supernova physics and supernova-neutrino detection, and enables\nvalidation of dark-matter detector background and detector-response models. In\nthe long term, precision measurement of CEvNS will address questions of nuclear\nstructure. COHERENT will deploy multiple detector technologies in a phased\napproach: a 14-kg CsI[Na] scintillating crystal, 15 kg of p-type point-contact\ngermanium detectors, and 100 kg of liquid xenon in a two-phase time projection\nchamber. Following an extensive background measurement campaign, a location in\nthe SNS basement has proven to be neutron-quiet and suitable for deployment of\nthe COHERENT detector suite. The simultaneous deployment of the three COHERENT\ndetector subsystems will test the $N^2$ dependence of the cross section and\nensure an unambiguous discovery of CEvNS.

It has been also argued that, in these conditions, the best candidate\nparticle acceleration mechanism is efficient reconnection of magnetic field\nlines, for which it is predicted that magnetic field and accelerated\nrelativistic electron energy densities are in equipartition.Through the\nmodeling of the jet non--thermal emission, we explore if equipartition is\nindeed possible in BL Lac objects, i.e. low-power blazars with weak or absent\nbroad emission lines.

As a consequence, the jet kinetic power largely exceeds the magnetic\npower.

One would map draws from an\neasy-to-sample distribution $\\pi_{0}$ to the target distribution $\\pi_{1}$\nusing this transport map. Although it is usually impossible to obtain an\nexplicit transport map for complex target distributions, we show here how to\nbuild a tractable approximation of a novel transport map. This is achieved by\nmoving samples from $\\pi_{0}$ using an ordinary differential equation with a\nvelocity field that depends on the full conditional distributions of the\ntarget. Even when this ordinary differential equation is time-discretized and\nthe full conditional distributions are numerically approximated, the resulting\ndistribution of mapped samples can be efficiently evaluated and used as a\nproposal within sequential Monte Carlo samplers. We demonstrate significant\ngains over state-of-the-art sequential Monte Carlo samplers at a fixed\ncomputational complexity on a variety of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 14:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2015 22:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

However, STT-MRAMs suffer from poor reliability due\nto shared read and write paths. Additionally, conflicting requirements for data\nretention and write-ability (both related to the energy barrier height of the\nmagnet) makes design more challenging. Furthermore, the energy barrier height\ndepends on the physical dimensions of the free layer. Any variations in the\ndimensions of the free layer lead to variations in the energy barrier height.\nIn order to address poor reliability of STT-MRAMs, usage of Error Correcting\nCodes (ECC) have been proposed. Unlike traditional CMOS memory technologies,\nECC is expected to correct both soft and hard errors in STT_MRAMs. To achieve\nacceptable yield with low write power, stronger ECC is required, resulting in\nincreased number of encoded bits and degraded memory efficiency.

Steering is relevant for one-sided device-independent key\ndistribution, the realistic implementations of which necessitate the study of\nnoisy scenarios. So far mainly the case of imperfect detection efficiency has\nbeen considered; here we look at the effect of dynamical noise responsible for\ndecoherence and dissipation. In order to set up the optimisation, we map the\nsteering problem into the equivalent joint measurability problem, and employ\nquantum resource-theoretic robustness monotones from that context. The\nadvantage is that incompatibility (hence steerability) with arbitrary pairs of\nnoisy qubit measurements has been completely characterised through an\nanalytical expression, which can be turned into a computable cost function with\nexact gradient. Furthermore, dynamical loss of incompatibility has recently\nbeen illustrated using these monotones. We demonstrate resource control\nnumerically using a special gradient-based software, showing, in particular,\nthe advantage over naive control with cost function chosen as a fidelity in\nrelation to a specific target.

The variability that the\nstochasticity provides to the deterministic steady state solutions (perennial\nand seasonal ice states) is illustrated by examining both the stochastic paths\nand probability density functions (PDFs). The principal stochastic moments\n(standard deviation, mean and skewness) are calculated and compared with those\ndetermined from a stochastic perturbation theory described previously by Moon\nand Wettlaufer (2013). We examine in detail the competing roles of the\ndestabilizing sea ice-albedo-feedback and the stabilizing long-wave radiative\nloss contributions to the variability of the ice cover under increased\ngreenhouse-gas forcing. In particular, the variability of the stochastic paths\nat the end of summer shows a clear maximum, which is due to the combination of\nthe increasing importance of the albedo-feedback and its associated \"memory\neffect\" that accumulates from early spring to late summer. This is\ncounterbalanced by the stabilization of the ice cover due to the longwave loss\nof energy from the ice surface, which is enhanced during winter, thereby\nfocusing the stochastic paths and decreasing the variability in winter. The\norganizing principle for the interpretation of these effects is a generalized\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process with a time dependent potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2015 13:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 09:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}
