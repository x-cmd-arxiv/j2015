Technically, this paper\nintroduces and studies the class of semi-galois categories, which extend galois\ncategories and are dual to profinite monoids in the same way as galois\ncategories are dual to profinite groups; the study on this class of categories\nis aimed at providing an axiomatic reformulation of Eilenberg's theory of\nvarieties of regular languages--- a branch in formal language theory that has\nbeen developed since the mid 1960's and particularly concerns systematic\nclassification of regular languages, finite monoids, and deterministic finite\nautomata.

Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important challenge\nfor the Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, it\nis helpful to automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents\nsuch as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal\nstop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident\ndetection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an\nautomated tool for further classification. In literature, there is a lack of\nresearch for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC\nmethod is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed\nmethod, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and\nconverted as spatial-temporal (ST) signals. Based on the characteristics of the\nST signals, a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an\nextended big traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a\nMean-Shift filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract\nsignificant features from the ST signals. The extracted features are then\nassociated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and\nmultiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive\nboosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data\nautomatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted\nto train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this\nhybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM)\nmethod. Experimental results show that the proposed AB-SVM method achieves a\nsatisfied result with more than 92% classification accuracy on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 16:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 08:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

We discuss two classes of\nACLCs: (i) externally driven ACLCs, in which the motion of colloidal particles\nis powered by an externally applied electric field, and (ii) internally driven\nACLCs, formed by self-propelled particles such as bacteria. The liquid crystal\n(LC) medium is of a thermotropic type in the first case and lyotropic (water\nbased) in the second case. In the absence of external fields and self-propelled\nparticles, the ACLCs are inactive, with the equilibrium LC state exhibiting\nlong-range orientational order. The external electric field causes ACLCs of\ntype (i) to experience translations, rotations, and orbiting, powered by\nmechanisms such as LC-enabled electrokinetics, Quincke rotations and entrapment\nat the defects of LC order. A dense system of Quincke rotators, orbiting along\ncircularly shaped smectic defects, undergoes a transition into a collective\ncoherent orbiting when their activity increases. An example of internally\ndriven ACLCs of type (ii) is living liquid crystals, representing swimming\nbacteria placed in an otherwise passive lyotropic chromonic LC. The LC strongly\naffects many aspects of bacterial behavior, most notably by shaping their\ntrajectories. As the concentration of bacteria and their activity increase, the\norientational order of living liquid crystals experiences two-stage\ninstability: first, the uniform steady equilibrium director is replaced with a\nperiodic bend deformation, then, at higher activity, pairs of positive and\nnegative disclinations nucleate, separate, and annihilate in dynamic patterns\nof topological turbulence. The ACLCs are contrasted to their isotropic\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 16:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

Despite their very puzzling\nabundance patterns, very few detailed spectroscopic studies existed up to a few\nyears ago, preventing any clear understanding of the wGb phenomenon. We\nrecently proposed the first consistent analysis of published data for 28 wGb\nstars and identified them as descendants of early A-type to late B-type stars,\nwithout being able to conclude on their evolutionary status or the origin of\ntheir peculiar abundance pattern.\n  We used newly obtained high-resolution and high SNR spectra for 19 wGb stars\nin the southern and northern hemisphere to homogeneously derive their\nfundamental parameters, metallicities, as well as the spectroscopic abundances\nfor Li, C, N, O, Na, Sr, and Ba. We also computed dedicated stellar evolution\nmodels that we used to determine the masses and to investigate the evolutionary\nstatus and chemical history of the stars in our sample. We confirm that the wGb\nstars are stars in the mass range 3.2 to 4.2 M$_\\odot$. We suggest that a large\nfraction could be mildly evolved stars on the SGB currently undergoing the 1st\nDUP, while a smaller number of stars are more probably in the core He burning\nphase at the clump. After analysing their abundance pattern, we confirm their\nstrong N enrichment anti-correlated with large C depletion, characteristic of\nmaterial fully processed through the CNO cycle to an extent not known in other\nevolved intermediate-mass stars. However, we demonstrate here that such a\npattern is very unlikely due to self-enrichment. In the light of the current\nobservational constraints, no solid self-consistent pollution scenario can be\npresented either, leaving the wGb puzzle largely unsolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 17:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The factors affecting the performance of\nthis restoration are how much prior information about an image and a blur\nkernel are provided and what algorithm is used to perform the restoration task.\nPrior information on images is often employed to restore the sharpness of the\nedges of an image. By contrast, no consensus is still present regarding what\nprior information to use in restoring from a blur kernel due to complex image\nblurring processes. In this paper, we propose modelling of a blur kernel as a\nsparse linear combinations of basic 2-D patterns. Our approach has a\ncompetitive edge over the existing blur kernel modelling methods because our\nmethod has the flexibility to customize the dictionary design, which makes it\nwell-adaptive to a variety of applications. As a demonstration, we construct a\ndictionary formed by basic patterns derived from the Kronecker product of\nGaussian sequences. We also compare our results with those derived by other\nstate-of-the-art methods, in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 17:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

The observations were triggered by an outburst in 2015 April\nseen at GeV energies with the Large Area Telescope on board Fermi.\nMulti-wavelength observations suggest a subdivision of the high state into two\ndistinct flux states. In the band covered by MAGIC, the variability time scale\nis estimated to be 6.4 +/- 1.9 days. Modeling the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution with an external Compton model, the location of the emitting\nregion is understood as originating in the jet outside the broad line region\n(BLR) during the period of high activity, while being partially within the BLR\nduring the period of low (typical) activity.

We revised the properties of candidate transiting planets using the\nstellar parameters, high-resolution imaging to identify companion stars, and,\nin the case of binaries, fitting light curves to identify the likely planet\nhost. In 49 of 54 systems we validated the primary as the host star. We\ninferred the intrinsic distribution of M dwarf planets using the method of\niterative Monte Carlo simulation. We compared several models of planet orbital\ngeometry and clustering and found that one where planets are exponentially\ndistributed and almost precisely coplanar best describes the distribution of\nmulti-planet systems. We determined that $Kepler$ M dwarfs host an average of\n$2.2 \\pm 0.3$ planets with radii of 1-4$R_{\\oplus}$ and orbital periods of\n1.5-180 d. The radius distribution peaks at $\\sim 1.2R_{\\oplus}$ and is\nessentially zero at $4R_{\\oplus}$, although we identify three giant planet\ncandidates other than the previously confirmed Kepler-45b. There is suggestive\nbut not significant evidence that the radius distribution varies with orbital\nperiod. The distribution with logarithmic orbital period is flat except for a\ndecline for orbits less than a few days.

To explore the resulting\ninterplay between active and polymeric dynamics, we first generalise a linear\nstability analysis (from earlier studies without polymer) to derive criteria\nfor the onset of spontaneous heterogeneous flows (strain rate) and/or\ndeformations (strain). We find two modes of instability. The first is a viscous\nmode, associated with strain rate perturbations. It dominates for relatively\nsmall values of $\\tau_C$ and is a simple generalisation of the instability\nknown previously without polymer. The second is an elastomeric mode, associated\nwith strain perturbations, which dominates at large $\\tau_C$ and persists even\nas $\\tau_C\\to\\infty$. We explore the novel dynamical states to which these\ninstabilities lead by means of direct numerical simulations. These reveal\noscillatory shear-banded states in 1D, and activity-driven turbulence in 2D\neven in the elastomeric limit $\\tau_C\\to\\infty$. Adding polymer can also have\ncalming effects, increasing the net throughput of spontaneous flow along a\nchannel in a new type of \"drag-reduction\". Finally the effect of including\nstrong, antagonistic coupling between nematic and polymer is examined\nnumerically, revealing a rich array of spontaneously flowing states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 18:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

For instance, the\nconformal window in the six dimensional theory is at Nf = 16 for the SU(3)\ncolour group. The critical theory structure is similar to that of an O(N)\nscalar theory in eight dimensions. Using the large N expansion the latter is\nshown to be in the same universality class as the Heisenberg ferromagnet.\nSimilarly using the large Nf expansion, six dimensional QCD is shown to be in\nthe same class as the two dimensional non-abelian Thirring model and four\ndimensional QCD.

The former\nis formulated by considering Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) systems with the\ndiscrete action being constructed through numerical approximations of the\naction integral. The latter derives the discrete Euler-Lagrange equations whose\nsolutions give the variational time integrator. In this paper, we build\nvariational time integrators in the context of smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH). So, we start with a variational formulation of SPH for fluids. Then, we\napply the generalized midpoint rule, which depends on a parameter $\\alpha$, in\norder to generate the discrete action. Then, the step (b) yields a variational\ntime integration scheme that reduces to a known explicit one if\n$\\alpha\\in\\{0,1\\}$ but it is implicit otherwise. Hence, we design a fixed point\niterative method to approximate the solution and prove its convergence\ncondition. Besides, we show that the obtained discrete Euler-Lagrange equations\npreserve linear momentum. In the experimental results, we consider artificial\nviscous as well as boundary interaction effects and simulate a dam breaking set\nup.

The\npresence of a DZ naturally leads to conditions susceptible to the Rossby wave\ninstability (RWI), which produces vortices and spiral density waves that may\nrevive the DZ and be responsible for observed large-scale disc structures. We\npresent a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the\nrole of the RWI in DZs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of the\ndisc and its morphology. The nonlinear RWI can generate Reynolds stresses\n(effective $\\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the DZ, helping to\nsustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. It also produces novel disc\nmorphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypical\nvortex shapes. The angular momentum transport strength and morphology are most\nsensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the DZ and the disc\nviscosity. The largest Reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent of\nthe DZ is less than its distance to the central star. Such narrow DZs lead to a\nsingle vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. The\nedges of wider DZs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices and\nreduced angular momentum transport efficiency. In either case, we find that,\nbecause of the Reynolds stresses generated by the nonlinear RWI, gravitational\ninstability is unlikely to play a role in angular momentum transport across the\nDZ, unless the accretion rate is sufficiently high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 18:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In particular, we first train a linear\nclassifier on the labeled data, then define a loss for the autoencoder with the\nweights learned from the linear classifier. To reduce the bias brought by one\nsingle classifier, we define a posterior probability distribution on the\nweights of the classifier, and derive the marginalized loss of the autoencoder\nwith Laplace approximation.

We are particularly interested in cases where the cost of\neach likelihood evaluation (forward-model call) is expensive and the number of\nun- known (latent) variables is high. This is the setting in many problems in\ncom- putational physics where forward models with nonlinear PDEs are used and\nthe parameters to be calibrated involve spatio-temporarily varying\ncoefficients, which upon discretization give rise to a high-dimensional vector\nof unknowns. One of the consequences of the well-documented ill-posedness of\ninverse prob- lems is the possibility of multiple solutions. While such\ninformation is contained in the posterior density in Bayesian formulations, the\ndiscovery of a single mode, let alone multiple, is a formidable task.

Mechanisms of this type of neuroinflammation are\nstill not understood well. Recent experimental and theoretical results point\nout possible role of the diffusion species in this process. The paper considers\na model of anomalous diffusion occurring in the glial scar around a chronic\nimplant in two simple geometries -- a separable rectilinear electrode and a\ncylindrical electrode, which are solvable exactly. We describe a hypothetical\nextended source of diffusing species and study its concentration profile in\nsteady-state conditions. Diffusion transport is assumed to obey a\nfractional-order Fick law, which is derived from physically realistic\nassumptions using a fractional calculus approach. The derived fractional-order\ndistribution morphs into regular order diffusion in the case of integer\nfractional exponents. The model presented here demonstrates that accumulation\nof diffusing species can occur and the scar properties (i.e. tortuosity,\nfractional order, scar thickness) can influence such accumulation.

The effect relies on the interaction of magnetic\nfluctuations with a mean shear flow, meaning the saturated state of the\nsmall-scale dynamo can drive a large-scale dynamo -- in some sense the inverse\nof dynamo quenching. The dynamo is nonhelical, with the mean-field $\\alpha$\ncoefficient zero, and is caused by the interaction between an off-diagonal\ncomponent of the turbulent resistivity and the stretching of the large-scale\nfield by shear flow. Following up on previous numerical and analytic work, this\npaper presents further details of the numerical evidence for the effect, as\nwell as an heuristic description of how magnetic fluctuations can interact with\nshear flow to produce the required electromotive force. The pressure response\nof the fluid is fundamental to this mechanism, which helps explain why the\nmagnetic effect is stronger than its kinematic cousin, and the basic idea is\nrelated to the well-known lack of turbulent resistivity quenching by magnetic\nfluctuations. As well as being interesting for its applications to general high\nReynolds number astrophysical turbulence, where strong small-scale magnetic\nfluctuations are expected to be prevalent, the magnetic shear-current effect is\na likely candidate for large-scale dynamo in the unstratified regions of\nionized accretion disks.

These indicate the\nonset of turbulent convection in the common envelope, thus altering the\ntransport of energy on longer time scales.

Naturally, neighbouring stream stars reach pericentre at\nslightly different times. In the presence of a rotating bar, these neighbouring\nstream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage\nand hence each star receives a different torque from the bar. These differing\ntorques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the\nstream, which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream. For a progenitor\norbiting in the same sense as the bar's rotation and satisfying a resonance\ncondition, the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than\nexpected, depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur\nalong the bar's minor or major axis respectively. We present a full discussion\nof this phenomenon focusing mainly on streams confined to the Galactic plane.\nIn stark contrast with the evolution in static potentials, which give rise to\nstreams that grow steadily in time, rotating barred potentials can produce\ndynamically old, short streams. This challenges the traditional viewpoint that\nthe inner halo consists of well phase-mixed material whilst the\ntidally-disrupted structures in the outer halo are more spatially coherent.

We also simulate the halo with\nthermal 2.0 keV warm dark matter for comparison and discuss quantitative\ndifferences. We find that the resonantly produced sterile neutrino model for\nthe 3.55 keV line provides a good description of structures in the Local Group,\nincluding the number of satellite dwarf galaxies and their radial distribution,\nand largely mitigates the too-big-to-fail problem. Future searches for\nsatellite galaxies by deep surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey, Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope, and Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope, will be a\nstrong direct test of warm dark matter scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 21:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

Exploiting a sample of galaxies\nwith masses $M_\\ast>10^{9.8}M_\\odot$, drawn from the WIde-field Nearby\nGalaxy-cluster Survey (WINGS) and its recent extension OMEGAWINGS, we\ninvestigate the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$)\nin galaxy clusters at $0.04<z<0.07$.

Overall, we find agreement between the\nSFR-M$_*$ relation in the two environments, but detect a population of cluster\ngalaxies with reduced SFRs which is rare in the field. These {\\it transition}\ngalaxies are mainly found within the cluster virial radius ($R_{200}$) but they\nimpact on the SFR-M$_*$ relation only within 0.6R$_{200}$. The ratio of\ntransition to PSF galaxies strongly depends on environment, being larger than\n0.6 within 0.3R$_{200}$ and rapidly decreasing with distance, while it is\nalmost flat with $M_*$. As galaxies move downward from the SFR-M$_*$ main\nsequence, they become redder and present older luminosity and mass weighted\nages. These trends, together with the analysis of the star formation histories,\nsuggest that transition galaxies have had a reduced SFR for the past 2-5 Gyr.\nOur results are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction of galaxies\nwith the intracluster medium via strangulation causes a gradual shut down of\nstar formation, giving birth to an evolved population of galaxies in transition\nfrom being star forming to becoming passive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 21:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 11:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Using a suite of cosmological chemodynamical disc galaxy simulations,\nwe assess how (a) radial metallicity gradients evolve with scaleheight; (b) the\nvertical metallicity gradients change through the thick disc; and (c) the\nvertical gradient of the stellar rotation velocity varies through the disc. We\ncompare with the Milky Way to search for analogous trends. Methods. We analyse\nfive simulated spiral galaxies with masses comparable to the Milky Way. The\nsimulations span a range of star formation and energy feedback strengths and\nprescriptions, particle- and grid-based hydrodynamical implementations, as well\nas initial conditions/assembly history. Results. Consistently, we find that the\nsteeper, negative, radial metallicity gradients seen in the mid-plane flatten\nwith increasing height away from the plane. In simulations with stronger\n(and/or more spatially-extended) feedback, the negative radial gradients\ninvert, becoming positive for heights in excess of 1 kpc.

Our measurements of the\nvertical metallicity gradients show no clear correlation with galactocentric\nradius, and are in good agreement with those observed in the Milky Way's thick\ndisc (locally).

The inverted, positive, radial\nmetallicity gradients seen in the simulated thick stellar discs originate from\na population of younger, more metal-rich, stars formed in-situ, superimposed\nupon a background population of older migrators from the inner disc; the\ncontrast provided by the former increases radially, due to the inside-out\ngrowth of the disc.

Gas hydrates contribute to the strength and stiffness of\nthe hydrate-bearing sediments. During gas production, the geomechanical\nstability of the sediment is compromised. Due to the potential geotechnical\nrisks and process management issues, the mechanical behavior of the gas\nhydrate-bearing sediments needs to be carefully considered. In this study, we\ndescribe a coupling concept that simplifies the mathematical description of the\ncomplex interactions occuring during gas production by isolating the effects of\nsediment deformation and hydrate phase changes. Central to this coupling\nconcept is the assumption that the soil grains form the load-bearing solid\nskeleton, while the gas hydrate enhances the mechanical properties of this\nskeleton. We focus on testing this coupling concept in capturing the overall\nimpact of geomechanics on gas production behavior though numerical simulation\nof a high-pressure isotropic compression experiment combined with methane\nhydrate formation and dissociation. We consider a linear-elastic stress-strain\nrelationship because it is uniquely defined and easy to calibrate. Since, in\nreality, the geomechanical response of the hydrate bearing sediment is\ntypically inelastic and is characterized by a significant shear-volumetric\ncoupling, we control the experiment very carefully in order to keep the sample\ndeformations small and well within the assumptions of poro-elasticity.

A hierarchy of progressively coarser grids is\nconstructed that utilize complementary relaxation and interpolation operators.\nHigh-energy error is reduced by relaxation, while low-energy error is mapped to\ncoarse-grids and reduced there. However, large parallel communication costs\noften limit parallel scalability. As the multigrid hierarchy is formed, each\ncoarse matrix is formed through a triple matrix product. The resulting\ncoarse-grids often have significantly more nonzeros per row than the original\nfine-grid operator, thereby generating high parallel communication costs on\ncoarse-levels. In this paper, we introduce a method that systematically removes\nentries in coarse-grid matrices after the hierarchy is formed, leading to an\nimproved communication costs. We sparsify by removing weakly connected or\nunimportant entries in the matrix, leading to improved solve time. The main\ntrade-off is that if the heuristic identifying unimportant entries is used too\naggressively, then AMG convergence can suffer. To counteract this, the original\nhierarchy is retained, allowing entries to be reintroduced into the solver\nhierarchy if convergence is too slow. This enables a balance between\ncommunication cost and convergence, as necessary. In this paper we present new\nalgorithms for reducing communication and present a number of computational\nexperiments in support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 02:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

We\ngive a characterisation of how these embedded surfaces intersect with the\ntetrahedra of T. This is done by characterising isotopy classes of simple\nclosed loops in the 3-punctured disk. As a direct result we obtain a new system\nof coordinates for edge colourings which allows for simpler definitions of the\ntetrahedron weights incorporated in the Turaev-Viro invariants.\n  Moreover, building on a detailed analysis of the colourings, as well as\nclassical work due to Kirby and Melvin, Matveev, and others, we show that\nconsidering a much smaller set of colourings suffices to compute Turaev-Viro\ninvariants in certain significant cases. This results in a substantial\nimprovement of running times to compute the invariants, reducing the number of\ncolourings to consider by a factor of $2^n$. In addition, we present an\nalgorithm to compute Turaev-Viro invariants of degree four -- a problem known\nto be #P-hard -- which capitalises on the combinatorial structure of the input.\n  The improved algorithms are shown to be optimal in the following sense: There\nexist triangulations admitting all colourings the algorithms consider.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our new algorithms to compute Turaev-Viro\ninvariants are able to distinguish the majority of $\\mathbb{Z}$-homology\nspheres with complexity up to $11$ in $O(2^n)$ operations in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 04:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

We find that the instability survives interaction renormalization due\nto vertex corrections and discuss how this can be seen in experiments. We also\ntrack the renormalization group flows of the different couplings between the\nfermionic degrees of freedom, and find that there are no perturbative\ninstabilities, and that Stoner instability is the strongest instability which\noccurs at a critical threshold value of the interaction. The critical\ninteraction goes to zero as the chemical potential is tuned towards the band\nbottom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 09:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 08:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We made multi-wavelength observations\nwith high spatial resolution and high cadence using SDO/AIA, the IRIS\nspectrograph and the Hinode/SOT instrument. Along with spectropolarimetry\nprovided by the THEMIS telescope we have coverage of both optically thick\nemission lines and magnetic field information. AIA reveals that the two legs of\nthe prominence are strongly absorbing structures which look like they are\nrotating, or oscillating in the plane of the sky. The two prominence legs,\nwhich are both very bright in Ca II (SOT), are not visible in the IRIS Mg II\nslit-jaw images. This is explained by the large optical thickness of the\nstructures in Mg II which leads to reversed profiles, and hence to lower\nintegrated intensities at these locations than in the surroundings. Using lines\nformed at temperatures lower than 1 MK, we measure relatively low Doppler\nshifts on the order of +/- 10 km/s in the tornado-like structure. Between the\ntwo legs we see loops in Mg II, with material flowing from one leg to the\nother, as well as counterstreaming. It is difficult to interpret our data as\nshowing two rotating, vertical structures which are unrelated to the loops.\nThis kind of `tornado' scenario does not fit with our observations. The\nmagnetic field in the two legs of the prominence is found to be preferentially\nhorizontal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 11:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

We assume\nthat the number of emitting spots, which defines an apparent formal area\nefficiency of CFE surfaces, depends on the macroscopic electric field.\nNon-uniformity is described by local enhancement factors\n$\\left\\{\\gamma_j\\right\\}$, which are randomly assigned to each distinct emitter\nof a conducting CFE surface, from a discrete probability distribution\n$\\rho{(\\gamma_{j})}$, with $j=1,2$.

That threat is\nroutinely thwarted by having invigilators ensure that candidates do not\nmisbehave during testing. However, as recent exam scandals confirm, also\ninvigilators and exam authorities may have interest in frauds, hence they may\npose security threats as well. Moreover, new security issues arise from the\nrecent use of computers, which can facilitate the exam experience for example\nby allowing candidates to register from home. Thus, exams must be designed with\nthe care normally devoted to security protocols.\n  This dissertation studies exam protocol security and provides an in-depth\nunderstanding that can be also useful for the study of the security of similar\nsystems, such as personnel selections, project reviews, and conference\nmanagement systems. It introduces an unambiguous terminology that leads to the\nspecification of a taxonomy of various exam types, depending on the level of\ncomputer assistance. It then establishes a theoretical framework for the formal\nanalysis of exams. The framework defines several authentication, privacy, and\nverifiability requirements that modern exams should meet, and enables the\nsecurity of exam protocols to be studied. Using the framework, we formally\nanalyse traditional, computer-assisted, and Internet-based exam protocols. We\nfind some security issues and propose modifications to partially achieve the\ndesired requirements.\n  This dissertation also designs three novel exam protocols that guarantee a\nwide set of security requirements.\n  Finally, this dissertation looks at exams as carried out through modern\nbrowsers.

However,\nthis yields a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, for which we\npropose a three-stage robust group sparse beamforming algorithm. In the first\nstage, a quadratic variational formulation of the weighted mixed l1/l2-norm is\nproposed to induce the group-sparsity structure in the aggregated beamforming\nvector, which indicates those RRHs that can be switched off.

Finally, the semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR) technique is adopted to determine the robust multicast beamformers.\nSimulation results will demonstrate the convergence of the perturbed\nalternating optimization algorithm, as well as, the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm to minimize the network power consumption for multicast\nCloud-RAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 13:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

By\nmoving the signal processing functionality to a single baseband unit (BBU)\npool, centralized signal processing and resource allocation are enabled in\nCloud-RAN, thereby providing the promise of improving the energy efficiency via\neffective network adaptation and interference management. In this paper, we\npropose a holistic sparse optimization framework to design green Cloud-RAN by\ntaking into consideration the power consumption of the fronthaul links,\nmulticast services, as well as user admission control. Specifically, we first\nidentify the sparsity structures in the solutions of both the network power\nminimization and user admission control problems. However, finding the optimal\nsparsity structures turns out to be NP-hard, with the coupled challenges of the\nl0-norm based objective functions and the nonconvex quadratic QoS constraints\ndue to multicast beamforming. In contrast to the previous works on convex but\nnon-smooth sparsity inducing approaches, e.g., the group sparse beamforming\nalgorithm based on the mixed l1/l2-norm relaxation [1], we adopt the nonconvex\nbut smoothed lp-minimization (0 < p <= 1) approach to promote sparsity in the\nmulticast setting, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the\nprinciple of the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm and the semidefinite\nrelaxation (SDR) technique. In particular, an iterative reweighted-l2 algorithm\nis developed, which will converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the\nrelaxed smoothed lp-minimization problem from the SDR technique.

In this paper, we study a bounce cosmology with a Type IV\nsingularity occurring at the bouncing point, in the context of $F(R)$ modified\ngravity. We investigate the evolution of the Hubble radius and we examine the\nissue of primordial cosmological perturbations in detail. As we demonstrate,\nfor the singular bounce, the primordial perturbations originating from the\ncosmological era near the bounce, do not produce a scale invariant spectrum and\nalso the short wavelength modes, after these exit the horizon, do not freeze,\nbut grow linearly with time. After presenting the cosmological perturbations\nstudy, we discuss the viability of the singular bounce model, and our results\nindicate that the singular bounce must be combined with another cosmological\nscenario, or should be modified appropriately, in order that it leads to a\nviable cosmology. The study of the slow-roll parameters leads to the same\nresult, indicating the singular bounce theory is unstable at the singularity\npoint, for certain values of the parameters. We also conformally transform the\nJordan frame singular bounce, and as we demonstrate, the Einstein frame metric\nleads to a Big Rip singularity. Therefore, the Type IV singularity in the\nJordan frame, becomes a Big Rip singularity in the Einstein frame.

In this Review,\nrecent developments in the understanding of light harvesting by plants will be\ndiscussed, based on results obtained from single molecule spectroscopy studies.\nThree design principles of the main light-harvesting antenna of plants will be\nhighlighted: (a) fine, photoactive control over the intrinsic protein disorder\nto efficiently use intrinsically available thermal energy dissipation\nmechanisms; (b) the design of the protein microenvironment of a low-energy\nchromophore dimer to control the amount of shade absorption; (c) the design of\nthe exciton manifold to ensure efficient funneling of the harvested light to\nthe terminal emitter cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 14:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

One result\nthat emerged out of a previous study to investigate the application of\nsearch-based software testing (SBST) in an industrial setting was the\ndevelopment of the Interactive Search-Based Software Testing (ISBST) system.\nISBST allows users to interact with the underlying SBST system, guiding the\nsearch and assessing the results. An industrial evaluation indicated that the\nISBST system could find test cases that are not created by testers employing\nmanual techniques. The validity of the evaluation was threatened, however, by\nthe low number of participants.\n  Objective: This paper presents a follow-up study, to provide a more rigorous\nevaluation of the ISBST system.\n  Method: To assess the ISBST system a two-way crossover controlled experiment\nwas conducted with 58 students taking a Verification and Validation course. The\nNASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) is used to assess the workload experienced by\nthe participants in the experiment.\n  Results: The experimental results validated the hypothesis that the ISBST\nsystem generates test cases that are not found by the same participants\nemploying manual testing techniques.

Taking\nalso into account the IGM heating associated to structure formation, we argue\nthat values of the y parameter of several*10^(-6), i.e. a factor of a few below\nthe COBE/FIRAS upper limit, are to be expected. The Compton scattering by the\nre-ionized plasma also re-processes primordial distortions, adding a y-type\ncontribution.

We can take a\nlower frequency limit for a corresponding high-frequency break to calculate a\nBH mass upper limit of 1.6x10^3 solar masses. Using the X-ray/radio fundamental\nplane we calculate another upper limit to the BH mass of 3.5x10^4 solar masses\nfor a BH in the low/hard state. The hard spectrum, high rms variability and\nmass limits are consistent with ULX-7 being an intermediate-mass BH; however we\ncannot exclude other interpretations of this source's interesting behaviour,\nmost notably a neutron star with an extreme accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 15:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 12:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-14"}

Note that the FRT and FPT\nare deeply affected by the starting or target site. We don't intend to\nenumerate all the possible cases and analyze them. We only study the\nvolatilities of FRT for a given hub (i.e., node with highest degree) and the\nvolatilities of the global FPT (GFPT) to a given hub, which is the average of\nthe FPTs for arriving at a given hub from any possible starting site selected\nrandomly according to the equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain.\nFirstly, we calculate exactly the probability generating function of the GFPT\nand FRT based on the self-similar structure of the PSFW. Then, we calculate the\nprobability distribution, the mean, the variance and reduced moment of the GFPT\nand FRT by using the generating functions as a tool.

The I.S.B.T.C., being the only major\ninformation database for CB, seems lacking in some crucial information on\nvarious cancer biotherapy regimens. It is thus necessary to have a\ncomprehensive curated CB database. The database accessible to cancer patients\nand also should be a sounding board for scientific ideas by cancer researchers.\nThe database/web server has information about main families of cancer\nbiotherapy regimens to date, namely, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Ras Pathway\nInhibitors, Cell-Cycle Active Agents, MAbs (monoclonal antibodies), ADEPT\n(Antibody-Directed Enzyme Pro-Drug Therapy), Cytokines, Anti-Angiogenesis\nAgents, Cancer Vaccines, Cell-based Immunotherapeutics, Gene Therapy,\nHematopoietic Growth Factors, Retinoids, and CAAT. For each biotherapy regimen,\nwe will extract the following attributes in populating the database: Cancer\ntype, Gene/s and gene product/s involved, Gene sequence, Organs affected,\nReference papers, Clinical phase/stage, Survival rate, Clinical test center\nlocations, Cost, Patient blogs, Researcher blogs, and Future work. The database\nwill be accessible to public through a website and had FAQs for making it\nunderstandable to the laymen and discussion page for researchers to express\ntheir views and ideas. In addition to information about the biotherapy\nregimens, the website will link to other biologically significant databases\nlike structural proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and lipidomics databases,\nas well as to news around the world regarding cancer therapy results.

The former comprises a significant majority of\nproteins. This work concerns the second category. Unlike a spheroprotein, an\nRSP possesses a conspicuous axis along its longest dimension. To take advantage\nof this symmetry element, we decided to represent RSPs using cylindrical\ncoordinates, (rho, theta, z), with the z-axis as the main axis, and one tip of\nthe protein at the origin. A \"tip\" is one of two extreme points in the protein\nlying along the protein axis along its longest dimension. We first identify the\ntwo tips, T1 and T2, of the RSP using a protein graphics software, then\ndetermine their (Cartesian) coordinates, (h, k, l) and (m, n, o), respectively.\nArbitrarily selecting T1 as the tip at the origin, we translate the protein by\nsubtracting (h, k, l) from all structural coordinates. We then find the angle\nalpha between vector T1-T2 and the positive z-axis by computing the scalar\nproduct of vectors T1- T2 and OP where P is an arbitrary point along the\npositive z-axis. We typically use (0, 0, p) where p is a suitable positive\nnumber. Then we compute the cross product of the two vectors to determine the\naxis about which we should rotate vector T1-T2 to make it coincide with the\npositive z-axis. We use a matrix form of Rodrigues' formula to do the rotation.\nWe then apply the Cartesian to cylindrical coordinate transformation equations\nto the system. We have applied the above transformation to 15 RSPs: 1QCE, 2JJ7,\n2KPE, 3K2A, 3LHP, 2LOE, 2L3H, 2L1P, 1KSG, 1KSJ, 1KSH, 2KOL, 2KZG, 2KPF and\n3MQC.

The protein\nmolecular centroid (global centroid, GC), and the LBS centroid (local centroid,\nLC) are first determined. The SP is the plane passing through the LC and normal\nto the line passing through the LC and the GC. The \"exterior side\" of the SP is\nthe side opposite GC. The TS is the sphere with center at GC and tangent to the\nSP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms inside the TS (TS index) and on the\nexterior side of the SP (SP index), are complementary measures of LBS depth.\nThe SPi is directly proportional to LBS depth while the TSi is inversely\nproportional. We tested the two methods using a test set of 67\nwell-characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski, et al. 1996), as well\nas that of an artificial protein in the form of a grid of points in the overall\nshape of a sphere and in which LBS of any depth can be specified. Results from\nboth the SP and TS methods agree well with reported data (ibid.), and results\nfrom the artificial case confirm that both methods are suitable measures of LBS\ndepth. The web server may be used in two modes. In the \"ligand mode\", user\ninputs the protein PDB coordinates as well as those of the ligand. The \"LBS\nmode\" is the same as the former, except that the ligand coordinates are assumed\nto be unavailable; hence the user inputs what s/he believes to be the\ncoordinates of the LBS amino acid residues. In both cases, the web server\noutputs the SP and TS indices. LBS depth is usually directly related to the\namount of conformational change a protein undergoes upon ligand binding -\nability to quantify it could allows meaningful comparison of protein\nflexibility and dynamics.

Currently there is no available method of protein 3D structure\nrepresentation which captures enough chemical information from the protein\nsequence and clearly shows the intra-molecular and the inter-molecular H-bonds\nand VDW interactions at the same time. This project aims to reduce the 3D\nstructure of a protein and display the reduced representation along with\nintermolecular and the intra- molecular H-bonds and van der Waals interactions.\nA reduced protein representation has a significantly lower atomicity (i.e.,\nnumber of atom coordinates) than one which is in all- atom representation. In\nthis work, we transform the protein structure from all-atom representation\"\n(AAR) to double-centroid reduced representation (DCRR), which contains amino\nacid backbone (N, CA, C', O) and side chain (CB and beyond) centroid\ncoordinates instead of atomic coordinates. Another aim of this project is to\ndevelop a visualization interface for the reduced representation. This\ninterface is implemented in MATLAB and displays the protein in DCRR along with\nits inter-molecular, as well as intra-molecular, interaction. Visually, DCRR is\neasier to comprehend than AAR. We also developed a Web Server called the\nProtein DCRR Web Server wherein users can enter the PDB id or upload a modeled\nprotein and get the DCRR of that protein. The back end to the Web Server is a\ndatabase which has the reduced representation for all the x-ray\ncrystallographic structure in the PDB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 01:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-29"}

Small\norganic molecules called ligands or metabolites in the cell form complexes with\nbiomolecules (usually proteins) to serve different purposes. The sites at which\nthe ligands bind are known as ligand binding sites, which are essentially\n\"pockets\" which have complementary shapes and patterns of charge distribution\nwith the ligands. Sometimes a pocket is induced by the ligand itself. If we\nstudy different bound conformations of ligands it is found that they share a\nspecific three- dimensional pattern that is more or less common and is\nresponsible for its binding and which is complementary in three-dimensional\ngeometry and charge distribution pattern with its cognate binding site in the\nprotein. This work studies the three dimensional structure of the consensus\nligand binding site for the ligand FMN. A training set for the ligand binding\nsites was made and a 3D consensus binding site motif was determined for FMN.\nThe FMN system was studied and its binding sites in its respective regulator\nproteins. The ability to identify ligand binding site by scanning the 3D\nbinding site consensus motif in protein 3D structures is an important step in\ndrug target discovery. Once a pharmacophore template is found it can also be\nused to design other potential molecules that can bind to it and thus serve as\nnovel drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 23:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-29"}

This allows for voting rules\ndifferent from majority voting. While the linear voter model is known to reach\nconsensus, non-linear voter models can result in the coexistence of opposite\nopinions. Our aim is to derive approximations to correctly predict the time\ndependent dynamics, or at least the asymptotic outcome, of such local\ninteractions. Emphasis is on a probabilistic approach to decompose the opinion\ndistribution in a second-order neighborhood into lower-order probability\ndistributions. This is compared with an analytic pair approximation for the\nexpected value of the global fraction of opinions and a mean-field\napproximation. Our reference case are averaged stochastic simulations of a\none-dimensional cellular automaton. We find that the probabilistic second-order\napproach captures the dynamics of the reference case very well for different\nnon-linearities, i.e for both majority and minority voting rules, which only\npartly holds for the first-order pair approximation and not at all for the\nmean-field approximation. We further discuss the interesting phenomenon of a\ncorrelated coexistence, characterized by the formation of large domains of\nopinions that dominate for some time, but slowly change.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 12:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Our main finding is that the\ndistribution of GDP growth rates can be well approximated by a bimodal function\nassociated to a series of switches between regimes of strong growth rate\n$\\rho_\\text{high}$ and regimes of low growth rate $\\rho_\\text{low}$. The\nsuccession of such two regimes compounds to produce a remarkably stable long\nterm average real annualized growth rate of 1.6\\% from 1800 to 2010 and\n$\\approx 2.0\\%$ since 1950, which is the result of a subtle compensation\nbetween the high and low growth regimes that alternate continuously. Thus, the\noverall growth dynamics of the US economy is punctuated, with phases of strong\ngrowth that are intrinsically unsustainable, followed by corrections or\nconsolidation until the next boom starts. We interpret these findings within\nthe theory of \"social bubbles\" and argue as a consequence that estimations of\nthe cost of the 2008 crisis may be misleading.
