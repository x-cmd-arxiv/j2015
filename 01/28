It seems important to study all baryon data that are\navailable from collider experiments in wide range of energies. Transverse\nmomentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC\n($\\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. It is seen that the slope of\ndistributions at low $p_T$'s is changing with energy. The QGSM fit of these\nspectra gives the average transverse momenta which behave as $s^{0.06}$ that is\nsimilar to the previously observed behavior of $\\Lambda^0$ hyperon spectra. The\nchange in average transverse momenta that are slowly growing in VHE hadron\ninteractions at CR detectors cannot cause the \"knee\" in measured cosmic ray\nproton spectra. In addition, the available data on heavy quark hadron\nproduction from LHC-b at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV were also studied. The preliminary\ndependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy\nis presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios\nthat are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the\ngrowing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production\nspectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target\nfragmentation. In the laboratory system of cosmic ray measurements this\nspectrum asymmetry will be seen as growing ratio of secondary\nantiparticle-to-particle spectra until the certain energy of secondaries. This\nconclusion makes the particle production at the sources of very high energy\ncosmic protons important, if the interactions with positive target matter would\nhave place in proximity of these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 16:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

The Fermi gamma-ray source 2FGL J2339.6-0532 was\nrecently categorized as a black widow in which a recycled millisecond pulsar\n(MSP) is evaporating up the companion star with its powerful pulsar wind. Our\noptical observations show clear sinusoidal light curves due to the asymmetric\ntemperature distribution of the companion star. Assuming a simple geometry, we\nconstrained the range of the inclination angle of the binary system to\n52$^{\\circ}$ < i < 59$^{\\circ}$, which enables us to discuss the interaction\nbetween the pulsar wind and the companion in detail. The X-ray spectrum\nconsists of two components: a soft, steady component that seems to originate\nfrom the surface of the MSP, and a hard variable component from the\nwind-termination shock near the companion star. The measured X-ray luminosity\nis comparable to the bolometric luminosity of the companion, meaning that the\nheating efficiency is less than 0.5. In the companion orbit, 10$^{11}$ cm from\nthe pulsar, the pulsar wind is already in particle dominant-stage, with a\nmagnetization parameter of $\\sigma$ < 0.1. In addition, we precisely\ninvestigated the time variations of the X-ray periodograms and detected a\nweakening of orbital modulation. The observed phenomenon may be related to an\nunstable pulsar-wind activity or a weak mass accretion, both of which can\nresult in the temporal extinction of radio-pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

While the diffusion forecasting method assumes the\navailability of a noise-free training data set observing the full state space\nof the dynamics, in real applications we often have only partial observations\nwhich are corrupted by noise. To alleviate these practical issues, following\nthe theory of embedology, the diffusion model is built using the\ndelay-embedding coordinates of the data. We show that this delay embedding\nbiases the geometry of the data in a way which extracts the most stable\ncomponent of the dynamics and reduces the influence of independent additive\nobservation noise. The resulting diffusion forecast model approximates the\nsemigroup solutions of the generator of the underlying dynamics in the limit of\nlarge data and when the observation noise vanishes.

At the same time, the need for precise calibration of these devices\n(ranging from tiny sensors to space telescopes) manifests itself as a major\nroadblock in many scientific and technological endeavors. To achieve optimal\nperformance of advanced high-performance sensors one must carefully calibrate\nthem, which is often difficult or even impossible to do in practice. In this\nwork we bring together three seemingly unrelated concepts, namely\nSelf-Calibration, Compressive Sensing, and Biconvex Optimization. The idea\nbehind self-calibration is to equip a hardware device with a smart algorithm\nthat can compensate automatically for the lack of calibration. We show how\nseveral self-calibration problems can be treated efficiently within the\nframework of biconvex compressive sensing via a new method called SparseLift.\nMore specifically, we consider a linear system of equations y = DAx, where both\nx and the diagonal matrix D (which models the calibration error) are unknown.\nBy \"lifting\" this biconvex inverse problem we arrive at a convex optimization\nproblem. By exploiting sparsity in the signal model, we derive explicit\ntheoretical guarantees under which both x and D can be recovered exactly,\nrobustly, and numerically efficiently via linear programming. Applications in\narray calibration and wireless communications are discussed and numerical\nsimulations are presented, confirming and complementing our theoretical\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 18:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 18:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 06:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Around Sun-like stars, CO2 photolysis by Far-UV (FUV) radiation is\nbalanced by recombination reactions that depend on water abundance. Planets\norbiting M dwarf stars experience more FUV radiation, and could be depleted in\nwater due to M dwarfs' prolonged, high-luminosity pre-main sequences (Luger &\nBarnes 2015). We show that, for water-depleted M dwarf terrestrial planets, a\ncatalytic cycle relying on H2O2 photolysis can maintain a CO2 atmosphere.\nHowever, this cycle breaks down for atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios <1 ppm,\nresulting in ~40% of the atmospheric CO2 being converted to CO and O2 on a time\nscale of 1 Myr. The increased O2 abundance leads to high O3 concentrations, the\nphotolysis of which forms another CO2-regenerating catalytic cycle. For\natmospheres with <0.1 ppm hydrogen, CO2 is produced directly from the\nrecombination of CO and O. These catalytic cycles place an upper limit of ~50%\non the amount of CO2 that can be destroyed via photolysis, which is enough to\ngenerate Earth-like abundances of (abiotic) O2 and O3. The conditions that lead\nto such high oxygen levels could be widespread on planets in the habitable\nzones of M dwarfs. Discrimination between biological and abiotic O2 and O3 in\nthis case can perhaps be accomplished by noting the lack of water features in\nthe reflectance and emission spectra of these planets, which necessitates\nobservations at wavelengths longer than 0.95 microns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:24:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 22:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

The main advantage of\nthe new target-detector system is a density several orders of magnitude higher\nthan conventional gas targets.

The model consists of a fixed background and many small\n\"particles\" as building blocks that float around in the background to resemble\nthe target by clustering. This approach contrasts the conventional geometric\ninversions requiring the target to be regularly shaped bodies, since here the\ngeometry of the target can be arbitrary and does not need to be known\nbeforehand. Because of the lack of resolution in the data, the particles may\nnot necessarily cluster when recovering compact targets. A model norm, called\ndistribution norm, is introduced to quantify the spread of particles and\nincorporated into the objective function to encourage further clustering of the\nparticles. As proof of concept, 1D magnetotelluric inversion is used as\nexample. My experiments reveal that the particles, starting from a fully\nscattered distribution, are able to move towards the actual target location;\nthe quality of recovery depends on whether there is enough material (vertical\nconductance in 1D) in the particles to build the target; and the use of\ndistribution norm can help produce tightened clustering. When the inversion\nstruggles to fit the data, it may indicate that the prior information about the\nparticles' conductivity and size are incorrect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 20:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

The [C/Fe] ratio in the\nclusters decreases with increasing luminosity above log(L/L_sun) ~= 1.6, which\ncan be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is\nobserved in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform.\nStars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize\nthat [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with\nincreasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of\nasymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of Type Ia\nsupernovae at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich\ngiants (8 previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases\npreclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the Milky Way\nstellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with [C/Fe] < +1 in dSphs follow a\ndifferent [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in\ndSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the\nmetallicity of the [C/Fe] \"knee\" adds to the evidence from [alpha/Fe]\ndistributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for\nchemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 01:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This framework allows\nus to view power grids as complex networks of coupled second-order phase\noscillators with both forcing and damping terms. Using simple illustrative\nexamples, test systems, and real power-grid datasets, we study the inherent\nfrequencies of the oscillators as well as their coupling structure, comparing\nacross the different models.

Potential SB galaxies are\nselected from the SDSS DR7 and their stellar content is analysed. We apply an\nage dependent dust attenuation correction and derive star formation rates\n(SFR), ages and masses of the young and old populations. The photometric masses\nnicely agree with dynamical masses derived from the H-alpha emission line\nwidth. To select SB galaxies, we use the birthrate parameter b=SFR/<SFR>,\nrequiring b>=3. The PB sample is selected from the citerion EW(Hdelta_abs)>=6\nA. Only 1% of star-forming galaxies are found to be SB galaxies. They\ncontribute 3-6% to the stellar production and are therefore unimportant for the\nlocal star formation activity. The median SB age is 70 Myr, roughly independent\nof mass. The b-parameter strongly depends on burst age. Values close to b=60\nare found at ages ~10 Myr, while almost no SBs are found at ages >1 Gyr. The\nmedian baryonic burst mass fraction of sub-L* galaxies is 5%, decreasing slowly\nwith mass. The median mass fraction of the recent burst in the PB sample is\n5-10%. The age-mass distribution of the progenitors of the PBs is bimodal with\na break at log(M)~10.6 above which the ages are doubled. The SB and PB\nluminosity functions (hereafter LFs) follow each other closely until M_r~-21,\nwhen AGNs begin to dominate. The PB LF continues to follow the AGN LF while SB\nloose significance. This suggests that the number of luminous SBs is\nunderestimated by about one dex at high luminosities, due to large amounts of\ndust and/or AGN blending.

For classical random walks,\nthere is a natural sense in which continuous-time walks are a limit of\ndiscrete-time walks. Quantum mechanically, in the discrete-time case, an\nadditional \"coin space\" must be appended for the walk to have nontrivial time\nevolution. Continuous-time quantum walks, however, have no such constraints.\nThis means that there is no completely straightforward way to treat a CTQW as a\nlimit of DTQW, as can be done in the classical case. Various approaches to this\nproblem have been taken in the past. We give a construction for walks on\n$d$-regular, $d$-colorable graphs when the coin flip operator is Hermitian:\nfrom a standard DTQW we construct a family of discrete-time walks with a\nwell-defined continuous-time limit on a related graph. One can think of this\nlimit as a {\\it coined} continuous-time walk. We show that these CTQWs share\nsome properties with coined DTQWs.

The\ncontinuous limit of the DTQW search over the 2-D torus exhibits the\n$O(\\sqrt{N}\\log{N})$ scaling, like the coined walk it is derived from.

To characterize the response, it is useful to use its\nenergy-weighted moments, or sum rules. By comparing computed sum rules with\nexperimental values, the information content of the response can be utilized in\nthe optimization process of the nuclear Hamiltonian or EDF. But the additional\ninformation comes at a price: compared to the ground state, computation of\nexcited states is more demanding. To establish an efficient framework to\ncompute sum rules of the response that is adaptable to the optimization of the\nnuclear EDF and large-scale surveys of collective strength, we have developed a\nnew technique within the complex-energy FAM based on the QRPA. To compute sum\nrules, we carry out contour integration of the response function in the\ncomplex-energy plane. We benchmark our results against the conventional matrix\nformulation of the QRPA theory, the Thouless theorem for the energy-weighted\nsum rule, and the dielectric theorem for the inverse energy-weighted sum rule.\nWe demonstrate that calculated sum-rule values agree with those obtained from\nthe matrix formulation of the QRPA. We also discuss the applicability of both\nthe Thouless theorem about the energy-weighted sum rule and the dielectric\ntheorem for the inverse energy-weighted sum rule to nuclear density functional\ntheory in cases when the EDF is not based on a Hamiltonian. The proposed\nsum-rule technique based on the complex-energy FAM is a tool of choice when\noptimizing effective interactions or energy functionals.

Using the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method, we calculate momentum distribution\nfunction, gap, and spin-correlation function to reveal rich ground-state\nproperties. We find that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can generate unconventional\nmomentum distribution, which depends crucially on the filling. We call the\ncorresponding phase with zero gap the SOC-induced metallic phase. We also show\nthat SOC can drive the system from the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic Mott\ninsulators with spin rotating. As a result, a second-order quantum phase\ntransition between the spin-rotating ferromagnetic Mott insulator and the\nSOC-induced metallic phase is predicted at the strong SOC. Here the spin\nrotating means that the spin orientations of the nearest-neighbor sites are not\nparallel or antiparallel, i.e., they have an intersection angle $\\theta \\in\n(0,\\pi )$.

Such a\nlayer could have an observable signature in both long-term and short-term\nvariations of the magnetic field of the Earth, which are used to probe the flow\nat the top of the core. Indeed, with the recent SWARM mission, it seems\nreasonable to be able to identify waves propagating in the core with period of\nseveral months, which may play an important role in the large-scale dynamics.\nIn this paper, we characterize the influence of a stratified layer at the top\nof the core on deep quasi-geostrophic (Rossby) waves. We compute numerically\nthe quasi-geostrophic eigenmodes of a rapidly rotating spherical shell, with a\nstably stratified layer near the outer boundary. Two simple models of\nstratification are taken into account, which are scaled with commonly adopted\nvalues of the Brunt-V{\\\"a}is{\\\"a}l{\\\"a} frequency in the Earth's core. In the\nabsence of magnetic field, we find that both azimuthal wavelength and frequency\nof the eigenmodes control their penetration into the stratified layer: the\nhigher the phase speed, the higher the permeability of the stratified layer to\nthe wave motion. We also show that the theory developed by Takehiro and Lister\n[2001] for thermal convection extends to the whole family of Rossby waves in\nthe core. Adding a magnetic field, the penetrative behaviour of the\nquasi-geostrophic modes (the so-called fast branch) is insensitive to the\nimposed magnetic field and only weakly sensitive to the precise shape of the\nstratification. Based on these results, the large-scale and high frequency\nmodes (1 to 2 month periods) may be detectable in the geomagnetic data measured\nat the Earth's surface, especially in the equatorial area where the modes can\nbe trapped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 07:22:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 09:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

At the moment, kangaroo methods are the\nbest low memory algorithm to solve the interval discrete logarithm problem.

However, processing such data streams while ensuring strict\nguarantees on quality of services is problematic due to: (i) uncertain stream\narrival pattern; (ii) need of processing different types of continuous queries;\nand (iii) variable resource consumption behavior of continuous queries. Recent\nwork has explored the use of statistical techniques for resource estimation of\nSQL queries and OLTP workloads. All these techniques approximate resource usage\nfor each query as a single point value. However, in data stream processing\nworkloads in which data flows through the graph of operators endlessly and\nposes performance and resource demand fluctuations, the single point resource\nestimation is inadequate. Because it is neither expressive enough nor does it\ncapture the multi-modal nature of the target data. To this end, we present a\nnovel technique which uses mixture density networks, a combined structure of\nneural networks and mixture models, to estimate the whole spectrum of resource\nusage as probability density functions. The proposed approach is a flexible and\nconvenient means of modeling unknown distribution models. We have validated the\nmodels using both the linear road benchmark and the TPC-H, observing high\naccuracy under a number of error metrics: mean-square error, continuous ranked\nprobability score, and negative log predictive density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 08:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-29"}

In this paper we\nshow that the Taylor formula of the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus can be\ngeneralized to the S-functional calculus, the proof is not a trivial extension\nof the classical case because there are several obstructions due to the non\ncommutativity of the setting in which we work that have to be overcome. To\nprove the Taylor formula we need to introduce a new series expansion of the\n$S$-resolvent operators associated to the sum of two $n$-tuples of operators.\nThis result is a crucial step in the proof of our main results,but it is also\nof independent interest because it gives a new series expansion for the\n$S$-resolvent operators. This paper is devoted to researchers working in\noperators theory and hypercomplex analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 10:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The\neigenvalues of the deformation tensor are directly related to the parameters\nthat describe triaxiality, namely, the minor to major and intermediate to major\naxes ratios ($s$ and $q$) and the triaxiality parameter $T$. Using the phase\nspace equations, we evolve the eigenvalues and examine the evolution of the PDF\n(probability distribution function) of the axes ratios as a function of mass\nscale and redshift for Gaussian initial conditions. We find that the\nellipticity and prolateness increase with decreasing mass scale and decreasing\nredshift. These trends agree with previous analytic studies but differ from\nnumerical simulations. However, the PDF of the scaled parameter ${\\tilde q} =\n(q-s)/(1-s)$ follows a universal distribution over two decades in mass range\nand redshifts which is in qualitative agreement with the universality for\nconditional PDF reported in simulations. We further show using the phase space\ndynamics that, in fact, ${\\tilde q}$ is a phase space invariant and is\nconserved individually for each halo. These results, demonstrate that the phase\nspace analysis is a useful tool that provides a different perspective on the\nevolution of perturbations and can be applied to more sophisticated models in\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 12:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 04:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2018 05:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop\ndifferent types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different\ncomputation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general\nschedulability analysis framework, namely the k2U framework, that can be\npotentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any\nfixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor\nscheduling. The key to k2U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which\ncan be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding\nk-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient\nutilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of\nk2U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved\ntests compared to the state-of-the-art.\n  Analogously, a similar concept by testing only k points with a different\nformulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k2Q, which\nprovides quadratic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different\nformulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms,\nk2Q and k2U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be\nmeasured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only\nfor uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling.

The disease progression is slow, asymptomatic and may lead to\nsudden cardiac arrest, stroke or myocardial infraction. Presently, imaging\ntechniques are being employed to understand the molecular and metabolic\nactivity of atherosclerotic plaques to estimate the risk. Though imaging\nmethods are able to provide some information on plaque metabolism they lack the\nrequired resolution and sensitivity for detection. In this paper we consider\nthe clinical observations and habits of individuals for predicting the risk\nfactors of CHD. The identification of risk factors helps in stratifying\npatients for further intensive tests such as nuclear imaging or coronary\nangiography. We present a novel approach for predicting the risk factors of\natherosclerosis with an in-built imputation algorithm and particle swarm\noptimization (PSO). We compare the performance of our methodology with other\nmachine learning techniques on STULONG dataset which is based on longitudinal\nstudy of middle aged individuals lasting for twenty years. Our methodology\npowered by PSO search has identified physical inactivity as one of the risk\nfactor for the onset of atherosclerosis in addition to other already known\nfactors. The decision rules extracted by our methodology are able to predict\nthe risk factors with an accuracy of $99.73%$ which is higher than the\naccuracies obtained by application of the state-of-the-art machine learning\ntechniques presently being employed in the identification of atherosclerosis\nrisk studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 13:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 03:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

Firstly, we determine\nthe solar motion by comparing the observed velocity distribution to that\ngenerated with the analytic formulism of Schonrich & Binney that has been\ndemonstrated to show excellent agreement with rigorous torus-based dynamics\nmodelling by Binney & McMillan. Secondly, we propose that cold populations of\nthin disc stars, selected by applying an orbital eccentricity cut, can be\ndirectly used to determine the LSR without the need of asymmetric drift\ncorrections. Both approaches yield consistent results of solar motion in the\ndirection of Galactic rotation, V_sun, that are much higher than the standard\nvalue adopted hitherto, derived from Stromgren's equation. The newly deduced\nvalues of V_sun are 1-2 km/s smaller than the more recent estimates derived\nfrom the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey sample of stars in the solar neighbourhood\n(within 100 pc). We attribute the small difference to the presence of several\nwell-known moving groups in the GCS sample that, fortunately, hardly affect the\nLSS-GAC sample. The newly derived radial and vertical components of the solar\nmotion agree well with the previous studies. In addition, for all components of\nthe solar motion, the values yielded by stars of different spectral types in\nthe LSS-GAC sample are consistent with each other, suggesting that the local\ndisk is well relaxed and that the LSR reported in the current work is robust.\nOur final recommended LSR is, (U,V,W)_sun = (7.01+/-0.20, 10.13+/-0.12,\n4.95+/-0.09) km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 13:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

A recent analysis of plausible\nastrophysical counterparts within the error circles of IceCube events showed\nthat likely counterparts for nine of the IceCube neutrinos include mostly BL\nLacs, among which Mrk 421.

Moreover, the model-predicted neutrino flux\nand energy for these sources are of the same order of magnitude as those of the\nIceCube neutrinos. In two cases, namely Mrk 421 and H 1914-194, we find a\nsuggestively good agreement between the model prediction and the detected\nneutrino flux.

Some\npaleomagnetic records also suggest that the field decreases much slower before\nan reversals than it recovers afterwards and that the recovery phase may show\nan overshoot in field intensity. Here we study the dipole moment variations in\nseveral extremely long dynamo simulation to statistically explored the reversal\nand excursion properties. The numerical reversals are characterized by a switch\nfrom a high axial dipole moment state to a low axial dipole moment state. When\nanalysing the respective transitions we find that decay and growth have very\nsimilar time scales and that there is no overshoot. Other properties are\ngenerally similar to paleomagnetic findings. The dipole moment has to decrease\nto about 30% of its mean to allow for reversals. Grand excursions during which\nthe field intensity drops by a comparable margin are very similar to reversals\nand likely have the same internal origin. The simulations suggest that both are\nsimply triggered by particularly large axial dipole fluctuations while other\nfield components remain largely unaffected.

Conventionally, niobium\ncavities are fabricated from sheet niobium by the formation of half-cells by\ndeep drawing, followed by trim machining and Electron-Beam Welding (EBW). The\nwelding of half-cells is a delicate procedure, requiring intermediate cleaning\nsteps and a careful choice of weld parameters to achieve full penetration of\nthe joints.

For CsCl, in addition to the two\nsubstitutional sites, a distorted tetrahedral interstitial site is considered.\nFor Ni2Al3, the Ni site, two distinct Al sites and a vacant, insterstitial-type\nNi-site are considered. An equation of constraint among concentrations of\nelementary defects is derived that is valid for any crystal structure. The\nconcentration of a selected defect can be solved using the equation of\nconstraint in conjunction with mass-action equations for defect combinations.\nThe method leads directly to defect concentrations without the need to evaluate\ncomposition-dependent chemical potentials, resulting in a more transparent\nformalism.\n  The model is used to explore the phenomenology of site-preferences of dilute\nternary solute atoms. Findings are in agreement with previous treatments\nrestricted to substitutional sites.

Built on a foundation of trust-users\nconnect to other users with common interests or overlapping personal\ntrajectories-online social networks and the associated applications extract an\nunprecedented volume of personal information. Unsurprisingly, serious privacy\nand security risks emerged, positioning themselves along two main types of\nattacks: attacks that exploit the implicit trust embedded in declared social\nrelationships; and attacks that harvest user's personal information for\nill-intended use. This article provides an overview of the privacy and security\nissues that emerged so far in OSNs. We introduce a taxonomy of privacy and\nsecurity attacks in OSNs, we overview existing solutions to mitigate those\nattacks, and outline challenges still to overcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 18:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

The charge and spin mobilities of photoelectrons are equal in all\nconditions and exhibit the well known increase as the temperature is lowered.\nIt is shown that this is related mainly to the electron statistics rather than\nthe majority hole statistics.
