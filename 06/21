Thus\nserializability is insufficient, and stronger safety properties are required in\nTM, which regulate what values can be read, even by transactions that abort.\nHence, a number of TM safety properties were developed, including opacity, and\nTMS1 and TMS2. However, such strong properties preclude using early release as\na technique for optimizing TM, because they virtually forbid reading from live\ntransactions. On the other hand, properties that do allow early release are\neither not strong enough to prevent any of the problems mentioned above\n(recoverability), or add additional conditions on transactions with early\nrelease that limit their applicability (elastic opacity, live opacity, virtual\nworld consistency).

In the abstract form of the problem, where no noise\nor other corruptions are present, the data are assumed to lie in general\nposition inside the algebraic variety of a union of subspaces, and the\nobjective is to decompose the variety into its constituent subspaces. Prior\nalgebraic-geometric approaches to this problem require the subspaces to be of\nequal dimension, or the number of subspaces to be known. Subspaces of arbitrary\ndimensions can still be recovered in closed form, in terms of all homogeneous\npolynomials of degree $m$ that vanish on their union, when an upper bound m on\nthe number of the subspaces is given. In this paper, we propose an alternative,\nprovably correct, algorithm for addressing a union of at most $m$\narbitrary-dimensional subspaces, based on the idea of descending filtrations of\nsubspace arrangements. Our algorithm uses the gradient of a vanishing\npolynomial at a point in the variety to find a hyperplane containing the\nsubspace S passing through that point. By intersecting the variety with this\nhyperplane, we obtain a subvariety that contains S, and recursively applying\nthe procedure until no non-trivial vanishing polynomial exists, our algorithm\neventually identifies S. By repeating this procedure for other points, our\nalgorithm eventually identifies all the subspaces by returning a basis for\ntheir orthogonal complement. Finally, we develop a variant of the abstract\nalgorithm, suitable for computations with noisy data. We show by experiments on\nsynthetic and real data that the proposed algorithm outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on several occasions, thus demonstrating the merit of\nthe idea of filtrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 20:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 19:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 03:15:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 03:31:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 18:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-13"}

In order to meet the ever increasing demand, it\nis inevitable that, future wireless networks will have to develop seamless\ninterconnection between multiple technologies. A manifestation of this idea is\nthe collaboration among different types of network tiers such as macro and\nsmall cells, leading to the so-called heterogeneous networks (HetNets).\nResearchers have used stochastic geometry to analyze such networks and\nunderstand their real potential. Unsurprisingly, it has been revealed that\ninterference has a detrimental effect on performance, especially if not modeled\nproperly. Interference can be correlated in space and/or time, which has been\noverlooked in the past. For instance, it is normally assumed that the nodes are\nlocated completely independent of each other and follow a homogeneous Poisson\npoint process (PPP), which is not necessarily true in real networks since the\nnode locations are spatially dependent. In addition, the interference\ncorrelation created by correlated stochastic processes has mostly been ignored.\nTo this end, we take a different approach in modeling the interference where we\nuse non-PPP, as well as we study the impact of spatial and temporal correlation\non the performance of HetNets. To illustrate the impact of correlation on\nperformance, we consider three case studies from real-life scenarios.\nSpecifically, we use massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to\nunderstand the impact of spatial correlation; we use the random medium access\nprotocol to examine the temporal correlation; and we use cooperative relay\nnetworks to illustrate the spatial-temporal correlation.

One of the limitations with the direct detection of exoplanets,\neither with ground- or space-based coronagraphs, is pointing errors and other\nlow-order wavefront aberrations. The coronagraphic detection sensitivity at the\ndiffraction limit therefore depends on how well low-order aberrations upstream\nof the focal plane mask are corrected. To prevent starlight leakage at the\ninner working angle of a phase mask coronagraph, we have introduced a\nLyot-based low-order wavefront sensor (LLOWFS), which senses aberrations using\nthe rejected starlight diffracted at the Lyot plane. In this paper, we present\nthe implementation, testing and results of LLOWFS on the Subaru Coronagraphic\nExtreme Adaptive Optics system (SCExAO) at the Subaru Telescope.\n  We have controlled thirty-five Zernike modes of a H-band vector vortex\ncoronagraph in the laboratory and ten Zernike modes on sky with an integrator\ncontrol law. We demonstrated a closed-loop pointing residual of 0.02 mas in the\nlaboratory and 0.15 mas on sky for data sampled using the minimal 2-second\nexposure time of the science camera. We have also integrated the LLOWFS in the\nvisible high-order control loop of SCExAO, which in closed-loop operation has\nvalidated the correction of the non-common path pointing errors between the\ninfrared science channel and the visible wavefront sensing channel with\npointing residual of 0.23 mas on sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 21:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Our cavity-free scheme operates with a\nfast intrinsic time scale in comparison with similar cavity-based schemes. We\nimplement a full real-space multimode numerical analysis of the interacting\nphotonic modes and confirm the validity of our nondestructive scheme in the\nmultimode case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 04:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

We\npresent the first solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the\n$^{77}$Se and $^{125}$Te NMR resonances in polycrystalline powders of\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$, respectively. The spin-lattice ($T_1$)\nrelaxation is modeled by at most two exponentials. Within the framework of this\nmodel, the NMR measurement is sensitive to the distribution of native defects\nwithin these materials. One component corresponds to a stoichiometric fraction,\nan insulator with a very long $T_1$, whereas the other component is attributed\nto a sample fraction with high defect content with a short $T_1$ resulting from\ninteraction with the conduction carriers. The absence of a very long $T_1$ in\nthe bismuth telluride suggests defects throughout the sample. For the bismuth\nselenide, defect regions segregate into domains. We also find a substantial\ndifference in the short $T_1$ component for $^{125}$Te nuclei (76 ms) and\n$^{77}$Se (0.63 s) in spite of the fact that these materials have nearly\nidentical lattice structures, chemical and physical properties. Investigations\nof the NMR shift and Korringa law indicate that the coupling to the conduction\nband electrons at the chalcogenide sites is much stronger in the telluride. The\nresults are consistent with a stronger spin-orbit coupling (SOC) to the\n$p$-band electrons in the telluride.

To investigate the observational properties of relatively low-mass\nhelium stars in binary systems as SN Ib/c progenitors, we constructed\natmospheric models with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN, using\nbinary star evolution models. We find that these helium stars can be\ncharacterized by relatively narrow helium emission lines if the mass-loss rate\nduring the final evolutionary phase is significantly enhanced as implied by\nmany SN Ib/c observations. The optical brightness of helium star progenitors\ncan be meaningfully enhanced with a strong wind for $M \\gtrsim 4.4 M_\\odot$,\nbut hardly affected or slightly weakened for relatively low-mass of $\\sim 3.0\nM_\\odot$, compared to the simple estimate using blackbody approximation. We\nfurther confirm the previous suggestion that the optical brightness would be\ngenerally higher for a less massive SN Ib/c progenitor. In good agreement with\nprevious studies, our results indicate that the optical magnitudes and colors\nof the recently detected progenitor of the SN Ib iPTF13bvn can be well\nexplained by a binary progenitor with a final helium star mass of about 3.0 --\n4.4 $M_\\odot$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 11:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

A fundamental difference between phylogenetic and functional\nanalyses is that phylogeny is intrinsically dependent on a tree-like structure.\nWhen the branches of a phylogenetic tree have lengths, then each evolutionary\nunit on these branches can be considered as a basic entity on which\ndissimilarities among sites should be measured. Several of the recent measures\nof phylogenetic dissimilarities among sites thus are traditional dissimilarity\nindices where species are replaced by evolutionary units. The resulting indices\nwere named PD-dissimilarity indices. Here I review and compare indices and\nordination approaches that, although first developed to analyse the differences\nin the species compositions of sites, can be adapted to describe\nPD-dissimilarities among sites, thus revealing how lineages are distributed\nalong environmental gradients, or among habitats or regions. As an\nillustration, I show that the amount of PD-dissimilarities among the main\nhabitats of a disturbance gradient in Selva Lacandona of Chiapas, Mexico is\nstrongly dependent on whether species are weighted by their abundance or not,\nand on the index used to measure PD-dissimilarity. Overall, the family of\nPD-dissimilarity indices has a critical potential for future analyses of\nphylogenetic diversity as it benefits from decades of research on the measure\nof species dissimilarity. I provide clues to help to choose among many\npotential indices, identifying which indices satisfy minimal basis properties,\nand analysing their sensitivity to abundance, size, diversity, and joint\nabsences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 12:45:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

In this paper, we examine the performance\nof different schedulers in ultra dense small cell deployments. Due to the\nstronger line of sight (LOS) at low inter-site distances (ISDs), we discuss\nthat the Rician fading channel model is more suitable to study network\nperformance than the Rayleigh one, and model the Rician K factor as a function\nof distance between the user equipment (UE) and its serving base station (BS).\nWe also construct a cross-correlation shadowing model that takes into account\nthe ISD, and finally investigate potential multi-user diversity gains in ultra\ndense small cell deployments by comparing the performances of proportional fair\n(PF) and round robin (RR) schedulers. Our study shows that as network becomes\ndenser, the LOS component starts to dominate the path loss model which\nsignificantly increases the interference. Simulation results also show that\nmulti-user diversity is considerably reduced at low ISDs, and thus the PF\nscheduling gain over the RR one is small, around 10% in terms of cell\nthroughput. As a result, the RR scheduling may be preferred for dense small\ncell deployments due to its simplicity. Despite both the interference\naggravation as well as the multi-user diversity loss, network densification is\nstill worth it from a capacity view point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2015 14:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Unfortunately, current compilers only\nhandle \"local\" programs that specify behavior in terms of hop-by-hop forwarding\nbehavior, or modest extensions such as simple paths. To encode richer \"global\"\nbehaviors, programmers must add extra state -- something that is tricky to get\nright and makes programs harder to write and maintain. Making matters worse,\nexisting compilers can take tens of minutes to generate the forwarding state\nfor the network, even on relatively small inputs. This forces programmers to\nwaste time working around performance issues or even revert to using\nhardware-level APIs.\n  This paper presents a new compiler for the NetKAT language that handles rich\nfeatures including regular paths and virtual networks, and yet is several\norders of magnitude faster than previous compilers.

When there is a\nsufficiently broad spread in the energy of eigenstates, a well-defined\ntemperature is shown to arise by photon production when the samples are\noptically thick. This produces a highly accurate approximation to the Planck\ndistribution so that thermalization arises from the initial data as a\nconsequence of purely quantum and unitary dynamics. These results are used as a\nfoil for some common hydrodynamic theory of ultracold gases. It is suggested\nhere that strong history dependence typically remains in these gases and so\nlimits the validity of thermodynamics in their description.
