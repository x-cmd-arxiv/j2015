By the order effect we\nmean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the\norder of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility:\nadjacent reproducibility ($A-A$) and separated reproducibility($A-B-A$). The\nfirst one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of\nsome observable $A$ measured twice, one $A$ measurement after the other. The\nsecond one, $A-B-A$, is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of $A$\nmeasurement when another quantum observable $B$ is measured between two $A$'s.\nHeuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is\ncomplementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, for an important\nclass of quantum observables given by positive operator valued measures\n(POVMs), this may not be the case. The order effect can coexist with a\nseparated reproducibility as well as adjacent reproducibility for both\nobservables $A$ and $B.$ However, the additional constraint in the form of\nseparated reproducibility of the $B-A-B$ type makes this coexistence\nimpossible. Mathematically, this paper is about the operator algebra for\neffects composing POVMs. The problem under consideration was motivated by\nattempts to apply the quantum formalism outside of physics, especially, in\ncognitive psychology and psychophysics. However, it is also important for\nfoundations of quantum physics as a part of the problem about the structure of\nsequential quantum measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 16:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes\nan exciting, yet challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul\nnetworks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibers (OF).\nWhile RF is a cost-effective solution as compared to OF, it supports lower data\nrate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution is the free-space optics\n(FSO) as it offers both a high data rate and a relatively low cost. FSO,\nhowever, is sensitive to nature conditions, e.g., rain, fog, line-of-sight.\nThis paper combines both RF and FSO advantages and proposes a hybrid RF/FSO\nbackhaul solution. It considers the problem of minimizing the cost of the\nbackhaul network by choosing either OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links between\nthe base-stations (BS) so as to satisfy data rate, connectivity, and\nreliability constraints. It shows that under a specified realistic assumption\nabout the cost of OF and hybrid RF/FSO links, the problem is equivalent to a\nmaximum weight clique problem, which can be solved with moderate complexity.\nSimulation results show that the proposed solution shows a close-to-optimal\nperformance, especially for practical prices of the hybrid RF/FSO links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 16:41:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 23:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

As a natural counterpart of the\n$k$-rainbow index, we introduced the concept of $k$-vertex-rainbow index\n$rvx_k(G)$ in this paper. For a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $S\\subseteq V$ of at\nleast two vertices, \\emph{an $S$-Steiner tree} or \\emph{a Steiner tree\nconnecting $S$} (or simply, \\emph{an $S$-tree}) is a such subgraph $T=(V',E')$\nof $G$ that is a tree with $S\\subseteq V'$. For $S\\subseteq V(G)$ and $|S|\\geq\n2$, an $S$-Steiner tree $T$ is said to be a \\emph{vertex-rainbow $S$-tree} if\nthe vertices of $V(T)\\setminus S$ have distinct colors. For a fixed integer $k$\nwith $2\\leq k\\leq n$, the vertex-coloring $c$ of $G$ is called a\n\\emph{$k$-vertex-rainbow coloring} if for every $k$-subset $S$ of $V(G)$ there\nexists a vertex-rainbow $S$-tree.

The minimum number of colors that are\nneeded in a $k$-vertex-rainbow coloring of $G$ is called the\n\\emph{$k$-vertex-rainbow index} of $G$, denoted by $rvx_k(G)$.

For many viral systems, in particular for\nhuman viruses like hepatitis B, adeno or human immunodeficiency virus, that\nlead to persistent infections, capsomeres are continuously produced in the\ncytoplasm of the host cell while completed capsids exit the cell for a new\nround of infection. Here we use coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of\na generic patchy particle model to elucidate the role of the dynamic supply of\ncapsomeres for the reversible self-assembly of empty T1 icosahedral virus\ncapsids. We find that for high rates of capsomere influx only a narrow range of\nbond strengths exists for which a steady state of continuous capsid production\nis possible.

Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually\nassume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity\nover the time course of assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however,\nbinding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during\nthe self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). In order to study possible\nadvantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly,\nwe use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us\nto switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T1 viruses, we\nimplement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become\nactive only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly\nto be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural\nreorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with\nsmall dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping.\nHowever, at the same time it is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during\nthe final phase. Increasing the number of initial monomers does have only a\nweak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly\nschemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here\nfor T3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous\nhexamers in the hierarchical scheme. In order to complement the simulations for\nthis more complicated case, we introduce a master equation approach that agrees\nwell with the simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 19:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

If the offset is omitted, only 17 of our 34 `constant' stars fall within\nthe instability regions. For the two `constant' stars also observed by LAMOST,\nthe LAMOST Teff values are cooler than the KIC Teff by several hundred K, and\nwould move these stars out of the instability regions. It is possible that a\nmore accurate determination of their Teff and log g would move some of the\nother `constant' stars out of the instability regions.

The circumbinary disk is significantly misaligned with the\nbinary orbital plane, and is subject to the time-dependent tidal torques. In\nprinciple, such a disk is warped and precesses, and is torn into mutually\nmisaligned rings in the region, where the tidal precession torques are stronger\nthan the local viscous torques. We derive the tidal-warp and tearing radii of\nthe misaligned circumbinary disks around eccentric SMBH binaries. We find that\nin disks with the viscosity parameter, alpha, larger than a critical value\ndepending on the disk aspect ratio, the disk warping appears outside the\ntearing radius. This condition is expressed as alpha > sqrt{H/3r} for H/r\n~<0.1, where H is the disk scale height. If alpha < sqrt{H/3r}, only the disk\ntearing occurs because the tidal warp radius is inside the tearing radius,\nwhere most of disk material is likely to rapidly accrete onto SMBHs. In warped\nand torn disks, both the tidal-warp and the tearing radii most strongly depend\non the binary semi-major axis, although they also mildly depend on the other\norbital and disk parameters. This strong dependence enables us to estimate the\nsemi-major axis, once the tidal warp or tearing radius is determined\nobservationally: For the tidal warp radius of 0.1 pc, the semi-major axis is\nestimated to be ~10^{-2} pc for 10^7 Msun black hole with typical orbital and\ndisk parameters.

Earlier, we studied the\nspecial case of consistent linear systems and provided an exact formula for the\nmean squared error (MSE) in the value reconstructed by RKA, as well as a simple\nway to compute the exact decay rate of the error. In this work, we consider the\ncase of inconsistent linear systems, which is a more relevant scenario for most\napplications.

In this paper, we examine a\nfundamental problem of this nature from the perspective of game theory, a\nbranch of applied mathematics studying selfish behaviors of two or more\nplayers.

If two\nadmissible pairs $(\\overline{X}_1,D_1)$ and $(\\overline{X}_2,D_2)$ with\n$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\overline{X}_i=4$ satisfy the \\emph{gluing condition}, we can\nglue $\\overline{X}_1\\setminus D_1$ and $\\overline{X}_2\\setminus D_2$ together\nto obtain a compact Riemannian $8$-manifold $(M,g)$ whose holonomy group\n$\\mathrm{Hol}(g)$ is contained in $\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$. Furthermore, if the\n$\\widehat{A}$-genus of $M$ equals $2$, then $M$ is a Calabi-Yau fourfold, i.e.,\na compact Ricci-flat K\\\"{a}hler fourfold with holonomy $\\mathrm{SU}(4)$. In\nparticular, if $(\\overline{X}_1,D_1)$ and $(\\overline{X}_2,D_2)$ are identical\nto an admissible pair $(\\overline{X},D)$, then the gluing condition holds\nautomatically, so that we obtain a compact Riemannian $8$-manifold $M$ with\nholonomy contained in $\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$. Moreover, we show that if the\nadmissible pair is obtained from \\emph{any} of the toric Fano fourfolds, then\nthe resulting manifold $M$ is a Calabi-Yau fourfold by computing\n$\\widehat{A}(M)=2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 07:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 01:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

This could be related to results obtained in simulations of massive star\nformation, which show that the stronger the magnetic field in the original\nmolecular cloud, the more difficult it is to fragment massive cores to form\nseveral stars. Therefore, more and more arguments support the fossil field\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 10:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}
