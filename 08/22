However, most multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as\nexponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes\nit difficult to scale up to realistic multi-agent problems. In this paper, a\nnovel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI)\nis presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction based MARL\nalgorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for\nagents to select the non-strict Equilibrium Dominating Strategy Profile\n(non-strict EDSP) or Meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented\nNegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for\nsparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum\nvariance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of\nlocal Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared\nvalue functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to\nachieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational\ncomplexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI\nalgorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria:\nsteps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime\n(AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games\nand shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm.\nThen in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent\nwarehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npresented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 16:30:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 15:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

Inflation in supergravity, however, cannot be easily described\nbecause of restrictions from supersymmetry (SUSY). The scalar potential has an\nexponential factor and a large negative term whereas a flat and positive\npotential is needed to realize inflation. The standard method to obtain such an\ninflationary scalar potential requires an additional superfield to the one\ncontaining inflaton. In this thesis, we propose and develop an alternative\nmethod which does not require the additional superfield and thus reduces the\nnecessary degrees of freedom by half. That is, we study inflation in\nsupergravity with only a single chiral superfield which contains inflaton. We\naccomplish it by introducing a higher dimensional term in the inflaton Kahler\npotential, which plays an important dual role: fixing the value of the scalar\nsuperpartner of the inflaton resulting in effective single field models, and\nensuring the positivity of the inflaton potential at the large field region.\nOur proposal is not just particular models but rather a new framework to\nrealize various inflationary models in supergravity. In particular, large field\ninflation in supergravity using one superfield without tuning has become\npossible for the first time. In our generic models, SUSY breaking at the\ninflationary scale by inflaton is not completely restored after inflation, so\nnull results for SUSY search at the LHC are predicted for the simplest cases.\nRemarkably, however, it is possible with tuning to embed arbitrary positive\nsemidefinite scalar potentials into supergravity preserving SUSY at the vacuum.\nOur discovery opens up an entirely new branch of model building of inflation in\nsupergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 17:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

Stronger prior constraints on\nneutron-star spins can further constrain mass estimates, but only marginally.\nHowever, we find that the sky position and luminosity distance for these\nsources are not influenced by the inclusion of spin; therefore, if LIGO detects\na low-spin population of BNS sources, less computationally expensive results\ncalculated neglecting spin will be sufficient for guiding electromagnetic\nfollow-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 17:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 18:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 14:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

But in most experiments, adiabatic simulation is not possible\nbecause it would take too long, and the system has some level of diabatic\nexcitation. In this work, we quantify the extent of the diabatic excitation\neven if we do not know {\\it a priori} what the complicated ground state is.\nSince many quantum simulator platforms, like trapped ions, can measure the\nprobabilities to be in a product state, we describe techniques that can employ\nthese measurements to estimate the probability of being in the ground state of\nthe system after the diabatic evolution. These techniques do not require one to\nknow any properties about the Hamiltonian itself, nor to calculate its\neigenstate properties. All the information is derived by analyzing the\nproduct-state measurements as functions of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 18:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-24"}

The high temporal resolution of the CoRoT data combined with the wide\ntime span of the observations has enabled the study of short and long time\nvariations in unprecedented detail. From the initial sample of 2534 stars\nclassified as M-giants in the CoRoT databasis, we selected 1428 targets that\nexhibit well defined variability, using visual inspection. The variability\nperiod and amplitude of C1 stars (stars having Teff < 4200 K) were computed\nusing Lomb-Scargle and harmonic fit methods. The trends found in the V-I vs J-K\ncolor-color diagram are in agreement with standard empirical calibrations for\nM-giants. The sources located towards the inner regions of the Galaxy are\ndistributed throughout the diagram while the majority of the stars towards the\nouter regions of the Galaxy are spread between the calibrations of M-giants and\nthe predicted position for Carbon stars. The stars classified as supergiants\nfollow a different sequence from the one found for giant stars. We also\nperformed a KS test of the period and amplitude of stars towards the inner and\nouter regions of the Galaxy. We obtained a low probability that the two samples\ncome from the same parent distribution. The observed behavior of the\nperiod-amplitude and period-Teff diagrams are, in general, in agreement with\nthose found for Kepler sources and ground based photometry, with pulsation\nbeing the dominant cause responsible for the observed modulation. We also\nconclude that short-time variations on M-Giant stars do not exist orare very\nrare and the few cases we found are possibly related to biases or background\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 18:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

A plausible\ninterpretation of galactic conformity can be given as a combination of the halo\nconformity signal with the galaxy color-halo age relation: at fixed stellar\nmass, particularly toward the low-mass end, Illustris' galaxy colors correlate\nwith halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) being\npreferentially found in the oldest haloes.

The\nenergy consumption of DCs becomes a critical issue. Powering DCs with renewable\nenergy can effectively reduce the brown energy consumption and thus alleviates\nthe energy consumption problem. Owing to geographical deployments of DCs, the\nrenewable energy generation and the data processing demands usually vary in\ndifferent DCs. Migrating virtual machines (VMs) among DCs according to the\navailability of renewable energy helps match the energy demands and the\nrenewable energy generation in DCs, and thus maximizes the utilization of\nrenewable energy. Since migrating VMs incurs additional traffic in the network,\nthe VM migration is constrained by the network capacity. The inter-datacenter\n(inter-DC) VM migration with network capacity constraints is an NP-hard\nproblem. In this paper, we propose two heuristic algorithms that approximate\nthe optimal VM migration solution.

As a function of the\nsubstrate strength and filling factor, within the pinned state we observe a\nseries of order-disorder transitions associated with buckling phenomena in\nwhich the number of vortex rows that fit between neighboring substrate maxima\nincreases. These transitions coincide with steps in the depinning threshold,\njumps in the density of topological defects, and changes in the structure\nfactor. At the buckling transition the vortices are disordered, while between\nthe buckling transitions the vortices form a variety of crystalline and\npartially ordered states. In the weak substrate limit, the buckling transitions\nare absent and the vortices form an ordered hexagonal lattice that undergoes\nchanges in its orientation with respect to the substrate as a function of\nvortex density. At intermediate substrate strengths, certain ordered states\nappear that are correlated with peaks in the depinning force.

These concerns have attracted the attention of the research\ncommunity, and several techniques have been proposed to protect against\nmalicious parties by providing secure communication protocols. Most of the\nproposed techniques, however, require the involvement of a third party, and\nthis by itself can be viewed as another security concern. These security\nbreaches can be avoided by following a new approach that depends on data\nsorted, managed, and stored in encrypted form at the remote servers. To realize\nsuch an approach, the encryption cryptosystem must support algebraic operations\nover encrypted data. This cryptosystem can be effective in protecting data and\nsupporting the construction of programs that can process encrypted input and\nproduce encrypted output. In fact, the latter programs do not decrypt the\ninput, and therefore, they can be run by an un-trusted party without revealing\ntheir data and internal states. Furthermore, such programs prove to be\npractical in situations where we need to outsource private computations,\nespecially in the context of cloud computing. Homomorphic cryptosystems are\nperfectly aligned with these objectives as they are a strong foundation for\nschemes that allow a blind processing of encrypted data without the need to\ndecrypt them. In this dissertation we rely on homomorphic encryption schemes to\nsecure cloud computing, services and routing protocols. We design several\ncircuits that allow for the blind processing and management of data such that\nmalicious parties are denied access to sensitive information. We select five\nareas to apply our models to. These models are easily customized for many other\nareas.

Random walks on the monoid model a number of interesting Markov\nchains such as the Tsetlin library and riffle shuffle. The representation\ntheory of left regular bands then comes into play and has had a major influence\non both the combinatorics and the probability theory associated to such\nstructures. In a recent paper, the authors established a close connection\nbetween algebraic and combinatorial invariants of a left regular band by\nshowing that certain homological invariants of the algebra of a left regular\nband coincide with the cohomology of order complexes of posets naturally\nassociated to the left regular band.\n  The purpose of the present monograph is to further develop and deepen the\nconnection between left regular bands and poset topology.

One area in deep neural\nnetworks that is ripe for exploration is neural connectivity formation. A\npivotal study on the brain tissue of rats found that synaptic formation for\nspecific functional connectivity in neocortical neural microcircuits can be\nsurprisingly well modeled and predicted as a random formation. Motivated by\nthis intriguing finding, we introduce the concept of StochasticNet, where deep\nneural networks are formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons. As a\nresult, any type of deep neural networks can be formed as a StochasticNet by\nallowing the neuron connectivity to be stochastic. Stochastic synaptic\nformations, in a deep neural network architecture, can allow for efficient\nutilization of neurons for performing specific tasks. To evaluate the\nfeasibility of such a deep neural network architecture, we train a\nStochasticNet using four different image datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, SVHN, and\nSTL-10). Experimental results show that a StochasticNet, using less than half\nthe number of neural connections as a conventional deep neural network,\nachieves comparable accuracy and reduces overfitting on the CIFAR-10, MNIST and\nSVHN dataset. Interestingly, StochasticNet with less than half the number of\nneural connections, achieved a higher accuracy (relative improvement in test\nerror rate of ~6% compared to ConvNet) on the STL-10 dataset than a\nconventional deep neural network. Finally, StochasticNets have faster\noperational speeds while achieving better or similar accuracy performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2015 03:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 19:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 01:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

Since\nanalysis of spiking behavior when many synaptic inputs are active adds further\nto the number of components, it is useful to have simplified mathematical\nmodels of spiking in such neurons so that, for example, stochastic features of\ninputs and output spike trains can be incorporated. In this article we\ninvestigate two simple two-component models which mimic features of spiking in\nserotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus and noradrenergic neurons of\nthe locus coeruleus.

In this paper, using the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) method, we performed numerical simulations of collisions\nbetween planetesimals at various numerical resolutions (from 2 x 10^4 to 5 x\n10^6 SPH particles) and investigated the resulting variation in Q_D^*. The\nvalue of Q_D^* is shown to decrease as the number of SPH particles increases,\nand the difference between the Q_D^* values for the lowest and highest\ninvestigated resolutions is approximately a factor of two. Although the results\nfor 5 x 10^6 SPH particles do not fully converge, higher-resolution simulations\nnear the impact site show that the value of Q_D^* for the case with 5 x 10^6\nSPH particles is close to the expected converged value. Although Q_D^* depends\non impact parameters and material parameters, our results indicate that at\nleast 5 x 10^6 SPH particles are required for numerical simulations in\ndisruptive collisions to obtain the value of Q_D^* within 20% error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2015 07:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Considering the normal sandwiched\nstructure of perovskite solar cells, i.e. the intrinsic perovskite layer is\nsituated in an electric field built by p-type (Spiro-OMeTAD) and n-type (TiO2)\nlayers, the poling process also works in such devices. The migration of ions\nwill induce a new electric field with opposite direction as inherent built-in\nelectric field. As a consequence, less collection of photogenerated carriers is\npredicted due to the built-in electric field is partially screened. Here, the\nions induced electric field is experimentally demonstrated by exploring the\nexternal quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under various forward voltage biases.\nThe anomalous hysteresis observed on J-V curves is explained based on the\ninsight of ions migrations under bias voltage. The external applied voltage\npresents significant influence on the stability of solar cells.

They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology.

Then, the tether\nis reeled in while keeping the kite at a neutral position, thus leaving a net\namount of generated energy.

Here we describe the first two accurate and efficient algorithms to\ncompute the conformational entropy for RNA secondary structures, with respect\nto the Turner energy model, where free energy parameters are determined from UV\naborption experiments. An algorithm to compute the derivational entropy for RNA\nsecondary structures had previously been introduced, using stochastic context\nfree grammars (SCFGs). However, the numerical value of derivational entropy\ndepends heavily on the chosen context free grammar and on the training set used\nto estimate rule probabilities. Using data from the Rfam database, we determine\nthat both of our thermodynamic methods, which agree in numerical value, are\nsubstantially faster than the SCFG method. Thermodynamic structural entropy is\nmuch smaller than derivational entropy, and the correlation between\nlength-normalized thermodynamic entropy and derivational entropy is moderately\nweak to poor. In applications, we plot the structural entropy as a function of\ntemperature for known thermoswitches, determine that the correlation between\nhammerhead ribozyme cleavage activity and total free energy is improved by\nincluding an additional free energy term arising from conformational entropy,\nand plot the structural entropy of windows of the HIV-1 genome.
