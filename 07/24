The integral model is derived from\nradial integration of the governing equations expressing the conservation of\nmass, axial momentum and buoyancy. The non-uniform radial profiles of the axial\nvelocity and density deficit in the plume are explicitly described by shape\nfactors in the integral equations; the commonly-assumed top-hat profiles lead\nto shape factors equal to unity. The resultant model is hyperbolic when the\nmomentum shape factor, determined from the radial profile of the mean axial\nvelocity, differs from unity. The solutions of the model when source conditions\nare maintained at constant values retain the form of the well-established\nsteady plume solutions. We demonstrate that the inclusion of a momentum shape\nfactor that differs from unity leads to a well-posed integral model. Therefore,\nour model does not exhibit the mathematical pathologies that appear in\npreviously proposed unsteady integral models of turbulent plumes. A stability\nthreshold for the value of the shape factor is identified, resulting in a range\nof its values where the amplitude of small perturbations to the steady\nsolutions decay with distance from the source. The hyperbolic character of the\nsystem allows the formation of discontinuities in the fields describing the\nplume properties during the unsteady evolution. We compute numerical solutions\nto illustrate the transient development following an abrupt change in the\nsource conditions. The adjustment to the new source conditions occurs through\nthe propagation of a pulse of fluid through the plume. The dynamics of this\npulse are described by a similarity solution and, by constructing this new\nsimilarity solution, we identify three regimes in which the evolution of the\ntransient pulse following adjustment of the source qualitatively differ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 17:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

It was shown that in the\nnon-rotating case this can lead to a much stronger equation of state\nindependence and our goal is to generalize the static relations to the rapidly\nrotating case and values of the spherical mode number $l\\ge2$. We employ\nrealistic equations of state that cover a very large range of stiffness in\norder to check better the universality of the relations.

To address this issue, several approaches\nthat train SVMs on many small chunks of large data sets separately have been\nproposed in the literature. So far, however, almost all these approaches have\nonly been empirically investigated. In addition, their motivation was always\nbased on computational requirements. In this work, we consider a localized SVM\napproach based upon a partition of the input space. For this local SVM, we\nderive a general oracle inequality. Then we apply this oracle inequality to\nleast squares regression using Gaussian kernels and deduce local learning rates\nthat are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions\non the regression function. This gives the first motivation for using local\nSVMs that is not based on computational requirements but on theoretical\npredictions on the generalization performance. We further introduce a\ndata-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show\nthat this method achieves the same learning rates as before. Finally, we\npresent some larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it\nachieves essentially the same test performance as a global SVM for a fraction\nof the computational requirements. In addition, it turns out that the\ncomputational requirements for the local SVMs are similar to those of a vanilla\nrandom chunk approach, while the achieved test errors are significantly better.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 19:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}

We also extracted an 8.7 micron\nimage from the mid-IR VLTI instrument MIDI. Our aim is to spatially resolve the\ninnermost region of the circumstellar environment. The diffraction-limited\nimage at 2.27 micron obtained by bispectrum speckle interferometry with NACO\nwith a spatial resolution of 57 mas shows an elongated component. The\naperture-synthesis imaging combining the NACO speckle data and AMBER data\n(2.2--2.29 micron) with a spatial resolution of 5.6x7.3 mas further resolves\nnot only this elongated component, but also the central star. The reconstructed\nimage reveals that the elongated component is a nearly edge-on disk with a size\nof ~180x50 mas lying in the E-W direction, and furthermore, that the southern\nhemisphere of the central star is severely obscured by the equatorial dust lane\nof the disk. The angular size of the disk is consistent with the distance that\nthe dust clouds that were ejected at the onset of the dimming event should have\ntraveled by the time of our observations, if we assume that the dust clouds\nmoved radially. This implies that the formation of the disk may be responsible\nfor the dimming event. The 8.7 micron image with a spatial resolution of 220\nmas extracted from the MIDI data taken in 2004 (seven years before the AMBER\nand NACO observations) shows an approximately spherical envelope without a\nsignature of the disk.

Gravitational billiards are generalizations of these classical\nbilliards which are amenable to both analytical and experimental\ninvestigations. Most previous work on gravitational billiards has been\nconcerned with two dimensional boundaries. In particular the case of linear\nboundaries, also known as the wedge billiard, has been widely studied. In this\nwork, we introduce a three dimensional version of the wedge; that is, we study\nthe nonlinear dynamics of a billiard in a constant gravitational field\ncolliding elastically with a linear cone of half angle $\\theta$. We derive a\ntwo-dimensional Poincar\\'{e} map with two parameters, the half angle of the\ncone and $\\ell$, the $z$-component of the billiard's angular momentum. Although\nthis map is sufficient to determine the future motion of the billiard, the\nthree-dimensional nature of the physical trajectory means that a periodic orbit\nof the mapping does not always correspond to a periodic trajectory in\ncoordinate space. We demonstrate several integrable cases of the parameter\nvalues, and analytically compute the system's fixed point, analyzing the\nstability of this orbit as a function of the parameters as well as its relation\nto the physical trajectory of the billiard. Next, we explore the phase space of\nthe system numerically. We find that for small values of $\\ell$ the conic\nbilliard exhibits behavior characteristic of two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian\nsystems with a discontinuity, and the dynamics is qualitatively similar to that\nof the wedge billiard, although the correspondence is not exact. As we increase\n$\\ell$ the dynamics becomes on the whole less chaotic, and the correspondence\nwith the wedge billiard is lost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 22:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

Under\nthe assumption of compact star cluster formation in merging galaxies, star\nclusters in haloes of 10^8 ~ 10^9 Msun can undergo rapid core-collapse leading\nto the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) with ~1000 Msun which directly\ncollapse into black holes with similar masses. Star clusters in halos of > 10^9\nMsun experience type-II supernovae before the formation of VMSs due to long\ncore-collapse time scales. We also model the subsequent growth of black holes\nvia accretion of residual stars in clusters. 2-body relaxation efficiently\nre-fills the loss cones of stellar orbits at larger radii and resonant\nrelaxation at small radii is the main driver for accretion of stars onto black\nholes.

This setting is useful for applications such\nas modeling dynamic scenes or shape deformations, where the visual scene or the\ndeformed objects can be modeled by a manifold. The proposed framework is\nnonparametric and uses the heat kernel (and its associated Brownian motion) on\nmanifolds as an averaging procedure.

In order to avoid explicit dependence on estimates of the\nheat kernel, we follow a Bayesian setting, where Brownian motion on $M$ induces\na prior distribution on the space of continuous functions $C([0,1], M)$.

While these behaviors are increasingly well\nunderstood for ensembles of linearly self-propelled particles, less is known\nabout the collective behaviors of active rotating particles where energy input\nat the particle level gives rise to rotational particle motion. A recent\nsimulation study revealed that active rotation can induce phase separation in\nmixtures of counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that of linearly\nself-propelled particles, the phase separation of counter-rotating fluids is\naccompanied by steady convective flows that originate at the fluid-fluid\ninterface. Here, we investigate the influence of these flows on the coarsening\ndynamics of actively rotating binary liquids using a phenomenological,\nhydrodynamic model that combines a Cahn-Hilliard equation for the fluid\ncomposition with a Navier-Stokes equation for the fluid velocity. The effect of\nactive rotation is introduced though an additional force within the\nNavier-Stokes equations that arises due to gradients in the concentrations of\nclockwise and counter-clockwise rotating particles. Depending on the strength\nof active rotation and that of frictional interactions with the stationary\nsurroundings, we observe and explain new dynamical behaviors such as \"active\ncoarsening\" via self-generated flows as well as the emergence of self-propelled\nvortex doublets. We confirm that many of the qualitative behaviors identified\nby the continuum model can also be found in discrete, particle-based\nsimulations of actively rotating liquids.

To\navoid dark count noise and dead time comes from quench circuit, we are planning\nto use APD in linear multiplication mode. SOI technology enables laminating\nreadout circuit and APD layer, and high-speed and low-noise signal reading\nregardless smaller gain of linear APD. This study shows design of linear APD by\nusing SOI fabrication process. We designed test element group (TEG) of linear\nAPD and inspected optimal structure of linear APD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 02:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

Offloading such traffic through complementary networks,\nsuch as a delay tolerant network formed by device-to-device (D2D)\ncommunications between mobile subscribers, is a promising solution to reduce\nthe cellular burdens. In the existing solutions, mobile users are assumed to be\nvolunteers who selfishlessly deliver the content to every other user in\nproximity while moving. However, practical users are selfish and they will\nevaluate their individual payoffs in the D2D sharing process, which may highly\ninfluence the network performance compared to the case of selfishless users. In\nthis paper, we take user selfishness into consideration and propose a network\nformation game to capture the dynamic characteristics of selfish behaviors. In\nthe proposed game, we provide the utility function of each user and specify the\nconditions under which the subscribers are guaranteed to converge to a stable\nnetwork. Then, we propose a practical network formation algorithm in which the\nusers can decide their D2D sharing strategies based on their historical\nrecords. Simulation results show that user selfishness can highly degrade the\nefficiency of data offloading, compared with ideal volunteer users. Also, the\ndecrease caused by user selfishness can be highly affected by the cost ratio\nbetween the cellular transmission and D2D transmission, the access delays, and\nmobility patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 05:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

We demonstrate how the growth of the State\nTransition Model Space can be mapped to the problem of finding the number of\npossible paths between the Least Upper Bound (LUB) and the Greatest Lower Bound\n(GLB) of a k-dimensional hypercube Lattice structure. We formally present the\nmathematics for doing a quantitative analysis of the space growth. The Naive\nAlgorithm has its main drawback in the hyperexponential explosion caused in the\nState Transition Model space. This is identified and the Semantic Implosion\nAlgorithm is proposed which exploits the temporal information embedded within\nthe i* model of an enterprise to reduce the rate of growth of the State\nTransition Model space. A comparative quantitative analysis between the two\napproaches concludes the superiority of the Semantic Implosion Algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 06:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-15"}

The problem of outlier detection is to find a small number of\ninstances that are apparently distant from the remaining instances. On the\nother hand, the objective of differential privacy is to conceal presence (or\nabsence) of any particular instance. Outlier detection and privacy protection\nare thus intrinsically conflicting tasks. In this paper, instead of reporting\noutliers detected, we present two types of differentially private queries that\nhelp to understand behavior of outliers. One is the query to count outliers,\nwhich reports the number of outliers that appear in a given subspace. Our\nformal analysis on the exact global sensitivity of outlier counts reveals that\nregular global sensitivity based method can make the outputs too noisy,\nparticularly when the dimensionality of the given subspace is high. Noting that\nthe counts of outliers are typically expected to be relatively small compared\nto the number of data, we introduce a mechanism based on the smooth upper bound\nof the local sensitivity. The other is the query to discovery top-$h$ subspaces\ncontaining a large number of outliers. This task can be naively achieved by\nissuing count queries to each subspace in turn. However, the variation of\nsubspaces can grow exponentially in the data dimensionality. This can cause\nserious consumption of the privacy budget. For this task, we propose an\nexponential mechanism with a customized score function for subspace discovery.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first trial to ensure\ndifferential privacy for distance-based outlier analysis. We demonstrated our\nmethods with synthesized datasets and real datasets.

MTD\nsampling is based on filling the free energy basins by biasing potentials and\nthus for cases with flat, broad and unbound free energy wells, the\ncomputational time to sample them becomes very large. To alleviate this\nproblem, we combine the standard Umbrella Sampling (US) technique with MTD to\nsample orthogonal collective variables (CVs) in a simultaneous way. Within this\nscheme, we construct the equilibrium distribution of CVs from biased\ndistributions obtained from independent MTD simulations with umbrella\npotentials. Reweighting is carried out by a procedure that combines US\nreweighting and Tiwary-Parrinello MTD reweighting within the Weighted Histogram\nAnalysis Method (WHAM). The approach is ideal for a controlled sampling of a CV\nin a MTD simulation, making it computationally efficient in sampling flat,\nbroad and unbound free energy surfaces. This technique also allows for a\ndistributed sampling of a high-dimensional free energy surface, further\nincreasing the computational efficiency in sampling. We demonstrate the\napplication of this technique in sampling high-dimensional surface for various\nchemical reactions using ab initio and QM/MM hybrid molecular dynamics\nsimulations.

However, this is not true in real scenario: most biological\ntissues are comprised of cell membranes, various intracellular and\nextracellular spaces, and of other compartments, where the water diffusion is\nreferred to have a non-Gaussian distribution. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI),\nrecently considered to be one sensitive biomarker, is an extension of diffusion\ntensor imaging, which quantifies the degree of non-Gaussianity of the\ndiffusion. This work proposes an efficient scheme of maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) in DKI: we start from the Rician noise model of the signal\nintensities. By augmenting a Von-Mises distributed latent phase variable, the\nRician likelihood is transformed to a tractable joint density without loss of\ngenerality. A fast computational method, an expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm for MLE is proposed in DKI. To guarantee the physical relevance of\nthe diffusion kurtosis we apply the ternary quartic (TQ) parametrization to\nutilize its positivity, which imposes the upper bound to the kurtosis. A\nFisher-scoring method is used for achieving fast convergence of the individual\ndiffusion compartments. In addition, we use the barrier method to constrain the\nlower bound to the kurtosis. The proposed estimation scheme is conducted on\nboth synthetic and real data with an objective of healthy human brain.

On the other hand, a reduction of this rate may increase the\namount of residual (or unburned) 13C at the end of the interpulse: in this\ncondition, the residual 13C is burned at higher temperature in the convective\nzone powered by the following TP.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, security\nanalysis, and evaluation of D-DEMOS, a complete e-voting system that is\ndistributed, privacy-preserving and end-to-end verifiable.

We also include a distributed,\nreplicated and fault-tolerant Bulletin Board component, that stores all\nnecessary election-related information, and allows any party to read and verify\nthe complete election process. Finally, we also incorporate trustees, i.e.,\nindividuals who control election result production while guaranteeing privacy\nand end-to-end-verifiability as long as their strong majority is honest. Our\nsystem is the first e-voting system whose voting operation is human verifiable,\ni.e., a voter can vote over the web, even when her web client stack is\npotentially unsafe, without sacrificing her privacy, and still be assured her\nvote was recorded as cast. Additionally, a voter can outsource election\nauditing to third parties, still without sacrificing privacy. Finally, as the\nnumber of auditors increases, the probability of election fraud going\nundetected is diminished exponentially. We provide a model and security\nanalysis of the system.

ESNs can provide employees\nwith various professional services to help them deal with daily work issues.\nMeanwhile, employees in companies are usually organized into different\nhierarchies according to the relative ranks of their positions. The company\ninternal management structure can be outlined with the organizational chart\nvisually, which is normally confidential to the public out of the privacy and\nsecurity concerns. In this paper, we want to study the IOC (Inference of\nOrganizational Chart) problem to identify company internal organizational chart\nbased on the heterogeneous online ESN launched in it. IOC is very challenging\nto address as, to guarantee smooth operations, the internal organizational\ncharts of companies need to meet certain structural requirements (about its\ndepth and width). To solve the IOC problem, a novel unsupervised method Create\n(ChArT REcovEr) is proposed in this paper, which consists of 3 steps: (1)\nsocial stratification of ESN users into different social classes, (2)\nsupervision link inference from managers to subordinates, and (3) consecutive\nsocial classes matching to prune the redundant supervision links. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on real-world online ESN dataset demonstrate that Create\ncan perform very well in addressing the IOC problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 13:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

An adaptive\ndecision rule stops the readout as soon as a desired level of confidence has\nbeen achieved, as opposed to setting a fixed readout time $t_f$. The\nperformance of the adaptive decision is characterized by the \"adaptive-decision\nspeedup,\" $t_f/T$. In this work, we reformulate this readout problem in terms\nof the first-passage time of a particle undergoing stochastic motion. This\nformalism allows us to theoretically establish the maximum achievable\nadaptive-decision speedups for several physical two-state readout\nimplementations. We show that for two common readout schemes (the Gaussian\nlatching readout and a readout relying on state-dependent decay), the speedup\nis bounded by $4$ and $2$, respectively, in the limit of high single-shot\nreadout fidelity. We experimentally study the achievable speedup in a\nreal-world scenario by applying the adaptive decision rule to a readout of the\nnitrogen-vacancy-center (NV-center) charge state. We find a speedup of $\\approx\n2$ with our experimental parameters. In addition, we propose a simple readout\nscheme for which the speedup can, in principle, be increased without bound as\nthe fidelity is increased. Our results should lead to immediate improvements in\nnanoscale magnetometry based on spin-to-charge conversion of the NV-center\nspin, and provide a theoretical framework for further optimization of the\nbandwidth of quantum measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 14:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 22:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 19:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}

We studied a static and polychromatic method for\nspectropolarimetry, applicable to stellar physics. Instead of modulating the\npolarization information temporally, as usually done in spectropolarimeters,\nthe modulation is performed in a spatial direction, orthogonal to the spectral\none. Thanks to the proportionality between phase retardance imposed by a\nbirefringent material and its thickness, birefringent wedges can be used to\ncreate this spatial modulation. The light is then spectrally cross-dispersed,\nand a full-Stokes determination of the polarization over the whole spectrum can\nbe obtained with a single-shot measurement. The use of Magnesium Fluoride\nwedges, for example, could lead to a compact, static polarimeter working at\nwavelengths from 0.115 mm up to 7 mm.

For low light-level depth imaging applications,\nsuch as remote sensing and robot vision, these systems use single-photon\ndetectors that resolve individual photon arrivals. Even so, they must detect a\nlarge number of photons to mitigate Poisson shot noise and reject anomalous\nphoton detections from background light. We introduce a novel framework for\naccurate depth imaging using a small number of detected photons in the presence\nof an unknown amount of background light that may vary spatially. It employs a\nPoisson observation model for the photon detections plus a union-of-subspaces\nconstraint on the discrete-time flux from the scene at any single pixel.\nTogether, they enable a greedy signal-pursuit algorithm to rapidly and\nsimultaneously converge on accurate estimates of scene depth and background\nflux, without any assumptions on spatial correlations of the depth or\nbackground flux. Using experimental single-photon data, we demonstrate that our\nproposed framework recovers depth features with 1.7 cm absolute error, using 15\nphotons per image pixel and an illumination pulse with 6.7-cm scaled\nroot-mean-square length.

While not universal, scaling relationships with\nexponents that are close to multiples of 1/4 are common and have been described\nin all major clades. Foremost among these relationships is the 3/4 scaling of\nmetabolism with mass which underpins the 1/4 power dependence of biological\nrates and times. Several models have been advanced to explain the underlying\nmechanistic drivers of such patterns, but questions regarding a disconnect\nbetween model structures and empirical data have limited their widespread\nacceptance. Notable among these is a fractal branching model which predicts\npower law scaling of both metabolism and physical dimensions. While a power law\nis a useful first approximation to many datasets, non-linearity in some large\ndata compilations suggest the possibility of more complex or alternative\nmechanisms. Here, we first show that quarter power scaling can be derived using\nonly the preservation of volume flow rate and velocity as model constraints.\nApplying our model to the specific case of land plants, we show that\nincorporating biomechanical principles and allowing different parts of plant\nbranching networks to be optimized to serve different functions predicts\nnon-linearity in allometric relationships, and helps explain why interspecific\nscaling exponents covary along a fractal continuum. We also demonstrate that\nwhile branching may be a stochastic process, due to the conservation of volume,\ndata may still be consistent with the expectations for a fractal network when\none examines subtrees within a tree. Data from numerous sources at the level of\nplant shoots, stems, petioles, and leaves show strong agreement with our model\npredictions.

First, we apply this approach to investigate dynamic\nstability of non-spherical bodies. We solve the equations that describe, in a\nsimplified way, the Newtonian dynamics of a self-gravitating non-rotating\nspheroidal body. We find that, after loss of stability, a contraction to a\nsingularity occurs only in a pure spherical collapse, and deviations from\nspherical symmetry prevent the contraction to the singularity through a\nstabilizing action of nonlinear non-spherical oscillations. The development of\ninstability leads to the formation of a regularly or chaotically oscillating\nbody, in which dynamical motion prevents the formation of the singularity.
