RW Aur A is a classical T Tauri star (CTTS) with an unusually rich\nemission line spectrum. In 2014 the star faded by ~ 3 magnitudes in the V band\nand went into a long-lasting minimum. In 2010 the star suffered from a similar\nfading, although less deep. These events in RW Aur A are very unusual among the\nCTTS, and have been attributed to occultations by passing dust clouds. Aims. We\nwant to find out if any spectral changes took place after the last fading of RW\nAur A with the intention to gather more information on the occulting body and\nthe cause of the phenomenon. Methods. We collected spectra of the two\ncomponents of RW Aur. Photometry was made before and during the minimum.\nResults. The overall spectral signatures reflecting emission from accretion\nflows from disk to star did not change after the fading. However, blue-shifted\nabsorption components related to the stellar wind had increased in strength in\ncertain resonance lines, and the profiles and strengths, but not fluxes, of\nforbidden lines had become drastically different. Conclusions. The extinction\nthrough the obscuring cloud is grey indicating the presence of large dust\ngrains. At the same time, there are no traces of related absorbing gas. The\ncloud occults the star and the interior part of the stellar wind, but not the\nwind/jet further out. The dimming in 2014 was not accompanied by changes in the\naccretion flows at the stellar surface. There is evidence that the structure\nand velocity pattern of the stellar wind did change significantly. The dimmings\ncould be related to passing condensations in a tidally disrupted disk, as\nproposed earlier, but we also speculate that large dust grains have been\nstirred up from the inclined disk into the line-of-sight through the\ninteraction with an enhanced wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 17:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

For several types of DM-Standard Model couplings, a\nmeaningful interpretation of the results requires to go beyond effective field\ntheory, considering simplified models with light mediators. This is especially\nimportant in the case of loop-mediated interactions. In this paper we perform\nthe first simplified model study of the magnetic dipole interacting DM, by\nincluding the one-loop momentum-dependent form factors that mediate the\ncoupling -- given by the Dark Penguin -- in collider processes. We compute\nbounds from the monojet, monophoton, and diphoton searches at the $8$ and $14$\nTeV LHC, and compare the results to those of direct and indirect detection\nexperiments. Future searches at the $100$ TeV hadron collider and at the ILC\nare also addressed. We find that the optimal search strategy requires loose\ncuts on the missing transverse energy, to capture the enhancement of the form\nfactors near the threshold for on-shell production of the mediators. We\nconsider both minimal models and models where an additional state beyond the DM\nis accessible. In the latter case, under the assumption of anarchic flavor\nstructure in the dark sector, the LHC monophoton and diphoton searches will be\nable to set much stronger bounds than in the minimal scenario. A determination\nof the mass of the heavier dark fermion might be feasible using the $M_{T2}$\nvariable. In addition, if the Dark Penguin flavor structure is almost aligned\nwith that of the DM mass, a displaced signal from the decay of the heavier dark\nfermion into the DM and photon can be observed.

It allows for precision studies of QCD and is a\nsensitive probe of nuclear structure and dynamics. The large transverse\nmomentum (P_{J_T}) of the final state jet $J$, characterizes the hard scale in\nthe problem. The region of phase space where tau_1 << P_{J_T}, corresponds to\nconfigurations where energetic radiation (E~ P_{J_T}) is only along either the\nsingle jet direction or the beam direction with only soft radiation (E ~ \\tau_1\n<<P_{J_T}) in between. Thus, the restriction tau_1 << P_{J_T} corresponds to a\nveto on additional jets and leads to large Sudakov logarithms of \\tau_1/P_{J_T}\nthat must be resummed. Based on a factorization framework, derived using the\nSoft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), we provide resummation results at the\nNNLL level of accuracy and match them onto the NLO result in fixed order\nperturbation theory, appropriate in the \\tau_1 \\sim P_{J_T} region where\nadditional jets and hard radiation are allowed.

K\\\"onig and Smith [arXiv:1205.3409] and De Palma, Mari, and\nGiovannetti [arXiv:1402.0404] obtained quantum analogues of these inequalities\nfor continuous-variable quantum systems, where $X$ and $Y$ are replaced by\nbosonic fields and the addition rule is the action of a beamsplitter with\ntransmissivity $a$ on those fields. In this paper, we similarly establish a\nclass of EPI analogues for $d$-level quantum systems (i.e. qudits). The\nunderlying addition rule for which these inequalities hold is given by a\nquantum channel that depends on the parameter $a \\in [0,1]$ and acts like a\nfinite-dimensional analogue of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$,\nconverting a two-qudit product state into a single qudit state. We refer to\nthis channel as a partial swap channel because of the particular way its output\ninterpolates between the states of the two qudits in the input as $a$ is\nchanged from zero to one. We obtain analogues of Shannon's EPI, not only for\nthe von Neumann entropy and the entropy power for the output of such channels,\nbut for a much larger class of functions as well.

Finding\nradio-loud quasars at the highest accessible redshifts (z~6) is important to\nstudy their properties and environments at even earlier cosmic time. They would\nalso serve as background sources for radio surveys intended to study the\nintergalactic medium beyond the epoch of reionization in HI 21 cm absorption.\nCurrently, only five radio-loud ($R=f_{\\nu,5{\\rm GHz}}/f_{\\nu,4400\\AA}>10$)\nquasars are known at z~6. In this paper we search for 5.5 < z < 7.2 quasars by\ncross-matching the optical Pan-STARRS1 and radio FIRST surveys. The radio\ninformation allows identification of quasars missed by typical color-based\nselections. While we find no good 6.4 < z <7.2 quasar candidates at the\nsensitivities of these surveys, we discover two new radio-loud quasars at z~6.\nFurthermore, we identify two additional z~6 radio-loud quasars which were not\npreviously known to be radio-loud, nearly doubling the current z~6 sample. We\nshow the importance of having infrared photometry for z>5.5 quasars to robustly\nclassify them as radio-quiet or radio-loud. Based on this, we reclassify the\nquasar J0203+0012 (z=5.72), previously considered radio-loud, to be\nradio-quiet. Using the available data in the literature, we constrain the\nradio-loud fraction of quasars at z~6, using the Kaplan--Meier estimator, to be\n$8.1^{+5.0}_{-3.2}\\%$.

A fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each\nbase as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or from an\nN-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous work has used simple\nparametric distributions to model transitions from state to state in a hidden\nMarkov model (HMM) of VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via\nthe same process across sites.

We demonstrate that although these channels have\nin general very limited reach, they are viable for the detection of light\npseudoscalars in some parts of parameter space and can serve as an important\ncomplementary probe to the dominant gluon-fusion production mode. We also\ndemonstrate that in a Higgsfactory these channels may reach sensitivities\ncomparable to or even exceeding the gluon fusion channels at the LHC, thus\npossibly rendering this our best option to discover a light pseudoscalar. It is\nalso worth mentioning that for the singlet dominated scalar this may be the\nonly way to measure its couplings to gauge bosons. Especially promising are\nchannels where the initial scalar is radiated off a W as these events have\nrelatively high rates and provide substantial background suppression due to\nleptons from the W. We identify three benchmark points that well represent the\nabove scenarios. Assuming that the masses of the scalars and pseudoscalars are\nalready measured in the gluon-fusion channel, the event kinematics can be\nfurther constrained, hence significantly improving detection prospects.

The radar operates in two modes,\ninterference-mitigation mode when it avoids interference with the CoMP system\nand cooperation mode when it exchanges information with it.

Being born with\nmasses ~1.1 Msun, hybrid WDs in a binary system may easily approach the\nChandrasekhar mass (MCh) by accretion and give rise to a thermonuclear\nexplosion. Here, we investigate an off-centre deflagration in a near-MCh hybrid\nWD under the assumption that nuclear burning only occurs in carbon-rich\nmaterial. Performing hydrodynamics simulations of the explosion and detailed\nnucleosynthesis post-processing calculations, we find that only 0.014 Msun of\nmaterial is ejected while the remainder of the mass stays bound. The ejecta\nconsist predominantly of iron-group elements, O, C, Si and S. We also calculate\nsynthetic observables for our model and find reasonable agreement with the\nfaint Type Iax SN 2008ha. This shows for the first time that deflagrations in\nnear-MCh WDs can in principle explain the observed diversity of Type Iax\nsupernovae. Leaving behind a near-MCh bound remnant opens the possibility for\nrecurrent explosions or a subsequent accretion-induced collapse in faint Type\nIax SNe, if further accretion episodes occur. From binary population synthesis\ncalculations, we find the rate of hybrid WDs approaching MCh to be on the order\nof 1 percent of the Galactic SN Ia rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 11:25:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 13:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

Most Bayesian variable selection methods are restricted\nto mixture priors having separate components for characterizing the signal and\nthe noise. However, such priors encounter computational issues in high\ndimensions. This has motivated continuous shrinkage priors, resembling the\ntwo-component priors facilitating computation and interpretability. While such\npriors are widely used for estimating high-dimensional sparse vectors,\nselecting a subset of variables remains a daunting task. In this article, we\npropose a general approach for variable selection with shrinkage priors. The\npresence of very few tuning parameters makes our method attractive in\ncomparison to adhoc thresholding approaches. The applicability of the approach\nis not limited to continuous shrinkage priors, but can be used along with any\nshrinkage prior.

A brief description\nof the filter equations its aesthetics, beauty, truth, fascinating perspectives\nand competence are described. For a Kalman filter design to provide optimal\nestimates tuning of its statistics namely initial state and covariance, unknown\nparameters, and state and measurement noise covariances is important. The\nearlier tuning approaches are reviewed. The present approach is a reference\nrecursive recipe based on multiple filter passes through the data without any\noptimization to reach a `statistical equilibrium' solution. It utilizes the a\npriori, a posteriori, and smoothed states, their corresponding predicted\nmeasurements and the actual measurements help to balance the measurement\nequation and similarly the state equation to help form a generalized likelihood\ncost function. The filter covariance at the end of each pass is heuristically\nscaled up by the number of data points is further trimmed to statistically\nmatch the exact estimates and Cramer Rao Bounds (CRBs) available with no\nprocess noise provided the initial covariance for subsequent passes. During\nsimulation studies with process noise the matching of the input and estimated\nnoise sequence over time and in real data the generalized cost functions helped\nto obtain confidence in the results. Simulation studies of a constant signal, a\nramp, a spring, mass, damper system with a weak non linear spring constant,\nlongitudinal and lateral motion of an airplane was followed by similar but more\ninvolved real airplane data was carried out in MATLAB. In all cases the present\napproach was shown to provide internally consistent and best possible estimates\nand their CRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 15:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

For these major cities we investigated the\nsuperlinear scaling for three separate modalities: the cities defined as\nmunicipalities, their urban agglomerations and their urban areas. We find\nsuperlinearity with power-law exponents of around 1.15. But remarkably, both\ntypes of agglomerations underperform if we compare for the same size of\npopulation an agglomeration with a city as a municipality. In other words, an\nurban system as one formal municipality performs better as compared to an urban\nagglomeration with the same population size. This effect is larger for the\nsecond type of agglomerations, the urban areas. We think this finding has\nimportant implications for urban policy, in particular municipal\nreorganizations.

Einstein's 1911 theory was considerably\nimproved by Robert Dicke in 1957, but only recently has the equivalence of the\nvariable speed of light approach to the conventional formalism been\ndemonstrated (Broekaert, 2008). Using Green's functions, we show that\nEinstein's 1911 idea can be expressed in an analytic form, similar to the\nPoisson equation. Using heuristic arguments, we derive a simple formula that\ndirectly relates curvature $w$ to the local speed of light, $w= -c^2 \\Delta\n\\frac{1}{c^2}$. In contrast to the conventional formulation, this allows for a\nMachian interpretation of general relativity and the gravitational constant\n$G$.
