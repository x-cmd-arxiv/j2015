This feature reflects the distance from the Sun that an\nelectron beam can drive the observable plasma emission mechanism. The stopping\nfrequency has never been systematically studied before from a theoretical\nperspective. Using numerical kinetic simulations, we explore the different\nparameters that dictate how far an electron beam can travel before it stops\ninducing a significant level of Langmuir waves, responsible for plasma radio\nemission. We use the quasilinear approach to model self-consistently the\nresonant interaction between electrons and Langmuir waves in inhomogeneous\nplasma, and take into consideration the expansion of the guiding magnetic flux\ntube and the turbulent density of the interplanetary medium. We find that the\nrate of radial expansion has a significant effect on the distance an electron\nbeam travels before enhanced leves of Langmuir waves, and hence radio waves,\ncease. Radial expansion of the guiding magnetic flux tube rarefies the electron\nstream to the extent that the density of non-thermal electrons is too low to\ndrive Langmuir wave production. The initial conditions of the electron beam\nhave a significant effect, where decreasing the beam density or increasing the\nspectral index of injected electrons would cause higher type III stopping\nfrequencies. We also demonstrate how the intensity of large-scale density\nfluctuations increases the highest frequency that Langmuir waves can be driven\nby the beam and how the magnetic field geometry can be the cause of type III\nbursts only observed at high coronal frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 16:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

We found a counterpart\nwith B = 28.21+/-0.16. An XMM-Newton observation from a previous outburst\nyielded a spectrum that is well described by an absorbed power law with\nabsorption equivalent to ~2.6 E+21 H atom cm^(-2) and photon index ~1.8; the\nhighest quality Chandra spectrum yielded only $\\sim$130 counts, and best fits\nconsistent with the XMM-Newton results. We calculated an absolute V magnitude\nof +1.9 during outburst for a typical disk spectrum. An empirical relation\nbetween the ratio of X-ray to optical flux and orbital period suggests a period\n< ~4 hr for a black hole accretor. Such a short period is expected to yield an\nasymmetric, precessing disk, and we propose that the observed decay lightcurve\nis due to modulation of the mass transfer rate due to the disk precession.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 16:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we\nconclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in\npotential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the\ndissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the\nfusion hindrance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 18:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

Instead, if a\nLagrangean with non-negative values is considered as well, an optimal control\nproblem can be defined in relation to the corresponding integral functional.\n  In the first part of the present paper we show that the existence of a\nMinimum Restraint Function -- a solution of a strict Hamilton-Jacobi inequality\ninvolving the Lagrangian and a non-negative \"savings multiplier\" -- provides\nnot only global asymptotic controllability but also savings, namely a\nstate-dependent upper bound for the infima. This extends a former result, where\nthe control set was assumed to be compact. Here we allow unbounded controls and\nreplace inputs' values' compactness with a quite mild hypothesis concerning the\ndependence of the data on inputs: such condition is met, for instance, by\ncontrol vector fields that are compositions of Lipschitz maps with polynomials\nand exponentials of the control variable.\n  In the second part of the paper we focus on the case when the dynamics is a\npolynomial in the control variable. Through some analysis of convexity\nproperties of vector-valued polynomials' ranges, we prove some simplified\nversions of the main result, in terms of either affine representability or\nreduction to weak subsystems for the original dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 18:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 08:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

EFMs-based\nmetabolic flux analysis (MFA) estimates the flux over each EFM from external\nflux measurements through least-squares data fitting. In previous work we\npresented an optimization method of column generation type that facilitates\nEFMs-based MFA when the metabolic reaction network is so large that enumerating\nall EFMs is prohibitive. In this work we extend this model by including errors\non measurements in a robust optimization framework. In the robust optimization\nproblem, the least-squares data fitting is minimized subject to the error on\neach metabolite being as unfavourable as it can be, within a given interval. In\ngeneral, inclusion of robustness may make the optimization problem\nsignificantly harder. However, we show that in our case the robust problem can\nbe stated as a convex quadratic programming problem, i.e., of the same form as\nthe original non-robust problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that the\ncolumn-generation technique of the non-robust problem can be extended also to\nthe robust problem. Furthermore, the option to indicate intervals on\nmetabolites that are not measured is introduced in this column generation\nframework. The effect of including robustness in the model is evaluated in a\ncase-study, which indicated that the solutions of our non-robust problems are\nin fact near-optimal also when robustness is considered. On the other hand, the\naddition of intervals on unmeasured metabolites resulted in a change of optimal\nsolution.

It is equally successful in describing\nboth the stationary limit and the dynamics, including regions of the parameter\nspace where the numerical integration of the full problem is significantly less\nefficient. We further develop a Gaussian approach consistent with our theory,\nwhich yields sensibly better results than the previous Gaussian methods\ndeveloped for this system, most notably standard linearization techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 19:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We explore a new technique to constrain the matter power\nspectrum on smaller scales, assuming the dark matter is a Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particle (WIMP) that annihilates at early epochs. Energy released by\ndark matter annihilation can modify the spectrum of CMB temperature\nfluctuations and thus CMB experiments such as Planck have been able to\nconstrain the quantity f <sigma v> /m < 1/88 picobarn c / GeV, where f is the\nfraction of energy absorbed by gas, <sigma v> is the annihilation rate assumed\nconstant, and m is the particle mass. We assume the standard scale-invariant\nprimordial matter power spectrum of P_prim(k) ~ k^{n_s} at large scales k <\nk_p, while we adopt the modified power law of P_prim(k) ~ k_p^{n_s}\n(k/k_p)^{m_s} at small scales. We then aim at deriving constraints on m_s. For\nm_s > n_s, the excess small-scale power results in a much larger number of\nnonlinear small mass halos, particularly at high redshifts. Dark matter\nannihilation in these halos releases sufficient energy to partially ionize the\ngas, and consequently modify the spectrum of CMB fluctuations.

This observational evidence is the\nbasis of the radio-gamma-ray connection established for the class of active\ngalactic nuclei known as blazars. In particular, the main spectral property of\nthe radio counterparts associated with gamma-ray blazars is that they show a\nflat spectrum in the GHz frequency range. Our recent analysis dedicated to\nsearch blazar-like candidates as potential counterparts for the unidentified\ngamma-ray sources (UGSs) allowed us to extend the radio-gamma-ray connection in\nthe MHz regime. We also showed that below 1 GHz blazars maintain flat radio\nspectra. Thus on the basis of these new results, we assembled a low-frequency\nradio catalog of flat spectrum sources built by combining the radio\nobservations of the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS) and of the\nWesterbork in the southern hemisphere (WISH) catalog with those of the NRAO\nVery Large Array Sky survey (NVSS).

The state of matter at\nsuch high densities and low temperatures is believed to be a phase known as the\ncolor-flavor locked phase which breaks color and electromagnetic gauge\ninvariance leaving a linear combination of them unbroken. Of the 9 quarks\n(three flavors and three colors), five are neutral under this unbroken\ngenerator and four are oppositely charged. In the presence of a magnetic field\ncorresponding to the unbroken generator however, the properties of the\ncondensate changes and a new phase known as the magnetic color flavor locked\n(MCFL)phase is realized. This phase breaks some of the color-flavor symmetry of\nthe Lagrangian spontaneously, giving rise to 6 Goldstone modes, 5 of which are\npseudo Goldstone modes. These Goldstone modes are composed of excitations that\ncorrespond to both neutral quarks and charged quarks. Hence it is natural to\nexpect that the propagators of these Goldstone modes get affected in the\npresence of a magnetic field and their speed becomes considerably anisotropic.\nAlthough this anisotropy is self-evident from symmetry arguments, it has not\nbeen quantified yet. We calculate this anisotropy in the speed of the Goldstone\nmodes using an NJL model type of interaction between the quarks and comment on\nthe impact of such anisotropic modes on the transport properties of the MCFL\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

The climatic effects of the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events\nwere felt globally, although the North Atlantic experienced the largest and\nmost abrupt temperature anomalies. Similar but weaker oscillations also took\nplace during the interglacial period. This paper proposes an auto-oscillatory\nmechanism between sea ice and convective deep water formation in the north\nAtlantic as the source of the persistent cycles. A simple dynamical model is\nconstructed by coupling and slightly modifying two existing models of ocean\ncirculation and sea ice. The model exhibits mixed mode oscillations, consisting\nof decadal scale small amplitude oscillations, and a large amplitude relaxation\nfluctuation. The decadal oscillations occur due to the insulating effect of sea\nice and leads to periodic ventilation of heat from the polar ocean. Gradually\nan instability builds up in the polar column and results in an abrupt\ninitiation of convection and polar warming. The unstable convective state\nrelaxes back to the small amplitude oscillations from where the process repeats\nin a self-sustained manner. Freshwater pulses mimicking Heinrich events cause\nthe oscillations to be grouped into packets of progressively weaker\nfluctuations, as also observed in the proxy records. Modulation of this stable\noscillation mechanism by freshwater and insolation variations could account for\nthe distribution and pacing of DO and Bond events. Physical aspects of the\nsystem such as sea ice extent and oceanic advective flow rates could determine\nthe characteristic 1,500 year timescale of DO events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Assuming the\norbital period of the planet is known and the signal is periodic, we illustrate\nthat systematic noise can be removed in Fourier space at all frequencies, by\nonly using data within a fixed time frame with a width equal to an integer\nnumber of orbital periods. This results in a reconstruction of the full transit\nsignal which on average is unbiased, despite that no prior knowledge of either\nthe noise or the transit signal itself is used in the analysis. The method has\ntherefore clear advantages over standard phase folding, which normally requires\nexternal input such as nearby stars or noise models for removing systematic\ncomponents. In addition, we can extract the full orbital transit signal ($360$\ndegrees) simultaneously, and \\emph{Kepler} like data can be analyzed in just a\nfew seconds. We illustrate the performance of our method by applying it to a\ndataset composed of light curves from \\emph{Kepler} with a fake injected signal\nemulating a planet with rings.

Using\nthis database, the accuracy of localization - both in terms of knowing which\nroute a user is on - and in terms of position along a certain route, can be\nevaluated.

In practice, these resources have an\nassociated cost that depends on either the resiliency level achieved by the\npreventive resource, or the restoration efficiency of the corrective resource.\nWe present a mathematical framework, based on dynamic systems theory and convex\noptimization, to find the cost-optimal distribution of protection resources in\na network to contain the spread.

Properties of the number of\ncoalescent histories for gene trees and species trees affect a variety of\nprobabilistic calculations in mathematical phylogenetics. Exact and asymptotic\nevaluations of the number of coalescent histories, however, are known only in a\nlimited number of cases. Here we introduce a particular family of species\ntrees, the \\emph{lodgepole} species trees $(\\lambda_n)_{n\\geq 0}$, in which\ntree $\\lambda_n$ has $m=2n+1$ taxa. We determine the number of coalescent\nhistories for the lodgepole species trees, in the case that the gene tree\nmatches the species tree, showing that this number grows with $m!!$ in the\nnumber of taxa $m$. This computation demonstrates the existence of tree\nfamilies in which the growth in the number of coalescent histories is faster\nthan exponential. Further, it provides a substantial improvement on the lower\nbound for the ratio of the largest number of matching coalescent histories to\nthe smallest number of matching coalescent histories for trees with $m$ taxa,\nincreasing a previous bound of $(\\sqrt{\\pi} / 32)[(5m-12)/(4m-6)] m \\sqrt{m}$\nto $[ \\sqrt{m-1}/(4 \\sqrt{e}) ]^{m}$.

The system we analyze here consists of two\ncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators each interacting with its own bath\ndescribed by a scalar field, set at temperatures $T_1 > T_2$. For\n\\textit{constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling} studied here (Case C1)\nowing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be solved exactly at arbitrary\ntemperatures even for strong coupling. We find that the valid entanglement\ncriterion in general is not a function of the bath temperature difference, in\ncontrast to thermal transport in the same NESS setting [1]. Thus lowering the\ntemperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard\nthe entanglement between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will\ndisappear if any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the\ncritical temperature $T_c$. With the Langevin equations derived we give a full\ndisplay of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$\n, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For\nweak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature $T_c$ is about the order\nof the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it\nwill depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic\ncircumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling,\n`hot entanglement' is largely a fiction.

Each test takes as input a group of items and produces a binary output\nindicating whether any defective item is present in the group. In a\nnon-adaptive scheme designing a testing scheme is equivalent to the\nconstruction of a disjunct matrix, an $M \\times N$ binary matrix where the\nunion of supports of any $t$ columns does not contain the support of any other\ncolumn. In this paper we consider the scenario where defective items are random\nand follow simple probability distributions. In particular we consider the\ncases where 1) each item can be defective independently with probability\n$\\frac{t}{N}$ and 2) each $t$-set of items can be defective with uniform\nprobability. In both cases our aim is to design a testing matrix that\nsuccessfully identifies the set of defectives with high probability.

We go beyond the minimum distance analysis\nand connect the average distance of a constant weight code to the parameters of\nthe resulting test matrix.

By exploiting the sparsity, adaptive sparse channel estimation\n(ASCE) algorithms, e.g., least mean square with reweighted L1-norm constraint\n(LMS-RL1) algorithm, could bring a considerable performance gain under\nassumption of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). In practical scenario of\nwireless systems, however, channel estimation performance is often deteriorated\nby unexpected non-Gaussian mixture noises which include AWGN and impulsive\nnoises. To design stable communication systems, sign LMS-RL1 (SLMS-RL1)\nalgorithm is proposed to remove the impulsive noise and to exploit channel\nsparsity simultaneously. It is well known that regularization parameter (REPA)\nselection of SLMS-RL1 is a very challenging issue.

Eliminating this variance\nallows us to use search-subspaces of dimensions many times greater than would\notherwise be possible, allowing us to sample very rare events that a\nlower-dimensional search-subspace would be unlikely to intersect.\n  To extend this method to events that are rare for reasons other than their\nsupport $\\mathcal{M}$ having a lower dimension, we formulate and prove a new\ntheorem in integral geometry that makes use of the curvature form of the\nChern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem to reweight sampling probabilities. On the side, we\nalso apply our theorem to obtain new theoretical bounds for the volumes of real\nalgebraic manifolds.\n  Finally, we demonstrate the computational effectiveness and speedup of our\nmethod by numerically applying it to the conditional stochastic Airy operator\nsampling problem in random matrix theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 08:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

A major challenge in a MCMR-WMN is finding the routing with\nQoS satisfied and an interference free path from the redundant paths, in order\nto transmit the packets through this path. The Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) is an optimization technique to find the candidate solution in the search\nspace optimally, and it applies artificial intelligence to solve the routing\nproblem. On the other hand, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population based\nmeta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the natural evolution, such\nas selection,mutation and crossover.

DGCC builds dependency graphs for batched transactions before\nexecuting them. Using these graphs, contentions within the same batch of\ntransactions are resolved before execution. As a result, the execution of the\ntransactions does not need to deal with contention while maintaining full\nequivalence to that of serialized execution. This better exploits multicore\nhardware and achieves higher level of parallelism. To facilitate DGCC, we have\nalso proposed a system architecture that does not have certain centralized\ncontrol components yielding better scalability, as well as supports a more\nefficient recovery mechanism.

The hyperfine interaction\nbetween electron and nuclear spins in a quantum dot allows for the transfer of\nangular momentum from spin-polarized electrons injected from ferromagnetic or\nhalf-metal leads to the nuclear spin system under a finite voltage bias.\nAccounting for a local nuclear-spin dephasing process prevents the system from\nbecoming stuck in collective dark states, allowing a large nuclear polarization\nto be built up in the long-time limit. After reaching a steady state, reversing\nthe voltage bias induces a transient current response as the nuclear\npolarization is reversed. Long-range nuclear-spin coherence leads to a strong\nenhancement of spin-flip transition rates (by an amount proportional to the\nnumber of nuclear spins) and is revealed by an intense current burst, analogous\nto superradiant light emission. The crossover to a regime with incoherent spin\nflips occurs on a relatively long time scale, on the order of the\nsingle-nuclear-spin dephasing time, which can be much longer than the time\nscale for the superradiant current burst. This conclusion is confirmed through\na general master equation. For the two limiting regimes (coherent/incoherent\nspin flips) the general master equation recovers our simpler treatment based on\nrate equations, but is also applicable at intermediate dephasing. Throughout\nthis work we assume uniform hyperfine couplings, which yield the strongest\ncoherent enhancement. We propose realistic strategies, based on isotopic\nmodulation and wavefunction engineering in core-shell nanowires, to realize\nthis analytically solvable \"box-model\" of hyperfine couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 09:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 08:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

By combining symmetry and energetic arguments, we derive general and\nexperimentally accessible selection rules for Cooper instabilities in\nnoncentrosymmetric systems which yield necessary and sufficient conditions for\nspontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking at the superconducting transition\nand constrain the orientation of the triplet vector.

All pairing states of this system\nallowed by the selection rules are predicted to display topological Majorana\nmodes at dislocations or at the edge of the system.

Using density functional theory calculations, we find that an\nelectric field, E_ext, applied normal to a 2D black phosphorus thin film, can\nreduce the direct band gap of few-layer black phosphorus, resulting in an\ninsulator-to-metal transition at a critical field, E_c. Increasing E_ext beyond\nE_c can induce a Dirac cone in the system, provided the black phosphorus film\nis sufficiently thin. The electric field strength can tune the position of the\nDirac cone and the Dirac-Fermi velocities, the latter being similar in\nmagnitude to that in graphene. We show that the Dirac cone arises from an\nanisotropic interaction term between the frontier orbitals that are spatially\nseparated due to the applied field, on different halves of the 2D slab. When\nthis interaction term becomes vanishingly small for thicker films, the Dirac\ncone can no longer be induced.

However, this recommendation is very challenging compared to the\ntraditional recommender systems. A user can visit only a limited number of\nspatial items, leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. Most of the items\nvisited by a user are located within a short distance from where he/she lives,\nwhich makes it hard to recommend items when the user travels to a far away\nplace. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary dramatically\nacross different geographical regions. In light of this, we propose Geo-SAGE, a\ngeographical sparse additive generative model for spatial item recommendation\nin this paper. Geo-SAGE considers both user personal interests and the\npreference of the crowd in the target region, by exploiting both the\nco-occurrence pattern of spatial items and the content of spatial items. To\nfurther alleviate the data sparsity issue, Geo-SAGE exploits the geographical\ncorrelation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial\nindex structure called spatial pyramid. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the performance of our Geo-SAGE model on two real large-scale\ndatasets.

Following our previous work on\nthe evolution of PAHs in the NGC 7023 reflection nebula, we evaluate, using\nphotochemical modeling, the possibility that the PAH C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ (i.e.\ncircumovalene) can lead to the formation of C$_{60}$ upon irradiation by\nultraviolet photons. The chemical pathway involves full dehydrogenation,\nfolding into a floppy closed cage and shrinking of the cage by loss of C$_2$\nunits until it reaches the symmetric C$_{60}$ molecule. At 10\" from the\nilluminating star and with realistic molecular parameters, the model predicts\nthat 100% of C$_{66}$H$_{20}$ is converted into C$_{60}$ in $\\sim$ 10$^5$\nyears, a timescale comparable to the age of the nebula. Shrinking appears to be\nthe kinetically limiting step of the whole process. Hence, PAHs larger than\nC$_{66}$H$_{20}$ are unlikely to contribute significantly to the formation of\nC$_{60}$, while PAHs containing between 60 and 66 C atoms should contribute to\nthe formation of C$_{60}$ with shorter timescales, and PAHs containing less\nthan 60 C atoms will be destroyed. Assuming a classical size distribution for\nthe PAH precursors, our model predicts absolute abundances of C$_{60}$ are up\nto several $10^{-4}$ of the elemental carbon, i.e. less than a percent of the\ntypical interstellar PAH abundance, which is consistent with observational\nstudies. According to our model, once formed, C$_{60}$ can survive much longer\nthan other fullerenes because of the remarkable stability of the C$_{60}$\nmolecule at high internal energies.Hence, a natural consequence is that\nC$_{60}$ is more abundant than other fullerenes in highly irradiated\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 12:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 08:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 14:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

Elliptic\nequations with the Laplace-Beltrami and the surface bi-Laplacian operator as\nwell as the associated eigenvalue problems are considered. Thereby, efficiency\nrelies on the proper choice of a numerical quadrature scheme which preserves\nthe expected higher order consistency. A particular emphasis is on the\nrobustness of the approach in the vicinity of extraordinary vertices. In this\npaper, the focus is on Loop's subdivision scheme on triangular meshes.

These communication channels provide plenty of\nincentives (both economical and social) and opportunities for abuse. As social\nmedia activity became increasingly intertwined with the events in the offline\nworld, individuals and organizations have found ways to exploit these platforms\nto spread misinformation, to attack and smear others, or to deceive and\nmanipulate. During crises, social media have been effectively used for\nemergency response, but fear-mongering actions have also triggered mass\nhysteria and panic. Criminal gangs and terrorist organizations like ISIS adopt\nsocial media for propaganda and recruitment. Synthetic activity and social bots\nhave been used to coordinate orchestrated astroturf campaigns, to manipulate\npolitical elections and the stock market. The lack of effective content\nverification systems on many of these platforms, including Twitter and\nFacebook, rises concerns when younger users become exposed to cyber-bulling,\nharassment, or hate speech, inducing risks like depression and suicide. This\narticle illustrates some of the recent advances facing these issues and\ndiscusses what it remains to be done, including the challenges to address in\nthe future to make social media a more useful and accessible, safer and\nhealthier environment for all users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 14:50:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 03:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

The current measurements were\ncomplemented with Cepheid abundances either provided by our group (75) or\navailable in the literature, for a total of 439 Galactic Cepheids. Special\nattention was given in providing a homogeneous abundance scale for these five\nelements plus iron (Genovali et al. 2013, 2014). In addition, accurate\nGalactocentric distances (RG) based on near-infrared photometry are also\navailable for all the Cepheids in the sample (Genovali et al. 2014). They cover\na large fraction of the Galactic thin disk (4.1 <= RG <= 18.4 kpc). We found\nthat the above five elements display well defined linear radial gradients and\nmodest standard deviations over the entire range of RG. Moreover, the\n[element/Fe] abundance ratios are constant across the entire thin disk; only\nthe Ca radial distribution shows marginal evidence of a positive slope. These\nresults indicate that the chemical enrichment history of iron and of the quoted\nfive elements has been quite similar across the four quadrants of the Galactic\nthin disk. The [element/Fe] ratios are also constant over the entire period\nrange. This empirical evidence indicates that the chemical enrichment of\nGalactic Cepheids has also been very homogenous during the range in age that\nthey cover (~10-300 Myr). Once again, [Ca/Fe] vs. log(P) shows a (negative)\ngradient, being underabundant among youngest Cepheids.

Eisenbud,\nwhere the author describes the generic initial ideal by means of a suitable\ntotal order on the terms of an exterior power, we introduce first the generic\ninitial extensor of a subset of a Grassmannian and then the double-generic\ninitial ideal of a so-called GL-stable subset of a Hilbert scheme. We discuss\nthe features of these new notions and introduce also a partial order which\ngives another useful description of them. The double-generic initial ideals\nturn out to be the appropriate points to understand some geometric properties\nof a Hilbert scheme: they provide a necessary condition for a Borel ideal to\ncorrespond to a point of a given irreducible component, lower bounds for the\nnumber of irreducible components in a Hilbert scheme and the maximal Hilbert\nfunction in every irreducible component. Moreover, we prove that every isolated\ncomponent having a smooth double-generic initial ideal is rational. As a\nbyproduct, we prove that the Cohen-Macaulay locus of the Hilbert scheme\nparameterizing subschemes of codimension 2 is the union of open subsets\nisomorphic to affine spaces. This improves results by J. Fogarty (1968) and R.\nTreger (1989).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 15:25:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 10:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

In the model fibers break due to two mechanisms: slowly accumulating\ndamage triggers bursts of immediate breakings analogous to acoustic emissions\nin experiments. The rupture process accelerates such that the size of breaking\navalanches increases while the waiting time between consecutive events\ndecreases towards failure. Record events are defined as bursts which have a\nlarger size than all previous events in the time series. We analyze the\nstatistics of records focusing on the limit of equal load sharing (ELS) of the\nmodel and compare the results to the record statistics of sequences of\nindependent identically distributed random variables. Computer simulations\nrevealed that the number of records grows with the logarithm of the event\nnumber except for the close vicinity of macroscopic failure where an\nexponential dependence is evidenced. The two regimes can be attributed to the\ndominance of disorder with small burst sizes and to stress enhancements giving\nrise efficient triggering of extended bursts, respectively. Both the size of\nrecords and the increments between consecutive record events are characterized\nby power law distributions with a common exponent 1.33 significantly different\nfrom the usual ELS burst size exponents of fiber bundles. The distribution of\nwaiting times follows the same behavior, however, with two distinct exponents\nfor low and high loads. Studying the evolution of records we identify a load\ndependent characteristic scale of the system which separates slow down and\nacceleration of record breaking as failure is approached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 15:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

Using temperature-dependent\nspectroscopic ellipsometry at an $a$-plane oriented single crystal, we show how\nthe dielectric function is affected by the magnetic order transition at the\nN\\'eel temperature. We focus especially on the pronounced charge transfer\ntransitions around (1.6-1.7)eV which are strongly connected to Mn 3$d$\nelectrons. If described with a Bose-Einstein model, the temperature dependency\nof their energy and broadening is characterized by effective phonon energies\nnot larger than 8meV. We argue that this is a hint for the occurrence of a soft\nphonon mode related to the antiferromagnetic phase transition. This is observed\nin both tensor components of the dielectric function, parallel and\nperpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis. Furthermore, a suitable\nparametrization for the uniaxial dielectric function is presented for the\nNIR-VUV spectral range. The broad transitions at energies higher than a\ncritical point-like bandgap do not show a clear temperature dependence. We also\nobserve some weak discrete absorption features around the strong charge\ntransfer transitions with energies matching well to low-temperature\nphotoluminescence signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

The inter- and\nintra-laminar damage evolution is characterized for various configurations\nadhesively bonded by three structural adhesive systems. Typical situations are\nsimulated by means of a comprehensive moisture-dependent non-linear rheological\nfinite element model for wood with the capability to capture delaminations. The\nsimulations give insight into the role of different strain components such as\nvisco-elastic, mechano-sorptive, plastic, and hygro-elastic deformations under\nchanging moisture content in progressive damage and delamination. We show the\nstress buildup under cyclic hygric loading resulting in hygro-fatigue and\nmodify an analytical micro-mechanics of damage model, originally developed for\ncross-ply laminates, to describe the problem of moisture-induced damage in\nbeech lamellae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 10:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

Graph pruning is the process of identifying the\nmost significant edges according to a generative null model, and extracting the\nsubgraph consisting of those edges. Here, we focus on integer-weighted graphs\ncommonly arising when weights count the occurrences of an \"event\" relating the\nnodes. We introduce a simple and intuitive null model related to the\nconfiguration model of network generation, and derive two significance filters\nfrom it: the Marginal Likelihood Filter (MLF) and the Global Likelihood Filter\n(GLF). The former is a fast algorithm assigning a significance score to each\nedge based on the marginal distribution of edge weights whereas the latter is\nan ensemble approach which takes into account the correlations among edges. We\napply these filters to the network of air traffic volume between US airports\nand recover a geographically faithful representation of the graph. Furthermore,\ncompared with thresholding based on edge weight, we show that our filters\nextract a larger and significantly sparser giant component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 20:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 23:20:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 23:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 07:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}
