For the two-user case, we completely\ncharacterize the sum DoF for an arbitrary number of antennas and RF chains by\ndeveloping an achievable scheme optimized for the hybrid beam-forming structure\nand deriving its matching upper bound. For a general K-user case, we focus on a\nsymmetric case and obtain lower and upper bounds on the sum DoF, which are\ntight for certain cases. The results show that hybrid beam-forming can increase\nthe sum DoF of interference channel under certain conditions while it cannot\nimprove the sum DoFs of point-to-point channel, multiple access channel, and\nbroadcast channel. The key insights on this gain is that hybrid beam-forming\nenables users to manage inter user interference better, and thus each user can\nincrease the dimension of interference-free signal space for its own desired\nsignals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Apr 2015 16:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

The optimization setup\ncomprises the number of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to be installed on the\ngrid, a weight associated with each PMU, processing time at the control center\nfor the PMUs, and precedence constraints between the PMUs. The solution to the\nPMU placement problem yields the optimum number of PMUs to be installed on the\ngrid, while the processing times are picked uniformly at random from a\npredefined set. The weight associated with each PMU and the precedence\nconstraints are both assumed known. The scheduling problem is provably NP-hard,\nso we resort to approximation algorithms which provide solutions that are\nsuboptimal yet possessing polynomial time complexity.

This ambiguity gives way to unphysical\nconsequences: the projection rule could be applied in one or the other\ntemporal(?) order of measurements (being non local in any case), but symmetry\nof the roles of both subsystems would be broken.\n  An alternative theory is presented in which this ambiguity does not exist.\nObservable relative frequencies differ from those of orthodox Quantum\nMechanics, and a {\\it gendaken} experiment is proposed to falsify one or the\nother theory. In the alternative theory, each subsystem has an individual state\nin its own Hilbert space, and the total system state is direct product (rank\none) of both, so there is no entanglement. Correlation between subsystems\nappears through a hidden label that prescribes the output of arbitrary\nhypothetical measurements. Measurement is treated as a usual reversible\ninteraction, and this postulate allows to determine relative frequencies when\nthe value of a magnitude is known without in any way perturbing the system, by\nmeasurement of the correlated companion.\n  It is predicted the existence of an accompanying system, the de Broglie wave,\nintroduced in order to preserve the action reaction principle in indirect\nmeasurements, when there is no interaction of detector and particle. Some\naction on the detector, different from the one cause by a particle, should be\nobservable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 10:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

In\nthis acticle we show that a colossal magnetoresistance is realized in the state\nof the topological Kondo insulator, that is similar to the Kondo insulator\nstate in the Kondo lattice. The mechanism of the phenomenon is the following:\nin the spin gapless phase an external magnetic field induces the gap in the\nspectrum of spin excitations, the gap in the spectrum of fermions is opened due\nto a hybridization between spin and fermion subsystems at half filling, as the\nresult the magnetic field leads to metal-insulator (or bad metal - insulator)\nphase transition. A model of the topological Kondo lattice defined on a\nhoneycomb lattice is studied for the case when spinless fermion bands are half\nfilled. It is shown that the hybridization between local moments and itinerant\nfermions should be understood as the hybridization between corresponding\nMajorana fermions of the spin and charge sectors. The system is a topological\ninsulator, single fermion and spin excitations at low energies are massive. We\nwill show that a spin gap induces a gap in the charge channel, it leads to an\nappearance of a topological insulator state with chiral gapless edge modes and\nthe Chern number one or two depending on the exchange integrals' values.

We\npropose an approach to estimate any metric based on contingency tables,\nincluding ROC and PR curves, using only positive and unlabeled data. Estimating\nthese performance metrics is essentially reduced to estimating the fraction of\n(latent) positives in the unlabeled set, assuming known positives are a random\nsample of all positives.
