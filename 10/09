What triggered its\nactivity? We present ALMA Cycle 2 observations of cold molecular CO(6-5) gas\nand dust, which reveal that this is likely a gas-rich triple merger. It\nconsists of a close double nucleus (separation ~4 kpc) and a weak CO-emitter at\n~10 kpc distance, all of which have counterparts in HST/NICMOS imagery. The\nhyper-luminous starburst and powerful radio-AGN were triggered at this\nprecoalescent stage of the merger. The CO(6-5) traces dense molecular gas in\nthe central region, and complements existing CO(1-0) data, which revealed more\nwidespread tidal debris of cold gas. We also find ~10$^{10}$ M(sun) of\nmolecular gas with enhanced excitation at the highest velocities. At least\n20-50% of this high-excitation, high-velocity gas shows kinematics that\nsuggests it is being displaced and redistributed within the merger, although\nwith line-of-sight velocities of |v| < 500 km/s, this gas will probably not\nescape the system. The processes that drive the redistribution of cold gas are\nlikely related to either the gravitational interaction between two kpc-scale\ndiscs, or starburst/AGN-driven outflows. We estimate that the rate at which the\nmolecular gas is redistributed is at least ~1200 +- 500 M(sun)/yr, and could\nperhaps even approach the star formation rate of ~3000 +- 800 M(sun)/yr. The\nfact that the gas depletion and gas redistribution timescales are similar\nimplies that dynamical processes can be important in the evolution of massive\nhigh-z galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 16:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-07"}

To address the complexity of the model, we propose a\nBayesian hierarchical model, where a joint probability distribution is defined\nto determine the parameters (age, metallicity, IMF), from the observed data, in\nthis case the observed flux ratios \\Ha\\ / FUV. The joint distribution of the\nparameters is described through an i.i.d.

We present a general framework for knowledge distillation, whereby a\nconvenient model of our choosing learns how to mimic a complex model, by\nobserving the latter's behaviour and being penalized whenever it fails to\nreproduce it.\n  We develop our framework within the context of three distinct machine\nlearning applications: (a) model compression, where we compress large\ndiscriminative models, such as ensembles of neural networks, into models of\nmuch smaller size; (b) compact predictive distributions for Bayesian inference,\nwhere we distil large bags of MCMC samples into compact predictive\ndistributions in closed form; (c) intractable generative models, where we\ndistil unnormalizable models such as RBMs into tractable models such as NADEs.\n  We contribute to the state of the art with novel techniques and ideas. In\nmodel compression, we describe and implement derivative matching, which allows\nfor better distillation when data is scarce.

Many available techniques rely on\ndiscrete-time reversible Markov chains whose transition kernels build up over\nthe Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We explore and propose several original\nextensions of an alternative approach introduced recently in Peters and de With\n(2012) where the target distribution of interest is explored using a\ncontinuous-time Markov process. In the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a trial\nmove to a region of lower target density, equivalently \"higher energy\", than\nthe current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this\nalternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines continuously around\nthe space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is not rejected but its\npath is modified by bouncing against this barrier. The resulting non-reversible\nMarkov process provides a rejection-free MCMC sampling scheme. We propose\nseveral original techniques to simulate this continuous-time process exactly in\na wide range of scenarios of interest to statisticians. When the target\ndistribution factorizes as a product of factors involving only subsets of\nvariables, such as the posterior distribution associated to a probabilistic\ngraphical model, it is possible to modify the original algorithm to exploit\nthis structure and update in parallel variables within each clique. We present\nseveral extensions by proposing methods to sample mixed discrete-continuous\ndistributions and distributions restricted to a connected smooth domain.

This is\nparticularly true for the helicity-suppressed annihilation of Majorana\nparticles, like neutralinos, into fermion pairs. Surprisingly, and despite the\npotentially large effect due to the strong coupling, this has so far been\nstudied in much less detail for the internal bremsstrahlung of gluons than for\nphotons or electroweak gauge bosons. Here, we aim at bridging that gap by\npresenting a general analysis of neutralino annihilation into quark anti-quark\npairs and a gluon, allowing e.g. for arbitrary neutralino compositions and\nkeeping the leading quark mass dependence at all stages in the calculation. We\nfind in some cases largely enhanced annihilation rates, especially for\nscenarios with squarks being close to degenerate in mass with the lightest\nneutralino, but also notable distortions in the associated antiproton and\ngamma-ray spectra. Both effects significantly impact limits from indirect\nsearches for dark matter and are thus important to be taken into account in,\ne.g., global scans.

We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics).

It is commonly thought that directly imaging a potentially\nhabitable exoplanet around a Sun-like star requires space telescopes with\napertures of at least 1m. A notable exception to this is Alpha Centauri (A and\nB), which is an extreme outlier among FGKM stars in terms of apparent habitable\nzone size: the habitable zones are ~3x wider in apparent size than around any\nother FGKM star. This enables a ~30-45cm visible light space telescope equipped\nwith a modern high performance coronagraph or starshade to resolve the\nhabitable zone at high contrast and directly image any potentially habitable\nplanet that may exist in the system. We presents a brief analysis of the\nastrophysical and technical challenges involved with direct imaging of Alpha\nCentauri with a small telescope and describe two new technologies that address\nsome of the key technical challenges.

We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets\n(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer\nNeptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in\nthe planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the\nincreasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship\nand heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are\nindependent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass\nlocked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where\nKepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average\nheavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with\nstellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7\nM_Earth in M stars. This trend stands in stark contrast with observed\nprotoplanetary disk masses that decrease towards lower mass stars, and provides\na challenge for current planet formation models. Neither models of in situ\nformation nor migration of fully-formed planets are consistent with these\nresults. Instead, these results are indicative of large-scale inward migration\nof planetary building blocks --- either through type-I migration or radial\ndrift of dust grains --- that is more efficient for lower mass stars, but does\nnot result in significantly larger or smaller planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 20:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 21:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

We\nexplore some of the consequences for precision measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). Quantum relaxation is a feature of the de\nBroglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, which allows the\nexistence of more general physical states that violate the Born probability\nrule. Recent work has shown that relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for\nlong-wavelength field modes on expanding space, resulting in a large-scale\npower deficit with a characteristic inverse-tangent dependence on k. Because\nthe quantum relaxation dynamics is independent of the direction of the wave\nvector for the relaxing field mode, in the limit of weak anisotropy we are able\nto derive an expression for the anisotropic power spectrum that is determined\nby the power deficit function. As a result, the off-diagonal terms in the CMB\ncovariance matrix are also determined by the power deficit. We show that the\nlowest-order l-(l+1) inter-multipole correlations have a characteristic scaling\nwith multipole moment l. Our derived spectrum also predicts a residual\nstatistical anisotropy at small scales, with an approximate consistency\nrelation between the scaling of the l-(l+1) correlations and the scaling of the\nangular power spectrum at high l. We also predict a relationship between the\nl-(l+1) correlations at large and small scales. Cosmological quantum relaxation\nappears to provide a single physical mechanism that predicts both a large-scale\npower deficit and a range of statistical anisotropies, together with\npotentially testable relationships between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 22:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

However, no accepted explanation for the\nepisodic occurrence of quasiperiodicities has emerged. This paper examines the\npossibility that the periodicities are associated with a Mercury Sun\ninteraction of base period 88 days. To test this idea we band pass filter the\n140 year long daily sunspot area data to obtain the 88 day period and 176 day\nsub harmonic period components of the data and compare the time variation of\nthe components with the time variation of the orbital radius of Mercury, or\nmore specifically with the time variation of the tidal effect of Mercury. We\nwere able to show that, when successive episodes of the occurrence of the 88\nday period component were discrete and not overlapping in time, the time\nvariation of this component of sunspot area was either exactly in-phase or\nexactly in anti-phase with the time variation of tidal effect. A similar result\nwas obtained for the 176 day period component. When several discrete episodes\nof the components occurred during a solar cycle the spectrum of the sunspot\narea data exhibited strong sidebands with periods dependent on the duration of\nthe episodes. A simple model based on episode modulation and solar cycle\nmodulation of 88 day and sub harmonic period sinusoids reproduced most of the\nspectral peaks observed in the intermediate range of sunspot area periodicity.\nThis is compelling evidence of a link between the motion of Mercury and the\nperiodic emergence of sunspots. It is proposed that the link involves magnetic\nsurface waves with mode periods close to the sub harmonic periods associated\nwith Mercury and the triggering of sunspot emergence by the waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 22:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

Our algorithms broadly fall into two categories: optimisation\nof finite sums and of graph structured objectives. The finite sum problem is\nsimply the minimisation of objective functions that are naturally expressed as\na summation over a large number of terms, where each term has a similar or\nidentical weight. Such objectives most often appear in machine learning in the\nempirical risk minimisation framework in the non-online learning setting. The\nsecond category, that of graph structured objectives, consists of objectives\nthat result from applying maximum likelihood to Markov random field models.\nUnlike the finite sum case, all the non-linearity is contained within a\npartition function term, which does not readily decompose into a summation.\n  For the finite sum problem, we introduce the Finito and SAGA algorithms, as\nwell as variants of each.\n  For graph-structured problems, we take three complementary approaches.

We show that using massive MIMO, the uplink SINR\nin certain urban marco-cell scenarios is limited by interference. In the\ninterference-limited regime, the results reveal that for MRC receivers, a\nsuper-linear (polynomial) scaling law between the number of base station\nantennas and scheduled users per cell preserves the uplink SIR distribution,\nwhile a linear scaling applies to ZF receivers. ZF receivers are shown to\noutperform MRC receivers in the SIR coverage, and the performance gap is\nquantified in terms of the difference in the number of antennas to achieve the\nsame SIR distribution. Numerical results verify the analysis. It is found that\nthe optimal compensation fraction in fractional power control to optimize rate\nis generally different for MRC and ZF receivers.

The results may be of general interest, but\nin particular have application to the \"beating-modes model\" of the Blazhko\neffect which was recently shown to accurately reproduce the light curve of RR\nLyr. For weak coupling, the two modes do not phase-lock and they retain\nseparate frequencies, but the coupling nevertheless has important consequences.\nUpon increasing the coupling strength from zero, an additional side-peak\nemerges in the spectrum forming an asymmetric triplet centered on the\nfundamental. As the coupling is further increased, the amplitude of this\nside-peak increases and the three peaks are also pulled towards each other,\ndecreasing the Blazhko frequency. Beyond a critical coupling strength,\nphase-locking occurs between the modes. With appropriate choice of coupling\nstrength, this \"interactive beating-modes model\" can match the side-peak\namplitude ratio of any star. The effects of nonlinear damping are also explored\nand found to generate additional side-peaks of odd order. Consistent with this,\nthe odd side-peaks are found to be favored in V808 Cyg. It is also shown that\nthe Blazhko effect generates a fluctuating \"environment\" that can have a\nmodulatory effect on other excited modes of the star. An example is found in\nV808 Cyg where the modulation is at double the Blazhko frequency. An\nexplanation is found for this mysterious doubling, providing additional\nevidence in favor of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 01:46:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 17:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

These bounds allow designers to compare\nthe performance of their developed approaches, which are deemed to be of\nacceptable complexity, to the best achievable performance.

We also describe how\nthis setting naturally leads to a three level hierarchy of quantum\ncontextuality: weak contextuality, logical non-locality and strong\ncontextuality. We use these insights in order to classify certain multipartite\nentangled states. Almost all of these turn out to be at least logically\nnon-local, and a number of them even turn out to be strongly contextual.

The cyclic redundancy check\n(CRC) aided successive cancelation list (SCL) decoding algorithm has better\nerror performance than the SC algorithm. However, current CRC aided SCL\n(CA-SCL) decoders still suffer from long decoding latency and limited\nthroughput. In this paper, a reduced latency list decoding (RLLD) algorithm for\npolar codes is proposed. Our RLLD algorithm performs the list decoding on a\nbinary tree, whose leaves correspond to the bits of a polar code. In existing\nSCL decoding algorithms, all the nodes in the tree are traversed and all\npossibilities of the information bits are considered. Instead, our RLLD\nalgorithm visits much fewer nodes in the tree and considers fewer possibilities\nof the information bits. When configured properly, our RLLD algorithm\nsignificantly reduces the decoding latency and hence improves throughput, while\nintroducing little performance degradation. Based on our RLLD algorithm, we\nalso propose a high throughput list decoder architecture, which is suitable for\nlarger block lengths due to its scalable partial sum computation unit. Our\ndecoder architecture has been implemented for different block lengths and list\nsizes using the TSMC 90nm CMOS technology.

We have carried out a first-principles density\nfunctional theory investigation into the migration of both a single\ninterstitial He atom and an interstitial He-pair in bcc (Fe, Mo and W) and fcc\n(Cu, Pd and Pt) metals. By identifying the most stable configurations of an\ninterstitial He-pair in each metal and decomposing its motion into rotational,\ntranslational, and rotational-translational routines, we are able to determine\nits migration barrier and trajectory. Our first-principles calculations reveal\nthat the migration trajectories and barriers are determined predominantly by\nthe relatively stable He-pair configurations which depend mainly on the\nstability of a single He in different interstices. Contrary to atomistic\nstudies reported in literature, the migration barrier in bcc Fe, Mo, and W is\n0.07, 0.07, and 0.08 eV respectively, always slightly higher than for a single\ninterstitial He (0.06 eV for all three). Configurations of a He-pair in fcc\nmetals are much more complicated, due to the stability closeness of different\ninterstitial sites for a single He atom. In both Cu and Pd, the migration of a\nHe-pair proceeds by moving one He at a time from one tetrahedral site to\nneighboring octahedral site; whereas in Pt the two He move simultaneously\nbecause the bridge interstitial site presents an extremely low barrier.

However, these intrinsic alignments are still\npoorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear\nanalyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant\nin determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic\nellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we\ncalculate the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model\nfrom non-linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate\nthis to the contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured\ncross-correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the CMB lensing potential.\nOn the scales relevant for CMB lensing observations, the squeezed limit of the\ngravitational bispectrum dominates the correlation. Physically, the large-scale\nmode that sources CMB lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the\nintrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular\ncross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in\nthe linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies.\nThe amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the\nformation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift\nwhen the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we\nmake simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the\ncorrelation of forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current CMB lensing\nmeasurements. We note that cosmic variance can be significantly reduced in\nmeasurements of the difference in the intrinsic alignments for elliptical and\nspiral galaxies if these can be separated (e.g., using colour).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 10:17:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 15:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-21"}

Here we aim\nat investigating the inner 2 degrees by observing the [alpha/Fe] element trends\nversus metallicity, and by trying to derive the metallicity gradient.\n[alpha/Fe] and metallicities have been determined by spectral synthesis of 2\nmicron spectra observed with VLT/CRIRES of 28 M-giants, lying along the\nSouthern minor axis at (l,b)=(0,0), (0,-1), and (0,-2).

We present the first\nconnection between the Galactic Center and the Bulge using similar stars, high\nspectral resolution, and analysis techniques. The [alpha/Fe] trends in all our\n3 fields show a large similarity among each other and with trends further out\nin the Bulge, with a lack of an [\\alpha/Fe] gradient all the way into the\ncentre. This suggests a homogeneous Bulge when it comes to the enrichment\nprocess and star-formation history.

We could interpret this as a\ncontinuation of the metallicity gradient established further out in the Bulge,\nbut due to the low number of stars and possible selection effects, more data of\nthe same sort as presented here is necessary to conclude on the inner\nmetallicity gradient from our data alone.

In this paper, we use the post-nova\nevolutionary models of Wolf et al. to compute the expected population of\npost-nova SSSs in M31. We predict that depending on the assumptions about the\nWD mass distribution in novae, at any instant there are about 250-600 post-nova\nSSSs in M31 with (unabsorbed) 0.2-1.0 keV luminosity L_x>10^36 erg/s.

Their\nluminosity distribution shows significant steepening around log(L_x)~37.7-38\nand becomes zero at L_x~2x10^38 erg/s, the maximum L_x achieved in the\npost-nova evolutionary tracks. Their effective temperature distribution has a\nroughly power law shape with differential slope of ~4-6 up to the maximum\ntemperature of T_eff~1.5x10^6 K.\n  We compare our predictions with the results of the XMM-Newton monitoring of\nthe central field of M31 between 2006 and 2009.

The reason is that these models\nutilise the symmetry breaking pattern $E_6\\rightarrow SO(10)\\times U(1)_\\zeta$\nby GGSO projections. Consequently, $U(1)_\\zeta$ becomes anomalous. The\nspinor--vector duality that was observed in the fermionic $Z_2\\times Z_2$\norbifold compactifications is used to construct a phenomenological three\ngeneration Pati--Salam heterotic--string model in which $U(1)_\\zeta$ is anomaly\nfree and therefore can be a component of a low scale $Z^\\prime$. The model\nimplies existence of matter states at the $Z^\\prime$ breaking scale, which are\nrequired for anomaly cancelation. Moreover, the string model gives rise to\nexotic states, which are $SO(10)$ singlets but carry exotic $U(1)_\\zeta$\ncharges.

We observe that adapting the\ntransmission rate at the packet level, i.e., periodically dropping a subset of\nthe packets, leads to a good tradeoff between the throughput and the maximum\ninter-decoding delay.

Aims: We explore the potential of this method for detecting\nasymmetries around AGB stars. Methods:We obtained CRIRES observations of\nseveral CO $\\Delta$v=1 lines near 4.6 $\\mu$m and HCN lines near 3 $\\mu$m in\n2010 and 2013. These were then searched for spectro-astrometric signatures. For\nthe interpretation of the results, we used simple simulated observations.\nResults: Several lines show significant photocentre shifts with a clear\ndependence on position angle. In all cases, tilde-shaped signatures are found\nwhere the positive and negative shifts (at PA 0deg) are associated with blue\nand weaker red components of the lines. The shifts can be modelled with a\nbright blob 70 mas to 210 mas south of the star with a flux of several percent\nof the photospheric flux. We estimate a lower limit of the blob temperature of\n1000 K. The blob may be related to a mass ejection as found for AGB stars or\nred supergiants. We also consider the scenario of a companion object.\nConclusions: Although there is clear spectro-astrometric evidence of a rather\nprominent structure near TX Psc, it does not seem to relate to the other\nevidence of asymmetries, so no definite explanation can be given. Our data thus\nunderline the very complex structure of the environment of this star, but\nfurther observations that sample the angular scales out to a few hundred\nmilli-arcseconds are needed to get a clearer picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 14:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

This study aims to detect PG 0043+039 in a deep\nX-ray exposure. The question is what causes the extreme X-ray weakness of PG\n0043+039? Does PG 0043+039 show other spectral or continuum peculiarities? We\ntook simultaneous deep X-ray spectra with XMM-Newton, far-ultraviolet (FUV)\nspectra with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and optical spectra of PG\n0043+039 with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) and Southern African Large\nTelescope (SALT) in July, 2013. We have detected PG 0043+039 in our X-ray\nexposure taken in 2013. We presented our first results in a separate paper\n(Kollatschny et al. 2015). PG 0043+039 shows an extreme {\\alpha}_ox gradient\n({\\alpha}_ox =-2.37). Furthermore, we were able to verify an X-ray flux of this\nsource in a reanalysis of the X-ray data taken in 2005. At that time, it was\nfainter by a factor of 3.8 +- 0.9 with {\\alpha}_ox=-2.55. The X-ray spectrum is\ncompatible with a normal quasar power-law spectrum ({\\Gamma}=1.70_-0.45^+0.57)\nwith moderate intrinsic absorption (N_H=5.5_-3.9^+6.9 +- 10^21cm^-2) and\nreflection. The UV/optical flux of PG 0043+039 has increased by a factor of 1.8\ncompared to spectra taken in the years 1990-1991. The FUV spectrum is highly\npeculiar and dominated by broad bumps besides Ly{\\alpha}. There is no\ndetectable Lyman edge associated with the BAL absorbing gas seen in the CIV\nline. PG 0043+039 shows a maximum in the overall continuum flux at around\n{\\lambda} 2500{\\AA} in contrast to most other AGN where the maximum is found at\nshorter wavelengths. All the above is compatible with an intrinsically X-ray\nweak quasar, rather than an absorbed X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 14:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-07"}

The density associated with a general $\\alpha$-stable\ndistribution cannot be obtained in closed form, which hinders the process of\nestimating its parameters. A nonlinear population Monte Carlo (NPMC) scheme is\napplied in order to approximate the posterior probability distribution of the\nparameters of an $\\alpha$-stable random variable given a set of random\nrealizations of the latter.

In this paper, we consider the\nreconstruction problem of two integers from their residue sets, where the\nremainders are not only out of order but also may have errors. We prove that\ntwo integers can be robustly reconstructed if their remainder errors are less\nthan $M/8$, where $M$ is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli.\nWe also propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm.

The mean separation between cores\nis ~0.40(+-0.18)pc. While this is approximately consistent with the\nfragmentation of an infinite, isothermal, gravitationally bound gas cylinder, a\nhigh mass-to-length ratio of M/l~1000M_sun/pc requires additional turbulent\nand/or magnetic support against radial collapse of the filament. The N2H+(1-0)\ndata reveal a velocity gradient perpendicular to the main filament. Although\nrotation of the filament cannot be excluded, the data are also consistent with\nthe main filament being comprised of several velocity-coherent sub-filaments.\nFurthermore, this velocity gradient perpendicular to the filament resembles\nrecent results toward Serpens south that are interpreted as signatures of\nfilament formation within magnetized and turbulent sheet-like structures.\nLower-density gas tracers ([CI] and C18O) reveal a similar red/blueshifted\nvelocity structure on scales around 60'' east and west of the IRDC18223\nfilament. This may tentatively be interpreted as a signature of the large-scale\ncloud and the smaller-scale filament being kinematically coupled. We do not\nidentify a velocity gradient along the axis of the filament. This may either be\ndue to no significant gas flows along the filamentary axis, but it may partly\nalso be caused by a low inclination angle of the filament with respect to the\nplane of the sky that could minimize such signature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 09:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

A number of\nmethods, including some from our own group, have explored how one goes about\ncomputing or predicting the dynamics of networks given information about\ninternal models of individual nodes and network connectivity, possibly with\nadditional information provided by statistical or descriptive metrics that\ncharacterize the network. But what can be inferred about network dynamics when\nthere is no knowledge or information about the internal model or dynamics of\nparticipating nodes? Here, we explore how connected subsets of nodes\ncompetitively interact in order to activate a common downstream node they\nconnect into. We achieve this by assuming a simple set of rules borrowed from\nneurophysiology. The model we develop reflects a local process from which\nglobal network dynamics emerges. We call this model a competitive refractory\ndynanics model. It is derived from a consideration of spatial and temporal\nsummation in biological neurons, whereby summating post synaptic potentials\n(PSPs) along the dendritic tree contribute towards the membrane potential at\nthe initial segment reaching a threshold potential. We first show how the\n'winning node' or set of 'winning' nodes that achieve activation of a\ndownstream node is computable by the model. We then derive a formal definition\nof optimized network signaling within our framework. We define a ratio between\nthe signaling latencies on the edges of the network and the internal time it\ntakes individual nodes to process incoming signals. We show that an optimal\nratio is one where the speed of information propagation between connected nodes\ndoes not exceed the internal dynamic time scale of the nodes. We then show how\nwe can use these results to arrive at a unique interpretation for the\nprevalence of the small world network topology in natural and engineered\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 06:50:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 18:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 23:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 03:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 03:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-06"}
