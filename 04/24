There are a number of measures proposed for this purpose, for\ninstance, high-degree centrality measure reflects the importance of the network\ntopology and has a reasonable runtime performance to find a set of nodes with\nhighest degree, but they do not have a satisfactory dissemination potentiality\nin the network due to having many common neighbors ($\\mbox{CN}^{(1)}$) and\ncommon neighbors of neighbors ($\\mbox{CN}^{(2)}$). This flaw holds in other\nmeasures as well. In this paper, we compare high-degree centrality measure with\nother well-known measures using ten datasets in order to find a proportion for\nthe common seeds in the seed sets obtained by them. We, thereof, propose an\nimproved high-degree centrality measure (named DegreeDistance) and improve it\nto enhance accuracy in two phases, FIDD and SIDD, by putting a threshold on the\nnumber of common neighbors of already-selected seed nodes and a non-seed node\nwhich is under investigation to be selected as a seed as well as considering\nthe influence score of seed nodes directly or through their common neighbors\nover the non-seed node. To evaluate the accuracy and runtime performance of\nDegreeDistance, FIDD, and SIDD, they are applied to eight large-scale networks\nand it finally turns out that SIDD dramatically outperforms other well-known\nmeasures and evinces comparatively more accurate performance in identifying the\nmost influential nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 16:01:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 08:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

We monitored M31N 2008-12a with\ndaily Swift observations for 20 days after discovery, covering the entire\nsupersoft X-ray source (SSS) phase. We detected SSS emission around day six\nafter outburst. The SSS state lasted for approximately two weeks until about\nday 19. M31N 2008-12a was a bright X-ray source with a high blackbody\ntemperature. The X-ray properties of this outburst were very similar to the\n2013 eruption. Combined X-ray spectra show a fast rise and decline of the\neffective blackbody temperature. The short-term X-ray light curve showed\nstrong, aperiodic variability which decreased significantly after about day 14.\nOverall, the X-ray properties of M31N 2008-12a are consistent with the average\npopulation properties of M 31 novae. The optical and X-ray light curves can be\nscaled uniformly to show similar time scales as those of the Galactic RNe U Sco\nor RS Oph. The SSS evolution time scales and effective temperatures are\nconsistent with a high-mass WD.

The resulting dust\nsurface density distribution can be compared to that of the gas. The latter was\nderived from the analysis of accompanying molecular line emission, observed\nwith Herschel from space and with APEX from the ground.

Radiative transfer modelling of the N2H+(J=3-2) and (J=6-5)\nlines with their hyperfine structure explicitly taken into account provides\nsolutions for the spatial distribution of the column density N(H2), hence the\nsurface density distribution of the gas.

Since beta is\nprimarily controlled by grain size, grain growth mostly occurs in circumstellar\ndisks. The spatial segregation of gas and dust, seen in projection toward the\ncore centre, probably implies that, like C18O, also N2H+ is frozen onto the\ngrains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 17:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Up and down states are typically observed in neuronal networks as a\nslow oscillation, where the population switches between high and low firing\nrates (Sanchez-Vivez and McCormick, 2000). A neural population model with spike\nrate adaptation is used to model such slow oscillations, and the timescale of\nadaptation determines the oscillation period. Furthermore, the period depends\nnon-monotonically on the background tonic input driving the population, having\nlong periods for very weak and very strong stimuli. Using both linearization\nand fast-slow timescale separation methods, we can compute the phase\nsensitivity function of the slow oscillation. We find that the phase response\nis most strongly impacted by perturbations to the adaptation variable. Phase\nsensitivity functions can then be utilized to quantify the impact of noise on\noscillating populations. Noise alters the period of oscillations by speeding up\nthe rate of transition between the up and down states. When common noise is\npresented to two distinct populations, their transitions will eventually become\nentrained to one another through stochastic synchrony.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 18:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness\namplification using only two no-signaling components and in a situation where\nthe violation of a Bell inequality only guarantees that some outcomes of the\ndevice for specific inputs exhibit randomness? Here, we solve this question and\npresent a device-independent protocol for randomness amplification of\nSantha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of two non-signaling\ncomponents.

In addition, there exist\npolynomial-time algorithms that compute exact (coarse) correlated equilibria.\nIn light of these results, a natural question is how good are the (coarse)\ncorrelated equilibria that can arise from any efficient algorithm or dynamics.\n  In this paper we address this question, and establish strong negative\nresults. In particular, we show that in multiplayer games that have a succinct\nrepresentation, it is NP-hard to compute any coarse correlated equilibrium (or\napproximate coarse correlated equilibrium) with welfare strictly better than\nthe worst possible. The focus on succinct games ensures that the underlying\ncomplexity question is interesting; many multiplayer games of interest are in\nfact succinct. Our results imply that, while one can efficiently compute a\ncoarse correlated equilibrium, one cannot provide any nontrivial welfare\nguarantee for the resulting equilibrium, unless P=NP. We show that analogous\nhardness results hold for correlated equilibria, and persist under the\negalitarian objective or Pareto optimality.\n  To complement the hardness results, we develop an algorithmic framework that\nidentifies settings in which we can efficiently compute an approximate\ncorrelated equilibrium with near-optimal welfare.

CAWSES II was planned to examine the behavior of the\nsolar terrestrial system as the solar activity climbed to its maximum phase in\nsolar cycle 24. After a deep minimum following cycle 23, the Sun climbed to a\nvery weak maximum in terms of the sunspot number in cycle 24 (MiniMax24), so\nmany of the results presented here refer to this weak activity in comparison\nwith cycle 23. The short term variability that has immediate consequence to\nEarth and geospace manifests as solar eruptions from closed field regions and\nhigh speed streams from coronal holes. Both electromagnetic (flares) and mass\nemissions (coronal mass ejections, CMEs) are involved in solar eruptions, while\ncoronal holes result in high speed streams that collide with slow wind forming\nthe so called corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Fast CMEs affect Earth via\nleading shocks accelerating energetic particles and creating large geomagnetic\nstorms. CIRs and their trailing high speed streams (HSSs), on the other hand,\nare responsible for recurrent small geomagnetic storms and extended (days) of\nauroral zone activity, respectively. The latter lead to the acceleration of\nrelativistic magnetospheric killer electrons. One of the major consequences of\nthe weak solar activity is the altered physical state of the heliosphere that\nhas serious implications for the shock-driving and storm causing properties of\nCMEs. Finally, a discussion is presented on extreme space weather events\nprompted by the 2012 July 23 super storm event that occurred on the backside of\nthe Sun. Many of these studies were enabled by the simultaneous availability of\nremote-sensing and in situ observations from multiple vantage points with\nrespect to the Sun Earth line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 20:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}

We point out, in the 4D spatially flat FLRW\nuniverse, that the causal structure of transverse-traceless (TT) gravitational\nwaves can be elucidated by first reducing the problem to a 2D Minkowski wave\nequation with a time dependent potential, where the relevant Green's function\nis pure tail -- waves produced by a physical source propagate strictly within\nthe null cone. By viewing this 2D world as embedded in a 4D one, the 2D Green's\nfunction can also be seen to be sourced by a cylindrically symmetric scalar\nfield in 3D. From both the 2D wave equation as well as the 3D scalar\nperspective, we recover the exact solution of the 4D graviton tail, for the\ncase where the scale factor written in conformal time is a power law. There are\nno TT gravitational wave tails when the universe is radiation dominated because\nthe background Ricci scalar is zero. In a matter dominated one, we estimate the\namplitude of the tail to be suppressed relative to its null counterpart by both\nthe ratio of the duration of the source to the age of the universe $\\eta_0$,\nand the ratio of the observer-source spatial distance (at the observer's time)\nto the same $\\eta_0$. In a universe driven primarily by a cosmological\nconstant, the tail contribution to the background FLRW geometry after the\nsource has ceased, is the conformal factor $a^2$ times a spacetime-constant\nsymmetric matrix proportional to the spacetime volume integral of the TT part\nof the source's stress-energy-momentum tensor.

Here we\nreport transport measurements on ballistic suspended graphene-Niobium Josephson\nweak links that demonstrate a transition from ballistic to pseudo-diffusive\nlike evanescent transport below a carrier density of $(10^{10}\ncm^{-2})$.Approaching the Dirac point, the sub-harmonic gap structures due to\nmultiple Andreev reflections display a strong Fermi energy-dependence and\nbecome increasingly pronounced, while the normalized excess current through the\nsuperconductor-graphene interface decreases sharply. Our observations are in\nqualitative agreement with the longstanding theoretical prediction for the\nemergence of evanescent transport mediated pseudo-diffusive transport in\ngraphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 20:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 01:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Our work makes evident the link\nbetween particle surface interaction and near field thermal emission and\ndemonstrates how this can be used to engineer Casimir-Polder forces.

Moreover, the beamforming techniques for underlay spectrum\nsharing do not consider the interference originating from the incumbent primary\nsystem. This work extends the common underlay sharing model by incorporating\nthe interference originating from the incumbent system into generic combined\nbeamforming design that can be applied on interference, broadcast or multiple\naccess channels.

The main results can be precisely phrased\nas follows: on $\\mathbf{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average\nwidth of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\\sqrt{k})/d$,\nwhile random states obtained as partial traces over an environment\n$\\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the\n$k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$.\nBoth statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed,\n$k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even\nthough any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed\nby $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent)\nvalue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 10:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 06:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

A novel,\npractical model based on GOK-DFT for the calculation of electronic excitation\nenergies is discussed. The new model relies on two modifications of GOK-DFT:\nuse of range separation and use of the slope of the linearly-interpolated\nensemble energy, rather than orbital energies. The range-separated approach is\nappealing as it enables the rigorous formulation of a multi-determinant\nstate-averaged DFT method. In the exact theory, the short-range density\nfunctional, that complements the long-range wavefunction-based ensemble energy\ncontribution, should vary with the ensemble weights even when the density is\nheld fixed. This weight dependence ensures that the range-separated ensemble\nenergy varies linearly with the ensemble weights. When the (weight-independent)\nground-state short-range exchange-correlation functional is used in this\ncontext, curvature appears thus leading to an approximate weight-dependent\nexcitation energy. In order to obtain unambiguous approximate excitation\nenergies, we propose to interpolate linearly the ensemble energy between\nequiensembles. It is shown that such a linear interpolation method (LIM) can be\nrationalized and that it effectively introduces weight dependence effects. As\nproof of principle, LIM has been applied to He, Be, H$_2$ in both equilibrium\nand stretched geometries as well as the stretched HeH$^+$ molecule. Very\npromising results have been obtained for both single (including charge\ntransfer) and double excitations with spin-independent short-range local and\nsemi-local functionals. Even at the Kohn--Sham ensemble DFT level, that is\nrecovered when the range-separation parameter is set to zero, LIM performs\nbetter than standard time-dependent DFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 11:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 11:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

However, the upcoming wireless systems, notably the\n5G system, will need to support novel traffic types that use short packets. For\nexample, short packets represent the most common form of traffic generated by\nsensors and other devices involved in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications.\nFurthermore, there are emerging applications in which small packets are\nexpected to carry critical information that should be received with low latency\nand ultra-high reliability.\n  Current wireless systems are not designed to support short-packet\ntransmissions. For example, the design of current systems relies on the\nassumption that the metadata (control information) is of negligible size\ncompared to the actual information payload. Hence, transmitting metadata using\nheuristic methods does not affect the overall system performance. However, when\nthe packets are short, metadata may be of the same size as the payload, and the\nconventional methods to transmit it may be highly suboptimal.\n  In this article, we review recent advances in information theory, which\nprovide the theoretical principles that govern the transmission of short\npackets. We then apply these principles to three exemplary scenarios (the\ntwo-way channel, the downlink broadcast channel, and the uplink random access\nchannel), thereby illustrating how the transmission of control information can\nbe optimized when the packets are short. The insights brought by these examples\nsuggest that new principles are needed for the design of wireless protocols\nsupporting short packets.

We introduce the\nnotion of the density matrix reduced to the center of mass, and show that its\neigenvalues are N times the probabilities of the different eigenvalues of \\P. A\nseries of results is presented for the limit of sequences of positive definite\natomic probability measures, relevant for the probability distribution of both\nthe single-particle and the total momentum. The P=0 ensemble is shown to be\nequivalent to the canonical ensemble.

In a distributed algorithm, an arbitrary\nnumber of processes cooperate to achieve a common goal (e.g., elect a leader).\nProcesses have unique identifiers (pids) from an infinite, totally ordered\ndomain. An algorithm proceeds in synchronous rounds, each round allowing a\nprocess to perform a bounded sequence of actions such as send or receive a pid,\nstore it in some register, and compare register contents wrt. the associated\ntotal order. An algorithm is supposed to be correct independently of the number\nof processes. To specify correctness properties, we introduce a logic that can\nreason about processes and pids. Referring to leader election, it may say that,\nat the end of an execution, each process stores the maximum pid in some\ndedicated register. Since the verification of distributed algorithms is\nundecidable, we propose an underapproximation technique, which bounds the\nnumber of rounds. This is an appealing approach, as the number of rounds needed\nby a distributed algorithm to conclude is often exponentially smaller than the\nnumber of processes. We provide an automata-theoretic solution, reducing model\nchecking to emptiness for alternating two-way automata on words. Overall, we\nshow that round-bounded verification of distributed algorithms over rings is\nPSPACE-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 15:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-27"}

Phase-front\ncorrugations deduced from these optical-path fluctuations are then applied to\nlight from extra-galactic point sources, and used to constrain various models\nof quantum gravity. However, when a photon propagates in three spatial\ndimensions, it does not follow a specific ray, but rather samples a finite,\nthree-dimensional region around that ray --- thereby averaging over space-time\nquantum fluctuations all through that region. We use a simple, random-walk type\nmodel to demonstrate that, once the appropriate wave optics is applied, the\naveraging of neighboring space-time fluctuations will cause much less\ndistortion to the phase front. In our model, the extra suppression factor due\nto diffraction is the wave length in units of the Planck length, which is at\nleast $10^{29}$ for astronomical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 12:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The method is based on using as the\nmain approximation of the relativistic self-consistent field model, in which\nthe influence of vacuum field fluctuations is taken into account when\nconstructing the one-particle states. The solutions of the self-consistent\nequations determine possible states, which also include the states with broken\nsymmetries. Different states of the field are matched to particles, whose\nmasses are determined by both parameters of the Lagrangian and vacuum\nfluctuations. The density of the vacuum energy in these states is calculated.\nIt is shown that the concept of Bogolubov's quasi-averages can naturally be\napplied for definition of exact Green functions in the states with broken\nsymmetries.
