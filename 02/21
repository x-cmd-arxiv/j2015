The main\ncomponent of this work is an improved version of the NormalHedge.DT algorithm\n(Luo and Schapire, 2014), called AdaNormalHedge. On one hand, this new\nalgorithm ensures small regret when the competitor has small loss and almost\nconstant regret when the losses are stochastic. On the other hand, the\nalgorithm is able to compete with any convex combination of the experts\nsimultaneously, with a regret in terms of the relative entropy of the prior and\nthe competitor. This resolves an open problem proposed by Chaudhuri et al.\n(2009) and Chernov and Vovk (2010). Moreover, we extend the results to the\nsleeping expert setting and provide two applications to illustrate the power of\nAdaNormalHedge: 1) competing with time-varying unknown competitors and 2)\npredicting almost as well as the best pruning tree. Our results on these\napplications significantly improve previous work from different aspects, and a\nspecial case of the first application resolves another open problem proposed by\nWarmuth and Koolen (2014) on whether one can simultaneously achieve optimal\nshifting regret for both adversarial and stochastic losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 16:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}

On the very largest\nscales, instrumental systematic residuals are still non-negligible compared to\nthe expected cosmological signal, and modes with $\\ell < 20$ are accordingly\nsuppressed in the current polarization maps by high-pass filtering.

The authors of the FITS standard\ncould not appreciate the challenges which we would be facing today in\nastronomical computing.

This reaction should be taken as a wakeup call to the FITS\ncommunity to make changes in the FITS standard, or to see its usage fall. In\nthis paper we detail some selected important problems which exist within the\nFITS standard today.

If ontologies are\nspecified with property-based restrictions on class membership, then such\nconsistency can be checked automatically. If no such logical restrictions are\napplied, as is the case with many biological ontologies, there are currently no\nautomated methods for measuring the semantic consistency of instance assignment\non an ontology-wide scale, nor for inferring the patterns of properties that\nmight define a particular class. We constructed a program that takes as its\ninput an OWL/RDF knowledge base containing an ontology, instances associated\nwith each of the classes in the ontology, and properties of those instances.\nFor each class, it outputs: 1) a rule for determining class membership based on\nthe properties of the instances and 2) a quantitative score for the class that\nreflects the ability of the identified rule to correctly predict class\nmembership for the instances in the knowledge base.

In this paper,\nan autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that\nenables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while\nguaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery\nerror. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the\nvalidation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with\nhigh confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and\nnoisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm\nis proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the\ninstantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap\nbetween CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that\nACSS can not only recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of\nmeasurements, but can also considerably improve the spectral recovery\nperformance compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery\nalgorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore\nsolving the problems of under-fitting or over-fitting which commonly exist in\nmost greedy recovery algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 22:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

It is shown that, from 1996 through 2010, the\ntotal area of coronal holes measured with EIT images varies between 5$\\%$ and\n17$\\%$ of the total solar surface area, and the total unsigned open flux varies\nbetween $2-5 \\times 10^{22}$ Mx.

Paleoclimate data shows that the fluctuations often occurred right\nafter massive glacial meltwater releases in the North Atlantic and in bursts of\nthree or four with progressively decreasing strengths. In this study a simple\ndynamical model of an overturning circulation and sea ice is developed with the\ngoal of understanding the fundamental mechanisms that could have caused the DO\nevents. Interaction between sea ice and the overturning circulation in the\nmodel produces self-sustained oscillations. Analysis and numerical experiments\nreveal that the insulating effect of sea ice causes the ocean to periodically\nvent out accumulated heat in the deep ocean into the atmosphere. Subjecting the\nmodel to idealized freshwater forcing mimicking Heinrich events causes\nmodulation of the natural periodicity and produces burst patterns very similar\nto what is observed in temperature proxy data. Numerical experiments with the\nmodel also suggests that the characteristic period of 1,500 years is due to the\ngeometry, or the effective heat capacity, of the ocean that comes under sea ice\ncover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2015 02:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

Once the relay gets the traffic, it may have a sequence\nof probings of the second-hop channel (from the relay to the destination).\nAfter each probing, if the second-hop channel is good enough, the relay\ntransmits to the destination and completes the transmission process of the\nsource; otherwise, the relay decides either to give up and let all sources\nstart a new contention, or to continue to probe the second-hop channel. The\noptimal decision strategies for the two hops are derived in this letter. The\nfirst-hop strategy is a pure-threshold strategy, i.e., when the first-hop\nchannel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is more than a threshold, the winner source\nshould transmit to the relay, and subsequently the second-hop strategy should\nlet the relay keep probing the second-hop channel until a good enough\nsecond-hop channel is observed.

Spiking neural networks provide a useful technique in implementing\nreinforcement learning in an embodied context as they can deal with continuous\nparameter spaces and as such are better at generalizing the correct behaviour\nto perform in a given context.\n  In this project we implement a version of DA-modulated STDP in an embodied\nrobot on a food foraging task. Through simulated dopaminergic neurons we show\nhow the robot is able to learn a sequence of behaviours in order to achieve a\nfood reward. In tests the robot was able to learn food-attraction behaviour,\nand subsequently unlearn this behaviour when the environment changed, in all 50\ntrials. Moreover we show that the robot is able to operate in an environment\nwhereby the optimal behaviour changes rapidly and so the agent must constantly\nrelearn. In a more complex environment, consisting of food-containers, the\nrobot was able to learn food-container attraction in 95% of trials, despite the\nlarge temporal distance between the correct behaviour and the reward. This is\nachieved by shifting the dopamine response from the primary stimulus (food) to\nthe secondary stimulus (food-container).\n  Our work provides insights into the reasons behind some observed biological\nphenomena, such as the bursting behaviour observed in dopaminergic neurons.

But they fall short on\nquestions that require common sense reasoning. Perhaps this is because most\nexisting common sense databases rely on text to learn and represent knowledge.\nBut much of common sense knowledge is unwritten - partly because it tends not\nto be interesting enough to talk about, and partly because some common sense is\nunnatural to articulate in text. While unwritten, it is not unseen. In this\npaper we leverage semantic common sense knowledge learned from images - i.e.\nvisual common sense - in two textual tasks: fill-in-the-blank and visual\nparaphrasing. We propose to \"imagine\" the scene behind the text, and leverage\nvisual cues from the \"imagined\" scenes in addition to textual cues while\nanswering these questions. We imagine the scenes as a visual abstraction. Our\napproach outperforms a strong text-only baseline on these tasks. Our proposed\ntasks can serve as benchmarks to quantitatively evaluate progress in solving\ntasks that go \"beyond recognition\".

We calculate the energy splitting of the two qubit states as a\nfunction of these two bias detuning parameters to find \"sweet spots\", where the\nqubit is least susceptible to noise.

In\nthis paper, we consider a representation of the search region by a set of tight\nlocal upper bounds (in the minimization case) that can be derived from the\npoints of $N$. Local upper bounds play an important role in methods for\ngenerating or approximating the nondominated set of an MOO problem, yet few\nworks in the field of MOO address their efficient incremental determination. We\nrelate this issue to the state of the art in computational geometry and provide\nseveral equivalent definitions of local upper bounds that are meaningful in\nMOO. We discuss the complexity of this representation in arbitrary dimension,\nwhich yields an improved upper bound on the number of solver calls in\nepsilon-constraint-like methods to generate the nondominated set of a discrete\nMOO problem. We analyze and enhance a first incremental approach which operates\nby eliminating redundancies among local upper bounds. We also study some\nproperties of local upper bounds, especially concerning the issue of redundant\nlocal upper bounds, that give rise to a new incremental approach which avoids\nsuch redundancies. Finally, the complexities of the incremental approaches are\ncompared from the theoretical and empirical points of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2015 15:58:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 19:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 13:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}
