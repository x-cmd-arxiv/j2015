When increasing bath fraction exceeds half-filling, the\nwake-mediated interaction between obstacles switches from effective attraction\nto repulsion or vice-versa, depending on the mutual alignment of obstacles with\nrespect to the gas flow. It is shown that for an ensemble of small and widely\nseparated obstacles the dissipative interaction takes the form of induced\ndipole-dipole interaction governed by an anisotropic screened Coulomb-like\npotential. This allows one to give a qualitative picture of the interaction\nbetween obstacles and explain switching effect as a result of changes of\nanisotropy direction. The non-linear blockade effect is shown to be essential\nnear closely located obstacles, that manifests itself in additional screening\nof the gas flow and generation of a pronounced step-like profile of gas density\ndistribution. It is established that behavior of the magnitude of dissipative\neffective interaction is, generally, non-monotonic in relation to both the bath\nfraction and the external driving field.

The\nperformance of the proposed model is accessed by designing and conducting\nevaluation with published projects and industrial data. The evaluation results\nindicate that estimation with our proposed neuro-fuzzy model containing\nSEER-SEM is improved in comparison with the estimation results that only use\nSEER-SEM algorithm. At the same time, the results of this research also\ndemonstrate that the general neuro-fuzzy framework can function with various\nalgorithmic models for improving the performance of software effort estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 16:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

In this framework, the\nSM content is enlarged by the addition of one complex gauge singlet scalar with\na scale invariant and $CP$-symmetric potential.

It postulates the existence of an\nasymptotically optimal online BST, i.e. one that is constant factor competitive\nwith any BST on any input access sequence. The two main candidates for dynamic\noptimality in the literature are splay trees [Sleator and Tarjan, 1985], and\nGreedy [Lucas, 1988; Munro, 2000; Demaine et al. 2009] [..]\n  Dynamic optimality is trivial for almost all sequences: the optimum access\ncost of most length-n sequences is Theta(n log n), achievable by any balanced\nBST. Thus, the obvious missing step towards the conjecture is an understanding\nof the \"easy\" access sequences. [..] The difficulty of proving dynamic\noptimality is witnessed by highly restricted special cases that remain\nunresolved; one prominent example is the traversal conjecture [Sleator and\nTarjan, 1985], which states that preorder sequences (whose optimum is linear)\nare linear-time accessed by splay trees; no online BST is known to satisfy this\nconjecture.\n  In this paper, we prove two different relaxations of the traversal conjecture\nfor Greedy: (i) Greedy is almost linear for preorder traversal, (ii) if a\nlinear-time preprocessing is allowed, Greedy is in fact linear.

This so-called Rowhammer bug occurs in most of today's\nmemory modules and has fatal consequences for the security of all affected\nsystems, e.g., privilege escalation attacks.\n  All studies and attacks related to Rowhammer so far rely on the availability\nof a cache flush instruction in order to cause accesses to DRAM modules at a\nsufficiently high frequency.

We show that caches can be forced into fast cache\neviction to trigger the Rowhammer bug with only regular memory accesses.

Within the semiclassical version of the theory the laser line has zero\nwidth as the lasing mode corresponds to the existence of an eigenvector of the\nS-matrix with diverging eigenvalue due to the occurrence of a pole of the\nscattering matrix on the real axis. In this approach the system is infinite\nfrom the outset and no distinction is made between cavity modes and modes of\nthe universe; lasing modes exist both in the cavity and in the external region\nas solutions satisfying Sommerfeld radiation boundary conditions.

When the\nelectromagnetic and matter fields are treated as operators, quantum\nfluctuations enter the relevant correlation functions and a finite linewidth is\nobtained, via a generalization of SALT to include noise (N-SALT).

This component, often associated with the GRB\njet's photosphere, is usually subdominant compared to a much stronger\nnon-thermal one. The prompt emission of Fermi GRB 131014A provides a unique\nopportunity to study this thermal-like component. Indeed, the thermal emission\nin GRB 131014A is much more intense than in other GRBs and a pure thermal\nepisode is observed during the initial 0.16 s. The thermal-like component cools\nmonotonically during the first second while the non-thermal emission kicks off.\nThe intensity of the non-thermal component progressively increases until being\nenergetically dominant at late time. This is a perfect scenario to disentangle\nthe thermal component from the non-thermal one. A low-energy spectral index of\n+0.6 better fit the thermal component than the typical index value +1\ncorresponding to a pure Planck function. The non-thermal component is\nadequately fitted with a Band function whose low and high energy power law\nindices are ~-0.7 and <~-3, respectively; this is also statistically equivalent\nto a cutoff power law with a ~-0.7 index. This is in agreement with our\nprevious results. Finally, a strong correlation is observed between the\ntime-resolved luminosity of the non-thermal component, L$_i^{nTh}$, and its\ncorresponding rest frame spectral peak energy, E$_{peak,i}^{rest,nTh}$, with a\nslope similar to the one reported in our previous articles. Assuming this\nrelation to be universal for all GRBs we estimate a redshift of ~1.55 for GRB\n131014A that is a typical value for long GRBs. These observational results are\nconsistent with the models in which the non-thermal emission is produced well\nabove the GRB jet photosphere but they may also be compatible with other\nscenarios (e.g., dissipative photosphere) that are not discussed in this\narticle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 19:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Such short separation encounters of\nsingle stars along their known orbits are not common in the Galactic Centre,\nmaking this process a possible but unlikely origin for G2. We also discuss\nclump formation in close binaries such as IRS 16SW and in asymmetric encounters\nas promising alternatives that deserve further numerical study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 20:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 17:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

Two experiments\nwere performed at nearly equal Reynolds numbers, in geometrically similar\nexperimental setups. Air was utilized in one of them and water in the other.\nWith air, it was found that the probability density function of power\nfluctuations is strongly asymmetric, while with water, it is nearly Gaussian.\nThis suggests that the outcome of a big change of the fluid density in the\nflow-stirrer interaction is not simply a change in the amplitude of stirrers'\nresponse. In the case of water, with a density roughly 830 times greater than\nair density, the coupling between the flow and the stirrers is stronger, so\nthat they follow more closely the fluctuations of the average rotation of the\nnearby flow. When the fluid is air, the coupling is much weaker. The result is\nnot just a smaller response of the stirrers to the torque exerted by the flow;\nthe PDF of the injected power becomes strongly asymmetric and its spectrum\nacquires a broad region that scales as $f^{-2}$. Thus, the asymmetry of the\nprobability density functions of torque or angular speed could be related to\nthe inability of the stirrers to respond to flow stresses. This happens, for\ninstance, when the torque exerted by the flow is weak, due to small fluid\ndensity, or when the stirrers' moment of inertia is large.

This implies that cells\nmaintain multiple rounds of chromosome replication per cell division by\nregulating the timing of chromosome replications. Here, we show that both cell\nsize and chromosome replication may be simultaneously regulated by the\nlong-standing initiator accumulation strategy. The strategy proposes that\ninitiators are produced in proportion to the volume increase and is accumulated\nat each origin of replication, and chromosome replication is initiated when a\ncritical amount per origin has accumulated. We show that this model maps to the\nincremental model of size control, which was previously shown to reproduce\nexperimentally observed correlations between various events in the cell cycle\nand explains the exponential dependence of cell size on the growth rate of the\ncell.

However, policy adjustments will sometimes be costly, which\nmeans that fine-tuning a policy to track variability in the environment very\ntightly will only sometimes be worthwhile. We use a classic fisheries\nmanagement question -- how to manage a stochastically varying population using\nannually varying quotas in order to maximize profit -- to examine how costs of\npolicy adjustment change optimal management recommendations. Costs of policy\nadjustment (here changes in fishing quotas through time) could take different\nforms. For example, these costs may respond to the size of the change being\nimplemented, or there could be a fixed cost any time a quota change is made. We\nshow how different forms of policy costs have contrasting implications for\noptimal policies. Though it is frequently assumed that costs to adjusting\npolicies will dampen variation in the policy, we show that certain cost\nstructures can actually increase variation through time. We further show that\nfailing to account for adjustment costs has a consistently worse economic\nimpact than would assuming these costs are present when they are not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 22:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

This missing\ngalactic feedback problem is extremely prominent in early-type galaxy bulges\nwhere there is little cool gas to make the SNe ejecta radiate at lower\ntemperature beyond the X-ray domain. We herein present a deep Suzaku\nobservation of an S0 galaxy NGC5866, which is relatively rich in molecular gas\nas an S0 galaxy and shows significant evidence of cool-hot gas interaction. By\njointly analyzing the Suzaku and an archival Chandra data, we measure the Fe/O\nabundance ratio to be $7.63_{-5.52}^{+7.28}$ relative to solar values. This\nabundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among\nthe highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies. NGC5866 also simultaneously has\nthe highest Fe/O abundance ratio and molecular gas mass among a small sample of\ngas-poor early-type galaxies. An estimation of the Fe budget indicates that\nNGC5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction, but far from the total\namount of Fe injected by Type Ia SNe. We also find that the hot gas temperature\nincreases from inner to outer halos, with the inner halo has a temperature of\n~0.25keV, clearly lower than that expected from Type Ia SNe heating. This low\ntemperature could be most naturally explained by additional cooling processes\nrelated to the cool-hot gas interaction as being indicated by the existence of\nmany extraplanar dusty filaments. Our results indicate that the large cool gas\ncontent and the presence of cool-hot gas interaction in the inner region of\nNGC5866 have significantly reduced the specific energy of the SN ejecta and so\nthe velocity of galactic outflow.

This paper proposes the Square Root Agreement Rule (SRA): a\nsimple reward mechanism that incentivizes truthful responses to objective\nevaluations on such platforms. In this mechanism, an agent gets a reward for an\nevaluation only if her answer matches that of her peer, where this reward is\ninversely proportional to a popularity index of the answer. This index is\ndefined to be the square root of the empirical frequency at which any two\nagents performing the same evaluation agree on the particular answer across\nevaluations of similar entities operating on the platform. Rarely agreed-upon\nanswers thus earn a higher reward than answers for which agreements are\nrelatively more common.\n  We show that in the many tasks regime, the truthful equilibrium under SRA is\nstrictly payoff-dominant across large classes of natural equilibria that could\narise in these settings, thus increasing the likelihood of its adoption. While\nthere exist other mechanisms achieving such guarantees, they either impose\nadditional assumptions on the response distribution that are not generally\nsatisfied for objective evaluations or they incentivize truthful behavior only\nif each agent performs a prohibitively large number of evaluations and commits\nto using the same strategy for each evaluation. SRA is the first known\nincentive mechanism satisfying such guarantees without imposing any such\nrequirements. Moreover, our empirical findings demonstrate the robustness of\nthe incentive properties of SRA in the presence of mild subjectivity or\nobservational biases in the responses. These properties make SRA uniquely\nattractive for administering reward-based incentive schemes (e.g., rebates,\ndiscounts, reputation scores, etc.) on online platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 00:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 22:49:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 19:49:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2018 22:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 16:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has\nbeen useful in visualizing and localizing tumor candidates and with the use of\nendorectal coils (ERC), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved. The\ncoils introduce intensity inhomogeneities and the surface coil intensity\ncorrection built into MRI scanners is used to reduce these inhomogeneities.\nHowever, the correction typically performed at the MRI scanner level leads to\nnoise amplification and noise level variations. Methods: In this study, we\nintroduce a new Monte Carlo-based noise compensation approach for coil\nintensity corrected endorectal MRI which allows for effective noise\ncompensation and preservation of details within the prostate. The approach\naccounts for the ERC SNR profile via a spatially-adaptive noise model for\ncorrecting non-stationary noise variations. Such a method is useful\nparticularly for improving the image quality of coil intensity corrected\nendorectal MRI data performed at the MRI scanner level and when the original\nraw data is not available. Results: SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)\nanalysis in patient experiments demonstrate an average improvement of 11.7 dB\nand 11.2 dB respectively over uncorrected endorectal MRI, and provides strong\nperformance when compared to existing approaches.

We illustrate that promising noise compensation performance can be\nachieved for the proposed approach, which is particularly important for\nprocessing coil intensity corrected endorectal MRI data performed at the MRI\nscanner level and when the original raw data is not available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 00:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

This allows some of the burden of creative\ncontent generation to be passed from humans to machines. The approach was\ntested in the domain of chess problem composition. We used it to automatically\ncompose numerous sets of chess problems based on attributes extracted and\nrecombined from chess problems and tournament games by humans, renowned\npaintings, computer-evolved abstract art, photographs of people, and classical\nmusic tracks. The quality of these generated chess problems was then assessed\nautomatically using an existing and experimentally-validated computational\nchess aesthetics model.

In particular, a\nlow quality chess source (i.e. tournament game sequences between weak players)\nused in combination with actual photographs of people was able to produce\nthree-move chess problems of comparable quality or better to those generated\nusing a high quality chess source (i.e. published compositions by human\nexperts), and more efficiently as well.

Exploiting this\nenvelope preserving property of CS samples, we propose a new fast dictionary\nlearning (DL) algorithm which is able to extract prototype signals from\ncompressive samples for efficient sparse representation and recovery of\nsignals.

In $4=3+1$ dimensions, two kinds of\ncosmological billiards are considered: the so-called 'big billiard' which\naccounts for pure gravity, and the 'small billiard', which is a\nsymmetry-reduced version of the previous one, and is obtained when the\n'symmetry walls' are considered. The solution of Einstein field equations is\nthis way mapped to the (discrete) Poincar\\'e map of a billiard ball on the\nsides of a triangular billiard table, in the Upper Poincar\\'e Half Plane\n(UPHP). The billiard modular group is the scheme within which the dynamics of\nclassical chaotic systems on surfaces of constant negative curvature is\nanalyzed. The periodic orbits of the two kinds of billiards are classified,\naccording to the different symmetry-quotienting mechanisms.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state. For this purpose we employ the SGRID code, which allows\nus to construct such data in previously inaccessible regions of the parameter\nspace. In particular, we consider spinning neutron stars in isolation and in\nbinary systems; we incorporate new methods to produce highly eccentric and\neccentricity reduced data; we present the possibility of computing data for\nsignificantly unequal-mass binaries; and we create equal-mass binaries with\nindividual compactness up to 0.23. As a proof of principle, we explore the\ndynamical evolution of three new configurations. First, we simulate a $q=2.06$\nmass ratio which is the highest mass ratio for a binary neutron star evolved in\nnumerical relativity to date. We find that mass transfer from the companion\nstar sets in a few revolutions before merger and a rest mass of\n$\\sim10^{-2}M_\\odot$ is transferred between the two stars.

In practice one may\nhave access to dimensionality-reduced observations of the data only, resulting,\ne.g., from undersampling due to complexity and speed constraints on the\nacquisition device or mechanism. More pertinently, even if the high-dimensional\ndata set is available it is often desirable to first project the data points\ninto a lower-dimensional space and to perform clustering there; this reduces\nstorage requirements and computational cost. The purpose of this paper is to\nquantify the impact of dimensionality reduction through random projection on\nthe performance of three subspace clustering algorithms, all of which are based\non principles from sparse signal recovery. Specifically, we analyze the\nthresholding based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm, the sparse subspace\nclustering (SSC) algorithm, and an orthogonal matching pursuit variant thereof\n(SSC-OMP). We find, for all three algorithms, that dimensionality reduction\ndown to the order of the subspace dimensions is possible without incurring\nsignificant performance degradation. Moreover, these results are order-wise\noptimal in the sense that reducing the dimensionality further leads to a\nfundamentally ill-posed clustering problem.

Variable selection\nprocedures included in these comparisons include methods based on $g$-priors,\nreciprocal lasso, adaptive lasso, scad, and minimax concave penalty criteria.\nThe use of precision-recall curves eliminates the sensitivity of our\nconclusions to the choice of tuning parameters. We find that Bayesian variable\nselection procedures based on nonlocal priors are competitive to all other\nprocedures in a range of simulation scenarios, and we subsequently explain this\nfavorable performance through a theoretical examination of their consistency\nproperties. When certain regularity conditions apply, we demonstrate that the\nnonlocal procedures are consistent for linear models even when the number of\ncovariates $p$ increases sub-exponentially with the sample size $n$. A model\nselection procedure based on Zellner's $g$-prior is also found to be\ncompetitive with penalized likelihood methods in identifying the true model,\nbut the posterior distribution on the model space induced by this method is\nmuch more dispersed than the posterior distribution induced on the model space\nby the nonlocal prior methods.

This paper provides a novel\nintensity invariant detection model (IIDM) for detection of intensity variant\nclones that is robust against JPEG compression, noise attacks and blurring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 13:26:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}

By using a first-principles approach,\nwe uncover the {\\it dynamic} ME couplings of the long-range spin-cycloid in\nBiFeO$_3$. Based on a microscopic Hamiltonian, our first-principles approach\ndisentangles the hidden ME couplings due to spin-current and\nexchange-striction. Beyond the spin-current polarization governed by the\ninverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction \\cite{iDM}, various spin-current\npolarizations derived from both ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive\ndistortions cooperatively produce the strong non-reciprocal directional\ndichroism or the asymmetry in the absorption of counter-propagating light in\nBiFeO$_3$. Our systematic approach can be generally applied to any multiferroic\nmaterial, laying the foundation for revealing hidden ME couplings on an atomic\nscale and for exploiting optical ME effects in the next generation of\ntechnological devices such as optical diodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 18:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}
