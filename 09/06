Different from the traditional domain adaption methods which rely on a\nglobal domain shift for all classes between source and target domain, the\nproposed method is more flexible to capture individual class variations across\ndomains. By adopting a natural and widely used assumption -- \"the data samples\nfrom the same class should lay on a low-dimensional subspace, even if they come\nfrom different domains\", the proposed method circumvents the limitation of the\nglobal domain shift, and solves the cross-domain recognition by finding the\ncompact joint subspaces of source and target domain. Specifically, given\nlabeled samples in source domain, we construct subspaces for each of the\nclasses. Then we construct subspaces in the target domain, called anchor\nsubspaces, by collecting unlabeled samples that are close to each other and\nhighly likely all fall into the same class. The corresponding class label is\nthen assigned by minimizing a cost function which reflects the overlap and\ntopological structure consistency between subspaces across source and target\ndomains, and within anchor subspaces, respectively.We further combine the\nanchor subspaces to corresponding source subspaces to construct the compact\njoint subspaces. Subsequently, one-vs-rest SVM classifiers are trained in the\ncompact joint subspaces and applied to unlabeled data in the target domain. We\nevaluate the proposed method on two widely used datasets: object recognition\ndataset for computer vision tasks, and sentiment classification dataset for\nnatural language processing tasks. Comparison results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms the comparison methods on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2015 17:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

During inflation there\nmay be a heavy scalar field stabilized at a value deviated from the low-energy\nminimum. As the heavy field moves to the low-energy minimum, the inflaton\npotential could be significantly modified. In extreme cases, the inflaton\npotential vanishes and the inflaton becomes almost massless at some time after\ninflation. Such transition of the inflaton potential has interesting\nimplications for primordial density perturbations, reheating, creation of\nunwanted relics, dark radiation, and experimental search for light degrees of\nfreedom. To be concrete, we consider a chaotic inflation in supergravity where\nthe inflaton mass parameter is promoted to a modulus field, finding that the\ninflaton becomes stable after the transition and contributes to dark matter.\nAnother example is the new inflation by the MSSM Higgs field which acquires a\nlarge expectation value just after inflation, but it returns to the origin\nafter the transition and settles down at the electroweak vacuum. Interestingly,\nthe smallness of the electroweak scale compared to the Planck scale is directly\nrelated to the flatness of the inflaton potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2015 19:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The first step in this process is\nthe estimation of good values for two parameters, the time delay and the\nembedding dimension. Many heuristics and strategies have been proposed in the\nliterature for estimating these values. Few, if any, of these methods were\ndeveloped with forecasting in mind, however, and their results are not optimal\nfor that purpose. Even so, these heuristics---intended for other\napplications---are routinely used when building delay coordinate\nreconstruction-based forecast models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy\nfor choosing optimal parameter values for forecast methods that are based on\ndelay-coordinate reconstructions. The basic calculation involves maximizing the\nshared information between each delay vector and the future state of the\nsystem. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method on several synthetic and\nexperimental systems, showing that this metric can be calculated quickly and\nreliably from a relatively short time series, and that it provides a direct\nindication of how well a near-neighbor based forecasting method will work on a\ngiven delay reconstruction of that time series.

In the latter approach, we apply the projection\nmethod to deal with the potentially quasiperiodic ground states. A variable\ncell method of optimizing the shape and size of higher-dimensional periodic\ncell is developed to minimize the free energy with respect to the order\nparameters.

Baseline models\ninvestigated in the literature characterize the performance of IS in terms of a\nsensing-throughput tradeoff, however, this characterization assumes the\nknowledge of the involved channels at the secondary transmitter, which is\nunavailable in practice.

We\nhave selected these fields carefully to provide high signal-to-noise ratio,\navoid residual systematics in the SPIRE maps, and span a wide range of surface\nbrightness. The HFI maps are bandpass-corrected to match the emission observed\nby the SPIRE bandpasses. The SPIRE maps are convolved to match the HFI beam and\nput on a common pixel grid. We measure the cross-calibration relative gain\nbetween the instruments using two methods in each field, pixel-to-pixel\ncorrelation and angular power spectrum measurements. The SPIRE / HFI relative\ngains are 1.047 ($\\pm$ 0.0069) and 1.003 ($\\pm$ 0.0080) at 545 and 857 GHz,\nrespectively, indicating very good agreement between the instruments. These\nrelative gains deviate from unity by much less than the uncertainty of the\nabsolute extended emission calibration, which is about 6.4% and 9.5% for HFI\nand SPIRE, respectively, but the deviations are comparable to the values 1.4%\nand 5.5% for HFI and SPIRE if the uncertainty from models of the common\ncalibrator can be discounted. Of the 5.5% uncertainty for SPIRE, 4% arises from\nthe uncertainty of the effective beam solid angle, which impacts the adopted\nSPIRE point source to extended source unit conversion factor (Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 08:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 18:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

We discuss the possible role of the sigmoid\neruption in triggering the flare, which consists of two different set of\nribbons: parallel ribbons as well as a large-scale quasi-circular ribbon.\nSeveral observational evidence and nonlinear force-free field extrapolation\nresults show the existence of a large-scale fan-spine type magnetic\nconfiguration with a sigmoid lying under a section of the fan dome. The event\ncan be explained with the following two phases. During the pre-flare phase, we\nobserved the formation and appearance of sigmoid via tether-cutting\nreconnection between the two sets of sheared fields under the fan dome. The\nsecond, main flare phase, features the eruption of the sigmoid, the subsequent\nflare with parallel ribbons, and a quasi-circular ribbon. We propose the\nfollowing multi-stage successive reconnections scenario for the main flare.\nFirst, tether-cutting reconnection is responsible for the formation and the\neruption of the sigmoid structure. Second, the reconnection occurred in the\nwake of the erupting sigmoid produces the parallel flare ribbons on the both\nsides of the circular polarity inversion line. Third, the null-type\nreconnection higher in the corona, possibly triggered by the erupting sigmoid,\nleads to the formation of a large quasi-circular ribbon.

From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the\nfrequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie-strength, showing\nthat collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high\nturnover rates.

The prevalence of super\nties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and\nreward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of\ndescriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications\ncoauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for\npertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group\nexperience.

While recent Herschel\nobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar CMF is close to the\nthermal Jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of the\npower-law tail of the CMF/IMF at the high-mass end is less clear. Inutsuka\n(2001) proposed a theoretical scenario in which the origin of the power-law\ntail can be understood as resulting from the growth of an initial spectrum of\ndensity perturbations seeded along the long axis of filaments by interstellar\nturbulence. Here, we report the statistical properties of the line-mass\nfluctuations of filaments in nearby molecular clouds observed with Herschel\nusing a 1-D power spectrum analysis.

HPXe chambers are capable\nof imaging electron tracks, a feature that enhances the separation between\nsignal events (the two electrons emitted in the 0nbb decay of 136Xe) and\nbackground events, arising chiefly from single electrons of kinetic energy\ncompatible with the end-point of the 0nbb decay (Qbb ). Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction. Due to electron multiple scattering, this\nstrategy is not perfectly efficient on an event-by-event basis, but a\nstatistical estimator can be constructed which can be used to reject background\nevents by one order of magnitude at a moderate cost (approx. 30%) in signal\nefficiency. Combining this estimator with the excellent energy resolution and\ntopological signature identification characteristic of the HPXe TPC, it is\npossible to reach a background rate of less than one count per ton-year of\nexposure. Such a low background rate is an essential feature of the next\ngeneration of 0nbb experiments, aiming to fully explore the inverse hierarchy\nof neutrino masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 15:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

Since\nproteins half-lives can be comparable to the cell-cycle length, randomness in\ncell-division times generates additional intercellular variability in protein\nlevels. Moreover, as many mRNA/protein species are expressed at low-copy\nnumbers, errors incurred in partitioning of molecules between the mother and\ndaughter cells are significant. We derive analytical formulas for the total\nnoise in protein levels for a general class of cell-division time and\npartitioning error distributions. Using a novel hybrid approach the total noise\nis decomposed into components arising from i) stochastic expression; ii)\npartitioning errors at the time of cell-division and iii) random cell-division\nevents. These formulas reveal that random cell-division times not only generate\nadditional extrinsic noise but also critically affect the mean protein copy\nnumbers and intrinsic noise components. Counter intuitively, in some parameter\nregimes noise in protein levels can decrease as cell-division times become more\nstochastic. Computations are extended to consider genome duplication, where the\ngene dosage is increased by two-fold at a random point in the cell-cycle. We\nsystematically investigate how the timing of genome duplication influences\ndifferent protein noise components. Intriguingly, results show that noise\ncontribution from stochastic expression is minimized at an optimal genome\nduplication time.
