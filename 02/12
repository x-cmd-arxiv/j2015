In the usual arrangement, an off-axis gating pulse\ninduces birefringence in a medium exhibiting a strong Kerr response (commonly\ncarbon disulfide) which is followed by a polarizer aligned to fully attenuate\nthe on-axis imaging beam. By properly timing the gate pulse, imaging light\nexperiences a polarization change allowing time-dependent transmission through\nthe polarizer to form an ultrashort image. The crossed-beam system is effective\nin generating short gate times, however, signal transmission through the system\nis complicated by the crossing angle of the gate and imaging beams. This work\npresents a robust ultrafast time-gated imaging scheme based on a combination of\ntype-I frequency doubling and a collinear optical arrangement in carbon\ndisulfide. We discuss spatial effects arising from crossed-beam Kerr gating,\nand examine the imaging spatial resolution and transmission timing affected by\ncollinear activation of the Kerr medium, which eliminates crossing angle\nspatial effects and produces gate times on the order of 1 ps. In addition, the\ncollinear, two-color system is applied to image structure in an optical fiber\nand a gasoline fuel spray, in order to demonstrate image formation utilizing\nballistic or refracted light, selected on the basis of its transmission time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 16:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

In this context,\nthe notion of utility indifference price has gained popularity in the academic\ncircles. Although theoretically very appealing, this pricing method remains\ndifficult to apply in practice, due to the high computational cost of solving\nthe nonlinear partial integro-differential equation associated to the\nindifference price. In this work, we develop closed form approximations to\nexponential utility indifference prices in exponential L\\'evy models. To this\nend, we first establish a new non-asymptotic approximation of the indifference\nprice which extends earlier results on small risk aversion asymptotics of this\nquantity. Next, we use this formula to derive a closed-form approximation of\nthe indifference price by treating the L\\'evy model as a perturbation of the\nBlack-Scholes model.

The strong galactic gravitational field makes this impossible on\nenergetic grounds. It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy. This expulsion of only short lines of force can\nbe accomplished by a spike instability associated with gigantic astrophysical\nsuperbubbles.

However, little\nprogress has been made in the design of distributed algorithms with convergence\nguarantees for general and commonly used $\\alpha$-fair allocations. In this\npaper, we study weighted $\\alpha$-fair packing problems, that is, the problems\nof maximizing the objective functions (i) $\\sum_j w_j\nx_j^{1-\\alpha}/(1-\\alpha)$ when $\\alpha > 0$, $\\alpha \\neq 1$ and (ii) $\\sum_j\nw_j \\ln x_j$ when $\\alpha = 1$, over linear constraints $Ax \\leq b$, $x\\geq 0$,\nwhere $w_j$ are positive weights and $A$ and $b$ are non-negative.

Under this model, we provide a\ndistributed algorithm for general $\\alpha$ that converges to an\n$\\varepsilon-$approximate solution in time (number of distributed iterations)\nthat has an inverse polynomial dependence on the approximation parameter\n$\\varepsilon$ and poly-logarithmic dependence on the problem size. This is the\nfirst distributed algorithm for weighted $\\alpha-$fair packing with\npoly-logarithmic convergence in the input size. The algorithm uses simple local\nupdate rules and is stateless (namely, it allows asynchronous updates, is\nself-stabilizing, and allows incremental and local adjustments). We also obtain\na number of structural results that characterize $\\alpha-$fair allocations as\nthe value of $\\alpha$ is varied. These results deepen our understanding of\nfairness guarantees in $\\alpha-$fair packing allocations, and also provide\ninsight into the behavior of $\\alpha-$fair allocations in the asymptotic cases\n$\\alpha\\rightarrow 0$, $\\alpha \\rightarrow 1$, and $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 16:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 16:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 00:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

We assume\nthat agents first experience a formative period, in which they adjust their\nlearning style acting as supervised Bayesian adaptive learners. The formative\nphase is followed by a period of social influence by reinforcement learning. By\ncomparing data generated by the agents with data from a sample of 15000 Moral\nFoundation questionnaires we found the following. 1. The number of information\nexchanges in the formative phase correlates positively with statistics\nidentifying liberals in the social influence phase. This is consistent with\nrecent evidence that connects the dopamine receptor D4-7R gene, political\norientation and early age social clique size. 2. The learning algorithms that\nresult from the formative phase vary in the way they treat novelty and\ncorroborative information with more conservative-like agents treating it more\nequally than liberal-like agents. This is consistent with the correlation\nbetween political affiliation and the Openness personality trait reported in\nthe literature. 3. Under the increase of a model parameter interpreted as an\nexternal pressure, the statistics of liberal agents resemble more those of\nconservative agents, consistent with reports on the consequences of external\nthreats on measures of conservatism. We also show that in the social influence\nphase liberal-like agents readapt much faster than conservative-like agents\nwhen subjected to changes on the relevant set of moral issues.

The primary goal of the paper is to\nprove the convergence of the numerical interfaces of the DG methods to the\ninterface of the Hele-Shaw flow. This is achieved by establishing error\nestimates that depend on $\\epsilon^{-1}$ only in some low polynomial orders,\ninstead of exponential orders. Similar to [14], the crux is to prove a discrete\nspectrum estimate in the discontinuous Galerkin finite element space. However,\nthe validity of such a result is not obvious because the DG space is not a\nsubspace of the (energy) space $H^1$ and it is larger than the finite element\nspace.

Although Sgr A* was in a relatively quiet\nphase, the high sensitivity of ALMA and the VLA allowed us to detect and fit\nmaxima of an observed minor flare where flux density varied by ~10%.\n  The fitted times of flux density maxima at frequencies from 100 GHz to 19\nGHz, as well as a cross-correlation analysis, reveal a simple\nfrequency-dependent time lag relation where maxima at higher frequencies lead\nthose at lower frequencies. Taking the observed size-frequency relation of Sgr\nA* into account, these time lags suggest a moderately relativistic (lower\nestimates: 0.5c for two-sided, 0.77c for one-sided) collimated outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 20:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 13:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

Because the\nenvironment encodes such pointer state information uniformly and hence\nredundantly throughout its entire volume, the information is equally available\nto all observers regardless of their location. This framework is applied to the\nobservation of stellar center-of-mass positions, which are assumed to be\nencoded by the ambient photon field in a way that is uniformly accessible to\nall possible observers. Assuming Landauer's Principle, constructing such\nenvironmental encodings requires $(ln2) kT$ per encoded bit.

In this paper, we show that even some games with perfect recall can be\nproblematic to implement. Specifically, we show that if the agents have a sense\nof time passing (say, access to a clock), then some extensive-form games can no\nlonger be implemented; no matter how we attempt to time the game, some\ninformation will leak to the agents that they are not supposed to have.

Specifically, we\nshow that for some games the time required to approximately implement the game\ngrows as a power tower of height proportional to the number of players and with\na parameter that measures the precision of the approximation at the top of the\npower tower.

In this paper, we compile\nphotometric data from the T11 0.8m Automated Photoelectric Telescope at\nFairborn Observatory taken over ~14 years, including the constrained transit\nwindow, which results in a dispositive null result for both full transit\nexclusion of HD 130322b to a depth of 0.017 mag and grazing transit exclusion\nto a depth of ~0.001 mag. Our analysis of the starspot activity via the\nphotometric data reveals a highly accurate stellar rotation period: 26.53\n+/-0.70 days. In addition, the brightness of the host with respect to the\ncomparison stars is anti-correlated with the Ca II H and K indices, typical for\na young solar-type star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We describe and implement a novel super-Lagrangian\nrefinement scheme to increase, adaptively and 'on the fly', the mass and\nspatial resolution in targeted regions around the accreting black holes at\nlimited computational cost. While our refinement scheme is generically\napplicable and flexible, for the purpose of this paper we select the smallest\nresolvable scales to match black holes' instantaneous Bondi radii, thus\neffectively resolving Bondi-Hoyle-like accretion in full galaxy formation\nsimulations. This permits us to not only estimate gas properties close to the\nBondi radius much more accurately, but also allows us to improve black hole\naccretion and feedback implementations. We thus devise a more generic feedback\nmodel where accretion and feedback depend on the geometry of the local gas\ndistribution and where mass, energy and momentum loading are followed\nsimultaneously. We present a series of tests of our refinement and feedback\nmethods and apply them to models of isolated disc galaxies.

In recent years it was suggested that\nWD-WD direct collisions provide an additional channel for such explosions. Here\nwe extend the studies of such explosions, and explore the role of Helium-shells\nin affecting the thermonuclear explosions. We study both the impact of low-mass\nhelium ($\\sim0.01$ M$_{\\odot})$ shells, as well as high mass shells ($\\ge0.1$\nM$_{\\odot}$). We find that detonation of the massive helium layers precede the\ndetonation of the WD Carbon-Oxygen (CO) bulk during the collision and can\nchange the explosive evolution and outcomes for the cases of high mass\nHe-shells. In particular, the He-shell detonation propagates on the WD surface\nand inefficiently burns material prior to the CO detonation that later follows\nin the central parts of the WD. Such evolution leads to larger production of\nintermediate elements, producing large yields of $^{44}{\\rm Ti}$ and $^{48}{\\rm\nCr}$ relative to the pure CO-CO WD collisions. Collisions of WDs with a\nlow-mass He-shell do not give rise to helium detonation, but helium burning\ndoes precede the CO bulk detonation. Such collisions produce a high velocity,\nlow-mass of ejected burned material enriched with intermediate elements, with\nsmaller changes to the overall explosion outcomes. The various effects arising\nfrom the contribution of low/high mass He layers change the kinematics and the\nmorphological structure of collision-induced SNe and may thereby provide unique\nobservational signatures for such SNe, and play a role in the chemical\nenrichment of galaxies and the production of intermediate elements and\npositrons from their longer-term decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 21:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 13:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Using Monte-Carlo techniques\nto explore the possible density profiles of this form, a fit to\nstellar-kinematical data of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is performed. In order\nfor ULAs to resolve the cusp-core problem (without recourse to baryon feedback\nor other astrophysical effects) the axion mass must satisfy $m_a<1.1\\times\n10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$ at 95\\% C.L. On the other hand, ULAs with $m_a\\lesssim\n1\\times 10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$ are in some tension with cosmological structure\nformation. An axion solution to the cusp-core problem thus makes novel\npredictions for future measurements of the epoch of reionisation. On the other\nhand, this can be seen as evidence that structure formation could soon impose a\n\\emph{Catch 22} on axion/scalar field DM, similar to the case of warm DM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 21:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 15:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 19:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

There exists a trade-off of optimizing the average\nor maximum TTR in the CH rendezvous protocol design. On one hand, the random CH\nprotocol leads to the best \"average\" TTR without ensuring a finite \"maximum\"\nTTR (two CRs may never rendezvous in the worst case), or a high rendezvous\ndiversity (multiple rendezvous channels). On the other hand, many\nsequence-based CH protocols ensure a finite maximum TTR (upper bound of TTR)\nand a high rendezvous diversity, while they inevitably yield a larger average\nTTR.

The transport in these strongly\ndisordered quantum wells is activated by dipole-dipole repulsion. The latter\ninduces an emission blue shift that increases linearly with exciton density,\nwhereas the radiative recombination rate increases exponentially. Under\ncontinuous, localized excitation, we measure a continuous red shift of the\nemission, as excitons propagate away from the excitation spot. This shift\ncorresponds to a steady-state gradient of exciton density, measured over\nseveral tens of micrometers. Time-resolved micro-photoluminescence experiments\nprovide information on the dynamics of recombination and transport of dipolar\nexcitons. We account for the ensemble of experimental results by solving the\nnonlinear drift-diffusion equation. Quantitative analysis suggests that in such\nstructures, exciton propagation on the scale of 10 to 20 microns is mainly\ndriven by diffusion, rather than by drift, due to the strong disorder and the\npresence of nonradiative defects. Secondary exciton creation, most probably by\nthe intense higher-energy luminescence, guided along the sample plane, is shown\nto contribute to the exciton emission pattern on the scale up to 100 microns.\nThe exciton propagation length is strongly temperature dependent, the emission\nbeing quenched beyond a critical distance governed by nonradiative\nrecombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 23:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact,\nnon-parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given $\\alpha$-threshold,\nbut for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive.\nIn this paper, we show that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating\nthe columns of a very large matrix ${\\bf P}$.

In this paper we point out\nthat the Unruh effect is not the whole story in accounting for all the\nrelativistic effects in quantum teleportation. First, there could be\ndegradation of fidelity by a common field environment even when both quantum\nobjects are in inertial motion. Second, relativistic effects entering the\ndescription of the dynamics such as frame dependence, time dilation, and\nDoppler shift, already existent in inertial motion, can compete with or even\noverwhelm the effect due to uniform acceleration in a quantum field. We show it\nis not true that larger acceleration of an object would necessarily lead to a\nfaster degradation of fidelity. These claims are based on four cases of quantum\nteleportation we studied using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled via a common\nquantum field initially in the Minkowski vacuum. We find the quantum\nentanglement evaluated around the light cone, rather than the conventional ones\nevaluated on the Minkowski time-slices, is the necessary condition for the\naveraged fidelity of quantum teleportation beating the classical one.

The wholeness is an essential part of any\ncomplex system and exists, to some degree or other, in spaces. This paper\ndefines wholeness as a hierarchical graph, in which individual centers are\nrepresented as the nodes and their relationships as the directed links. The\nhierarchical graph gets its name from the inherent scaling hierarchy revealed\nby the head/tail breaks, which is a classification scheme and visualization\ntool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution. We suggest that (1) the degrees\nof wholeness for individual centers should be measured by PageRank (PR) scores\nbased on the notion that high-degree-of-life centers are those to which many\nhigh-degree-of-life centers point, and (2) that the hierarchical levels, or the\nht-index of the PR scores induced by the head/tail breaks can characterize the\ndegree of wholeness for the whole: the higher the ht-index, the more life or\nwholeness in the whole. Three case studies applied to the Alhambra building\ncomplex and the street networks of Manhattan and Sweden illustrate that the\ndefined wholeness captures fairly well human intuitions on the degree of life\nfor the geographic spaces. We further suggest that the mathematical model of\nwholeness be an important model of geographic representation, because it is\ntopological oriented that enables us to see the underlying scaling structure.\nThe model can guide geodesign, which should be considered as the\nwholeness-extending transformations that are essentially like the unfolding\nprocesses of seeds or embryos, for creating beautiful built and natural\nenvironments or with a high degree of wholeness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 07:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 11:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

Automatic weight generation is a non-trivial, however\nan important task in instance matching technique. Therefore, identifying an\nappropriate metric for generating weight for a property automatically is\nnevertheless a formidable task. In this paper, we investigate an approach of\ngenerating weights automatically by considering hypotheses: (1) the weight of a\nproperty is directly proportional to the ratio of the number of its distinct\nvalues to the number of instances contain the property, and (2) the weight is\nalso proportional to the ratio of the number of distinct values of a property\nto the number of instances in a training dataset.

To take into account the structure-dependent nature of the current, in\na previous set of papers we suggested a mechanism of sequential tunneling among\nneighbouring amino acids. As a matter of fact, it is well accepted that, when\nirradiated with green light, bR undergoes a conformational change at a\nmolecular level. Thus, the role played by the protein tertiary-structure in\nmodeling the charge transfer cannot be neglected. The aim of this paper is to\ngo beyond previous models, in the framework of a new branch of electronics, we\ncalled proteotronics, which exploits the ability to use proteins as reliable,\nwell understood materials, for the development of novel bioelectronic devices.\nIn particular, the present approach assumes that the conformational change is\nnot the unique transformation that the protein undergoes when irradiated by\nlight.

We aim to bridge the gap between these\ntwo methods in solving constrained overdetermined linear regression\nproblems---e.g., $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_1$ regression problems. We propose a hybrid\nalgorithm named pwSGD that uses RLA techniques for preconditioning and\nconstructing an importance sampling distribution, and then performs an SGD-like\niterative process with weighted sampling on the preconditioned system.

The experiments have been performed using an\nultra-high vacuum setup equipped with an infrared spectrometer that is used to\ninvestigate the spectral evolution of homogeneously mixed ice upon\nco-deposition in thin films, for temperatures in the 90 to 140 K domain. With\nthis non-energetic detection method we find a significantly lower activation\nenergy for H/D exchange -- $3840 \\pm 125$ K -- than previously reported.

In\nthis paper, two kinds of bidirectional teleportation schemes in order to\ncorrect and improve LN protocol are presented. In the first scheme, Alice and\nBob as two legitimate users can simultaneously teleport an unknown single-qubit\nstate to each other with the help of controller Charlie. In the second scheme,\nAlice can transmit two-qubit entangled state to Bob and at the same time Bob\ncan teleport single-qubit state to Alice. In both of proposed schemes the\nquantum channel linking users is a GHZ-Bell state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 10:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 17:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

In this article we consider the shear-induced\nrupture of short DNA duplexes, a system that has been given new importance by\nrecently designed force sensors and nanotechnological devices. We argue that\nrupture must be understood as an activated process, where the duplex state is\nmetastable and the strands will separate in a finite time that depends on the\nduplex length and the force applied. Thus, the critical shearing force required\nto rupture a duplex within a given experiment depends strongly on the time\nscale of observation. We use simple models of DNA to demonstrate that this\napproach naturally captures the experimentally observed dependence of the\ncritical force on duplex length for a given observation time. In particular,\nthe critical force is zero for the shortest duplexes, before rising sharply and\nthen plateauing in the long length limit. The prevailing approach, based on\nidentifying when the presence of each additional base pair within the duplex is\nthermodynamically unfavorable rather than allowing for metastability, does not\npredict a time-scale-dependent critical force and does not naturally\nincorporate a critical force of zero for the shortest duplexes. Additionally,\nmotivated by a recently proposed force sensor, we investigate application of\nstress to a duplex in a mixed mode that interpolates between shearing and\nunzipping. As with pure shearing, the critical force depends on the time scale\nof observation; at a fixed time scale and duplex length, the critical force\nexhibits a sigmoidal dependence on the fraction of the duplex that is subject\nto shearing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 12:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

The astrophysical null measured over the full rotation is fairly\nconstant, with a mean value of 1.52%, and a slight additional azimuthal\nmodulation of +/-0.2%.

The modest azimuthal variation may be explained by some skewness\nor anisotropy of the spatially extended source, e.g., an elliptical or spiral\ngeometry, or clumping, but it could also be due to the presence of a point\nsource located at a separation of ~120 mas (17AU) with ~6*10-3 of the stellar\nflux.

Unfortunately, practical truncations of $n$PIEA can\nunphysically violate symmetries. Pilaftsis and Teresi (PT) addressed this by\nintroducing a \"symmetry improvement\" scheme in the context of the 2PIEA for an\nO(2) scalar theory, ensuring that the Goldstone boson is massless in the broken\nsymmetry phase [A. Pilaftsis and D. Teresi, Nuc.Phys. B 874, 2 (2013), pp.\n594--619]. We extend this by introducing a symmetry improved 3PIEA for O(N)\ntheories, for which the basic variables are the 1-, 2- and 3-point correlation\nfunctions. This requires the imposition of a Ward identity involving the\n3-point function. The method leads to an infinity of physically distinct\nschemes, though an analogue of d'Alembert's principle is used to single out a\nunique scheme. The standard equivalence hierarchy of $n$PIEA no longer holds\nwith symmetry improvement and we investigate the difference between the\nsymmetry improved 3PIEA and 2PIEA. We present renormalized equations of motion\nand counter-terms for 2 and 3 loop truncations of the effective action, leaving\ntheir numerical solution to future work. We solve the Hartree-Fock\napproximation and find that our method achieves a middle ground between the\nunimproved 2PIEA and PT methods. The phase transition predicted by our method\nis weakly first order and the Goldstone theorem is satisfied. We also show\nthat, in contrast to PT, the symmetry improved 3PIEA at 2 loops does not\npredict the correct Higgs decay rate, but does at 3 loops. These results\nsuggest that symmetry improvement should not be applied to $n$PIEA truncated to\n$<n$ loops. We also show that symmetry improvement is compatible with the\nColeman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, a check on the consistency of the formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 13:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 04:05:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

CS is known as an efficient scheduling method that can assign\ndifferent time fractions for users or, equivalently, satisfy different channel\naccess ratio (CAR) requirements of users while exploiting multi-user diversity.\nWe first mathematically analyze the throughput characteristics of CS in\narbitrary fading statistics and data rate functions. It is shown that the\nthroughput gain of CS increases as the CAR of a user decreases or the number of\nusers in a cell increases. For Nakagami-m fading channels, we obtain the\naverage throughput in closed-form and investigate the effects of the average\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the shape parameter m, and the CAR on the throughput\nperformance. In addition, we propose a threshold-based opportunistic feedback\ntechnique in order to reduce feedback overhead while satisfying the CAR\nrequirements of users. We prove that the average feedback overhead of the\nproposed technique is upper bounded by -ln(p), where p is the probability that\nno user satisfies the threshold condition in a cell. Finally, we adopt a novel\nfairness criterion, called qualitative fairness, which considers not only the\nquantity of the allocated resources to users but also the quality of the\nresources. It is observed that CS provides a better qualitative fairness than\nother scheduling algorithms designed for controlling CARs of users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 14:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

We compare the energy spectra of the $^{104,106,108,110}$Sn and\n$^{103,105,107,109}$Sn isotopes with/without a nonlinear fit to the\nexperimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 14:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-13"}

In our method, late-type galaxies are treated by means of a\nparametric phenomenological method based on PEP/HerMES data up to z~4, whereas\nspheroids are described by means of a physically motivated backward model. The\nspectral evolution of spheroids is modelled by means of a single-mass model,\nassociated to a present-day elliptical with K-band luminosity comparable to the\nbreak of the local early-type luminosity function. The formation of\nproto-spheroids is assumed to occurr across the redshift range 1< z < 5. The\nkey parameter is represented by the redshift z_0.5 at which half\nproto-spheroids are already formed. A statistical study indicates for this\nparameter values between z_0.5=1.5 and z_0.5=3.

Behaviour in such\nexchanges involves complexities related to each agent's preference for equity\nwith their partner, beliefs about the partner's appetite for equity, beliefs\nabout the partner's model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan\ndifferent numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise\naccount of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what\nunderlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive\npartially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various\ncomplexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we\nshow how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a\nvariant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm.

Linear map of\nmodule over commutative ring is morphism of corresponding representation.

Polymorphism\nof representations is a map of Cartesian product of representations which is a\nmorphism of representations with respect to each separate independent variable.\nReduced morphism of representations allows us to simplify the study of\nmorphisms of representations. However a representation has to satisfy specific\nrequirements for existence of reduced polymomorphism of representations. It is\npossible that Abelian group is only $\\Omega$-algebra, such that representation\nin this algebra admits polymorphism of representations.
