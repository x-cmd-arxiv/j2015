Important examples are for\ninstance the solution set of linear matrix inequalities or the Schur/Hurwitz\nstability domains. These sets often have very complicated shapes (non-convex,\nand even non-connected), which renders very difficult their manipulation. It is\ntherefore of considerable importance to find simple-enough approximations of\nthese sets, able to capture their main characteristics while maintaining a low\nlevel of complexity. For these reasons, in the past years several convex\napproximations, based for instance on hyperrect-angles, polytopes, or\nellipsoids have been proposed. In this work, we move a step further, and\npropose possibly non-convex approximations , based on a small volume polynomial\nsuperlevel set of a single positive polynomial of given degree. We show how\nthese sets can be easily approximated by minimizing the L1 norm of the\npolynomial over the semialgebraic set, subject to positivity constraints.\nIntuitively, this corresponds to the trace minimization heuristic commonly\nencounter in minimum volume ellipsoid problems. From a computational viewpoint,\nwe design a hierarchy of linear matrix inequality problems to generate these\napproximations, and we provide theoretically rigorous convergence results, in\nthe sense that the hierarchy of outer approximations converges in volume (or,\nequivalently, almost everywhere and almost uniformly) to the original set. Two\nmain applications of the proposed approach are considered. The first one aims\nat reconstruction/approximation of sets from a finite number of samples. In the\nsecond one, we show how the concept of polynomial superlevel set can be used to\ngenerate samples uniformly distributed on a given semialgebraic set. The\nefficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated by different numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 16:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic\ntheorem of quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such\nas provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed\nup the adiabatic quantum behavior. Here, we propose a superadiabatic route to\nimplement universal quantum computation. Our method is based on the realization\nof piecewise controlled superadiabatic evolutions. Remarkably, they can be\nobtained by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. In\nparticular, we discuss the implementation of fast rotation gates and arbitrary\nn-qubit controlled gates, which can be used to design different sets of\nuniversal quantum gates. Concerning the energy cost of the superadiabatic\nimplementation, we show that it is dictated by the quantum speed limit,\nproviding an upper bound for the corresponding adiabatic counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 17:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 20:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 03:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

The two SSN\npeaks occurred in the years 2012 and 2014. Even though SSN was larger during\nthe second peak, we find that there were more space weather events during the\nfirst peak. The space weather events we considered are large solar energetic\nparticle (SEP) events and major geomagnetic storms associated with coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). We also considered interplanetary type II radio bursts, which\nare indicative of energetic CMEs driving shocks. When we compared the CME\nproperties between the two SSN peaks, we find that more energetic CMEs occurred\nduring the 2012 peak. In particular, we find that CMEs accompanying IP type II\nbursts had an average speed of 1543 km/s during the 2012 peak compared to 1201\nkm/s during the 2014 peak. This result is consistent with the reduction in the\naverage speed of the general population of CMEs during the second peak. All SEP\nevents were associated with the interplanetary type II bursts, which are better\nthan halo CMEs as indicators of space weather. The comparison between the two\npeaks also revealed that the discordant behavior between the CME rate and SSN\nwas more pronounced during the second peak. None of the 14 disk-center halo\nCMEs was associated with a major storm in 2014. The lone major storm in 2014\nwas due to the intensification of the (southward) magnetic field in the\nassociated magnetic cloud by a shock that caught up and propagated into the\nmagnetic cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 17:27:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 14:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

In this\nLetter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary diagnostic\nwe used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters, and on the iron\nprofiles. In keeping with observations, our simulated clusters display a\nvariety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range from steadily decreasing\nprofiles at small radii, characteristic of cool-core systems, to nearly flat\ncore isentropic profiles, characteristic of non-cool-core systems. Using\nobservational criteria to distinguish between the two classes of objects, we\nfind that they occur in similar proportions in both simulations and in\nobservations. Furthermore, we also find that simulated cool-core clusters have\nprofiles of iron abundance that are steeper than those of NCC clusters, which\nis also in agreement with observational results. We show that the capability of\nour simulations to generate a realistic cool-core structure in the cluster\npopulation is due to AGN feedback and artificial thermal diffusion: their\ncombined action allows us to naturally distribute the energy extracted from\nsuper-massive black holes and to compensate for the radiative losses of\nlow-entropy gas with short cooling time residing in the cluster core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 19:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 14:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

We have studied their\ncombined effect through a suite of 2d simulations of protoplanetary discs\nundergoing X-ray photoevaporation with an embedded giant planet. In a previous\nwork we explored how the formation of a giant planet triggers the dispersal of\nthe inner disc by photo-evaporation at earlier times than what would have\nhappened otherwise. This is particularly relevant for the observed transition\ndiscs with large holes and high mass accretion rates that cannot be explained\nby photo-evaporation alone. In this work we significantly expand the parameter\nspace investigated by previous simulations. In addition, the updated model\nincludes thermal sweeping, needed for studying the complete dispersal of the\ndisc. After the removal of the inner disc the disc is a non accreting\ntransition disc, an object that is rarely seen in observations. We assess the\nrelative length of this phase, to understand if it is long lived enough to be\nfound observationally. Depending on the parameters, especially on the X-ray\nluminosity of the star, we find that the fraction of time spent as a\nnon-accretor greatly varies.

We consider exclusive 2-jet\ncross sections in $e^+e^-$ collisions with an energy veto $\\Lambda$ on\nadditional jets. The key observation is that there are actually two pairs of\nenergy scales whose ratio is $R$: the transverse momentum $QR$ of the energetic\nparticles inside jets and their total energy $Q$, and the transverse momentum\n$\\Lambda R$ of soft particles that are cut out of the jet cones and their\nenergy $\\Lambda$. The soft-collinear mode is necessary to factorize and resum\nlogarithms of the latter hierarchy. We show how this factorization occurs in\nthe jet thrust cross section for cone and $k_T$-type algorithms at\n$O(\\alpha_s)$ and using the thrust cone algorithm at $O(\\alpha_s^2)$. We\nidentify the presence of hard-collinear, in-jet soft, global (veto) soft, and\nsoft-collinear modes in the jet thrust cross section.

Variations in galaxy selection due to systematics are found to cause\ndensity fluctuations of up to 10% for some small fraction of the area for most\ngalaxy redshift slices and as much as 50% for some extreme cases of faint\nhigh-redshift samples.

We measure low abundances\nin stars of Dolidze 25. For the three stars with spectral types around B0, we\nfind $0.3$ dex (Si) and $0.5$ dex (O) below the values typical in the solar\nneighbourhood. These values, even though not as low as those given previously,\nconfirm Dolidze 25 and the surrounding H II region Sh2-284 as the most\nmetal-poor star-forming environment known in the Milky Way. We derive a\ndistance $4.5\\pm0.3\\:$kpc to the cluster ($r_{\\textrm{G}}\\approx12.3\\:$kpc).\nThe cluster cannot be older than $\\sim3\\:$Myr, and likely is not much younger.\nOne star in its immediate vicinity, sharing the same distance, has Si and O\nabundances at most $0.15\\:$dex below solar. The low abundances measured in\nDolidze 25 are compatible with currently accepted values for the slope of the\nGalactic metallicity gradient, if we take into account that variations of at\nleast $\\pm0.15\\:$dex are observed at a given radius. The area traditionally\nidentified as Dolidze 25 is only a small part of a much larger star-forming\nregion that comprises the whole dust shell associated with Sh2-284 and very\nlikely several other smaller H II regions in its vicinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 20:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-07"}

This approach is well suited for\nproviding growing services like video, real-time TV, etc., in group\ntransportation systems such as coach, high-speed train, and airplane. We show\nthat the optimal power allocation policy depends only on the statistics of the\nminimum gain of all user channels, and it is a combination of water-filling and\nchannel inversion. We provide the optimal power allocation policy, which\nguarantees that real-time traffic be delivered with quality of service (QoS)\nfor every user. Moreover, we show that the required minimum average power to\nsatisfy the service outage constraint increases linearly with the number of\nusers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 22:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

The velocity dispersion\nwithin the effective radius is sigma_e = 271+-41 km/s. We detect rotation in\nthe stellar absorption lines for the first time beyond z~1.

Most research considers slotted protocols, in which the\npoints in time for reception are temporally coupled to beacon transmissions. In\ncontrast, many recent protocols, such as ANT/ANT+ and Bluetooth Low Energy\n(BLE) use a slotless, periodic-interval based scheme for neighbor discovery.\nHere, one device periodically broadcasts packets, whereas the other device\nperiodically listens to the channel. Both periods are independent from each\nother and drawn over continuous time. Such protocols provide 3 degrees of\nfreedom (viz., the intervals for advertising and scanning and the duration of\neach scan phase).

From the linear\nanalysis, it is found that SPM with the correction term suffer from significant\ndispersive errors, especially for slow waves propagating along magnetic fields.\nThe phase velocity for all wave numbers is significantly larger than the exact\nsolution and has a peak at a finite wavenumber.

In the\nneighborhood of the magnetic transition this configuration evolves into a\ncanted super-structure. The deduced temperature dependence of the canting angle\nexhibits two closely spaced peaks, which are in excellent agreement with the\ndouble peaks in the magnetic contribution to the specific heat and in the\nthermal expansion coefficient. We explain these features in terms of\nreorientation of the net ferromagnetic moment of the noncollinear spin state,\ndue to the local breaking of the inversion symmetry promoted by the monoclinic\ndistortions, with structural changes acting as the driving force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 02:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

A growing evidence base indicates that high\nquality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure\nand other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the\nright places, such as along 'desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates\nthe need for tools and methods to help answer the question 'where to build?'.\nFollowing a brief review of the policy and research context related to this\nquestion, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications\nof such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive\nplanning support system which was initially developed to explore and map\ncycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on\norigin-destination data, it models and visualises cycling levels at area,\ndesire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and\nfor scenario-based 'cycling futures'. Four scenarios are presented, including\n'Go Dutch' and 'Ebikes', which explore what would happen if English people\ncycled as much as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on\ncycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the\nnumber of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and\ncarbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level\nfor each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of\nadditional scenarios and its deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the\nPCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and\nraises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 07:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 16:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 23:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

To this end, it is\nfirst shown that large-scale motions in turbulent Couette flow at Re=2150\nself-sustain even when active processes at smaller scales are artificially\nquenched by increasing the Smagorinsky constant Cs in large eddy simulations.\nThese results are in agreement with earlier results on pressure driven\nturbulent channels.

Iron-rich\nmeteorites present a unique opportunity for this search, because they contain a\nbroad range of compounds produced under extreme growth conditions. We\ninvestigated a natural iron sulfide based materials (Troilite) inclusion with\nits associated minerals in the iron meteorite Tlacotepec. Tlacotepec formed in\nan asteroidal core under high pressure and at high temperature over millions of\nyears, while insoluble sulfur rich materials segregated into inclusions during\ncooling along with included minerals. The search for superconductivity in these\nheterogeneous materials requires a technique capable of detecting minute\namounts of a superconducting phase embedded in a non-superconducting matrix. We\nused Magnetic Field Modulated Microwave Spectroscopy (MFMMS), a very sensitive,\nselective, and non-destructive technique, to search for superconductivity in\nheterogeneous systems. Here, we report the observation of an electro-magnetic\nphase transition at 117 K that causes a MFMMS-response typical of a\nsuperconductor. A pronounced and reproducible peak together with isothermal\nmagnetic field sweeps prove the appearance of a new electromagnetic phase below\n117 K. This is very similar to the characteristic response due to flux trapping\nin a granular superconductor with a short coherence length.

It is rather easy to calculate the\ninterdiffusion coefficients for all the compositions in the interdiffusion zone\nin a binary system. The intrinsic diffusion coefficients can be calculated for\nthe composition of Kirkendall marker plane in a binary system. In a ternary\nsystem, however, the interdiffusion coefficients can only be calculated for the\ncomposition where composition profiles from two different diffusion couples\nintersect. Intrinsic diffusion coefficients are possible to calculate when the\nKirkendall markers are also present at that composition, which is a condition\nthat is generally difficult to satisfy. In a quaternary system, the composition\nprofiles for three different diffusion couples must intersect at one particular\ncomposition to calculate the diffusion parameters, which is a condition that is\nalmost impossible to satisfy. To avoid these complications in a multicomponent\nsystem, the average interdiffusion coefficients are calculated. I propose a\nmethod of calculating the intrinsic diffusion coefficients and the variation in\nthe interdiffusion coefficients for multicomponent systems. This method can be\nused for a single diffusion couple in a multicomponent pseudobinary system.

The\nbalance between the acceleration and synchrotron cooling yields a narrow\nenergy-distribution similar to the Maxwellian distribution.

However, in magnetic fusion devices, the\nopen magnetic field lines intersect the structural elements of the device with\nnear grazing incidence angles. The magnetic field tends to align the particle\nflow along its own field lines, thus counteracting the mechanism that leads to\nthe formation of the DS. Recent work using a fluid model [P. Stangeby, Nucl.\nFusion {\\bf 52}, 083012 (2012)] showed that the DS disappears when the\nincidence angle is smaller than a critical value (around $5^\\circ$ for\nITER-like parameters). Here, we study this transition by means of numerical\nsimulations of a kinetic model both in the collisionless and weakly collisional\nregimes. We show that the main features observed in the fluid model are\npreserved: for grazing incidence, the space charge density near the wall is\nreduced, the ion flow is subsonic, and the electric field and plasma density\nprofiles are spread out over several ion Larmor radii instead of a few Debye\nlengths as in the unmagnetized case. As there is no singularity at the DS\nentrance in the kinetic model, this phenomenon depends smoothly on the magnetic\nfield incidence angle and no particular critical angle arises. The simulation\nresults and the predictions of the fluid model are in good agreement, although\nsome discrepancies subsist, mainly due to the assumptions of isothermal closure\nand diagonality of the pressure tensor in the fluid model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 10:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 12:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

On the other hand, for a signed graph\non $n$ vertices, if the difference is smaller than 1, then there exists\n$\\epsilon_n>0$, such that the difference is at most $1 - \\epsilon_n$.\n  We also show that notion of $(k,d)$-colorings is equivalent to $r$-colorings\n(see (X. Zhu, Recent developments in circular coloring of graphs, in Topics in\nDiscrete Mathematics Algorithms and Combinatorics Volume 26, Springer Berlin\nHeidelberg (2006) 497-550)).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 10:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

In this paper, we study homogeneous MPS (hMPS), or MPS constructed via\nsite-independent tensors and a boundary condition. Exploiting a connection with\nthe theory of matrix algebras, we derive two structural properties shared by\nall hMPS, namely: a) there exist local operators which annihilate all hMPS of a\ngiven bond dimension; and b) there exist local operators which, when applied\nover any hMPS of a given bond dimension, decouple (cut) the particles where\nthey act from the spin chain while at the same time join (glue) the two loose\nends back again into a hMPS. Armed with these tools, we show how to\nsystematically derive `bond dimension witnesses', or 2-local operators whose\nexpectation value allows us to lower bound the bond dimension of the underlying\nhMPS. We extend some of these results to the ansatz of Projected Entangled\nPairs States (PEPS). As a bonus, we use our insight on the structure of hMPS\nto: a) derive some theoretical limitations on the use of hMPS and hPEPS for\nground state energy computations; b) show how to decrease the complexity and\nboost the speed of convergence of the semidefinite programming hierarchies\ndescribed in [Phys.

It has become the subject of important\nquestions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize\nthe singleton property triples? And how?

But it can be hard to discover\nthis material unless users know exactly where to look. Since the very\nbeginning, libraries have played a major role in supporting the OA movement.\nNext to all services they can provide to support the deposit of research output\nin the repositories, they can make Open Access materials widely discoverable by\ntheir patrons through general search engines (Google, Bing...), specialized\nsearch engines (like Google Scholar) and library discovery tools, thus\nexpanding their collection to include materials that they would not necessarily\npay for. In this paper, we intend to focus on two aspects regarding Open Access\nand Primo discovery tool. In early 2013, Ex Libris Group started to add\ninstitutional repositories to Primo Central Index (PCI), their mega-aggregation\nof hundreds of millions of scholarly e-resources. After 2 years, it may be\ninteresting to take stock of the current situation of PCI regarding Open Access\ninstitutional repositories. On basis of a survey to carry out among the Primo\ncommunity, the paper also shows how libraries using Primo discovery tool\nintegrate Green Open Access contents in their catalog. Two major ways are\npossible for them: Firstly, they can directly harvest, index and manage any\nrepository in their Primo and display those free contents next to the more\ntraditional library collections; Secondly, if they are PCI subscribers, they\ncan quickly and easily activate any, if not all, of the Open Access\nrepositories contained PCI, making thus the contents of those directly\ndiscoverable to their end users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 12:44:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2016 13:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

However, despite their\nsimplified character, their dynamics often cannot be simulated exactly on\nclassical computers as soon as the number of particles exceeds a few tens. For\nthis reason, the quantum simulation of spin Hamiltonians using the tools of\natomic and molecular physics has become very active over the last years, using\nultracold atoms or molecules in optical lattices, or trapped ions. All of these\napproaches have their own assets, but also limitations. Here, we report on a\nnovel platform for the study of spin systems, using individual atoms trapped in\ntwo-dimensional arrays of optical microtraps with arbitrary geometries, where\nfilling fractions range from 60 to 100% with exact knowledge of the initial\nconfiguration. When excited to Rydberg D-states, the atoms undergo strong\ninteractions whose anisotropic character opens exciting prospects for\nsimulating exotic matter. We illustrate the versatility of our system by\nstudying the dynamics of an Ising-like spin-1/2 system in a transverse field\nwith up to thirty spins, for a variety of geometries in one and two dimensions,\nand for a wide range of interaction strengths. For geometries where the\nanisotropy is expected to have small effects we find an excellent agreement\nwith ab-initio simulations of the spin-1/2 system, while for strongly\nanisotropic situations the multilevel structure of the D-states has a\nmeasurable influence. Our findings establish arrays of single Rydberg atoms as\na versatile platform for the study of quantum magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 13:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 08:26:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 14:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

The advantage of the autocorrelation comes from the\nfact that it can detect very small spectral line broadening effects because it\naverages over many spectral lines and therefore gives an average with a very\nhigh signal to noise ratio. We validate the technique with the spectra of known\nmagnetic stars and obtain autocorrelation curves that are in full agreement\nwith published magnetic curves obtained with Zeeman splitting. The\nautocorrelation also gives less noisy curves so that it can be used to obtain\nvery accurate curves. We degrade the resolution of spectra of these magnetic\nstars to lower spectral resolutions where the Zeeman splitting is undetectable.\nAt these resolutions, the autocorrelation still gives good quality curves,\nthereby showing that it can be used to measure magnetic fields in spectra where\nthe Zeeman splitting is significantly smaller than the width of the spectral\nline. This would therefore allow observing magnetic fields in very faint Ap\nstars with low-resolution spectrographs, thereby greatly increasing the number\nof known magnetic stars. It also demonstrates that the autocorrelation can\nmeasure magnetic fields in rapidly rotating stars as well as weak magnetic\nfields that give a Zeeman splitting smaller than the intrinsic width of the\nspectral lines. Finally, it shows that the autocorrelation can be used to find\nunknown magnetic stars in low resolution spectroscopic surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 13:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

To connect with previous work\non large scale dynamos with local linear shear and identify the minimum\nconditions needed for large scale field growth, we also solve our equations in\nlocal Cartesian coordinates. We find that large scale dynamo growth in a linear\nshear flow without rotation can be sustained by shear plus non-axisymmetric\nfluctuations -- even if not helical, a seemingly previously unidentified\ndistinction. The linear shear flow dynamo emerges as a more restricted version\nof our more general new global cylindrical calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 14:14:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 01:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 03:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

This feature of the transmission line can be used to perform phase\nmatching in a degenerate four-wave mixing process which can be utilized for\nparametric amplification of a weak signal in the presence of a strong pump.\nNumerical simulations of the TWPA design have shown that with tuning, phase\nmatching can be achieved and an exponential gain as a function of the\ntransmission line length can be realized. The flexibility of the proposed\ndesign can realize: compact TWPAs with less than 211 unit cells, signal gains\ngreater than 20 dB, 3 dB bandwidth greater than 5.4 GHz, and saturation powers\nup to -98 dBm.

In this paper, the effect of emission from a $300$ K\nVPM on the system performance is considered and addressed. Though instrument\ndesign can greatly reduce the influence of modulated VPM emission, some\nresidual modulated signal is expected. VPM emission is treated in the presence\nof rotational misalignments and temperature variation.

The formulation of\nthe theory arises from a straightforward analogy with the Special Relativity,\nbut its foundations are laid through the hypothesis on breakdown of the\nvelocity-momentum parallelism which affects onto the Einstein equivalence\nprinciple between mass and energy of a relativistic particle. Furthermore, the\nderivation is based on the technique of an eikonal equation whose\nwell-confirmed physical role lays the foundations of both optics and quantum\nmechanics. As a result, we receive the angular deformation of Special\nRelativity which clearly depicts the new deformation-based theoretical\nfoundations of physics, and, moreover, offers both constructive and consistent\nphenomenological discussion of the theoretical issues such like imaginary mass\nand formal superluminal motion predicted in Special Relativity for this case.\nIn the context of the relativistic theory, presence of deformation does not\nbreak the Poincar\\'{e} invariance, in particular the Lorentz symmetry, and\nprovides essential modifications of both bosons described through the\nKlein-Gordon equation and fermions satisfying the Dirac equation. On the other\nhand, on the level of discussion of quantum theory, there arises the concept of\nemergent deformed space-time, wherein the presence of angular deformation\nelucidates a certain new insight into the nature of spin, as well as both the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle and the Schr\\\"odinger wave equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 01:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

Such a system has wide ranging\napplications such as annotating images and using natural sentences to search\nfor images.In this project we focus on the task of bidirectional image\nretrieval: such asystem is capable of retrieving an image based on a sentence\n(image search) andretrieve sentence based on an image query (image annotation).\nWe present asystem based on a global ranking objective function which uses a\ncombinationof convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multi layer perceptrons\n(MLP).It takes a pair of image and sentence and processes them in different\nchannels,finally embedding it into a common multimodal vector space. These\nembeddingsencode abstract semantic information about the two inputs and can be\ncomparedusing traditional information retrieval approaches. For each such pair,\nthe modelreturns a score which is interpretted as a similarity metric. If this\nscore is high,the image and sentence are likely to convey similar meaning, and\nif the score is low then they are likely not to.\n  The visual input is modeled via deep convolutional neural network. On\ntheother hand we explore three models for the textual module. The first one\nisbag of words with an MLP. The second one uses n-grams (bigram, trigrams,and a\ncombination of trigram & skip-grams) with an MLP. The third is morespecialized\ndeep network specific for modeling variable length sequences (SSE).We report\ncomparable performance to recent work in the field, even though ouroverall\nmodel is simpler. We also show that the training time choice of how wecan\ngenerate our negative samples has a significant impact on performance, and can\nbe used to specialize the bi-directional system in one particular task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2015 17:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

To handle such a situation,\nimage fusion methods are used in multi-focus environment. Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) is a widely used image compression transform, image fusion in\nDCT domain is an efficient method. This paper presents a low complexity\napproach for multi-focus image fusion and its VLSI implementation using DCT.\nThe proposed method is evaluated using reference/non-reference fusion measure\ncriteria and the obtained results asserts it's effectiveness. The maximum\nsynthesized frequency on FPGA is found to be 221 MHz and consumes 42% of FPGA\nresources. The proposed method consumes very less power and can process 4K\nresolution images at the rate of 60 frames per second which makes the hardware\nsuitable for handheld portable devices such as camera module and wireless image\nsensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 13:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}
