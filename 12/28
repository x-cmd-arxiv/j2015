The\nhigh-resolution spectral survey currently covers |b| < 0.5 deg and 28 < l < 46\ndeg, with an angular resolution of 15 arcsec in 0.5 km/s velocity channels. The\nspectra have a median rms of $\\sim$ 0.6 K at this resolution, and for optically\nthin gas at an excitation temperature of 10 K, this sensitivity corresponds to\ncolumn densities of $N_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}} \\sim 3 \\times 10^{20}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ and\n$N_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{21}\\,$cm$^{-2}$ for $^{13}$CO and\nC$^{18}$O, respectively. The molecular gas that CHIMPS traces is at higher\ncolumn densities and is also more optically thin than in other publicly\navailable CO surveys due to its rarer isotopologues, and thus more\nrepresentative of the three-dimensional structure of the clouds. The critical\ndensity of the J=3-2 transition of CO is $\\gtrsim 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$ at\ntemperatures of $\\leq 20$ K, and so the higher density gas associated with star\nformation is well traced. These data complement other existing Galactic plane\nsurveys, especially the JCMT Galactic Plane Survey which has similar spatial\nresolution and column density sensitivity, and the Herschel infrared Galactic\nPlane Survey. In this paper, we discuss the observations, data reduction and\ncharacteristics of the survey, presenting integrated emission maps for the\nregion covered. Position-velocity diagrams allow comparison with Galactic\nstructure models of the Milky Way, and while we find good agreement with a\nparticular four arm model, there are some significant deviations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 16:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The system is\ninvestigated with different spatial and temporal boundary conditions on\nlattices of various spatial and temporal extensions, for two values of the bare\nfermion mass representing a {\\em heavy} and {\\em light} fermion regime. Our\nstudy shows that the infinite volume limit of masses and decay constants in the\nmesonic sector is reached only when the mass of the pseudoscalar particle\n$M_\\mathrm{PS}$ and the spatial lattice size $L$ satisfy the relation $L\nM_\\mathrm{PS} \\ge 15$. This bound, which is at least a factor of three higher\nthan what observed in QCD, is a likely consequence of the different spectral\nsignatures of the two theories, with the scalar isosinglet ($0^{++}$ glueball)\nbeing the lightest particle in our model. In addition to stressing the\nimportance of simulating large lattice sizes, our analysis emphasises the need\nto understand quantitatively the {\\em full} spectrum of the theory rather than\njust the spectrum in the mesonic isotriplet sector. While for the lightest\nfermion measuring masses from gluonic operators proves to be still challenging,\nreliable results for glueball states are obtained at the largest fermion mass\nand, in the mesonic sector, for both fermion masses. As a byproduct of our\ninvestigation, we perform a finite size scaling of the pseudoscalar mass and\ndecay constant.

The model is highly predictive, including the\npseudoscalar nature of $X(750)$, and two nearly mass-degenerate exotic quarks\ncarrying electric charge $5/3$ and $2/3$, respectively. Rich phenomenology is\nexpected with respect to collider searches, flavor physics and dark matter\ndetection, if $X(750)$ can be pinned down by future LHC experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 18:17:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 14:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

This methodology is now extended to\nquantum fields by considering the force densities acting on the vacuum\npolarization induced by a point charge. Such a model is applicable to any\ncharged particle at large distances, since the only vestige of its internal\nstructure is the electric Coulomb field together with the vacuum polarization\ninduced by it. While the polarization charge density is attracted to the point\ncharge, it is kept from collapsing by repulsive forces due to confinement and\ndegeneracy. It is shown analytically that the corresponding force densities are\nbalanced for every filled shell of mj states at a given angular momentum j. The\nforce densities are then summed over all single-electron states in the Dirac\nsea and renormalized by subtracting singular terms. In leading order of alpha,\nthe force densities remain balanced.

We propose a new setting where the question is reversed: \"What is\nthe orientation along which this particle has this spin value?\" It turns out\nthat the orientation is similarly subject to nonlocal effects. To enable the\nreversal, each particle's interaction with a beam-splitter at t1 leaves its\nspin orientation superposed. Then at t2, the experimenter selects an \"up\" or\n\"down\" spin value for this yet-undefined orientation. Only after the two\nparticles undergo this procedure, the two measurements are completed, each\nparticle having its spin value along a definite orientation. By Bell's theorem,\nit is now the \"choice\" of orientation that must be nonlocally transmitted\nbetween the particles upon completing the measurement. This choice, however,\nhas preceded the experimenter's selection. This seems to lend support for the\ntime-symmetric interpretations of QM, where retrocausality plays a significant\nrole.

Tikhonov regularization, or ridge regression, is a popular approach\nto address this issue. We reveal here a formal analogy between ridge regression\nand statistical mechanics, where the objective function is comparable to a free\nenergy and the ridge parameter plays the role of temperature. This analogy\nsuggests two new criteria to select a suitable ridge parameter: the\nspecific-heat (Cv) and the maximum penalty (MP) fits. We apply these methods to\nthe calibration of the force constant in elastic network models (ENM). This key\nparameter determines the amplitude of the predicted atomic fluctuations, and is\ncommonly obtained by fitting crystallographic B-factors. However, rigid-body\nmotions are often partially neglected in such fits, even though their\nimportance has been repeatedly stressed. Considering the full set of rigid-body\nand internal degrees of freedom bears significant risks of overfitting, due to\nstrong correlations between explanatory variables, and requires thus careful\nregularization. Using simulated data, we show that ridge regression with the Cv\nor MP criterion markedly reduces the error of the estimated force constant, its\nacross-protein variation, and the number of proteins with unphysical values of\nthe fit parameters, in comparison with popular regularization schemes such as\ngeneralized cross-validation. When applied to protein crystals, the new methods\nprovide a more robust calibration of ENM force constants, even though\nrigid-body motions account on average for more than 80% of the amplitude of\nB-factors. While MP emerges as the optimal choice for fitting crystallographic\nB-factors, the Cv fit is more robust to the nature of the data, and is thus an\ninteresting candidate for other applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 00:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The large total width\npreliminarily suggested by data seems to favor a large Yukawa coupling, at the\nborder of a healthy perturbative definition.

The precision of gradient\nsensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in\nthe gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of\nconcentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests\nthat precision should also increase with detector length in the direction\ntransverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the\nnoise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the\nprecision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest\ngradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason\nis that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured\nconcentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these\nmeasurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between\nthe measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We\ndemonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional\nexcitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the\nbenefit of transverse averaging.

First, classifying experimental subjects by their status is\nmerely a proxy for more important and meaningful classifications, such as\nclassifying them according to their abilities, and effort should be invested in\ndefining and using these more meaningful classifications. Second, in many cases\nusing students is perfectly reasonable, and student subjects can be used to\nobtain reliable results and further the research goals.

However, each agent is myopic, so in order to\nincentivize him to explore options with better long-term prospects, the\nprincipal must offer the agent money. Frazier et al. showed that a simple class\nof policies called time-expanded are optimal in the worst case, and\ncharacterized their budget-reward tradeoff.\n  The previous work assumed that all agents are equally and uniformly\nsusceptible to financial incentives. In reality, agents may have different\nutility for money. We therefore extend the model of Frazier et al. to allow\nagents that have heterogeneous and non-linear utilities for money. The\nprincipal is informed of the agent's tradeoff via a signal that could be more\nor less informative.\n  Our main result is to show that a convex program can be used to derive a\nsignal-dependent time-expanded policy which achieves the best possible\nLagrangian reward in the worst case. The worst-case guarantee is matched by\nso-called \"Diamonds in the Rough\" instances; the proof that the guarantees\nmatch is based on showing that two different convex programs have the same\noptimal solution for these specific instances. These results also extend to the\nbudgeted case as in Frazier et al. We also show that the optimal policy is\nmonotone with respect to information, i.e., the approximation ratio of the\noptimal policy improves as the signals become more informative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 14:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

The experimental results show that our approach\ngives very promising results for an effective tasks planning. - See more at:\nhttp://thesai.org/Publications/ViewPaper?Volume=6&Issue=10&Code=IJACSA&SerialNo=36#sthash.aV1fxMaQ.dpuf\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2015 20:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}
