To overcome this shortcoming we have created a new set of\ncircumstellar dust models, using the radiative transfer code DUSTY Ivezic et\nal. 1999, for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and incorporated them into\nthe Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis code. The circumstellar dust models\nprovide a good fit to individual AGB stars as well as the IR color-magnitude\ndiagrams of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. IR luminosity functions from\nthe Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are not well-fit by the 2008 Padova\nisochrones when coupled to our circumstellar dust models, and so we adjusted\nthe lifetimes of AGB stars in the models to provide a match to the data.

It is known that spatial and temporal variations in\nconcentration profiles of signaling molecules, which are frequently referred as\nmorphogen gradients, lead to cell differentiation via activating specific genes\nin a concentration-dependent manner. It is widely accepted that the\nestablishment of the morphogen gradients involves multiple biochemical\nreactions and diffusion processes. One of the critical elements in the\nformation of morphogen gradients is a degradation of signaling molecules. We\ndevelop a new theoretical approach that provides a comprehensive description of\nthe degradation mechanisms. It is based on the idea that the degradation works\nas an effective potential that drives the signaling molecules away from the\nsource region. Utilizing the method of first-passage processes, the dynamics of\nthe formation of morphogen gradients for various degradation mechanisms is\nexplicitly evaluated. It is found that the linear degradation leads to a\ndynamic behavior specified by times to form the morphogen gradients that depend\nlinearly on the distance from the source. This is because the effective\npotential due to degradation is quite strong. At the same time, the nonlinear\ndegradation mechanisms yield a quadratic scaling in the morphogen gradients\nformation times since the effective potentials are much weaker.\nPhysical-chemical explanations of these phenomena are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 20:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

The Thon rings from amorphous\ncarbon images are always more visible in the power spectrum of the summed\nframes whereas those of amorphous ice are more visible in the sum of power\nspectra from the individual frames. This difference indicates that while\npre-irradiated carbon behaves like a solid during the exposure, amorphous ice\nbehaves like a fluid with the individual water molecules undergoing\nbeam-induced motion.

The fact that NGS reads are generally\nshort makes it challenging to assemble the reads and reconstruct the original\ngenome sequence. For clustering genomes using such NGS data, word-count based\nalignment-free sequence comparison is a promising approach, but for this\napproach, the underlying expected word counts are essential.\n  A plausible model for this underlying distribution of word counts is given\nthrough modelling the DNA sequence as a Markov chain (MC). For single long\nsequences, efficient statistics are available to estimate the order of MCs and\nthe transition probability matrix for the sequences. As NGS data do not provide\na single long sequence, inference methods on Markovian properties of sequences\nbased on single long sequences cannot be directly used for NGS short read data.\n  Here we derive a normal approximation for such word counts. We also show that\nthe traditional Chi-square statistic has an approximate gamma distribution,\nusing the Lander-Waterman model for physical mapping. We propose several\nmethods to estimate the order of the MC based on NGS reads and evaluate them\nusing simulations. We illustrate the applications of our results by clustering\ngenomic sequences of several vertebrate and tree species based on NGS reads\nusing alignment-free sequence dissimilarity measures.

They have emerged as a robust solid-state platform for\nnext-generation optoelectronic applications as well as fundamental studies of\nquantum many-body physics. Importantly, exciton-polaritons are a profoundly\nopen (i.e., non-Hermitian) quantum system: it requires constant pumping of\nenergy and continuously decays releasing coherent radiation. Thus, the\nexciton-polaritons always exist in a balanced potential landscape of gain and\nloss. However, the inherent non-Hermitian nature of this potential has so far\nbeen largely ignored in exciton-polariton physics. Here we demonstrate that\nnon-Hermiticity dramatically modifies the structure of modes and spectral\ndegeneracies in exciton-polariton systems, and, therefore, will affect their\nquantum transport, localisation, and dynamical properties. Using a\nspatially-structured optical pump, we create a chaotic exciton-polariton\nbilliard. Eigenmodes of this billiard exhibit multiple non-Hermitian spectral\ndegeneracies -- exceptional points. These are known to cause remarkable wave\nphenomena, such as unidirectional transport, anomalous lasing/absorption, and\nchiral modes. By varying parameters of the billiard, we observe crossing and\nanti-crossing of energy levels and reveal the nontrivial topological modal\nstructure exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. We also observe the mode\nswitching and topological Berry phase for a parameter loop encircling the\nexceptional point.

Since then many\ndecomposition have been proposed where either the scattering model was modified\nto fit the data or the coherency matrix representing the second order\nstatistics of the full polarimetric data is rotated to fit the scattering\nmodel. In this paper we propose to modify the Yamaguchi four-component\ndecomposition (Y4O) scattering powers using the concept of statistical\ninformation theory for matrices. In order to achieve this modification we\npropose a method to estimate the polarization orientation angle (OA) from\nfull-polarimetric SAR images using the Hellinger distance. In this method, the\nOA is estimated by maximizing the Hellinger distance between the un-rotated and\nthe rotated $T_{33}$ and the $T_{22}$ components of the coherency matrix\n$\\mathbf{[T]}$. Then, the powers of the Yamaguchi four-component model-based\ndecomposition (Y4O) are modified using the maximum relative stochastic distance\nbetween the $T_{33}$ and the $T_{22}$ components of the coherency matrix at the\nestimated OA. The results show that the overall double-bounce powers over\nrotated urban areas have significantly improved with the reduction of volume\npowers. The percentage of pixels with negative powers have also decreased from\nthe Y4O decomposition.

Different from previous approaches that\ncalculate the virial parameter for different regions, our new method takes\ngravitational interactions between all the voxels in 3D PPV data cubes into\naccount, and generates maps of the importance of gravity. This map can be\ncombined with the original data cube to derive relations such as the\nmass-radius relation. Our method is important for several reasons. First, it\noffers the the ability to quantify the centrally condensed structures in the 3D\nPPV data cubes, and enables us to compare them in an uniform framework. Second,\nit allows us to understand the importance of gravity at different locations in\nthe data cube, and provides a global picture of gravity in clouds. Third, it\noffers a robust approach to decomposing the data into different regions which\nare gravitationally coherent. To demonstrate the application of our method we\nidentified regions from the Perseus and Ophiuchus molecular clouds, and\nanalyzed their properties. We found an increase in the importance of gravity\ntowards the centers of the individual molecular condensations. We also\nquantified the properties of the regions in terms of mass-radius and\nmass-velocity relations. Through evaluating the virial parameters based on the\nG-virial, we found that all our regions are almost gravitationally bound.\nCluster-forming regions appear are more centrally condensed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2015 10:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Starting from the microscopic model of the isotropic Dirac semi-metal,\nthe Ginzburg-Landau equations for the vector order parameter is derived using\nthe Gor'kov technique. The collective modes including gapless Goldstone modes,\nand gapped Higgs modes of various polarizations are identified. They are\nsomewhat analogous to the modes in the B phase of He3, although in the present\ncase quantitatively there is a pronouneced difference between longitudinal and\ntransverse components. The difference is caused by the vector nature of the\norder parameter leading to two different coherence lengths or penetration\ndepths.
