One of the strongest sources of stochasticity is the binary noise\nthat arises from the binding of a regulatory protein to a promoter in the\nchromosomal DNA. In this study, we focus on two minimal oscillators based on\nactivator titration and repressor titration to understand the key parameters\nthat are important for oscillations and for overcoming binary noise. We show\nthat the rate of unbinding from the DNA, despite traditionally being considered\na fast parameter, needs to be slow to broaden the space of oscillatory\nsolutions. The addition of multiple, independent DNA binding sites further\nexpands the oscillatory parameter space for the repressor-titration oscillator\nand lengthens the period of both oscillators. This effect is a combination of\nincreased effective delay of the unbinding kinetics due to multiple binding\nsites and increased promoter ultrasensitivity that is specific for repression.\nWe then use stochastic simulation to show that multiple binding sites increase\nthe coherence of the oscillations by mitigating the binary noise. Slow values\nof DNA unbinding rate are also effective in alleviating molecular noise due to\nthe increased distance from the bifurcation point. Our work demonstrates how\nDNA binding sites and slow unbinding kinetics, which are often omitted in\nbiophysical models of gene circuits, can have a significant impact on the\ntemporal and stochastic dynamics of genetic oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 16:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 22:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

In the present paper, we suggest that this might have been\ncaused by blue luminescence (BL), an emission feature of neutral polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs), discovered in 2004. It is a fact that\nthe highest emission peaks of the BL lie in the L band. Our goals were to\ninvestigate other possible causes, and to derive the fluxes of the emission. We\nused two-colour diagrams based on atmosphere models, spectral energy\ndistributions, and different extinctions and extinction laws, depending on the\nlocation of the supposed BL source: either in Gum48d on the background or in\nthe envelope of HR 5171A. False L-excess sources, such as a hot companion, a\nnearby star, or some instrumental effect, could be excluded. Also, emission\nfeatures from a hot chromosphere are not plausible. The fluxes of the L excess,\nrecorded in the data sets of 1971, 1973, and 1977 varied (all in units of\n10^(-10) W m^(-2) micron^(-1)) between 1.4 to 21, depending on the location of\nthe source. A flux near the low side of this range is preferred. Small\nbrightness excesses in uv (uvby system) were present in 1979, but its\nconnection with BL is doubtful. For the L fluxes we consider the lowest values\nas more realistic. The uncertainties are 20-30 %. Similar to other yellow\nhypergiants, HR 5171A showed powerful brightness outbursts, particularly in the\n1970s.

We develop a thermal-orbital evolution model calibrated to\nEarth that couples tidal dissipation, with a temperature-dependent Maxwell\nrheology, to orbital circularization and migration. We illustrate\nthermal-orbital steady states where surface heat flow is balanced by tidal\ndissipation and cooling can be stalled for billions of years until\ncircularization occurs. Orbital energy dissipated as tidal heat in the interior\ndrives both inward migration and circularization, with a circularization time\nthat is inversely proportional to the dissipation rate. We identify a peak in\nthe internal dissipation rate as the mantle passes through a visco-elastic\nstate at mantle temperatures near 1800 K.

Unfortunately, the\nfront-end A/D conversion necessary to drive hundreds of antennas, with a signal\nbandwidth of the order of 10 to 100 MHz, requires very large sampling bit-rate\nand power consumption.\n  In order to reduce such implementation requirements, Hybrid Digital-Analog\narchitectures have been proposed. In particular, our work in this paper is\nmotivated by one of such schemes named Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing\n(JSDM), where the downlink precoder (resp., uplink linear receiver) is split\ninto the product of a baseband linear projection (digital) and an RF\nreconfigurable beamforming network (analog), such that only a reduced number $m\n\\ll M$ of A/D converters and RF modulation/demodulation chains is needed. In\nJSDM, users are grouped according to the similarity of their channel dominant\nsubspaces, and these groups are separated by the analog beamforming stage,\nwhere the multiplexing gain in each group is achieved using the digital\nprecoder. Therefore, it is apparent that extracting the channel subspace\ninformation of the $M$-dim channel vectors from snapshots of $m$-dim\nprojections, with $m \\ll M$, plays a fundamental role in JSDM implementation.\n  In this paper, we develop novel efficient algorithms that require sampling\nonly $m = O(2\\sqrt{M})$ specific array elements according to a coprime sampling\nscheme, and for a given $p \\ll M$, return a $p$-dim beamformer that has a\nperformance comparable with the best p-dim beamformer that can be designed from\nthe full knowledge of the exact channel covariance matrix.

This criterion\nreveals that in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, MIMO-OWC offers both\nlarge-scale diversity gain, governing the exponential decaying of the error\ncurve, and small-scale diversity gain, producing traditional power-law\ndecaying.

To answer these types of questions, one has to go beyond\nlearning visual similarity and learn a visual notion of compatibility across\ncategories. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework to help answer\nthese types of questions. The main idea of this framework is to learn a feature\ntransformation from images of items into a latent space that expresses\ncompatibility. For the feature transformation, we use a Siamese Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) architecture, where training examples are pairs of items\nthat are either compatible or incompatible. We model compatibility based on\nco-occurrence in large-scale user behavior data; in particular co-purchase data\nfrom Amazon.com. To learn cross-category fit, we introduce a strategic method\nto sample training data, where pairs of items are heterogeneous dyads, i.e.,\nthe two elements of a pair belong to different high-level categories. While\nthis approach is applicable to a wide variety of settings, we focus on the\nrepresentative problem of learning compatible clothing style.

To compensate for high attenuation, mmWave systems exploit highly\ndirectional operation, which in turn substantially reduces the interference\nfootprint. The significant differences between mmWave networks and legacy\ncommunication technologies challenge the classical design approaches,\nespecially at the medium access control (MAC) layer, which has received\ncomparatively less attention than PHY and propagation issues in the literature\nso far. In this paper, the MAC layer design aspects of short range mmWave\nnetworks are discussed. In particular, we explain why current mmWave standards\nfail to fully exploit the potential advantages of short range mmWave\ntechnology, and argue for the necessity of new collision-aware hybrid resource\nallocation frameworks with on-demand control messages, the advantages of a\ncollision notification message, and the potential of multihop communication to\nprovide reliable mmWave connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 21:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

In the point-particle formulation, particle dynamics are coupled to\nfluid dynamics via a source term that appears in the respective momentum\nequations. When the particle Reynolds number is small and the particle diameter\nis smaller than the fluid scales, it is common to approximate the momentum\ncoupling source term as the Stokes drag. The Stokes drag force depends on the\ndifference between the undisturbed fluid velocity evaluated at the particle\nlocation, and the particle velocity. However, owing to two-way coupling, the\nfluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its\nundisturbed value. This causes the computed Stokes drag force to be\nunderestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. We develop\nestimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to\nthe grid size. We then develop a correction method that estimates the\nundisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. The\ncorrection scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent\nfluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an\norder of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 21:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In robotic applications soft materials can store and release\nenergy, absorb impacts, increase compliance and increase the range of possible\nshape profiles using minimal actuators. The shape changing ability is also a\npotential tool to manipulate friction forces caused by contact with the\nenvironment. These advantages are accompanied by challenges of soft material\nactuation and the need to exploit frictional interactions to generate\nlocomotion. Accordingly, the design of soft robots involves exploitation of\ncontinuum properties of soft materials for manipulating frictional interactions\nthat result in robot locomotion. The research presents design and control of a\nsoft body robot that uses its shape change capability for locomotion. The\nbioinspired (caterpillar) modular robot design is a soft monolithic body which\ninteracts with the environment at discrete contact points (caterpillar\nprolegs). The deformable body is actuated by muscle-like shape memory alloy\ncoils and the discrete contact points manipulate friction in a binary manner.\nThis novel virtual grip mechanism combines two materials with different\ncoefficients of frictions (sticky-slippery) to control the robot-environment\nfriction interactions. The research also introduces a novel control concept\nthat discretizes the robot-environment-friction interaction into binary states.\nThis facilitates formulation of a control framework that is independent of the\nspecific actuator or soft material properties and can be applied to\nmulti-limbed soft robots. The transitions between individual robot states are\nassigned a reward that allow optimized state transition control sequences to be\ncalculated. This conceptual framework is extremely versatile and we show how it\ncan be applied to situations in which the robot loses limb function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 23:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

The\nsmallest number of edges in a rectifier network computing $M$ is a classic\ncomplexity measure on matrices, which has been studied for more than half a\ncentury.\n  We explore two well-known techniques that have hitherto found little to no\napplications in this theory.

We obtain new results by using fractional and greedy coverings\n(defined in the standard way).\n  First, we show that all fractional coverings of the so-called full triangular\nmatrix have cost at least $n\\log n$. This provides (a fortiori) a new proof of\nthe tight lower bound on its depth-$2$ complexity (the exact value has been\nknown since 1965, but previous proofs are based on different arguments).\nSecond, we show that the greedy heuristic is instrumental in tightening the\nupper bound on the depth-$2$ complexity of the Kneser-Sierpi\\'nski\n(disjointness) matrix. The previous upper bound is $O(n^{1.28})$, and we\nimprove it to $O(n^{1.17})$, while the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(n^{1.16})$.

Most of the modelled molecular abundances agree well with the\nlatest values derived from Herschel data.

Indeed, when isogeometric spaces are constructed from $p$-degree\nsplines (and extensions, such as NURBS), they enjoy up to $C^{p-1}$ continuity\nwithin each patch. However, global continuity beyond $C^0$ on so-called\nmulti-patch geometries poses some significant difficulties. In this work, we\nconsider planar multi-patch domains that have a parametrization which is only\n$C^0$ at the patch interface. On such domains we study the $h$-refinement of\n$C^1$-continuous isogeometric spaces. These spaces in general do not have\noptimal approximation properties. The reason is that the $C^1$-continuity\ncondition easily over-constrains the solution which is, in the worst cases,\nfully locked to linears at the patch interface. However, recent studies by Kapl\net al. have given numerical evidence that optimal convergence occurs for\nbilinear two-patch geometries and cubic (or higher degree) $C^1$ splines.

Neutron star mergers are a\npromising candidate for an r-process site. They exhibit three different\nchannels for matter ejection fulfilling these conditions: dynamic ejecta due to\ntidal torques, neutrino-driven winds and evaporating matter from the accretion\ndisk. We present a first study of the integrated nucleosynthesis for a\nneutrino-driven wind from a neutron star merger with a hyper-massive neutron\nstar. Trajectories from a recent hydrodynamical simulation are divided into\nfour different angle regions and post-processed with a reaction network. We\nfind that the electron fraction varies around $Y_e \\approx 0.1 - 0.4$, but its\ndistribution differs for every angle of ejection. Hence, the wind ejecta do not\nundergo a robust r-process, but rather possess distinct nucleosynthesis yields\ndepending on the angle range. Compared to the dynamic ejecta, a smaller amount\nof neutron-rich matter gets unbound, but the production of lighter heavy\nelements with $A \\lesssim 130$ in the neutrino-driven wind can complement the\nstrong r-process of the dynamic ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 08:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

Despite the\nfact that the theory is more than 100 years old, we are still discussing its\nfoundations and its regime of applicability. A point of crucial importance is\nthe definition of the notion of thermal equilibrium, which is given as the\nstate that maximises the von Neumann entropy. Here we argue that it is\nnecessary to propose a new way of describing thermal equilibrium, focused on\nobservables rather than on the full state of the quantum system. We\ncharacterise the notion of thermal equilibrium, for a given observable, via the\nmaximisation of its Shannon entropy and highlight the thermal properties that\nsuch a principle heralds. The relation with Gibbs ensembles is brought to\nlight. Furthermore, we apply such a notion of equilibrium to a closed quantum\nsystems and prove that there is always a class of observables which exhibits\nthermal equilibrium properties and we give a recipe to explicitly construct\nthem. Eventually, we bring to light an intimate connection of such a principle\nwith the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 08:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 12:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 13:04:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 18:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 16:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

We show that the regimes where GSF predictions are accurate\nthan those of its asymptotic approximations is not only of practical relevance,\nbut are where inner scale effects influence the estimate of the\nscatter-broadening. Thus we propose that GSF should henceforth be used for\nscatter broadening calculations and estimates of quantities characterizing\ndensity turbulence in the solar corona and solar wind. In the next part of this\nthesis we use measurements of density turbulence in the solar wind from\npreviously publish observations of radio wave scattering and interplanetary\nscintillations. Density fluctuations are inferred using the GSF for radio\nscattering data and existing analysis methods for IPS.

We also overview key NFV projects,\nstandardization efforts, early implementations, use cases and commercial\nproducts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 11:03:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

NGC 891 has been studied\nfor decades and represents one of the best studied cases of an edge-on galaxy.\nWe use deep PACS data together with IRAC, MIPS and SPIRE data to study the\nvertical extent of dust emission around NGC 891. We also test the presence of a\nmore extended, thick dust component. By performing a convolution of an\nintrinsic vertical profile emission with each instrument PSF and comparing it\nwith observations we derived the scaleheight of a thin and thick dust disc\ncomponent. For all wavelengths considered the emission is best fit with the sum\nof a thin and a thick dust component. The scaleheight of both dust components\nshows a gradient passing from 70 $\\mu$m to 250 $\\mu$m. This could be due to a\ndrop in dust heating (and thus dust temperature) with the distance from the\nplane, or to a sizable contribution ($\\sim 15 - 80%$) of an unresolved thin\ndisc of hotter dust to the observed surface brightness at shorter wavelengths.\nThe scaleheight of the thick dust component, using observations from 70 $\\mu$m\nto 250 $\\mu$m has been estimated to be $(1.44\\pm 0.12)$ kpc, consistent with\nprevious estimates (extinction and scattering in optical bands and MIR\nemission).

The paucity of small grains high\nabove the midplane might indicate that dust is hit by interstellar shocks or\ngalactic fountains and entrained together with gas.

In the second phase we work through the sequence in\nreverse, repeatedly constructing a solution for a graph from the solution for\nits successor. In an iterative compaction algorithm, we insist that the graphs\ndecrease by a constant fraction of the entire graph.\n  Another approach to solving optimization problems is to exploit the\nstructural properties implied by the connectivity of the input graph. This\napproach can be used on graphs which are not highly connected by decomposing an\ninput graph into its highly connected pieces, solving subproblems on these\nspecially structured pieces and then combining their solutions.\n  We combine these two techniques by developing compaction algorithms which\nwhen applied to the highly connected pieces preserve their connectivity\nproperties.

The rotating black hole may be\nsurrounded by a Dirichlet mirror, if necessary, such that a regular,\nisometry-invariant vacuum state can be defined. We focus on the case of a\nmassive scalar field on a (2+1)-dimensional rotating black hole, but the method\ncan be extended to other types of matter fields and higher-dimensional rotating\nblack holes.\n  The Feynman propagator of the matter field in the regular, isometry-invariant\nstate is written as a sum over mode solutions on the complex Riemannian section\nof the black hole. A Hadamard renormalisation procedure is implemented at the\nlevel of the Feynman propagator by expressing its singular part as a sum over\nmode solutions on the complex Riemannian section of rotating Minkowski\nspacetime. This allows us to explicitly renormalise local observables such as\nthe vacuum polarisation of the quantum field.\n  The method is applied to the vacuum polarisation of a real massive scalar\nfield on a (2+1)-dimensional warped AdS3 black hole surrounded by a mirror.\nSelected numerical results are presented, demonstrating the numerical efficacy\nof the method. The existence of classical superradiance and the classical\nlinear mode stability of the warped AdS3 black hole to massive scalar field\nperturbations are also analysed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 11:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

We show that the central energy density used to reach the maximum mass\nvalue is the same used to determine the zero eigenfrequency of the fundamental\nmode when the total charge is fixed, thus indicating that the maximum mass\npoint marks the onset of instability. In other words, when fixing the total\ncharge, the conditions $\\frac{dM}{d\\rho_c}>0$ and $\\frac{dM}{d\\rho_c}<0$ are\nnecessary and sufficient to determine the stable and unstable equilibrium\nconfigurations regions against radial oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 12:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-30"}

Early\nalgorithms on mining communities have focused on the global structure, and\noften run in time functional to the size of the entire graph. Nowadays, as we\noften explore networks with billions of vertices and find communities of size\nhundreds, it is crucial to shift our attention from macroscopic structure to\nmicroscopic structure when dealing with large networks. A growing body of work\nhas been adopting local expansion methods in order to identify the community\nfrom a few exemplary seed members.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for finding overlapping\ncommunities called LEMON (Local Expansion via Minimum One Norm). Different from\nPageRank-like diffusion methods, LEMON finds the community by seeking a sparse\nvector in the span of the local spectra such that the seeds are in its support.\nWe show that LEMON can achieve the highest detection accuracy among\nstate-of-the-art proposals. The running time depends on the size of the\ncommunity rather than that of the entire graph. The algorithm is easy to\nimplement, and is highly parallelizable.\n  Moreover, given that networks are not all similar in nature, a comprehensive\nanalysis on how the local expansion approach is suited for uncovering\ncommunities in different networks is still lacking. We thoroughly evaluate our\napproach using both synthetic and real-world datasets across different domains,\nand analyze the empirical variations when applying our method to inherently\ndifferent networks in practice. In addition, the heuristics on how the quality\nand quantity of the seed set would affect the performance are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 13:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

We observe a peak of X-ray emission at the\nnominal position of V1180 Cas. This signal corresponds to an X-ray luminosity\nL_X(0.5-7 kev) in the range 0.8-2.2e30 erg/s. Based on the relatively short\nduration of the dim states in the light curve and on stellar luminosity\nconsiderations, we explored the possibility that the brightness minima of V1180\nCas are driven by extinction variations. From the analysis of the spectral\nenergy distribution of the high state we infer a stellar luminosity of 0.8-0.9\nLsun and find that the derived L_X is comparable to the average X-ray\nluminosities of T Tauri stars. Moreover, the X-ray luminosity is lower than the\nX-ray emission levels of 5e30 -1e31 erg/s detected at outbursts in similar\nlow-mass objects. Our analysis suggests that at least part of the photometric\nfluctuations of V1180 Cas might be extinction effects rather than the result of\naccretion excess emission. However, as the source displays spectral features\nindicative of active accretion, we speculate that its photometric variations\nmight be the result of a combination of accretion-induced and extinction-driven\neffects, as suggested for other young variables, such as V1184 Tau and V2492\nCyg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 14:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

Unlike most of the planetary\nsystems that include a hot Jupiter, these two systems with a hot Jupiter have a\nlong-period planet located at only $\\sim$1 au from their host star. WASP-41 is\na rather young star known to be chromospherically active. To differentiate its\nmagnetic cycle from the radial velocity effect induced by the second planet, we\nused the emission in the H$\\alpha$ line and find this indicator well suited to\ndetecting the stellar activity pattern and the magnetic cycle. The analysis of\nthe Rossiter-McLaughlin effect induced by WASP-41 b suggests that the planet\ncould be misaligned, though an aligned orbit cannot be excluded. WASP-47 has\nrecently been found to host two additional transiting super Earths. With such\nan unprecedented architecture, the WASP-47 system will be very important for\nunderstanding planetary migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 11:47:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

The high quality imagery produced by\nthe world's observatories can be a key to effectively engaging with the public\nand helping to inspire the next generation of scientists. Creating compelling\nastronomical imagery can, however, be particularly challenging in the\nnon-optical wavelength regimes. In the case of X-ray astronomy, where the\namount of light available to create an image is severely limited, it is\nnecessary to employ sophisticated image processing algorithms to translate\nlight beyond human vision into imagery that is aesthetically pleasing while\nstill being scientifically accurate. This paper provides a brief overview of\nthe history of X-ray astronomy leading to the deployment of NASA's Chandra\nX-ray Observatory, followed by an examination of the specific challenges posed\nby processing X-ray imagery. The authors then explore image processing\ntechniques used to mitigate such processing challenges in order to create\neffective public imagery for X-ray astronomy.

Though many clustering\nalgorithms have been proposed, clustering theories that justify the use of\nthese clustering algorithms are still unsatisfactory. In particular, one of the\nfundamental challenges is to address the following question:\n  What is a cluster in a set of data points?\n  In this paper, we make an attempt to address such a question by considering a\nset of data points associated with a distance measure (metric). We first\npropose a new cohesion measure in terms of the distance measure. Using the\ncohesion measure, we define a cluster as a set of points that are cohesive to\nthemselves. For such a definition, we show there are various equivalent\nstatements that have intuitive explanations. We then consider the second\nquestion:\n  How do we find clusters and good partitions of clusters under such a\ndefinition?\n  For such a question, we propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm and a\npartitional algorithm. Unlike standard hierarchical agglomerative algorithms,\nour hierarchical agglomerative algorithm has a specific stopping criterion and\nit stops with a partition of clusters. Our partitional algorithm, called the\nK-sets algorithm in the paper, appears to be a new iterative algorithm. Unlike\nthe Lloyd iteration that needs two-step minimization, our K-sets algorithm only\ntakes one-step minimization.\n  One of the most interesting findings of our paper is the duality result\nbetween a distance measure and a cohesion measure. Such a duality result leads\nto a dual K-sets algorithm for clustering a set of data points with a cohesion\nmeasure. The dual K-sets algorithm converges in the same way as a sequential\nversion of the classical kernel K-means algorithm. The key difference is that a\ncohesion measure does not need to be positive semi-definite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

In the past two years,\nover ten billion emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic\nsymbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to the\nsmall number of well-known emoticons that carry clear emotional contents, there\nare hundreds of emojis. But what are their emotional contents? We provide the\nfirst emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a\nsentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the\nemojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We\nengaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European\nlanguages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4%\nof the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis\nallows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of\nthe emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment\ndistribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different.\nThe inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend\nto occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with\nthe distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings\nbetween the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we\npropose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource\nfor automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization\nof sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 15:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 10:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Unfortunately, determining whether this is the case is known\nto be a complexity-theoretically intractable problem. This makes it highly\ndesirable to search for efficient heuristics and algorithms in order to, at\nleast, partially answer this question. Here we prove a general criterion - a\nsufficient condition - under which a local Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be\nfrustration free by lifting Shearer's theorem from classical probability theory\nto the quantum world. Remarkably, evaluating this condition proceeds via a\nfully classical analysis of a hard-core lattice gas at negative fugacity on the\nHamiltonian's interaction graph which, as a statistical mechanics problem, is\nof interest in its own right. We concretely apply this criterion to local\nHamiltonians on various regular lattices, while bringing to bear the tools of\nspin glass physics which permit us to obtain new bounds on the SAT/UNSAT\ntransition in random quantum satisfiability. These also lead us to natural\nconjectures for when such bounds will be tight, as well as to a novel notion of\nuniversality for these computer science problems.

In this\nreduction the spectrally-truncated vorticity equation defines the\nmicrodynamics, while the macroscopic state space consists of quasi-equilibrium\ntrial probability densities on the microscopic phase space, which are\nparameterized by the means and variances of the low modes of the vorticity. A\nmacroscopic path therefore represents a coarse-grained approximation to the\nevolution of a nonequilibrium ensemble of microscopic solutions. Closure in\nterms of the vector of resolved variables, namely, the means and variances of\nthe low modes, is achieved by minimizing over all feasible paths the time\nintegral of their mean-squared residual with respect to the Liouville equation.\nThe equations governing the optimal path are deduced from Hamilton-Jacobi\ntheory. The coarse-grained dynamics derived by this optimization technique\ncontains a scale-dependent eddy viscosity, modified nonlinear interactions\nbetween the low mode means, and a nonlinear coupling between the mean and\nvariance of each low mode. The predictive skill of this optimal closure is\nvalidated quantitatively by comparing it against direct numerical simulations.\nThese tests show that good agreement is achieved without adjusting any closure\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 19:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Spatial and temporal disturbances lead to adverse and hazardous\nmicroenvironments for cellular systems that is reflected in the phenotypic\nheterogeneity within the system. In this paper, we study the effect of\nmicroenvironment on the invasive capability of species, or mutants, on\nstructured grids under the influence of site-dependent random proliferation in\naddition to a migration potential. We discuss both continuous and discrete\nfitness distributions. Our results suggest that the invasion probability is\nnegatively correlated with the variance of fitness distribution of mutants (for\nboth advantageous and neutral mutants) in the absence of migration of both\ntypes of cells. A similar behaviour is observed even in the presence of a\nrandom fitness distribution of host cells in the system with neutral fitness\nrate. In the case of a bimodal distribution, we observe zero invasion\nprobability until the system reaches a (specific) proportion of advantageous\nphenotypes. Also, we find that the migrative potential amplifies the invasion\nprobability as the variance of fitness of mutants increases in the system,\nwhich is the exact opposite in the absence of migration. Our computational\nframework captures the harsh microenvironmental conditions through quenched\nrandom fitness distributions and migration of cells, and our analysis shows\nthat they play an important role in the invasion dynamics of several biological\nsystems such as bacterial micro-habitats, epithelial dysplasia, and metastasis.\nWe believe that our results may lead to more experimental studies, which can in\nturn provide further insights into the role and impact of heterogeneous\nenvironments on invasion dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 23:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 22:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

This leads to the perception by the customer of the\ndelivery of a product instead of a service.The product concerned is reduced to\na set of prescriptions, sometimes unrelated, which materialize in a descriptive\nand static view of client security management.
