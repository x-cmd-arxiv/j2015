However, once the tasks are\noutsourced, the end-users will lose control of their data, which may result in\nsevere security issues especially when the data is sensitive. To address this\nproblem, secure outsourcing mechanisms have been proposed to ensure security of\nthe end-users' outsourced data. In this paper, we investigate outsourcing of\ngeneral computational problems which constitute the mathematical basics for\nproblems emerged from various fields such as engineering and finance. To be\nspecific, we propose affine mapping based schemes for the problem\ntransformation and outsourcing so that the cloud is unable to learn any key\ninformation from the transformed problem. Meanwhile, the overhead for the\ntransformation is limited to an acceptable level compared to the computational\nsavings introduced by the outsourcing itself. Furthermore, we develop\ncost-aware schemes to balance the trade-offs between end-users' various\nsecurity demands and computational overhead. We also propose a verification\nscheme to ensure that the end-users will always receive a valid solution from\nthe cloud. Our extensive complexity and security analysis show that our\nproposed Cost-Aware Secure Outsourcing (CASO) scheme is both practical and\neffective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 16:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Two types of\nimportant regenerating code have been constructed: the minimum storage\nregeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code.\nHowever, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes,\nthe storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this\npaper, we propose two optimal constructions of regenerating codes through\nrate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile\nnetworks: 2-layer rate-matched regenerating code and $m$-layer rate-matched\nregenerating code. For the 2-layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage\nefficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that\nour code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency\ncompared to the universally resilient regenerating code which is a\nstraightforward extension of regenerating code with error detection and\ncorrection capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the\n2-layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching\nthe code rate of each layer's regenerating code. We also demonstrate that the\noptimized parameter can achieve the maximum storage capacity under the same\nconstraint.

Here we develop a computational method, a probabilistic\ndecomposition-synthesis technique, that takes into account the nature of\ninternal instabilities to inexpensively determine the non-Gaussian probability\ndensity function for any arbitrary quantity of interest. Our approach relies on\nthe decomposition of the statistics into a `non-extreme core', typically\nGaussian, and a heavy-tailed component. This decomposition is in full\ncorrespondence with a partition of the phase space into a `stable' region where\nwe have no internal instabilities, and a region where non-linear instabilities\nlead to rare transitions with high probability.

The\nprobabilistic information in the two domains is analytically synthesized\nthrough a total probability argument.

As a result,\nmuch of our understanding concerning stellar convection necessarily derives\nfrom theoretical and computational models. The Sun is, however, exceptional in\nthat regard. The wealth of observational data afforded by its proximity\nprovides a unique testbed for comparing convection models against observations.\nWhen such comparisons are carried out, surprising inconsistencies between those\nmodels and observations become apparent. Both photospheric and helioseismic\nmeasurements suggest that convection simulations may overestimate convective\nflow speeds on large spatial scales. Moreover, many solar convection\nsimulations have difficulty reproducing the observed solar differential\nrotation due to this apparent overestimation. We present a series of\n3-dimensional (3-D) stellar convection simulations designed to examine how the\namplitude and spectral distribution of convective flows are established within\na star's interior. While these simulations are non-magnetic and non-rotating in\nnature, they demonstrate two robust phenomena. When run with sufficiently high\nRayleigh number, the integrated kinetic energy of the convection becomes\neffectively independent of thermal diffusion, but the spectral distribution of\nthat kinetic energy remains sensitive to both of these quantities. A simulation\nthat has converged to a diffusion-independent value of kinetic energy will\ndivide that energy between spatial scales such that low-wavenumber power is\noverestimated, and high-wavenumber power is underestimated relative to a\ncomparable system possessing higher Rayleigh number. We discuss the\nimplications of these results in light of the current inconsistencies between\nmodels and observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 20:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Several holistic\nand geometric methods have been developed to identify faces and expressions\nusing public and local facial image databases. In this work we present the\nevolution in facial image data sets and the methodologies for facial\nidentification and recognition of expressions such as anger, sadness,\nhappiness, disgust, fear and surprise. We observe that most of the earlier\nmethods for facial and expression recognition aimed at improving the\nrecognition rates for facial feature-based methods using static images.\nHowever, the recent methodologies have shifted focus towards robust\nimplementation of facial/expression recognition from large image databases that\nvary with space (gathered from the internet) and time (video recordings). The\nevolution trends in databases and methodologies for facial and expression\nrecognition can be useful for assessing the next-generation topics that may\nhave applications in security systems or personal identification systems that\ninvolve \"Quantitative face\" assessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 22:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2015 14:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

At one extreme, all the mass comes from an initially\ngravitationally-bound core. At the other extreme, the majority of the mass\ncomes from cluster scale gas, which lies far outside the initial core boundary.\nOne way to unambiguously show high mass stars can assemble their gas through\nthe former route would be to find a high mass star forming in isolation. Making\nuse of recently available CORNISH and ATLASGAL Galactic plane survey data, we\ndevelop sample selection criteria to try and find such an object. From an\ninitial list of approximately 200 sources, we identify the high mass star\nforming region G13.384+0.064 as the most promising candidate. The region\ncontains a strong radio continuum source, that is powered by an early B-type\nstar. The bolometric luminosity, derived from infrared measurements, is\nconsistent with this. However, sub-millimetre continuum emission, measured in\nATLASGAL, as well as dense gas tracers, such as HCO+(3-2) and N2H+(3-2)\nindicate that there is less than 100 M$_{\\odot}$ of material surrounding this\nstar. We conclude that this region is indeed a promising candidate for a high\nmass star forming in isolation, but that deeper near-IR observations are\nrequired to put a stronger constraint on the upper mass limit of young, lower\nmass stars in the region. Finally, we discuss the challenges facing future\nstudies in proving a given high mass star is forming in isolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 22:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

In particular, it is tested on twelve UCI classification datasets,\na facial recognition problem, three real world prediction problems (2 chaotic\ntime series of geomagnetic activity indices and wind farm power generation\ndata), two synthetic case studies with constant and nonconstant noise variance\nas well as k-selector and linear programming problems. Results indicate the\ngeneral applicability and often superiority of the approach in terms of higher\naccuracy and lower model complexity, especially where low computational\ncomplexity is imperative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 01:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

Bonding capital is created by forming a circle of connections,\nhomophily increases bonding capital because it makes this circle of connections\nmore homogeneous. Popularity capital leads to preferential attachment:\nindividuals who become popular tend to become more popular because others are\nmore likely to link to them. Homophily creates asymmetries in the levels of\npopularity attained by different social groups, more gregarious types of agents\nare more likely to become popular.

Its merit, apart from\nthe capability to generate new creative thoughts from an internal mechanism,\ndepends on the potential to help training to generalize better.

Interstellar dust particles, which represent 1% of the total mass,\nare recognized to be very powerful interstellar catalysts in star-forming\nregions. The presence of dust can have a strong impact on the chemical\ncomposition of molecular clouds. While observations show that many species that\nformed onto dust grains populate the gas phase, the process that transforms\nsolid state into gas phase remains unclear. Aims. The aim of this paper is to\nconsider the chemical desorption process, i.e. the process that releases solid\nspecies into the gas phase, in astrochemical models. These models allow\ndetermining the chemical composition of star-forming environments with an\naccurate treatment of the solid-phase chemistry. Methods. In paper I we derived\na formula based on experimental studies with which we quantified the\nefficiencies of the chemical desorption process. Here we extend these results\nto astrophysical conditions. Results. The simulations of astrophysical\nenvironments show that the abundances of gas-phase methanol and H2O2 increase\nby four orders of magnitude, whereas gas-phase H2CO and HO2 increase by one\norder of magnitude when the chemical desorption process is taken into account.\nThe composition of the ices strongly varies when the chemical desorption is\nconsidered or neglected. Conclusions. We show that the chemical desorption\nprocess, which directly transforms solid species into gas-phase species, is\nvery efficient for many reactions. Applied to astrophysical environments such\nas Rho Oph A, we show that the chemical desorption efficiencies derived in this\nstudy reproduce the abundances of observed gas-phase methanol, HO2, and H2O2,\nand that the presence of these molecules in the gas shows the last signs of the\nevolution of a cloud before the frost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 09:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

The method constructs a convolutional neural\nnetwork of facial beauty prediction using a new deep cascaded fine-turning\nscheme with various face inputting channels, such as the original RGB face\nimage, the detail layer image, and the lighting layer image. With a carefully\ndesigned CNN model of deep structure, large input size and small convolutional\nkernels, we have achieved a high prediction correlation of 0.88. This result\nconvinces us that the problem of facial attractiveness prediction can be solved\nby deep learning approach, and it also shows the important roles of the facial\nsmoothness, lightness, and color information that were involved in facial\nbeauty perception, which is consistent with the result of recent psychology\nstudies. Furthermore, we analyze the high-level features learnt by CNN through\nvisualization of its hidden layers, and some interesting phenomena were\nobserved. It is found that the contours and appearance of facial features,\nespecially eyes and moth, are the most significant facial attributes for facial\nattractiveness prediction, which is also consistent with the visual perception\nintuition of human.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 09:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

They are a natural way to measure the\nrobustness of a system, or to identify its weakest spots. Interdiction problems\nhave been studied for a wide variety of classical combinatorial optimization\nproblems, including maximum $s$-$t$ flows, shortest $s$-$t$ paths, maximum\nweight matchings, minimum spanning trees, maximum stable sets, and graph\nconnectivity. Most interdiction problems are NP-hard, and furthermore, even\ndesigning efficient approximation algorithms that allow for estimating the\norder of magnitude of a worst-case impact, has turned out to be very difficult.\nNot very surprisingly, the few known approximation algorithms are heavily\ntailored for specific problems.\n  Inspired by an approach of Burch et al. (2003), we suggest a general method\nto obtain pseudoapproximations for many interdiction problems. More precisely,\nfor any $\\alpha>0$, our algorithm will return either a\n$(1+\\alpha)$-approximation, or a solution that may overrun the interdiction\nbudget by a factor of at most $1+\\alpha^{-1}$ but is also at least as good as\nthe optimal solution that respects the budget. Furthermore, our approach can\nhandle submodular interdiction costs when the underlying problem is to find a\nmaximum weight independent set in a matroid, as for example the maximum weight\nforest problem. The approach can sometimes be refined by exploiting additional\nstructural properties of the underlying optimization problem to obtain stronger\nresults. We demonstrate this by presenting a PTAS for interdicting $b$-stable\nsets in bipartite graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 13:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

The linkage of meteors to\nmeteor showers, to parent bodies, and to other meteors is done using measures\nof orbital similarity. These measures often take the form of so-called\nD-parameters and are generally paired with some cutoff value within which two\norbits are considered related. The appropriate cutoff value can depend on the\nsize of the data-set (Southworth & Hawkins 1963), the sporadic contribution\nwithin the observed size range (Jopek 1995), or the inclination of the shower\n(Galligan 2001).

The key in such a challenging setting is a semantic video\nrepresentation. Rather than building the representation from individual\nattribute detectors and their annotations, we propose to learn the entire\nrepresentation from freely available web videos and their descriptions using an\nembedding between video features and term vectors. In our proposed embedding,\nwhich we call VideoStory, the correlations between the terms are utilized to\nlearn a more effective representation by optimizing a joint objective balancing\ndescriptiveness and predictability.We show how learning the VideoStory using a\nmultimodal predictability loss, including appearance, motion and audio\nfeatures, results in a better predictable representation. We also propose a\nvariant of VideoStory to recognize an event in video from just the important\nterms in a text query by introducing a term sensitive descriptiveness loss. Our\nexperiments on three challenging collections of web videos from the NIST\nTRECVID Multimedia Event Detection and Columbia Consumer Videos datasets\ndemonstrate: i) the advantages of VideoStory over representations using\nattributes or alternative embeddings, ii) the benefit of fusing video\nmodalities by an embedding over common strategies, iii) the complementarity of\nterm sensitive descriptiveness and multimodal predictability for event\nrecognition without examples. By it abilities to improve predictability upon\nany underlying video feature while at the same time maximizing semantic\ndescriptiveness, VideoStory leads to state-of-the-art accuracy for both few-\nand zero-example recognition of events in video.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 14:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

In this work, we provide a self-consistent and definite form of the\nlunisolar expansion. We start with Kaula's expansion of the disturbing function\nin terms of the equatorial elements of both the perturbed and perturbing\nbodies. Then we give a detailed proof of Lane's expansion, in which the\nelements of the Moon are referred to the ecliptic plane. Using this approach\nthe inclination of the Moon becomes nearly constant, while the argument of\nperihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and the mean anomaly vary\nlinearly with time.\n  We make a comparison between the different expansions and we profit from such\ndiscussion to point out some mistakes in the existing literature, which might\ncompromise the correctness of the results. As an application, we analyze the\nlong--term motion of the highly elliptical and critically--inclined Molniya\norbits subject to quadrupolar gravitational interactions.

GEM is to minimise the space\ncharge effect in the main drift volume and thus will not require the standard\ngating grid and the resulting intrinsic dead time.

New read-out electronics will send the\ncontinuous data stream to a new online farm at rates up to 1~TByte/s. The new\nread-out chambers will consist of stacks of 4 GEM foils combining different\nhole pitches.

In particular, we concentrate\non a special class of secular resonances, which depend only on the debris'\norbital inclination. This class is typically subdivided into three distinct\ntypes of secular resonances: those occurring at the critical inclination, those\ncorresponding to polar orbits, and a third type resulting from a linear\ncombination of the rates of variation of the argument of perigee and the\nlongitude of the ascending node.\n  The model describing the dynamics of space debris includes the effects of the\ngeopotential, as well as the Sun's and Moon's attractions, and it is defined in\nterms of suitable action-angle variables. We consider the system averaged over\nboth the mean anomaly of the debris and those of the Sun and Moon. Such\nmultiply-averaged Hamiltonian is used to study the lunisolar resonances which\ndepend just on the inclination.\n  Borrowing the technique from the theory of bifurcations of Hamiltonian normal\nforms, we study the birth of periodic orbits and we determine the energy\nthresholds at which the bifurcations of lunisolar secular resonances take\nplace. This approach gives us physically relevant information on the existence\nand location of the equilibria, which help us to identify stable and unstable\nregions in the phase space. Besides their physical interest, the study of\ninclination dependent resonances offers interesting insights from the dynamical\npoint of view, since it sheds light on different phenomena related to\nbifurcation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 07:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 20:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}

The synthesis of reversible logic has\nbecome an intensely studied area as it overcomes the problem of power\ndissipation associated with irreversibility. Storage device such as\nRead-Only-Memory (ROM) can be realized in a reversible way with low power\ndissipation. The reversibility of ROM has not been yet realized in literature\nand hence, this paper presents a novel reversible ROM with its Complementary\nMetal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) realization. On the way to present the\narchitecture of reversible ROM, we propose a new reversible gate named as\nNowrin Papiya (NP) gate. All the proposed circuits and gates are realized with\nCMOS based pass transistor logic. Finally, an algorithm as well as several\ntheorems on the numbers of gates, transistors and garbage outputs have been\npresented to show the optimality of the reversible ROM. Simulations using\nMicrowind DSCH software has been shown to verify the correctness of the\nproposed design.
