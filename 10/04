At a 2-to-1 lane reduction,\nthe improvement in flow past a bottleneck due to traffic with a random mixture\nof 40% connected vehicles is found to be 52%. Control is based on\nconnected-vehicle-reported velocities near the bottleneck. In response to\nindications of congestion the connected vehicles, which are also adaptive\ncruise control vehicles, reduce their speed in slowdown regions. Early lane\nchanges of manually driven vehicles from the terminated lane to the continuous\nlane are induced by the slowing connected vehicles. Self-organized congestion\nat the bottleneck is thus delayed or eliminated, depending upon the incoming\nflow magnitude. For the large majority of vehicles, travel times past the\nbottleneck are substantially reduced. Control is responsible for delaying the\nonset of congestion as the incoming flow increases. Adaptive cruise control\nincreases the flow out of the congested state at the bottleneck. The nature of\nthe congested state, when it occurs, appears to be similar under a variety of\nconditions. Typically 80-100 vehicles are approximately equally distributed\nbetween the lanes in the 500-m region prior to the end of the terminated lane.\nWithout the adaptive cruise control capability, connected vehicles can delay\nthe onset of congestion but do not increase the asymptotic flow past the\nbottleneck. Calculations are done using the Kerner-Klenov stochastic\ndiscrete-time model for manual vehicles. The dynamics of the connected vehicles\nis given by a conventional adaptive cruise control algorithm plus commanded\ndeceleration. Because time in the model for manual vehicles is discrete\n(one-second intervals), it is assumed that the acceleration of any vehicle\nimmediately in front of a connected vehicle is constant during the time\ninterval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 21:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In this study the focus is on the resuspension of solid\nspherical particles with the density comparable to that of the fluid and the\ndiameter comparable with the Kolmogorov length scale. We track their motion\nduring the lift-off events in an oscillating grid turbulent flow. We measure\nsimultaneously the Lagrangian trajectories of both the particles freely moving\nalong the bottom smooth wall and the surrounding flow tracers.

We find that the number of MCs did not\ndecline in cycle 24, although the average sunspot number is known to have\ndeclined by ~40%. Despite the large number of MCs, their geoeffectiveness in\ncycle 24 was very low. The average Dst index in the sheath and cloud portions\nin cycle 24 was -33 nT and -23 nT, compared to -66 nT and -55 nT, respectively\nin cycle 23. One of the key outcomes of this investigation is that the\nreduction in the strength of geomagnetic storms as measured by the Dst index is\na direct consequence of the reduction in the factor VBz (the product of the MC\nspeed and the out-of-the-ecliptic component of the MC magnetic field). The\nreduction in MC-to-ambient total pressure in cycle 24 is compensated for by the\nreduction in the mean MC speed, resulting in the constancy of the dimensionless\nexpansion rate at 1 AU. However, the MC size in cycle 24 was significantly\nsmaller, which can be traced to the anomalous expansion of coronal mass\nejections near the Sun reported by Gopalswamy et al. (2014a).

The angular-dependent SdH\noscillations show a clear quasi-two-dimensional feature with highly anisotropic\nFermi surface and band topology, in stark contrast to the 3D Dirac semimetal\nsuch as Cd3As2. This is further confirmed by the angle-dependent Berry phase\nmeasurements and the observation of bulk quantum Hall plateaus.

However it is an open question whether such reciprocal\nstrategies can emerge as the rational outcome of repeated interactions between\nselfish agents. Here we show that adopting a co-action perspective, which takes\ninto account the symmetry between agents - a relevant consideration in\nbiological and social contexts - naturally leads to such a strategy. For a\n2-player IPD, we show that the co-action solution corresponds to the Pavlov\nstrategy, thereby providing a rational basis for it. For an IPD involving many\nplayers, an instance of the Public Goods game where cooperation is generally\nconsidered to be harder to achieve, we show that the cooperators always\noutnumber defectors in the co-action equilibrium. This can be seen as a\ngeneralization of Pavlov to contests involving many players. In general,\nrepeated interactions allow rational agents to become aware of the inherent\nsymmetry of their situation, enabling them to achieve robust cooperation\nthrough co-action strategies - which, in the case of IPD, is a reciprocal\nPavlovian one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 08:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 04:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 11:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

In this paper, we proposed a novel way to extract image\nrepresentations from two consecutive convolutional layers: one layer is\nutilized for local feature extraction and the other serves as guidance to pool\nthe extracted features. By taking different viewpoints of convolutional layers,\nwe further develop two schemes to realize this idea. The first one directly\nuses convolutional layers from a DCNN. The second one applies the pretrained\nCNN on densely sampled image regions and treats the fully-connected activations\nof each image region as convolutional feature activations. We then train\nanother convolutional layer on top of that as the pooling-guidance\nconvolutional layer.

Naive implementation of what we term a\npseudo-posterior resulting from replacing the likelihood function in the\nposterior distribution by the pseudolikelihood is likely to give misleading\ninferences.

Five MCP-PMTs are installed in two columns along the OTPC cylinder in\na small-angle stereo configuration. A mirror is mounted opposite each MCP-PMT\non the far side of the detector cylinder, effectively doubling the\nphoto-detection efficiency and providing a time-resolved image of the Cherenkov\nlight on the opposing wall. Each MCP-PMT is coupled to an anode readout\nconsisting of thirty 50 Ohm microstrips. A 180-channel data acquisition system\ndigitizes the MCP-PMT signals on one end of the microstrips using the PSEC4\nwaveform sampling-and-digitizing chip operating at a sampling rate of\n10.24~Gigasamples-per-second.

The neural\ncompartment is a neural mass model with double excitatory feedback, and the\nglial compartment focus on the dynamics of glutamate and GABA concentrations.\nUsing the proposed model, we first study the impact of a deficiency in the\nreuptake of GABA by astrocytes, which implies an increase in GABA concentration\nin the extracellular space. A decrease in the frequency of neural activity is\nobserved and explained from the dynamics analysis. Second, we investigate the\nneuronal response to a deficiency in the reuptake of Glutamate by the\nastrocytes. In this case, we identify three behaviors : the neural activity may\neither be reduced, or enhanced or, alternatively, may experience a transient of\nhigh activity before stabilizing around a new activity regime with a frequency\nclose to the nominal one. After translating theoretically the neuronal\nexcitability modulation using the bifurcation structure of the neural mass\nmodel, we state the conditions on the glial feedback parameters corresponding\nto each behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2015 15:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}
