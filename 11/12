We consider homogeneous submodules of $A[\\mathbf x]^m$\nhaving a special set of generators: a marked basis over a quasi-stable module.\nSuch a marked basis inherits several good properties of a Gr\\\"obner basis,\nincluding a Noetherian reduction relation. The set of submodules of $A[\\mathbf\nx]^m$ having a marked basis over a given quasi-stable module has an affine\nscheme structure that we are able to exhibit. Furthermore, the syzygies of a\nmodule generated by such a marked basis are generated by a marked basis, too\n(over a suitable quasi-stable module in $\\oplus^{m'}_{i=1} A[\\mathbf\nx](-d_i)$). We apply the construction of marked bases and related properties to\nthe investigation of Quot functors (and schemes). More precisely, for a given\nHilbert polynomial, we can explicitely construct (up to the action of a general\nlinear group) an open cover of the corresponding Quot functor made up of open\nfunctors represented by affine schemes. This gives a new proof that the Quot\nfunctor is the functor of points of a scheme. We also exhibit a procedure to\nobtain the equations defining a given Quot scheme as a subscheme of a suitable\nGrassmannian. Thanks to the good behaviour of marked bases with respect to\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity, we can adapt our methods in order to study the\nlocus of the Quot scheme given by an upper bound on the regularity of its\npoints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 16:00:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 08:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 08:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-23"}

However, this entails paying the costs of both dispersal\nand non-dispersal. Propagules that disperse are likely to encounter unfavorable\nconditions for establishment, while non-dispersing propagules might form\npopulations of close relatives burdened with inbreeding. Here, we investigate\nthe conditions under which mixed dispersal syndromes emerge and are\nevolutionarily stable, taking into account the risks of both environmental\nunpredictability and inbreeding. Using mathematical and computational modeling\nwe show that high dispersal propensity is favored whenever temporal\nenvironmental unpredictability is low and inbreeding depression high, whereas\nmixed dispersal syndromes are adaptive under conditions of high environmental\nunpredictability, but more particularly if also inbreeding depression is small.\nAlthough pure dispersers can be selected for under some circumstances, mixed\ndispersal provides the optimal strategy under most parameterizations of our\nmodels, indicating that this strategy is likely to be favored under a wide\nvariety of conditions. Furthermore, populations exhibiting any single phenotype\ngo inevitably extinct when environmental and genetic costs are high, whilst\nmixed strategies can maintain viable populations even under such conditions.\nOur models support the hypothesis that the interplay between inbreeding\ndepression and environmental unpredictability shapes dispersal syndromes, often\nresulting in mixed strategies.

Classification is one of the most important\ndata mining tasks for label prediction, categorization of objects into groups,\nadvertisement and data management.

Unfortunately, web security is known to\nbe difficult, and therefore the web interfaces of embedded systems represent a\nconsiderable attack surface.\n  In this paper, we present the first fully automated framework that applies\ndynamic firmware analysis techniques to achieve, in a scalable manner,\nautomated vulnerability discovery within embedded firmware images.

Lens modeling\nand source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably\nundistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, although\nat the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope PSF when mapped back to\nthe source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time and\nresource intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to\nprecisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological\nmeasurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it\nwould bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction\nprocess for some applications.

Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the\nlight of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that\nsurface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may\nbe well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing.

In the case of many group IV-VI,\nV, and related materials, these interactions are strong and the materials exist\nnear electronic and structural phase transitions. Their close proximity to\nphase instability produces a fragile balance among the various properties. The\nprototypical example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour has been\nassociated with large phonon anharmonicity and thermoelectricity. Experimental\nmeasurements on PbTe reveal anomalous lattice dynamics, especially in the soft\ntransverse optical phonon branch. This has been interpreted in terms of both\ngiant anharmonicity and local symmetry breaking due to off-centering of the Pb\nions. The observed anomalies have prompted renewed theoretical and\ncomputational interest, which has in turn revived focus on the extent that\nelectron-phonon interactions drive lattice instabilities in PbTe and related\nmaterials. Here, we use Fourier-transform inelastic x-ray scattering (FT-IXS)\nto show that photo-injection of free carriers stabilizes the paraelectric\nstate. With support from constrained density functional theory (CDFT)\ncalculations, we find that photoexcitation weakens the long-range forces along\nthe cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and incipient ferroelectricity.\nThis demonstrates the importance of electronic states near the band edges in\ndetermining the equilibrium structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 19:48:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

The Higgs mass\nvalue observed by ATLAS and CMS leads to a negative value of the quartic\ncoupling, making metastable the vacuum of the Standard Model, as it is seen by\nthe renormalization group improved (RGI) effective potential. The stability\nstatus of SM crucially depends upon the precise values of the top and Higgs\nmasses, a more precision determination of those masses and related\nuncertainties can modify drastically our conclusions about the SM stability\nproperties.

We here re-analyze an\nintriguing gedanken experiment which was designed by Bekenstein to challenge\nthe GSL. In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is\nlowered into a charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. For the GSL to work,\nthe resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate\nfor the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered\nadiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed\nin the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in\nblack-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)\nmay become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy. In order\nto resolve this apparent violation of the GSL, we here suggest to use a\ngeneralized version of the hoop conjecture. In particular, assuming that a\nphysical system of mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ forms a black hole if its\ncircumference radius $r_{\\text{c}}$ is equal to (or smaller than) the\ncorresponding Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole radius\n$r_{\\text{RN}}=M+\\sqrt{M^2-Q^2}$, we prove that a new (and larger) horizon is\nalready formed before the entropy-bearing box reaches the horizon of the\noriginal near-extremal black hole.

To determine if the coupled system can be many-body localized\nwe analyze the phonon-mediated hopping transport for both the weak and strong\ncoupling regimes. We show that the usual variable-range hopping mechanism\ninvolving a low-order phonon processes is ineffective at low temperature due to\ndiscreteness of the bath at the required energy.

We\nfind that, in realistic conditions of the interstellar medium, thermally\nrotating big grains with magnetic inclusions are weakly aligned and achieve\n{\\it alignment saturation} when the magnetic alignment rate becomes much faster\nthan the rotational damping rate. We then compute the degree of alignment for\nfree-flying magnetic nanoparticles, taking into account various interaction\nprocesses of grains with the ambient gas and radiation field, including neutral\ncollisions, ion collisions, and infrared emission.

Using the\ncomputed degrees of alignment, we predict the polarization level of MDE from\nfree-flying magnetic nanoparticles to be rather low.

Isolated GRB pulses can also exhibit intensity tracking\nbehaviors that, when observed, are tied to the timing of the three peaks:\npulses with the largest maximum hardnesses are hardest during the precursor,\nthose with smaller maximum hardnesses are hardest during the central peak, and\nall pulses can re-harden during the central peak and/or during the decay peak.\nSince these behaviors are essentially seen in all isolated pulses, the\ndistinction between \"hard-to-soft\" and \"intensity-tracking\" pulses really no\nlonger applies. Additionally, the triple-peaked nature of isolated GRB pulses\nseems to indicate that energy is injected on three separate occasions during\nthe pulse duration: theoretical pulse models need to account for this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 21:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Aims: We study the self-organisation of initially uniform\nsub-equipartition magnetic fields by highly stratified turbulent convection.\nMethods: We perform simulations of magnetoconvection in Cartesian domains that\nare $8.5$-$24$ Mm deep and $34$-$96$ Mm wide. We impose either a vertical or a\nhorizontal uniform magnetic field in a convection-driven turbulent flow.\nResults: We find that super-equipartition magnetic flux concentrations are\nformed near the surface with domain depths of $12.5$ and $24$ Mm. The size of\nthe concentrations increases as the box size increases and the largest\nstructures ($20$ Mm horizontally) are obtained in the 24 Mm deep models. The\nfield strength in the concentrations is in the range of $3$-$5$ kG. The\nconcentrations grow approximately linearly in time. The effective magnetic\npressure measured in the simulations is positive near the surface and negative\nin the bulk of the convection zone. Its derivative with respect to the mean\nmagnetic field, however, is positive in the majority of the domain, which is\nunfavourable for the negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI).\nFurthermore, we find that magnetic flux is concentrated in regions of\nconverging flow corresponding to large-scale supergranulation convection\npattern. Conclusions: The linear growth of large-scale flux concentrations\nimplies that their dominant formation process is tangling of the large-scale\nfield rather than an instability. One plausible mechanism explaining both the\nlinear growth and the concentrate on of the flux in the regions of converging\nflow pattern is flux expulsion. Possible reasons for the absence of NEMPI are\nthat the derivative of the effective magnetic pressure with respect to the mean\nmagnetic field has an unfavourable sign and that there may not be sufficient\nscale separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 22:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

However, the\naccuracy of brain activity estimates resulting from these data is limited\nmainly because 1) the number of sensors is much smaller than the number of\nsources, and 2) the low sensitivity of the recording device to deep or radially\noriented sources. These factors limit the number of sources that can be\nrecovered and bias estimates to superficial cortical areas, resulting in the\nneed to include a priori information about the source activity. The question of\nhow to specify this information and how it might lead to improved solutions\nremains a critical open problem. In this paper we show that the incorporation\nof knowledge about the brain's underlying connectivity and spatiotemporal\ndynamics could dramatically improve inverse solutions.

The\nclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forming\ngalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in more\nmassive halos. When using local density measurement, we find a clear positive\nquiescent fraction--density relation at $z < 1$, consistent with earlier\nresults. However, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trend\nat intermediate redshifts ($1 < z < 1.5$) with marginal significance\n(<1.8$\\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\\sigma$). The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching. Finally, at\n$z > 1.5$, the quiescent fraction depends little on the local density, even\nthough clustering shows that quiescent galaxies are in more massive halos. We\nargue that at high redshift the typical halo size falls below $10^{13}$\n$M_{\\odot}$, where intrinsically the local density measurements are so varied\nthat they do not trace the halo mass. Our results thus suggest that in the\nhigh-redshift Universe, halo mass may be the key in quenching the star\nformation in galaxies, rather than the conventionally measured galaxy density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 00:17:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 06:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

To tackle the operational\nreliability issues caused by the volatile and non-dispatchable wind generation,\nmany dispatch frameworks have been proposed, including robust unit commitment\n(RUC) considering wind variation. One of the drawbacks that commonly exist in\nthose dispatch frameworks is increased demand on flexibility resources and\nassociated costs. To improve wind dispatchability and reduce flexibility\nresource costs, in this paper, we propose a novel RUC model considering\nstrategic wind generation curtailment (WGC). Strategic WGC can reduce wind\nuncertainty and variability and increase the visibility of wind generation\ncapacity. As a result, the ramping requirement for wind generation will be\nreduced and ramp-up capability of wind generation can be increased, leading to\nreduced day-ahead operational cost with guaranteed operational reliability\nrequirement of power systems. The economic benefits also include profits gained\nby wind farm by providing ramping-up capacities other auxiliary services.

Here, we develop a simple model of metabolic reactions\nwith anabolism-catabolism coupling catalysed by enzymes.

This result is in strong contrast with\nthat observed in the oscillatory input, in which the efficiency always\ndecreased with oscillation. This improvement was effectively achieved by\nseparating the anabolic and catabolic reactions, which tend to disequilibrate\neach other, and taking advantage of the temporal oscillations so that each of\nthe antagonistic reactions could progress near equilibrium. In this case,\nanti-phase oscillation between the reaction flux and chemical affinity through\noscillation of enzyme abundances is essential.

A possible\nexplanation requires the slow rotation of the proto-neutron star at birth,\nwhich is unable to amplify its magnetic field to typical pulsar levels. An\nalternative possibility, the hidden magnetic field scenario, considers the\naccretion of the fallback of the supernova debris onto the neutron star as\nresponsible for the submergence (or screening) of the field and its apparently\nlow value. In this paper we study under which conditions the magnetic field of\na neutron star can be buried into the crust due to an accreting, conducting\nfluid. For this purpose, we consider a spherically symmetric calculation in\ngeneral relativity to estimate the balance between the incoming accretion flow\nand the magnetosphere. Our study analyses several models with different\nspecific entropy, composition, and neutron star masses. The main conclusion of\nour work is that typical magnetic fields of a few times 1e12 G can be buried by\naccreting only 1e-3 - 1e-2 solar mass, a relatively modest amount of mass.

As a first con- tribution, it is shown that, under a quantum\nnondemolition measurement scheme applied to a system initially at the ground\nstate, (i) the observed sequence of measurements (quantum tracks) corresponding\nto a single experiment converges to a limit point, and that (ii) the limit\npoint is random over the ensemble of the experiments, being distributed as a\nzero-mean Gaussian random variable with a variance at most equal to the\nground-state variance. As a second contribution, the richer scenario where the\noscillator is coupled with a frozen (i.e., at the ground state) ensemble of\nindependent quantum oscillators is considered. A sharply different behavior\nemerges: under the same measurement scheme, here we observe that the\nmeasurement sequences are essentially divergent.

In\npebble accretion, gravity and gas drag conspire to yield large collisional\ncross sections for small particles in protoplanetary disks. However, before\npebble accretion commences, aerodynamical deflection may act to prevent\nplanetesimals from becoming large, because particles tend to follow gas\nstreamlines. We derive the planetesimal radius where pebble accretion is\ninitiated and determine the growth timescales of planetesimals by sweepup of\nsmall particles. We obtain the collision efficiency factor as the ratio of the\nnumerically-obtained collisional cross section to the planetesimal surface\narea, from which we obtain the growth timescales. Integrations are conducted in\nthe potential flow limit (steady, inviscid) and in the Stokes flow regime\n(steady, viscid). Only particles of stopping time $t_s \\ll t_X$ where\n$t_X\\approx10^3$ s experience aerodynamic deflection. Even in that case, the\nplanetesimal's gravity always ensures positive collision factors.

For particles $t_s \\gg t_X$ pebble accretion commences only\nafter this phase and is characterized by a steep drop in growth timescales.\nConsequently, at distances beyond ~10 AU sweepup growth timescales are always\nlonger than $10$ Myr, while in the inner disk (~<3 AU) the viability of the\nsweepup scenario is determined by the outcome of pebble-planetesimal collisions\nin the geometric regime. We present analytical fits for the collision\nefficiency factors and the minimum planetesimal size needed for pebble\naccretion.

We present and\nanalyze several counterexamples from the class of perturbed Hamming-weight\noptimization problems with qubit permutation symmetry. We first show that, for\nthese problems, the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible should be\nunderstood not in terms of the cost function but rather the semi-classical\npotential arising from the spin-coherent path integral formalism. We then\nprovide an example where the shape of the barrier in the final cost function is\nshort and wide, which might suggest no quantum advantage for QA, yet where\ntunneling renders QA superior to simulated annealing in the adiabatic regime.\nHowever, the adiabatic dynamics turn out not be optimal. Instead, an evolution\ninvolving a sequence of diabatic transitions through many avoided\nlevel-crossings, involving no tunneling, is optimal and outperforms adiabatic\nQA. We show that this phenomenon of speedup by diabatic transitions is not\nunique to this example, and we provide an example where it provides an\nexponential speedup over adiabatic QA. In yet another twist, we show that a\nclassical algorithm, spin vector dynamics, is at least as efficient as diabatic\nQA. Finally, in a different example with a convex cost function, the diabatic\ntransitions result in a speedup relative to both adiabatic QA with tunneling\nand classical spin vector dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 14:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

The aim of this work is the study of abundances of the heavy elements\nBa, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu in 56 bulge giants (red giant branch and red clump) with\nmetallicities ranging from -1.3 dex to 0.5 dex. Methods. We obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra of our giant stars using the FLAMES-UVES spectrograph\non the Very Large Telescope. We inspected four bulge fields along the minor\naxis. Results. We measure the chemical evolution of heavy elements, as a\nfunction of metallicity, in the Galactic bulge. Conclusions. The [Ba, La, Ce,\nNd/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios decrease with increasing metallicity, in which aspect\nthey differ from disc stars. In our metal-poor bulge stars, La and Ba are\nenhanced relative to their thick disc counterpart, while in our metal-rich\nbulge stars La and Ba are underabundant relative to their disc counterpart.\nTherefore, this contrast between bulge and discs trends indicates that bulge\nand (solar neighbourhood) thick disc stars could behave differently. An\nincrease in [La, Nd/Eu] with increasing metallicity, for metal-rich stars with\n[Fe/H] > 0 dex, may indicate that the s-process from AGB stars starts to\noperate at a metallicity around solar. Finally, [Eu/Fe] follows the\n[{\\alpha}/Fe] behaviour, as expected, since these elements are produced by SNe\ntype II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 15:08:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

By studying the link\nbetween the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that even if the\nnet force vanishes, the velocity and pressure fields of the Navier-Stokes\nequations cannot be asymptotic to those of the Stokes equations. However, the\nvelocity field can be in some cases asymptotic to two exact solutions of the\nStokes equations which also solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a\nformal asymptotic expansion at infinity for the solutions of the\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations having a nonzero net force is\nestablished based physical arguments. The leading term of the velocity field in\nthis expansion decays like $|\\boldsymbol{x}|^{-1/3}$ and exhibits a wake\nbehavior. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this asymptotic\nexpansion when is net force is nonzero and to analyze the asymptotic behavior\nin the case where the net force is vanishing. This indicates that the\nNavier-Stokes equations admit solutions whose velocity field goes to zero at\ninfinity in contrast to the Stokes linearization and moreover this shows that\nthe set of possible asymptotes is very rich.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 15:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

This field exists only in the narrow polar tube of $r$\nwidth, narrowing with the depth, i.e. with increasing of the crust density\n$\\rho$, $r\\propto \\rho^{-1/4}$. Accordingly, the magnetic field $B$ in the tube\nincreases with the depth, $B\\propto \\rho^{1/2}$, and reaches the value of about\n$10^{17}$ Gauss in the core. It destroys super conducting vortices in the core\nof a star in the narrow region of the size of the order of ten centimeters.\nBecause of generated density gradient of vortices they constantly flow into\nthis dead zone and the number of vortices decreases, the magnetic field of a\nstar decreases as well. The attenuation of the magnetic field is exponential,\n$B=B_0(1+t/\\tau)^{-1}$. The characteristic time of decreasing of the magnetic\nfield $\\tau$ is equal to $\\tau\\simeq 10^3$ years. Thus, the magnetic field of\naccreted neutron stars decreases to values of $10^8 - 10^9$ Gauss during\n$10^7-10^6$ years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 15:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}
