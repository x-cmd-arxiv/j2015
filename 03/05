It shares with\ntechniques from other fields the emphasis on the existence of widely separated\nscales. Given this fact, the question arises whether it is feasible to improve\non the adiabatic approximation, similarly to some of those other approaches. A\nnumber of authors have addressed the issue from the quantum optics/atomic\nphysics perspective, and have run into the issue of non-hermiticity of the\neffective Hamiltonian improved beyond the adiabatic approximation, which poses\nconceptual and practical problems. Here, we first briefly survey methods\npresent in the physics literature. Next, we rewrite the problems addressed by\nthe adiabatic elimination technique to make apparent the fact that they are\nsingular perturbation problems from the point of view of dynamical systems. We\napply the invariant manifold method for singular perturbation problems to this\ncase, and show that this method produces the equation named after Bloch in\nnuclear physics. Given the wide separation of scales, it becomes intuitive that\nthe Bloch equation admits iterative/perturbative solutions. We show, using a\nfixed point theorem, that indeed the iteration converges to a perturbative\nsolution that produces in turn an exact Hamiltonian for the relevant subspace.\nWe propose thus several sequences of effective Hamiltonians, starting with the\nadiabatic elimination and improving on it. We show the origin of the\nnon-hermiticity, and that it is inessential given the isospectrality of the\neffective non-hermitian operator and a corresponding effective hermitian\noperator, which we build.

We show that signatures of a strong\nparsec-scale jet and of an accretion disk emission are present in the SED. We\ncan link the observationnal VLBI jet features from MOJAVE to parameters\nexpected for a VHE emitting blob accelerated near the jet base. The VHE\nemission appears to be dominated by the inverse-Compton effect of the blob\nrelativistic electrons interacting with the jet synchrotron radiation.

Quantifying uncertainty\nis crucial for determining how accurate the model predictions are and\nidentifying which input parameters affect the outputs of interest. Most of the\nexisting methods for uncertainty quantification require many samples to\ngenerate accurate results, are unable to differentiate where the uncertainty is\ncoming from (e.g., parameters or model assumptions), or require a lot of\ncomputational resources. Our approach addresses these challenges and\nopportunities by allowing different types of uncertainty, that is, uncertainty\nin input parameters as well as uncertainty created through stochastic model\ncomponents. This is done by combining the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition,\npolynomial chaos expansion, and Bayesian Gaussian process regression to create\na statistical surrogate for the stochastic model. The surrogate separates the\nanalysis of variation arising through stochastic simulation and variation\narising through uncertainty in the model parameterization. We illustrate our\napproach by quantifying the uncertainty in a stochastic ordinary differential\nequation epidemic model. Specifically, we estimate four quantities of interest\nfor the epidemic model and show agreement between the surrogate and the actual\nmodel results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 18:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

In a simple, illustrative model of constant density,\nthe tangled field eliminates the problematic Alfv\\'en continuum that would\nexist in the stellar core for an organized field. For a tangled field energy\ndensity comparable to that inferred from the measured dipole fields of $\\sim\n10^{15}$ G in SGRs 1806-20 and 1900+14, torsional modes exist with fundamental\nfrequencies of about 20 Hz, and mode spacings of $\\sim 10$ Hz.

The combined effects of stratification and crust stresses\ngenerally decrease the frequencies of torsional oscillations by $<10$% for\novertones and increase the lowest-frequency fundamentals by up to 50%, and so\nthe star can be treated as having constant density to a generally good first\napproximation. We address the issue of mode excitation by sudden readjustment\nof the stellar magnetosphere. While the total energy in excited modes is well\nwithin the energy budget of giant flares, the surface amplitude is $< 10^{-3}$\nof the stellar radius for global oscillations, and decreases strongly with mode\nfrequency. The 626 Hz QPO reported for SGR 1806-20 is particularly problematic\nto excite beyond a surface amplitude of $10^{-6}$ of the stellar radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 18:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

An\nalternative approach one can consider is an adaptive method which selects users\nin a manner which targets their influential neighbors. The advantage of such an\napproach is that it leverages the friendship paradox in social networks: while\nusers are often not influential, they often know someone who is.\n  Despite the various complexities in such optimization problems, we show that\nscalable adaptive seeding is achievable.

On the other hand, in the light-cone gauge quantization without\nthe mode expansion, the theory in $D>3$ has the spacetime conformal anomaly in\nthe traceless part of $[\\mathcal{J}^{-I}, \\mathcal{K}^{J}]$ in some operator\norder.\n  In this paper, we consider a tensionless closed bosonic string in the\nlight-cone gauge and investigate the spacetime conformal anomaly in the theory\nwith the mode expansion. The appearance of the spacetime conformal anomaly in\nthe light-cone gauge is different between the case of $D>3$ and the case of\n$D=3$ and depends on the choice of the operator order. Therefore we must\nconsider dangerous commutators in the spacetime conformal symmetry of $D>3$ and\n$D=3$ in each operator order separately.

Here, we show that the levels of habitable zone dust\narising from detectable Kuiper belt analogues can be tens to a few hundreds of\ntimes greater than the optical depth in the Solar Zodiacal cloud. Dust\nenhancements of more than a few tens of `zodi' are expected to hinder future\nEarth-imaging missions, but relatively few undetectable Kuiper belts result in\nsuch levels, particularly around stars older than a few Gyr. Thus, current mid\nto far-IR photometric surveys have already identified most of the 20-25% of\nnearby stars where P-R drag from outer belts could seriously impact\nEarth-imaging. The LBTI should easily detect such warm dust around many nearby\nstars with outer belts, and will provide insight into currently unclear details\nof the competition between P-R drag and collisions.

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection.

Our goal is to\nprovide an estimate of the combined effect of merging and RPS on stripping\nefficiency and star formation rate.\n  Methods: We make use of the combined N-body/hydrodynamic code GADGET-2. In\nour simulations, we vary mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:8 in a binary merger. We\nsample different geometric configurations of the merging systems (edge-on and\nface-on mergers, different impact parameters). Furthermore, we vary the\nproperties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in rough steps: The speed of the\nmerging system relative to the ICM between 500 and 1000 km/s, the ICM density\nbetween $10^{-29}$ and $10^{-27}$ g/cm$^3$, and the ICM direction relative to\nthe mergers' orbital plane. Ram pressure is kept constant within a simulation\ntime period, as is the ICM temperature of $10^7$ K. Each simulation in the ICM\nis compared to simulations of the merger in vacuum and the non-merging galaxies\nwith acting ram pressure.\n  Results: Averaged over the simulation time (1 Gyr) the merging pairs show a\nnegligible 5% enhancement in SFR, when compared to single galaxies under the\nsame environmental conditions. The SFRs peak at the time of the galaxies first\nfly-through. There, our simulations show SFRs of up to 20 M$_{\\odot}$/yr\n(compared to 3 M$_{\\odot}$/yr of the non-merging galaxies in vacuum). In the\nmost extreme case, this constitutes a short-term ($<50$ Myr) SFR increase of\n50% over the non-merging galaxies experiencing ram pressure. The wake of\nmerging galaxies in the ICM typically has a third to half the star mass seen in\nthe non-merging galaxies and 5% to 10 % less gas mass. The joint effect of RPS\nand merging, according to our simulations, is not significantly different from\npure ram pressure effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 21:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

This GOES C2.7 event was\ncharacterised by two flaring ribbons and a compact, bright coronal source\nlocated between them, which is the focus of our study. We use imaging from\nSDO/AIA, and imaging spectroscopy from RHESSI to characterise the thermal and\nnon-thermal emission from the coronal source, and EUV spectroscopy from the\nHinode/EIS, which scanned the coronal source during the impulsive peak, to\nanalyse Doppler shifts in Fe XII and Fe XXIV emission lines, and determine the\nsource density. The coronal source exhibited an impulsive emission lightcurve\nin all AIA filters during the impulsive phase. RHESSI hard X-ray images\nindicate both thermal and non-thermal emission at the coronal source, and its\nplasma temperature derived from RHESSI imaging spectroscopy shows an impulsive\nrise, reaching a maximum at 12-13 MK about 10 seconds prior to the hard X-ray\npeak. High redshifts associated with this bright source indicate downflows of\n40-250 km/s at a broad range of temperatures, interpreted as loop shrinkage\nand/or outflows along the magnetic field. Outflows from the coronal source\ntowards each ribbon are also observed by AIA images at 171, 193, 211, 304 and\n1600 A. The electron density of the source obtained from a Fe XIV line pair is\n$10^{11.50}$ which is collisionally thick to electrons with energy up to 45-65\nkeV, responsible for the source's non-thermal X-ray emission. We conclude that\nthe bright coronal source is the location of the main release of magnetic\nenergy in this flare, with a geometry consistent with component reconnection\nbetween crossing, current-carrying loops. We argue that the energy that can be\nreleased via reconnection, based on observational estimates, can plausibly\naccount for the non-thermal energetics of the flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 22:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

Based\non this model the observed metallicities and their gradients can be described\nsurprisingly well by the radially averaged distribution of the ratio of stellar\nmass to ISM gas mass. The comparison between observed and model predicted\nmetallicity is used to constrain the rate of mass loss through galactic wind\nand accretion gain in units of the star formation rate. Three groups of\ngalaxies are found: galaxies with either mostly winds and only weak accretion,\nor mostly accretion and only weak winds, and galaxies where winds are roughly\nbalanced by accretion. The three groups are distinct in the properties of their\ngas disks.

Robust control over the chemical\npotential of TI materials is important if these states are to become useful in\nnew technologies, or as a venue for exotic physics. Unfortunately, chemical\npotential tuning is challenging in TIs in part because the fabrication of\nelectrostatic top-gates tends to degrade material properties and the addition\nof chemical dopants or adsorbates can cause unwanted disorder. Here, we present\nan all-optical technique which allows persistent, bidirectional gating of a\n(Bi,Sb)2Te3 channel by optically manipulating the distribution of electric\ncharge below its interface with an insulating SrTiO3 substrate. In this fashion\nwe optically pattern p-n junctions in a TI material, which we subsequently\nimage using scanning photocurrent microscopy. The ability to dynamically write\nand re-write mesoscopic electronic structures in a TI may aid in the\ninvestigation of the unique properties of the topological insulating phase.

Similarly, the 15 new Li-rich K giants that were identified from\nthe same sample show no evidence of IR excess. Of the total 40 Li-rich K\ngiants, only 7 show IR excess. Important is that K giants with Li enhancement\nand/or IR excess begin to appear only at the bump on the RGB. Results show that\nK giants with IR excess are very rare, similar to K giants with Li enhancement.\nThis may be due to the rapid differential evolution of dust shell and Li\ndepletion compared to RGB evolutionary time scales.

With growing image sizes (2D and 3D), it is now highly desirable to run\nenergy minimization algorithms in parallel. But many existing algorithms, in\nparticular, some efficient combinatorial algorithms, are difficult to\npar-allelize. By exploiting results from convex and submodular theory, we\nreformulate the quadratic energy minimization problem as a total variation\ndenoising problem, which, when viewed geometrically, enables the use of\nprojection and reflection based convex methods. The resulting min-cut algorithm\n(and code) is conceptually very simple, and solves a sequence of TV denoising\nproblems. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing\nstate-of-the-art combinatorial algorithms and convex optimization techniques.\nOn small problems the iterative convex methods match the combinatorial max-flow\nalgorithms, while on larger problems they offer other flexibility and important\ngains: (a) their memory footprint is small; (b) their straightforward\nparallelizability fits multi-core platforms; (c) they can easily be\nwarm-started; and (d) they quickly reach approximately good solutions, thereby\nenabling faster \"inexact\" solutions.

Originally,\nthe spin-down rate was relatively stable, with the rotational frequency\nderivative of $-1.14 \\times 10^{-14}~\\rm s^{-2}$. After September 2005, the\nderivative began to rise up. About 1000 days later, it arrived at another\nrelatively stable value of about $-0.98 \\times 10^{-14}~\\rm s^{-2}$, indicating\nthat the pulsar is spinning-down relatively slowly. To explain the observed\nspin-down rate change, we resort to an asteroid disrupted by PSR J0738-4042. In\nour model, the orbital angular momentum of the asteroid is assumed to be\nparallel to that of the rotating pulsar, so that the pronounced reduction in\nthe spin-down rate can be naturally explained as due to the transfer of the\nangular momentum from the disrupted material to the central pulsar. The derived\nmagnetospheric radius is about $4.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cm, which is smaller than\nthe tidal disruption radius ($4.9 \\times 10^{10}$ cm). Our model is\nself-consistent. It is shown that the variability of the spin-down rate of PSR\nJ0738-4042 can be quantitatively accounted for by the accretion from the\nasteroid disrupted by the central pulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 08:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The known implementations for optimizing the objective\nwould be costly due to the alternative optimization of two separate objectives:\noptimal cluster-membership assignment and robust subspace selection, while the\nsubstitution of one process to a faster surrogate can cause failure in\nconvergence. To address the issue, we use a simplified procedure requiring\nefficient matrix-vector multiplications for subspace update instead of solving\nan expensive eigenvector problem at each iteration, in addition to release\nnested robust PCA loops.

They showed that the\nmajority protocol can tolerate $t=O(\\sqrt n)$ adaptive corruptions, and\nconjectured that this is optimal in the adaptive setting. Lichtenstein, Linial,\nand Saks proved that the conjecture holds for protocols in which each player\nsends a single bit. Their result has been the main progress on the conjecture\nin the last 30 years.\n  In this work we revisit this question and ask: what about protocols involving\nlonger messages? Can increased communication allow for a larger fraction of\nfaulty players?\n  We introduce a model of strong adaptive corruptions, where in each round, the\nadversary sees all messages sent by honest parties and, based on the message\ncontent, decides whether to corrupt a party (and intercept his message) or not.\nWe prove that any one-round coin-flipping protocol, regardless of message\nlength, is secure against at most $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt n)$ strong adaptive\ncorruptions. Thus, increased message length does not help in this setting.\n  We then shed light on the connection between adaptive and strongly adaptive\nadversaries, by proving that for any symmetric one-round coin-flipping protocol\nsecure against $t$ adaptive corruptions, there is a symmetric one-round\ncoin-flipping protocol secure against $t$ strongly adaptive corruptions.\nReturning to the standard adaptive model, we can now prove that any symmetric\none-round protocol with arbitrarily long messages can tolerate at most\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt n)$ adaptive corruptions.\n  At the heart of our results lies a novel use of the Minimax Theorem and a new\ntechnique for converting any one-round secure protocol into a protocol with\nmessages of $polylog(n)$ bits. This technique may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 09:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 21:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-06"}

In the\nStandard Model (SM) its branching ratio for the decay into two neutrinos is\nhelicity suppressed and predicted to be $Br(K_L \\to \\nu \\bar{\\nu}) \\lesssim\n10^{-10}$. We consider several natural extensions of the SM, such as\ntwo-Higgs-doublet (2HDM), 2HDM and light scalar, and mirror dark matter models,\nthose main feature is that they allow to avoid the helicity suppression factor\nand lead to an enhanced $Br(K_L \\to invisible)$. For the decay $K_L \\to \\nu\n\\bar{\\nu}$ the smallness of the neutrino mass in the considered 2HDM model is\nexplained by the smallness of the second Higgs doublet vacuum expectation\nvalue. The small nonzero value of the second Higgs isodoublet can arise as a\nconsequence of nonzero quark condensate. We show that taking into account the\nmost stringent constraints from the $K \\to \\pi +invisible$ decay, this process\ncould be in the region of $Br(K_L \\to invisible) \\simeq 10^{-8}-10^{-6}$, which\nis experimentally accessible.

A number of large scale projects aimed at\nsequencing many human genomes are in progress. Genome sequencing also becomes\nan important aid in the personalized medicine. One of the significant side\neffects of this change is a necessity of storage and transfer of huge amounts\nof genomic data. In this paper we deal with the problem of compression of large\ncollections of complete genomic sequences. We propose an algorithm that is able\nto compress the collection of 1092 human diploid genomes about 9,500 times.\nThis result is about 4 times better than what is offered by the other existing\ncompressors. Moreover, our algorithm is very fast as it processes the data with\nspeed 200MB/s on a modern workstation. In a consequence the proposed algorithm\nallows storing the complete genomic collections at low cost, e.g., the examined\ncollection of 1092 human genomes needs only about 700MB when compressed, what\ncan be compared to about 6.7 TB of uncompressed FASTA files.

In a\nlarge project we search for the close binary sdBs with the most and the least\nmassive companions. Significantly enhancing the known sample of close binary\nsdBs we performed the first comprehensive study of this population. Triggered\nby the discovery of two sdB binaries with close brown dwarf companions in the\ncourse of this project, we were able to show that the interaction of stars with\nsubstellar companions is an important channel to form sdB stars. Finally, we\ndiscovered a unique and very compact binary system consisting of an sdB and a\nmassive white dwarf, which qualifies as progenitor candidate for a supernova\ntype Ia. In addition to that, we could connect those explosions to the class of\nhypervelocity hot subdwarf stars, which we consider as the surviving companions\nof such events.

Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of LOFAR and present\nrealistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR\nobservations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the\nlevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and\ncompared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at\n134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\\rightarrow\nI$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The\nleakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of\nthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to\nvary between 0.2-0.3\\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of\nleakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization\nleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the PSF-induced wedge and below\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\\perp$ when 70\\% of the leakage had\nbeen removed. These LOFAR results show that even a modest polarimetric\ncalibration over a field of view of $\\lesssim 4^\\circ$ in the future arrays\nlike SKA will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the\nexpected EoR signal at the scales of 0.02-1 Mpc$^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 14:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 14:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

Our simulations indicate that orbital decay of the\nSMBHs occurs more quickly when the mean density of the CND is higher, due to\nincreased dynamical friction. However, in simulations where the CND is\nfragmented in high density gaseous clumps (clumpy CND), the orbits of the SMBHs\nare erratically perturbed by the gravitational interaction with these clumps,\ndelaying, in some cases, the orbital decay of the SMBHs. The densities of these\ngaseous clumps in our simulations and in recent studies of clumpy CNDs are\nsignificantly higher than the observed density of molecular clouds in isolated\ngalaxies or ULIRGs, thus, we expect that SMBH orbits are perturbed less in real\nCNDs than in the simulated CNDs of this study and other recent studies. We also\nfind that the migration timescale has a weak dependence on the star formation\nrate of the CND. Furthermore, the migration timescale of a SMBH pair in a\nstar-forming clumpy CND is at most a factor three longer than the migration\ntimescale of a pair of SMBHs in a CND modeled with more simple gas physics.\nTherefore, we estimate that the migration timescale of the SMBHs in a clumpy\nCND is on the order of $10^7$ yrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 15:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 19:13:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 18:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 23:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}
