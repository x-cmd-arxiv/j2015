On the one hand, we show that many common\napplications using MRF segmentation energies can benefit from a high-order NC\nterm, e.g. enforcing balanced clustering of arbitrary high-dimensional image\nfeatures combining color, texture, location, depth, motion, etc. On the other\nhand, standard clustering applications can benefit from an inclusion of common\npairwise or higher-order MRF constraints, e.g. edge alignment, bin-consistency,\nlabel cost, etc. To address joint energies like NC+MRF, we propose efficient\nKernel Cut algorithms based on bound optimization.

In mesoscopic systems, however, the two-path\ninterference is easily smeared by contributions from other paths, and this\nmakes it difficult to observe the \\textit{true} transmission phase shift. To\neliminate this problem, multi-terminal Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometers have\nbeen used to derive the phase shift by assuming that the relative phase shift\nof the electrons between the two paths is simply obtained when a smooth shift\nof the AB oscillations is observed. Nevertheless the phase shifts using such a\ncriterion have sometimes been inconsistent with theory. On the other hand, we\nhave used an AB ring contacted to tunnel-coupled wires and acquired the phase\nshift consistent with theory when the two output currents through the coupled\nwires oscillate with well-defined anti-phase. Here, we investigate thoroughly\nthese two criteria used to ensure a reliable phase measurement, the anti-phase\nrelation of the two output currents and the smooth phase shift in the AB\noscillation. We confirm that the well-defined anti-phase relation ensures a\ncorrect phase measurement with a quantum two-path interference. In contrast we\nfind that even in a situation where the anti-phase relation is less\nwell-defined, the smooth phase shift in the AB oscillation can still occur but\ndoes not give the correct transmission phase due to contributions from multiple\npaths.

The accuracy of the\n$M_W$ measurement has been significantly improved over the last years, and\nfurther improvement of the experimental accuracy is expected from future LHC\nmeasurements. In order to fully exploit the precise experimental determination,\nan accurate theoretical prediction for $M_W$ in the Standard Model (SM) and\nextensions of it is of central importance.

Since most of the\ntarget WSN applications are very sensitive, security issue is one of the major\nchallenges in the deployment of WSN. One of the important building blocks in\nsecuring WSN is key management. Traditional key management solutions developed\nfor other networks are not suitable for WSN since WSN networks are resource\n(e.g. memory, computation, energy) limited. Key pre-distribution algorithms\nhave recently evolved as efficient alternatives of key management in these\nnetworks. In the key pre-distribution systems, secure communication is achieved\nbetween a pair of nodes either by the existence of a key allowing for direct\ncommunication or by a chain of keys forming a key-path between the pair. In\nthis paper, we propose methods which bring prior knowledge of network\ncharacteristics and application constraints into the design of key\npre-distribution schemes, in order to provide better security and connectivity\nwhile requiring less resources.

To model these phenomena, we introduce into evolutionary game\ntheory two broad classes of asymmetric interactions: ecological and genotypic.\nEcological asymmetry results from variation in the environments of the players,\nwhile genotypic asymmetry is a consequence of the players having differing\nbaseline genotypes.

It has long been an important tool in the study of lattices.\nMore recently, algorithms for discrete Gaussian sampling (DGS) have found many\napplications in computer science. In particular, polynomial-time algorithms for\nDGS with very high parameters $s$ have found many uses in cryptography and in\nreductions between lattice problems. And, in the past year, Aggarwal, Dadush,\nRegev, and Stephens-Davidowitz showed $2^{n+o(n)}$-time algorithms for DGS with\na much wider range of parameters and used them to obtain the current fastest\nknown algorithms for the two most important lattice problems, the Shortest\nVector Problem (SVP) and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP).\n  Motivated by its increasing importance, we investigate the complexity of DGS\nitself and its relationship to CVP and SVP. Our first result is a\npolynomial-time dimension-preserving reduction from DGS to CVP. There is a\nsimple reduction from CVP to DGS, so this shows that DGS is equivalent to CVP.\nOur second result, which we find to be more surprising, is a polynomial-time\ndimension-preserving reduction from centered DGS (the important special case\nwhen $ t = 0$) to SVP. In the other direction, there is a simple reduction from\n$\\gamma$-approximate SVP for any $\\gamma = \\Omega(\\sqrt{n/\\log n})$, and we\npresent some (relatively weak) evidence to suggest that this might be the best\nachievable approximation factor.\n  We also show that our CVP result extends to a much wider class of\ndistributions and even to other norms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 18:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 19:16:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2015 16:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 19:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-28"}

Here we show that this assumption is violated for iterative\nsifting, a sifting procedure that has been employed in some (but not all) of\nthe recently suggested QKD protocols in order to increase their efficiency. We\nshow that iterative sifting leads to two security issues: (1) some rounds are\nmore likely to be key rounds than others, (2) the public communication of past\nmeasurement choices changes this bias round by round. We analyze these two\npreviously unnoticed problems, present eavesdropping strategies that exploit\nthem, and find that the two problems are independent. We discuss some sifting\nprotocols in the literature that are immune to these problems. While some of\nthese would be inefficient replacements for iterative sifting, we find that the\nsifting subroutine of an asymptotically secure protocol suggested by Lo et al\n(2005 J. Cryptol. 18 133-65), which we call LCA sifting, has an efficiency on\npar with that of iterative sifting. One of our main results is to show that LCA\nsifting can be adapted to achieve secure sifting in the finite-key regime. More\nprecisely, we combine LCA sifting with a certain parameter estimation protocol,\nand we prove the finite-key security of this combination. Hence we propose that\nLCA sifting should replace iterative sifting in future QKD implementations.\nMore generally, we present two formal criteria for a sifting protocol that\nguarantee its finite-key security. Our criteria may guide the design of future\nprotocols and inspire a more rigorous QKD analysis, which has neglected\nsifting-related attacks so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 19:04:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 15:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 09:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

In contrast to what is generally assumed to be\nthe case for isolated dwarf galaxies, TDGs are not embedded in their own dark\nmatter (DM) sub-halo. Hence, they are more sensitive to stellar feedback and\ncould be disrupted on a short time-scale. Detailed numerical and observational\nstudies demonstrate that isolated DM-dominated dwarf galaxies can have\nlifetimes of more than 10 Gyr. For TDGs that evolve in a tidal field with\ncompressing accelerations equal to the gravitational acceleration within a DM\nsub-halo typical of an isolated dwarf galaxy, a similar survival time is\nexpected. The tidal acceleration profile depends on the virial mass of the host\ngalaxy and the distance between the TDG and its host.

Clear detection of stellar absorption lines\nallows a reliable decomposition of the observed spectra into nuclear and host\ncomponents, using spectral models of quasar and stellar radiations as well as\nemission lines from the interstellar medium. We estimate age, mass (M*), and\nvelocity dispersion (sigma*) of the host stars, the star formation rate (SFR),\nquasar luminosity, and SMBH mass (Mbh), for each object. The quasars are\npreferentially hosted by massive galaxies with M* ~ 10^{11} Msun characterized\nby stellar ages around a billion years, which coincides with the transition\nphase of normal galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence. The host\ngalaxies have relatively low SFRs and fall below the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. These facts suggest that the hosts\nhave experienced an episode of major star formation sometime in the past\nbillion years, which was subsequently quenched or suppressed. The derived Mbh -\nsigma* and Mbh - M* relations agree with our past measurements and are\nconsistent with no evolution from the local Universe. The present analysis\ndemonstrates that reliable measurements of stellar properties of quasar host\ngalaxies are possible with high-SNR fiber spectra, which will be acquired in\nlarge numbers with future powerful instruments such as the Subaru Prime Focus\nSpectrograph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 20:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 07:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 00:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

This new critical flavor\nnumber has to be distinguished from the chiral-critical flavor number, below\nwhich the Thirring model is expected to allow spontaneous chiral symmetry\nbreaking, and its existence offers a resolution to the discrepancy between\nprevious results obtained in the continuum and the lattice Thirring models.\nMoreover, we find indications for a new feature of universality: details of the\ncritical behavior can depend on additional \"spectator symmetries\" that remain\nintact across the phase transition. Implications for the physics of interacting\nfermions on the honeycomb lattice, for which our theory space provides a simple\nmodel, are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 21:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 11:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

Clocks naturally drift away from being\nsynchronized because of many physical factors. The manual way of clock\nsynchronization suffers from an inherrent propagation of the so called \"clock\ndrift\" due to \"word-of-mouth effect.\" The current standard way of automated\nclock synchronization is either via radio band transmission of the global clock\nor via the software-based Network Time Protocol (NTP). Synchronization via\nradio band transmission suffers from the wave transmission delay, while the\nclient-server-based NTP does not scale to increased number of clients as well\nas to unforeseen server overload conditions (e.g., flash crowd and time-of-day\neffects). Further, the trivial running time of NTP for synchronizing an\n$N$-node network, where each node is a clock and the NTP server follows a\nsingle-port communication model, is~$\\bigO(N)$. We introduce in this paper a\n$\\bigO(\\log N)$ time for synchronizing the clocks in exchange for an increase\nof $\\bigO(N)$ in space complexity, though through creative \"tweaking,\" we later\nreduced the space requirement to~$\\bigO(1)$.

All $N$~nodes\ncommunicate via a single-port duplex channel model. Theoretically, this\nsynchronization protocol allows for $N(\\log N)^{-1} - 1$ more synchronizations\nthan the client-server-based one.

Here I report ensemble integrations of the full equations of motion of\nthe eight planets and Pluto over 5 Gyr, including contributions from general\nrelativity. The results show that different numerical algorithms lead to\nstatistically different results for the evolution of Mercury's eccentricity\n(eM).

For example, the probability for eM to increase beyond\n0.53 over 500 Myr is >90% (Jacobi) vs. only 40-55% (heliocentric).

The main goal of this work is to develop a model for multi-sensor\nsignals such as MEG or EEG signals, that accounts for the inter-trial\nvariability, suitable for corresponding binary classification problems. An\nimportant constraint is that the model be simple enough to handle small size\nand unbalanced datasets, as often encountered in BCI type experiments.\nApproach. The method involves linear mixed effects statistical model, wavelet\ntransform and spatial filtering, and aims at the characterization of localized\ndiscriminant features in multi-sensor signals. After discrete wavelet transform\nand spatial filtering, a projection onto the relevant wavelet and spatial\nchannels subspaces is used for dimension reduction. The projected signals are\nthen decomposed as the sum of a signal of interest (i.e. discriminant) and\nbackground noise, using a very simple Gaussian linear mixed model. Main\nresults. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, the corresponding parameter\nestimation problem is simplified. Robust estimates of class-covariance matrices\nare obtained from small sample sizes and an effective Bayes plug-in classifier\nis derived. The approach is applied to the detection of error potentials in\nmultichannel EEG data, in a very unbalanced situation (detection of rare\nevents). Classification results prove the relevance of the proposed approach in\nsuch a context. Significance. The combination of linear mixed model, wavelet\ntransform and spatial filtering for EEG classification is, to the best of our\nknowledge, an original approach, which is proven to be effective.

These results demonstrate\nthe importance of direct-space and real-time imaging of skyrmion domains for\naddressing both their long-range topology and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 10:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 11:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}

Tidal\ndissipation inside the fluid layers of celestial bodies are intrinsically\nlinked to the dynamics and the physical properties of the latter. This complex\ndependence must be characterized. We compute the tidal kinetic energy\ndissipated by viscous friction and thermal diffusion in a rotating local fluid\nCartesian section of a star/planet/moon submitted to a periodic tidal forcing.\nThe properties of tidal gravito-inertial waves excited by the perturbation are\nderived analytically as explicit functions of the tidal frequency and local\nfluid parameters (i.e. the rotation, the buoyancy frequency characterizing the\nentropy stratification, viscous and thermal diffusivities) for periodic normal\nmodes. The sensitivity of the resulting possibly highly resonant dissipation\nfrequency-spectra to a control parameter of the system is either important or\nnegligible depending on the position in the regime diagram relevant for\nplanetary and stellar interiors.

Like\nregular empirical risk minimization (ERM), it aims to learn a classifier with a\nlow error rate, and at the same time, for the predictions of the classifier to\nbe independent of sensitive features, such as gender, religion, race, and\nethnicity. Existing methods can achieve low dependencies on given samples, but\nthis is not guaranteed on unseen samples. The existing fairness-aware learning\nalgorithms employ different dependency measures, and each algorithm is\nspecifically designed for a particular one. Such diversity makes it difficult\nto theoretically analyze and compare them. In this paper, we propose a general\nframework for fairness-aware learning that uses f-divergences and that covers\nmost of the dependency measures employed in the existing methods. We introduce\na way to estimate the f-divergences that allows us to give a unified analysis\nfor the upper bound of the estimation error; this bound is tighter than that of\nthe existing convergence rate analysis of the divergence estimation. With our\ndivergence estimate, we propose a fairness-aware learning algorithm, and\nperform a theoretical analysis of its generalization error. Our analysis\nreveals that, under mild assumptions and even with enforcement of fairness, the\ngeneralization error of our method is $O(\\sqrt{1/n})$, which is the same as\nthat of the regular ERM. In addition, and more importantly, we show that, for\nany f-divergence, the upper bound of the estimation error of the divergence is\n$O(\\sqrt{1/n})$.

Thus, if large\nparts of an instance consist of such subsystems, then this yields a substantial\nsize reduction. We complement this by proving that relaxations to the\nconsidered structures, e.g., larger boundaries of the subsystems, allow\nworst-case lower bounds against kernelization.

These results provide a\nmicroscopic perspective on macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) for the weakly\nasymmetric case: It turns out that the predictions of MFT remain valid in the\nnon-rigorous limit of finite asymmetry. In addition, the microscopic results\nyield the correct scaling factor for the asymmetry that MFT cannot predict.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 14:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

When a liquid is cooled to form a glass, however, no\nnoticeable structural change marks the glass transition. Indeed, characteristic\nfeatures of glassy dynamics that appear below an onset temperature, T_0, are\nqualitatively captured by mean field theory, which assumes uniform local\nstructure at all temperatures. Even studies of more realistic systems have\nfound only weak correlations between structure and dynamics. This raises the\nquestion: is structure important to glassy dynamics in three dimensions? Here,\nwe answer this question affirmatively by using machine learning methods to\nidentify a new field, that we call softness, which characterizes local\nstructure and is strongly correlated with rearrangement dynamics. We find that\nthe onset of glassy dynamics at T_0 is marked by the onset of correlations\nbetween softness (i.e. structure) and dynamics. Moreover, we use softness to\nconstruct a simple model of slow glassy relaxation that is in excellent\nagreement with our simulation results, showing that a theory of the evolution\nof softness in time would constitute a theory of glassy dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 14:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 02:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 04:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

One important challenge to the\nfurther development of this material for photovoltaics (PV) is to reliably\nsynthesize films with carrier density less than or equal to 10^17\nelectrons/cm^3. In this work, we perform a systematic annealing study on\ncompositionally-graded Zn-Sn-N thin films to determine the effects on carrier\ndensity and transport of such post-growth treatment. We find that annealing up\nto 6 hr under an activated nitrogen atmosphere results in a reduction in\ncarrier density by ~80% for zinc-rich films, and by ~50% for stoichiometric\nfilms. However, we also find that annealing reduces mobility as a function of\nincreasing annealing time. This result suggests that initial film disorder\nhampers the benefits to film quality that should have been gained through\nannealing. This finding highlights that carefully managed initial growth\nconditions will be necessary to obtain PV-quality ZnSnN2 absorber films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 15:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Values for the\nuniversal scaling dimensions are compared with other nonperturbative approaches\nto gravity in four dimensions, and specifically to the conjectured value for\nthe universal critical exponent $\\nu =1 /3$. It is found that the lattice\nresults are generally consistent with gravitational anti-screening, which would\nimply a slow increase in the strength of the gravitational coupling with\ndistance, and here detailed estimates for exponents and amplitudes\ncharacterizing this slow rise are presented. Furthermore, it is shown that in\nthe lattice approach (as for gauge theories) the quantum theory is highly\nconstrained, and eventually by virtue of scaling depends on a rather small set\nof physical parameters. Arguments are given in support of the statement that\nthe fundamental reference scale for the growth of the gravitational coupling\n$G$ with distance is represented by the observed scaled cosmological constant\n$\\lambda$, which in gravity acts as an effective nonperturbative infrared\ncutoff. In the vacuum condensate picture a fundamental relationship emerges\nbetween the scale characterizing the running of $G$ at large distances, the\nmacroscopic scale for the curvature as described by the observed cosmological\nconstant, and the behavior of invariant gravitational correlation functions at\nlarge distances. Overall, the lattice results suggest that the infrared slow\ngrowth of $G$ with distance should become observable only on very large\ndistance scales, comparable to $\\lambda$.

The variety of materials\nto be reconstructed is broader than medical x-ray imaging. Presence of high\nattenuating materials such as metal may cause artifacts if analytical\nreconstruction methods are used. Statistical modeling and the resultant\niterative algorithms are known to reduce these artifacts and present good\nquantitative accuracy in estimates of linear attenuation coefficients. However,\niterative algorithms may require computations in order to achieve\nquantitatively accurate results. For the case of baggage scanning, in order to\nprovide fast accurate inspection throughput, they must be accelerated\ndrastically. There are many approaches proposed in the literature to increase\nspeed of convergence. This paper presents a new method that estimates the\nwavelet coefficients of the images in the discrete wavelet transform domain\ninstead of the image space itself. Initially, surrogate functions are created\naround approximation coefficients only. As the iterations proceed, the wavelet\ntree on which the updates are made is expanded based on a criterion and detail\ncoefficients at each level are updated and the tree is expanded this way. For\nexample, in the smooth regions of the image the detail coefficients are not\nupdated while the coefficients that represent the high-frequency component\naround edges are being updated, thus saving time by focusing computations where\nthey are needed. This approach is implemented on real data from a SureScan (TM)\nx1000 Explosive Detection System and compared to straightforward implementation\nof the unregularized alternating minimization of O'Sullivan and Benac [1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2015 22:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}
