In this paper\nwe explore the computational aspects of a possible similar scheme for assigning\nteachers to schools. Our model is motivated by a particular characteristic of\nthe education system in many countries where each teacher specializes in two\nsubjects. We seek stable matchings, which ensure that no teacher and school\nhave the incentive to deviate from their assignments. Indeed we propose two\nstability definitions depending on the precise format of schools' preferences.\nIf the schools' ranking of applicants is independent of their subjects of\nspecialism, we show that the problem of deciding whether a stable matching\nexists is NP-complete, even if there are only three subjects, unless there are\nmaster lists of applicants or of schools. By contrast, if the schools may order\napplicants differently in each of their specialization subjects, the problem of\ndeciding whether a stable matching exists is NP-complete even in the presence\nof subject-specific master lists plus a master list of schools. Finally, we\nprove a strong inapproximability result for the problem of finding a matching\nwith the minimum number of blocking pairs with respect to both stability\ndefinitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 16:02:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 10:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

The public health response was\nchallenged by difficulties with disease surveillance, which impacted subsequent\nanalysis and decision-making regarding optimal interventions. We developed a\nstage-structured model of Ebola virus disease (EVD). A key feature of the model\nis that it includes a generalized correction term accounting for factors such\nas the fraction of cases reported and fraction of the population at risk (e.g.\ndue to contact patterns, interventions, spatiotemporal spread, pre-existing\nimmunity, asymptomatic cases, etc.). We generated a range of short-term\nforecasts for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which we then validated using\nsubsequent data. We also used the model to examine the uncertainty in the\nrelative contributions to transmission by the different stages of infection\n(early, late, and funeral). We found that a wide range of forecasted\ntrajectories fit approximately equally well to the early data. However, by\nincluding the correction factor term the best-fit models correctly forecasted\nEVD activity for all three countries, both individually and for all countries\ncombined. In particular, the model correctly forecasted the slow-down in\nLiberia, as well as the continued exponential growth in Sierra Leone through\nNovember 2014. Parameter unidentifiability issues hindered estimation of the\nrelative contributions of each stage of transmission from incidence and deaths\ndata alone, which poses a challenge in determining optimal intervention\nstrategies, and underscores the need for additional data collection.

It has a mass of\n$1.535_{-0.054}^{+0.066}$ Msun, a radius of $1.732_{-0.045}^{+0.043}$ Rsun, and\nis the fifth most massive, fifth hottest, and the ninth brightest star known to\nhost a transiting planet. It is also the brightest star around which KELT has\ndiscovered a transiting planet. Thus, KELT-7b is an ideal target for detailed\ncharacterization given its relatively low surface gravity, high equilibrium\ntemperature, and bright host star. The rapid rotation of the star ($73 \\pm 0.5$\nkm/s) results in a Rossiter-McLaughlin effect with an unusually large amplitude\nof several hundred m/s. We find that the orbit normal of the planet is likely\nto be well-aligned with the stellar spin axis, with a projected spin-orbit\nalignment of $\\lambda=9.7 \\pm 5.2$ degrees. This is currently the second most\nrapidly rotating star to have a reflex signal (and thus mass determination) due\nto a planetary companion measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 16:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 17:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

According to Aristotle's relational theory, time is a measure of change\nand does not exist on its own. In contrast, quantum mechanics, just like\nNewtonian mechanics, is equipped with a master clock that dictates the\nevolution of a system. This clock is infinitely precise and tacitly supplied\nfree of charge from outside physics. Not only does this absolute time make it\nnotoriously difficult to make a consistent theory of quantum gravity, it is\nalso the underlying problem in establishing the second law. Indeed, contrary to\nour experience, the Wheeler-deWitt equation --a canonical quantization of\ngeneral relativity-- predicts a static universe. Similarly, when simply\nconcerned with the dynamics of a closed quantum system, there is no second law\nbecause the Von Neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations.\nHere we are mainly concerned with the latter problem and we show that it can be\nresolved by attributing a minimal amount of resources to the measurement of\ntime. Although there is an absolute time in quantum mechanics, an observer can\nonly establish a time by measuring a clock. For a local measurement, the\nminimal entropy production is equal to the number of ticks. This lower bound is\nattained by a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 16:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

In\norder to maintain the same {\\it relative} mass reach for NP, $M/{\\sqrt s}$, as\n$\\sqrt s$ increases, Richter recently reminded us that the required integrated\nluminosity obtainable at future hadron colliders (FHC) must grow rapidly, $\\sim\ns$, in the limit of naive scaling. This would imply, eg, a $\\sim 50$-fold\nincrease in the required integrated luminosity when going from the 14 TeV LHC\nto a FHC with $\\sqrt s=100$ TeV, an increase that would prove quite challenging\non many different fronts. In this paper we point out, due to the scaling\nviolations associated with the evolution of the parton density functions (PDFs)\nand the running of the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s$, that the actual luminosity\nnecessary in order to maintain any fixed value of the relative mass reach is\nsomewhat greater than this scaling result indicates. However, the actual values\nof the required luminosity scaling are found to be dependent upon the detailed\nnature of the NP being considered.

Because the word \"community\" is an ambiguous term, it is\nnecessary to quantify what it means to be a community within the context of a\nparticular type of problem. Our interpretation is that this quantification must\nbe done at a minimum of three scales. These scales are at the level of:\nindividual nodes, individual communities, and the network as a whole. Each of\nthese scales involves quantitative features of community structure that are not\naccurately represented at the other scales, but are important for defining a\nparticular notion of community. Our work focuses on providing sensible ways to\nquantify what is desired at each of these scales for a notion of community\napplicable to social networks, and using these models to develop a community\ndetection algorithm. Appealing features of our approach is that it naturally\nallows for nodes to belong to multiple communities, and is computationally\nefficient for large networks with low overall edge density. The scaling of the\nalgorithm is $O(N~\\overline{k^2} + \\overline{N_{com}^2})$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of nodes in the network, $\\overline{N_{com}^2}$ is the average squared\ncommunity size, and $\\overline{k^2}$ is the expected value of a node's degree\nsquared. Although our work focuses on developing a computationally efficient\nalgorithm for overlapping community detection in the context of social\nnetworks, our primary contribution is developing a methodology that is highly\nmodular and can easily be adapted to target specific notions of community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 20:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in\nfirst-ascent red giants like 2M19411367+4003382 requires deep mixing into the\nstellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12C/13C, which\nis possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has\nabnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the\ncluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude\ndiagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have\nmeasured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison\nstars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree\nof stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface\ngravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall\nchemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly\nlower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very\nlow mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster\nmembership, the 12C/13C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with\nstandard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and\ninconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 20:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Although they are not fundamental particles, such quasiparticles do\nconstitute the most basic description of the excited states of the \"vacuum\" in\nwhich they reside. In this regard the magnetic textures of the excited states\nof spin ices, magnetic pyrochlore oxides with dominant Ising interactions, are\nproposed to be modeled as effective magnetic charge monopoles. Recent inelastic\nneutron scattering experiments have established the pyrochlore material\nYb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ (YbTO) as a quantum spin ice, where in addition to the Ising\ninteractions there are substantial transverse terms that may induce quantum\ndynamics and - in principle - coherent monopole motion.

We find that the\nform of the susceptibility is consistent with monopole motion and a magnetic\nmonopole conductivity can be defined and measured. Using the unique phase\nsensitive capabilities of these techniques, we observe a sign change in the\nreactive part of the magnetic response. In generic models of monopole motion\nthis is only possible through introducing inertial effects, e.g. a mass\ndependent term, to the equations of motion. Analogous to conventional electric\ncharge systems, measurement of the conductivity's spectral weight allows us to\nderive a value for the magnetic monopole mass, which we find to be\napproximately 1800 electron masses.

However, the efficacy of the process in a\ncosmological context remains unclear due to excessive radiative losses during\nthe shock propagation. To better understand the impact of SN explosions on the\nevolution of galaxies, we perform a suite of high-resolution (12 pc), zoom-in\ncosmological simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy at z=3 with adaptive mesh\nrefinement. We find that SN explosions can efficiently regulate star formation,\nleading to the stellar mass and metallicity consistent with the observed\nmass-metallicity relation and stellar mass-halo mass relation at z~3. This is\nachieved by making three important changes to the classical feedback scheme: i)\nthe different phases of SN blast waves are modelled directly by injecting\nradial momentum expected at each stage, ii) the realistic time delay of SNe,\ncommencing at as early as 3 Myr, is required to disperse very dense gas before\na runaway collapse sets in at the galaxy centre via mergers of gas clumps, and\niii) a non-uniform density distribution of the ISM is taken into account below\nthe computational grid scale for the cell in which SN explodes. The last\ncondition is motivated by the fact that our simulations still do not resolve\nthe detailed structure of a turbulent ISM in which the fast outflows can\npropagate along low-density channels. The simulated galaxy with the SN feedback\nmodel shows strong outflows, which carry approximately ten times larger mass\nthan star formation rate, as well as smoothly rising circular velocity.

In the gauge theory dyonic region the spectral expansions are\ndivergent, and indeed are not Borel-summable, so they are more properly\ndescribed by resurgent trans-series in which perturbative and non-perturbative\neffects are deeply entwined. In the gauge theory electric region the spectral\nexpansions are convergent, but nevertheless there are non-perturbative effects\ndue to poles in the expansion coefficients, and which we associate with\nworldline instantons. This provides a concrete analog of a phenomenon found\nrecently by Drukker, Marino and Putrov in the large N expansion of the ABJM\nmatrix model, in which non-perturbative effects are related to complex\nspace-time instantons.

The goal of segmentation algorithms is to accurately\nassign object labels to each image location. However, image-noise, shortcomings\nof algorithms, and image ambiguities cause uncertainty in label assignment.\nEstimating the uncertainty in label assignment is important in multiple\napplication domains, such as segmenting tumors from medical images for\nradiation treatment planning. One way to estimate these uncertainties is\nthrough the computation of posteriors of Bayesian models, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive for many practical applications. On the other hand,\nmost computationally efficient methods fail to estimate label uncertainty. We\ntherefore propose in this paper the Active Mean Fields (AMF) approach, a\ntechnique based on Bayesian modeling that uses a mean-field approximation to\nefficiently compute a segmentation and its corresponding uncertainty. Based on\na variational formulation, the resulting convex model combines any\nlabel-likelihood measure with a prior on the length of the segmentation\nboundary. A specific implementation of that model is the Chan-Vese segmentation\nmodel (CV), in which the binary segmentation task is defined by a Gaussian\nlikelihood and a prior regularizing the length of the segmentation boundary.\nFurthermore, the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the AMF model are\nequivalent to those of the popular Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model for image\ndenoising. Solutions to the AMF model can thus be implemented by directly\nutilizing highly-efficient ROF solvers on log-likelihood ratio fields. We\nqualitatively assess the approach on synthetic data as well as on real natural\nand medical images.

A total of 50 molecular lines are detected over a 13 GHz bandwidth\nimaged in the 3 mm band. Unambiguous identifications are assigned for 27 lines.\nBased on the measured high CO/C$^{17}$O isotopic line ratio ($\\gtrsim$350), we\nshow that $^{12}$CO(1-0) has moderate optical depths. A comparison of the HCN\nand HCO$^{+}$ with their $^{13}$C-substituted isotopologues shows that the\nHCN(1-0) and HCO$^{+}$(1-0) lines have optical depths at least comparable to\nCO(1-0). H$^{13}$CN/H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (and H$^{13}$CN/HN$^{13}$C) line ratios\nprovide tighter constraints on dense gas properties in this starburst. SiO has\nelevated abundances across the nucleus. HNCO has the most distinctive\nmorphology of all the bright lines, with its global luminosity dominated by the\nouter parts of the central region. The dramatic variation seen in the HNCO/SiO\nline ratio suggests that some of the chemical signatures of shocked gas are\nbeing erased in the presence of dominating central radiation fields (traced by\nC$_{2}$H and CN). High density molecular gas tracers (including HCN, HCO$^+$,\nand CN) are detected at the base of the molecular outflow. We also detect\nhydrogen $\\beta$ recombination lines that, like their $\\alpha$ counterparts,\nshow compact, centrally peaked morphologies, distinct from the molecular gas\ntracers.

We\npresent Hidden Community Detection HICODE, an algorithm template that\nidentifies both the strong, dominant community structure as well as the weaker,\nhidden community structure in networks. HICODE begins by first applying an\nexisting community detection algorithm to a network, and then removing the\nstructure of the detected communities from the network.

Feature-oriented scanning (FOS)\nmethodology is used as a basis for implementation of the distributed\ncalibration permitting to exclude in situ the negative influence of thermal\ndrift, creep and hysteresis on the obtained results.

To maintain a defined thermodynamic state,\nthermalization of the fluid is often required for certain MPC variants. We\ninvestigate the influence of three thermostats on the non-equilibrium\nproperties of a MPC fluid under shear or in Poiseuille flow. In all cases, the\nlocal velocities are scaled by a factor, which is either determined via a local\nsimple scaling approach (LSS), a Monte Carlo-like procedure (MCS), or by the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energy (MBS). We find that the\nvarious scal- ing schemes leave the flow profile unchanged and maintain the\nlocal temperature well. The fluid viscosities extracted from the various\nsimulations are in close agreement. Moreover, the numerically determined\nviscosities are in remarkably good agreement with the respective theoretically\npredicted values. At equilibrium, the calculation of the dynamic structure\nfactor reveals that the MBS method closely resembles an isothermal ensemble,\nwhereas the MCS procedure exhibits signatures of an adi- abatic system at\nlarger collision-time steps. Since the velocity distribution of the LSS\napproach is non-Gaussian, we recommend to apply the MBS thermostat, which has\nbeen shown to produce the correct velocity distribution even under\nnon-equilibrium conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 08:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

For the low\nEarth orbit, radar telescopes are the workhorse for this task, especially due\nto their continuous availability. However, optical observation methods can\ndeliver complementary information, especially towards high accuracy\nmeasurements. Passive-optical observations are inexpensive and can yield very\nprecise information about the apparent position of the object in the sky via\ncomparison with background stars. However, the object's distance from the\nobserver is not readily accessible, which constitutes a major drawback of this\napproach for the precise calculation of the orbital elements. Two experimental\nmethods have been devised to overcome this problem: Using two observatories a\nfew kilometres apart, strictly simultaneous observations of the same object\nyield an accurate, instantaneous 3D position determination through measurement\nof the parallax. If only one observatory is available, a pulsed laser can be\nused in addition to the passive-optical channel to measure the distance to the\nobject, in a similar fashion as used by the satellite laser ranging community.\nHowever, compared to conventional laser ranging, a stronger laser and more\nelaborate tracking algorithms are necessary. The two approaches can also be\ncombined by illuminating the object with a pulsed laser from one observatory\nand measuring the return times at both observatories.

The\nfirst one, referred to as the independent Metropolis-Hastings-Klein (MHK)\nalgorithm, tries to establish a Markov chain through an independent proposal\ndistribution. We show that the Markov chain arising from the independent MHK\nalgorithm is uniformly ergodic, namely, it converges to the stationary\ndistribution exponentially fast regardless of the initial state. Moreover, the\nrate of convergence is explicitly calculated in terms of the theta series,\nleading to a predictable mixing time. In order to further exploit the\nconvergence potential, a symmetric Metropolis-Klein (SMK) algorithm is\nproposed.

Pre-melting of the planetesimals by radioactive decay of 26Al would\nhelp producing sprays of melt even at relatively low impact velocity.

Specifically, we design a $1/e$-competitive\nalgorithm for the unconstrained case in which the algorithm may hold any subset\nof the elements, and constant competitive ratio algorithms for the case where\nthe algorithm may hold at most $k$ elements in its solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 13:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

Databases are ubiquitous in software and testing of programs\nmanipulating databases is thus essential to enhance the reliability of\nsoftware. This work proposes and evaluates experimentally a symbolic ex-\necution algorithm for constraint-based testing of database programs. First, we\ndescribe SimpleDB, a formal language which offers a minimal and well-defined\nsyntax and seman- tics, to model common interaction scenarios between pro-\ngrams and databases. Secondly, we detail the proposed al- gorithm for symbolic\nexecution of SimpleDB models. This algorithm considers a SimpleDB program as a\nsequence of operations over a set of relational variables, modeling both the\ndatabase tables and the program variables. By inte- grating this relational\nmodel of the program with classical static symbolic execution, the algorithm\ncan generate a set of path constraints for any finite path to test in the\ncontrol- flow graph of the program.

Most popular methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling,\nperform poorly on strongly multi-modal probability distributions, rarely\njumping between modes or settling on just one mode without finding others.\nParallel tempering addresses this problem by sampling simultaneously with\nseparate Markov chains from tempered versions of the target distribution with\nreduced contrast levels. Gaps between modes can be traversed at higher\ntemperatures, while individual modes can be efficiently explored at lower\ntemperatures. In this paper, we investigate how one might choose the ladder of\ntemperatures to achieve more efficient sampling, as measured by the\nautocorrelation time of the sampler. In particular, we present a simple,\neasily-implemented algorithm for dynamically adapting the temperature\nconfiguration of a sampler while sampling. This algorithm dynamically adjusts\nthe temperature spacing to achieve a uniform rate of exchanges between chains\nat neighbouring temperatures. We compare the algorithm to conventional\ngeometric temperature configurations on a number of test distributions and on\nan astrophysical inference problem, reporting efficiency gains by a factor of\n1.2-2.5 over a well-chosen geometric temperature configuration and by a factor\nof 1.5-5 over a poorly chosen configuration. On all of these problems a sampler\nusing the dynamical adaptations to achieve uniform acceptance ratios between\nneighbouring chains outperforms one that does not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 15:09:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 23:04:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 18:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

The effective Hamiltonian model of the composite system is\nexpressed by only exchange interactions between pairs of spins.
