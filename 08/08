To circumvent this, the current\ncommunication first defines the RTS of an inefficient DMU at its projected\npoint that lies in the relative interior of the minimum face.

Several different MA methods have been proposed and\napplied in the literature, but it remains unclear how they perform with respect\nto each other. In this paper we study the normal, Poisson, log-normal and\ncentral-moment-neglect MAs by applying them to understand the stochastic\nproperties of chemical systems whose deterministic rate equations show the\nproperties of bistability, ultrasensitivity and oscillatory behaviour. Our\nresults suggest that the normal MA is favourable over the other studied MAs. In\nparticular we found that (i) the size of the region of parameter space where a\nclosure gives physically meaningful results, e.g. positive mean and variance,\nis considerably larger for the normal closure than for the other three\nclosures; (ii) the accuracy of the predictions of the four closures (relative\nto simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm) is comparable in\nthose regions of parameter space where all closures give physically meaningful\nresults; (iii) the Poisson and log-normal MAs are not uniquely defined for\nsystems involving conservation laws in molecule numbers. We also describe the\nnew software package MOCA which enables the automated numerical analysis of\nvarious MA methods in a graphical user interface and which was used to perform\nthe comparative analysis presented in this paper. MOCA allows the user to\ndevelop novel closure methods and can treat polynomial, non-polynomial, as well\nas time-dependent propensity functions, thus being applicable to virtually any\nchemical reaction system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 16:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 11:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

This $V_e$ field reflects population-level\nneural activity, but does it modulate neural dynamics and the function of\nneural circuits? We provide a cable theory framework to study how a bundle of\nmodel neurons generates $V_e$ and how this $V_e$ feeds back and influences\nmembrane potential ($V_m$). We find that these \"ephaptic interactions\" are\nsmall but not negligible. The model neural population can generate $V_e$ with\nmillivolt-scale amplitude and this $V_e$ perturbs the $V_m$ of \"nearby\" cables\nand effectively increases their electrotonic length. After using passive cable\ntheory to systematically study ephaptic coupling, we explore a test case: the\nmedial superior olive (MSO) in the auditory brainstem. The MSO is a possible\nlocus of ephaptic interactions: sounds evoke large $V_e$ in vivo in this\nnucleus (millivolt-scale). The $V_e$ response is thought to be generated by MSO\nneurons that perform a known neuronal computation with submillisecond temporal\nprecision (coincidence detection to encode sound source location).

The resulting \"influence graph\" model is Markovian, in that\ncomponent outage probabilities depend only on the outages that occurred in the\nprior generation. To validate the model we compare the distribution of cascade\nsizes resulting from $n-2$ contingencies in a $2896$ branch test case to\ncascade sizes in the influence graph. The two distributions are remarkably\nsimilar. In addition, we derive an equation with which one can quickly identify\nmodifications to the proposed system that will substantially reduce cascade\npropagation. With this equation one can quickly identify critical components\nthat can be improved to substantially reduce the risk of large cascading\nblackouts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 18:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 16:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-14"}

There\nremains hence a great need to develop general purpose preconditioners whose\ncost scales well with the matrix size $N$. In this paper, we propose a\npreconditioner with broad applicability and with cost $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ for\ndense matrices, when the matrix is given by a smooth kernel. Extending the\nmethod using the same framework to general $\\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices is\nrelatively straightforward. These preconditioners have a controlled accuracy\n(machine accuracy can be achieved if needed) and scale linearly with $N$. They\nare based on an approximate direct solve of the system. The linear scaling of\nthe algorithm is achieved by means of two key ideas. First, the\n$\\mathcal{H}^2$-structure of the dense matrix is exploited to obtain an\nextended sparse system of equations. Second, fill-ins arising when performing\nthe elimination are compressed as low-rank matrices if they correspond to\nwell-separated interactions. This ensures that the sparsity pattern of the\nextended sparse matrix is preserved throughout the elimination, hence resulting\nin a very efficient algorithm with $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log(1/\\varepsilon)^2 )$\ncomputational cost and $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log 1/\\varepsilon )$ memory requirement,\nfor an error tolerance $0 < \\varepsilon < 1$. The solver is inexact, although\nthe error can be controlled and made as small as needed. These solvers are\nrelated to ILU in the sense that the fill-in is controlled. However, in ILU,\nmost of the fill-in is simply discarded whereas here it is approximated using\nlow-rank blocks, with a prescribed tolerance. Numerical examples are discussed\nto demonstrate the linear scaling of the method and to illustrate its\neffectiveness as a preconditioner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 23:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 18:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

Since the emergence\nof BCS, dictionary learning, a.k.a. sparse coding, has been studied as a matrix\nfactorization problem where its sample complexity, uniqueness and\nidentifiability have been addressed thoroughly. However, in spite of the strong\nconnections between BCS and sparse coding, recent results from the sparse\ncoding problem area have not been exploited within the context of BCS. In\nparticular, prior BCS efforts have focused on learning constrained and complete\ndictionaries that limit the scope and utility of these efforts.

Electronic cigarettes have been heavily\nmarketed across Twitter feeds, offering discounts, \"kid-friendly\" flavors,\nalgorithmically generated false testimonials, and free samples. Methods:All\nelectronic cigarette keyword related tweets from a 10% sample of Twitter\nspanning January 2012 through December 2014 (approximately 850,000 total\ntweets) were identified and categorized as Automated or Organic by combining a\nkeyword classification and a machine trained Human Detection algorithm.

Here we present the Causal Pixel Model (CPM) for\nKepler data, a data-driven model intended to capture variability but preserve\ntransit signals. The CPM works at the pixel level so that it can capture very\nfine-grained information about the variation of the spacecraft. The CPM\npredicts each target pixel value from a large number of pixels of other stars\nsharing the instrument variabilities while not containing any information on\npossible transits in the target star. In addition, we use the target star's\nfuture and past (auto-regression). By appropriately separating, for each data\npoint, the data into training and test sets, we ensure that information about\nany transit will be perfectly isolated from the model. The method has four\nhyper-parameters (the number of predictor stars, the auto-regressive window\nsize, and two L2-regularization amplitudes for model components), which we set\nby cross-validation. We determine a generic set of hyper-parameters that works\nwell for most of the stars and apply the method to a corresponding set of\ntarget stars. We find that we can consistently outperform (for the purposes of\nexoplanet detection) the Kepler Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC) method for\nexoplanet discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 04:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 07:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

This $R$-symmetry allows a subset of trilinear\n$R$-parity violating interactions, which determine the collider phenomenology\nof this model in a significant way. The gauginos are Dirac particles and\ngluinos are relatively heavy in this class of models. The model contains a\nright handed neutrino superfield, which gives a tree level mass to one of the\nactive neutrinos. An order one neutrino Yukawa coupling also helps enhance the\nHiggs boson mass at the tree level and results in a very light bino-like\nneutralino ($\\widetilde \\chi_2^0$) with mass around a few hundred MeV, which is\na carrier of missing (transverse) energy (\\met).

Hence, they need to first harvest energy from the\nradio-frequency (RF) signals radiated by the AP in the downlink (DL) before\ninformation transmission in the uplink (UL). Inspired by the recently proposed\nharvest-then-transmit (HTT) and harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocols, we\ndevelop a new adaptive transmission (AT) protocol. In the proposed protocol, at\nthe beginning of each transmission block, the AP charges the source. AP and\nsource then perform channel estimation to acquire the channel state information\n(CSI) between them. Based on the CSI estimate, the AP adaptively chooses the\nsource to perform UL information transmission either directly or cooperatively\nwith the relay.

In this way, different function\nsplitting scheme could be incorporated into the radio access network to satisfy\nthe bandwidth and latency requirements of ultra-dense networks, control/data\n(C/D) decoupling architectures, and delay-sensitive communications.

Following this analysis, we propose a\nreference architecture for designing the renovated FH.

One of\nthe most common methodologies based on CORINE land cover (Coordination of\nInformation on the Environment) data, which classifies natural cover according\nto a small number of categories. This method produces generalizations about the\ninventoried areas, resulting in the loss of important floristic and structural\ninformation about vegetation types present (such as palm groves, tall dense\nmangroves, and dense forests). This classification forfeits relevant\ninformation on sites with high heterogeneity and diversity. Especially in the\ntropics, simplification of coverage types reaches its maximum level with the\nuse of deforestation analysis, particularly when it is reduced to the two\nclasses of forests and nonforests. As this paper demonstrates, these results\nhave considerable consequences for political efforts to conserve the\nbiodiversity of megadiverse countries. We designed a new methodological\napproach that incorporates biological distinctiveness combined with\nphytosociological classification of vegetation and its relation to physical\nfeatures. This approach is based on parameters obtained through canonical\ncorrespondence analysis on a fuzzy logic model, which are used to construct\nmultiple coverage maps. This tool is useful for monitoring and analyzing\nvegetation dynamics, since it maintains the typological integrity of a\ncartographic series. The methodology creates cartographic series congruent in\ntime and scale, can be applied to multiple and varied satellite inputs, and\nalways evaluates the same model parameters.

Five curves, a circle, ellipse, parabola, catenary and cycloid, are\nanalyzed in detail. Several interesting features appear, for instance, in the\nabsense of friction, a particle moving on a catenary leaves the surface just\nbefore touching the floor, and in the case of the parabola, the particle never\nleaves the surface, regardless of the friction. A phase diagram that separates\nthe conditions that lead to a particle stopping in the surface to those that\nlead to a particle departuring from the surface is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 23:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

We propose a more straightforward and widely applicable method to\nquantify motion blur based on the width of the moving object. We thus compare\nvarious types of displays objectively. A perceptual experiment was conducted to\nvalidate the proposed method. We test varying motion velocities for nine\ncommercial displays. We compare the three motion blur evaluation methods\n(simulation, human perception, and our method) using z-scores. Our comparisons\nindicate that our method accurately characterizes motion blur for various\ndisplay types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2015 11:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}
