A signed graph is\nbalanced if there is a bipartition of its vertex set such that an edge has sign\n$-$ if and only if its endpoints are in different parts. The Edwards-Erd\\\"os\nbound states that every graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges has a balanced\nsubgraph with at least $\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{n-1}{4}$ edges. In the Signed Max Cut\nAbove Tight Lower Bound (Signed Max Cut ATLB) problem, given a signed graph $G$\nand a parameter $k$, the question is whether $G$ has a balanced subgraph with\nat least $\\frac{m}{2}+\\frac{n-1}{4}+\\frac{k}{4}$ edges. This problem\ngeneralizes Max Cut Above Tight Lower Bound, for which a kernel with $O(k^5)$\nvertices was given by Crowston et al. [ICALP 2012, Algorithmica 2015]. Crowston\net al. [TCS 2013] improved this result by providing a kernel with $O(k^3)$\nvertices for the more general Signed Max Cut ATLB problem. In this article we\nare interested in improving the size of the kernels for Signed Max Cut ATLB on\nrestricted graph classes for which the problem remains hard. For two integers\n$r,\\ell \\geq 0$, a graph $G$ is an $(r,\\ell)$-graph if $V(G)$ can be\npartitioned into $r$ independent sets and $\\ell$ cliques. Building on the\ntechniques of Crowston et al.

In this work we propose a generic\niterative framework for fine-grained categorization and dataset bootstrapping\nthat handles these three challenges. Using deep metric learning with humans in\nthe loop, we learn a low dimensional feature embedding with anchor points on\nmanifolds for each category. These anchor points capture intra-class variances\nand remain discriminative between classes. In each round, images with high\nconfidence scores from our model are sent to humans for labeling. By comparing\nwith exemplar images, labelers mark each candidate image as either a \"true\npositive\" or a \"false positive\". True positives are added into our current\ndataset and false positives are regarded as \"hard negatives\" for our metric\nlearning model. Then the model is retrained with an expanded dataset and hard\nnegatives for the next round. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework, we bootstrap a fine-grained flower dataset with 620 categories from\nInstagram images. The proposed deep metric learning scheme is evaluated on both\nour dataset and the CUB-200-2001 Birds dataset.

In this\napplication, promptly finding out the missing event is of paramount importance.\nHowever, existing missing tag detection protocols cannot efficiently handle the\npresence of a large number of unexpected tags whose IDs are not known to the\nreader, which shackles the time efficiency. To deal with the problem of\ndetecting missing tags in the presence of unexpected tags, this paper\nintroduces a two-phase Bloom filter-based missing tag detection protocol\n(BMTD). The proposed BMTD exploits Bloom filter in sequence to first deactivate\nthe unexpected tags and then test the membership of the expected tags, thus\ndampening the interference from the unexpected tags and considerably reducing\nthe detection time. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of the protocol\nparameters is performed to minimize the detection time of the proposed BMTD and\nachieve the required reliability simultaneously. Extensive experiments are then\nconducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed BMTD. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed BMTD significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 16:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We\nprove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the\nsetup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i.e. the signal picked up at\none antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to\nthermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers or the ground) radiating\ninto both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup, one cannot suppress\ncross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing sensitivity to the\nglobal signal by the same factor -- instead, the challenge is to characterize\nthese effects and their frequency dependence.

Recent results in cellular and evolutionary biology,\nneuroscience and computer science have revitalised the interest in the\ncriticality hypothesis, emphasising its role as a viable candidate general law\nin adaptive complex systems. In this paper we provide an overview of the works\non dynamical criticality that are -to the best of our knowledge- particularly\nrelevant for the criticality hypothesis. We review the main contributions\nconcerning dynamics and information processing at the edge of chaos, and we\nillustrate the main achievements in the study of critical dynamics in\nbiological systems.

In the GCs of the Fornax dwarf\ngalaxy significant mass-loss could be a problem. Larsen et al. (2012) showed\nthat there is a large ratio of GCs to metal-poor field stars in Fornax and\nabout $20-25\\%$ of all the stars with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}<-2$ belong to the four\nmetal-poor GCs. This imposes an upper limit of $\\sim80\\%$ mass-loss that could\nhave happened in Fornax GCs. In this paper, we propose a solution to this\nproblem by suggesting that stars can leave the Fornax galaxy. We use a series\nof $N$-body simulations, to determine the limit of mass-loss from Fornax as a\nfunction of the initial orbital radii of GCs and the speed with which stars\nleave Fornax GCs. We consider a set of cored and cuspy density profiles for\nFornax. Our results show that with a cuspy model for Fornax, the fraction of\nstars which leave the galaxy, can be as high as $\\sim90\\%$, when the initial\norbital radii of GCs are $R=2-3\\,\\rm{kpc}$ and the initial speed of stars is\n$v>20\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. We show that such large velocities can be achieved by\ngas expulsion induced mass-loss but not stellar evolution induced mass-loss.\nOur results imply that one cannot interpret the metallicity distribution of\nFornax field stars as evidence against significant mass-loss in Fornax GCs, if\nmass-loss is due to gas expulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 17:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

Combined with\nhigh-resolution context spectral imaging of the photosphere and chromosphere as\nprovided by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), we can now effectively trace\ndynamic phenomena through large parts of the solar atmosphere in both space and\ntime. IRIS SJI 1400 images from active regions, which primarily sample the\ntransition region with the Si IV 1394 and 1403 {\\AA} lines, reveal ubiquitous\nbright \"grains\" which are short-lived (2-5 min) bright roundish small patches\nof sizes 0.5-1.7\" that generally move limbward with velocities up to about 30\nkm s$^{-1}$.

We show that near the vacancies, the local magnetic response to a\nfield $h_z$ is parametrically enhanced in comparison to the pristine bulk.\nUnlike the previously studied case of the 2D honeycomb Kitaev model, the\nvacancies do not bind a flux of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field.

By\ncomparing OMHPs with different atomic substitutions in the $ABX_3$\narchitecture, we find that the displacement of the $B$-site cation contributes\nto nearly all the piezoelectric response, and that the competition between\n$A$-$X$ hydrogen bond and $B$-$X$ metal-halide bond in OMHPs controls the\npiezoelectric properties. These results highlight the potential of the OMHP\narchitecture for designing new functional photoferroelectrics and\nphotopiezoelectrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 18:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-17"}

Our\nestimation framework first solves for the surface normal at each pixel using a\nvariant of example-based photometric stereo. We design an efficient multi-scale\nsearch strategy for estimating the surface normal and subsequently, refine this\nestimate using a gradient descent procedure. Given the surface normal estimate,\nwe solve for the spatially-varying BRDF by constraining the BRDF at each pixel\nto be in the span of the BRDF dictionary, here, we use additional priors to\nfurther regularize the solution. A hallmark of our approach is that it does not\nrequire iterative optimization techniques nor the need for careful\ninitialization, both of which are endemic to most state-of-the-art techniques.\nWe showcase the performance of our technique on a wide range of simulated and\nreal scenes where we outperform competing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 18:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 22:06:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 00:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

We\nconsider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and a broad\nresonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed\ncouplings and branching fractions to final states other than diphotons, by\nincluding the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts\nto construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific\nmodels, our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the\npresence of only an additional singlet or doublet spin-zero field and the\nStandard Model degrees of freedom; this includes all two-Higgs-doublet models.\nLikewise, heavy scalars in the MSSM cannot explain the excess if stability of\nthe electroweak vacuum is required, at least in a leading-order analysis. If we\nassume that the resonance is broad we find that it is challenging to find a\nweakly coupled explanation. However, we provide an existence proof in the form\nof a model with vectorlike quarks with large electric charge that is\nperturbative up to the 100 TeV scale. For the narrow-resonance case a similar\nmodel can be perturbative up to high scales also with smaller charges.

We find that wholesale prices decrease slightly and converge at\nWestern European levels, the potential of suppliers to exert market power\ndecreases significantly, and consumer surplus increases by 15.9% in the EU. Our\nresults allow us to distinguish three categories of projects: (i) New gas\nsources developed and brought to the EU markets.

The only project in this\ncategory is the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline; (ii) Existing gas sources made\navailable to additional countries.

In\nthe solar wind at $1$ AU, for energy sufficiently small ($< 1$ keV protons),\nthe perpendicular average displacement due to field line tangling generally\ndominates over two decades of turbulent scales. However, for higher energies\n($\\simeq 25$ MeV protons) within the range of multi-spacecraft measurements,\nthe longitudinal spread originating from transport due to gradient/curvature\ndrift reaches up to $\\simeq 10^\\circ- 20^\\circ$. This result highlights the\nrole of the perpendicular transport in the interpretation of interplanetary and\ninterstellar data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The model has two interesting phases: the dark matter phase, with a\nStandard Model-like Higgs boson, a new scalar and a dark matter candidate; and\nthe broken phase, with all three neutral scalars mixing. In the latter phase\nHiggs decays into a pair of two different Higgs bosons are possible. In this\nstudy we analyse Higgs-to-Higgs decays in the framework of singlet extensions\nof the Standard Model (SM), with focus on the CxSM. After demonstrating that\nscenarios with large rates for such chain decays are possible we perform a\ncomparison between the NMSSM and the CxSM. We find that, based on\nHiggs-to-Higgs decays, the only possibility to distinguish the two models at\nthe LHC run 2 is through final states with two different scalars. This\nconclusion builds a strong case for searches for final states with two\ndifferent scalars at the LHC run 2. Finally, we propose a set of benchmark\npoints for the real and complex singlet extensions to be tested at the LHC run\n2. They have been chosen such that the discovery prospects of the involved\nscalars are maximised and they fulfil the dark matter constraints.

Recent experimental studies\nof the low-temperature properties of the paradigmatic Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ spin\nice material, in particular whether the predicted transition to long-range\norder occurs, raise questions as per the currently accepted microscopic model\nof this system. In this work, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field\ntheory calculations to analyze data from magnetization, elastic neutron\nscattering and specific heat measurements on Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.

We find that small effective exchange interactions compete with\nthe magnetostatic dipolar interaction responsible for the main spin ice\nphenomenology. This causes an unexpected \"refrustration\" of the long-range\norder that would be expected from the incompletely self-screened dipolar\ninteraction and which positions the material at the boundary between two\ncompeting classical long-range ordered ground states.

We\nassume the Galaxy to consist of a superposition of many composite stellar\npopulations belonging to the thin and thick disks, the stellar halo and the\nbulge, and to be surrounded by a single dark matter halo component. A global\nmodel for the Milky Way's gravitational potential is built up self-consistently\nwith the density profiles from the Poisson equation. In turn, these density\nprofiles are used to generate synthetic probability distribution functions\n(PDFs) for the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).\nFinally, the gravitational potential is used to constrain the stellar\nkinematics by means of the moment method on a (perturbed)-distribution\nfunction. Spiral arms perturb the axisymmetric disk distribution functions in\nthe linear response framework of density-wave theory where we present an\nanalytical formula of the so-called `reduction factor' using Hypergeometric\nfunctions.

The white noise amplitude f(t), called\narbitrage bubble, generates a time dependent potential U(t) which changes the\nusual equilibrium dynamics of the traditional Black-Scholes model. The purpose\nof this article is to tackle the inverse problem, that is, is it possible to\nextract the time dependent potential U(t) and its associated bubble shape f(t)\nfrom the real empirical financial data? In order to give an answer to this\nquestion, the interacting Black-Scholes equation must be interpreted as a\nquantum Schrodinger equation with hamiltonian operator H=H0+U(t), where H0 is\nthe equilibrium Black-Scholes hamiltonian and U(t) is the interaction term. If\nthe U(t) term is small enough, the interaction potential can be thought as a\nperturbation, so one can compute the solution of the interacting Black-Scholes\nequation in an approximate form by perturbation theory. In [2] by applying the\nsemi-classical considerations, an approximate solution of the non equilibrium\nBlack-Scholes equation for an arbitrary bubble shape f(t) was developed.

For\nthis purpose, the VLT/SPHERE instrument includes a unique long-slit\nspectroscopy (LSS) mode coupled with Lyot coronagraphy in its infrared\ndual-band imager and spectrograph (IRDIS). The performance of this mode is\nintrinsically limited by the use of a non-optimal coronagraph, but in a\nprevious work we demonstrated that it could be significantly improved at small\ninner-working angles using the stop-less Lyot coronagraph (SLLC). We now\npresent the development, testing, and validation of the first SLLC prototype\nfor VLT/SPHERE. Based on the transmission profile previously proposed, the\nprototype was manufactured using microdots technology and was installed inside\nthe instrument in 2014. The transmission measurements agree well with the\nspecifications, except in the very low transmissions (<5% in amplitude). The\nperformance of the SLLC is tested in both imaging and spectroscopy using data\nacquired on the internal source. In imaging, we obtain a raw contrast gain of a\nfactor 10 at 0.3\" and 5 at 0.5\" with the SLLC. Using data acquired with a\nfocal-plane mask, we also demonstrate that no Lyot stop is required to reach\nthe full performance, which validates the SLLC concept. Comparison with a\nrealistic simulation model shows that we are currently limited by the internal\nphase aberrations of SPHERE. In spectroscopy, we obtain a gain of ~1 mag in a\nlimited range of angular separations. Simulations show that although the main\nlimitation comes from phase errors, the performance in the non-SLLC case is\nvery close to the ultimate limit of the LSS mode. Finally, we obtain the very\nfirst on-sky data with the SLLC, which appear extremely promising for the\nfuture scientific exploitation of an apodized LSS mode in SPHERE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 21:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

To study convergence rates,\nwe introduce two types of graphs and find that (1) the proposed recovery\nstrategy achieves the optimal rates; and (2) the experimentally designed\nsampling fundamentally outperforms uniform sampling for Type-2 class of graphs.\nTo validate our proposed recovery strategy, we test it on five specific graphs:\na ring graph with $k$ nearest neighbors, an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph, a random\ngeometric graph, a small-world graph and a power-law graph and find that\nexperimental results match the proposed theory well. This work also presents a\ncomprehensive explanation for when and why sampling for semi-supervised\nlearning with graphs works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 22:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 04:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 15:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

However, a viable\nbeyond-CMOS logic technology has remained elusive. Here, we propose a scalable\nspintronic logic device which operates via spin-orbit transduction combined\nwith magneto-electric switching. The proposed Magneto-Electric Spin Orbit\n(MESO) logic enables a new paradigm to continue scaling of logic performance to\nnear thermodynamic limits for GHz logic (100 kT switching energy at 100 ps\ndelay). The proposed MESO devices scale strongly and favorably with critical\ndimensions of the device, showing a cubic dependence of switching energy on\nsize, (E_m proportional to W^3), and square dependence on voltage (E_m\nproportional to V^2). The excellent scaling is obtained thanks to the\nproperties of the spin orbit effects (e.g. Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE) and\nInverse Rashba-Edelstein Effect (IREE)) and the dependence of capacitance on\nsize. The operating voltages for these devices are predicted to be < 100 mV\nallowing a significant jump ahead of historic trends of scaling voltage with\nsize and corresponding reduction of energy. Interconnect resistance is a\ncritical obstacle for scaling beyond 10 nm dimensions. We project a less\ndetrimental impact of interconnect resistance and show that MESO logic is\namenable for highly resistive interconnects (100 uOhm.cm-1 mOhm.cm) which opens\na possibility to use nano-metallic (width < bulk electron mean free path) or\ndoped semiconducting wires (width<5 nm).

In this paper, an\nevent-triggered impulsive control scheme (ETI) is introduced to improve the\nperformance of DE. Impulsive control, the concept of which derives from control\ntheory, aims at regulating the states of a network by instantly adjusting the\nstates of a fraction of nodes at certain instants, and these instants are\ndetermined by event-triggered mechanism (ETM). By introducing impulsive control\nand ETM into DE, we hope to change the search performance of the population in\na positive way after revising the positions of some individuals at certain\nmoments. At the end of each generation, the impulsive control operation is\ntriggered when the update rate of the population declines or equals to zero. In\ndetail, inspired by the concepts of impulsive control, two types of impulses\nare presented within the framework of DE in this paper: stabilizing impulses\nand destabilizing impulses. Stabilizing impulses help the individuals with\nlower rankings instantly move to a desired state determined by the individuals\nwith better fitness values. Destabilizing impulses randomly alter the positions\nof inferior individuals within the range of the current population. By means of\nintelligently modifying the positions of a part of individuals with these two\nkinds of impulses, both exploitation and exploration abilities of the whole\npopulation can be meliorated. In addition, the proposed ETI is flexible to be\nincorporated into several state-of-the-art DE variants.

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we\nconsider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the\nintroduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the\nPontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity. We perturb about the\nmaximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop\nmathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions\nfor generic spin. First we find closed-form, analytic expressions for the\nextremal scalar field, and then determine the trace of the metric perturbation,\ngiving both in terms of Legendre decompositions. Retaining only the first three\nand four modes in the Legendre representation of the scalar field and the\ntrace, respectively, suffices to ensure a fidelity of over 99% relative to full\nnumerical solutions. The leading-order mode in the Legendre expansion of the\ntrace of the metric perturbation contains a logarithmic divergence at the\nextremal Kerr horizon, which is likely to be unimportant as it occurs inside\nthe perturbed dynamical Chern-Simons horizon.

Our observations\nhave confirmed that V1006 Cyg is the second established object showing three\ntypes of outbursts (normal, long normal and superoutbursts) after TU Men. We\nhave succeeded in recording the growing stage of superhumps (stage A\nsuperhumps) and obtained a mass ratio of 0.26-0.33, which is close to the\nstability limit of tidal instability. This identification of stage A superhumps\ndemonstrated that superhumps indeed slowly grow in systems near the stability\nlimit, the idea first introduced by Kato et al. 2014, arXiv:1406.6428). The\nsuperoutburst showed a temporary dip followed by a rebrightening. The moment of\nthe dip coincided with the stage transition of superhumps, and we suggest that\nstage C superhumps is related to the start of the cooling wave in the accretion\ndisk. We interpret that the tidal instability was not strong enough to maintain\nthe disk in the hot state when the cooling wave started. We propose that the\nproperties commonly seen in the extreme ends of mass ratios (WZ Sge-type\nobjects and long-period systems) can be understood as a result of weak tidal\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 04:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Knowing that Mars has long been\nconsidered a \"sulfur-rich planet\", a new construction material composed of\nsimulated Martian soil and molten sulfur is developed. In addition to the raw\nmaterial availability for producing sulfur concrete and a strength reaching\nsimilar or higher levels of conventional cementitious concrete, fast curing,\nlow temperature sustainability, acid and salt environment resistance, 100%\nrecyclability are appealing superior characteristics of the developed Martian\nConcrete. In this study, different percentages of sulfur are investigated to\nobtain the optimal mixing proportions. Three point bending, unconfined\ncompression and splitting tests were conducted to determine strength\ndevelopment, strength variability, and failure mechanisms. The test results\nshow that the strength of Martian Concrete doubles that of sulfur concrete\nutilizing regular sand. It is also shown that the particle size distribution\nplays an important role in the mixture's final strength. Furthermore, since\nMartian soil is metal rich, sulfates and, potentially, polysulfates are also\nformed during high temperature mixing, which might contribute to the high\nstrength.

We allow for two sources\nof noise: fluctuations in the control fields and those arising from the\nenvironment. We address the issue of error mitigation by means of a formulation\nrooted in the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) approach to noisy, classical\nstatistical-mechanical systems. We express the noisy control problem in terms\nof a path integral, and integrate out the noise to arrive at an effective,\nnoise-free description. We characterize the degree of success in error\nmitigation via a fidelity, which characterizes the proximity of the\nsought-after evolution to ones achievable in the presence of noise. Error\nmitigation is then accomplished by applying the optimal control fields, i.e.,\nthose that maximize the fidelity subject to any constraints obeyed by the\ncontrol fields. To make connection with MSR, we reformulate the fidelity in\nterms of a Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) path integral, with the added twist that the\n`forward' and `backward' branches of the time-contour are inequivalent with\nrespect to the noise. The present approach naturally allows the incorporation\nof constraints on the control fields; a useful feature in practice, given that\nthey feature in real experiments. We illustrate this MSR-SK approach by\nconsidering a system consisting of a single spin $s$ freedom (with $s$\narbitrary), focusing on the case of $1/f$ noise. We discover that optimal\nerror-mitigation is accomplished via a universal control field protocol that is\nvalid for all $s$, from the qubit (i.e., $s=1/2$) case to the classical (i.e.,\n$s \\to \\infty$) limit. In principle, this MSR-SK approach provides a framework\nfor addressing quantum control in the presence of noise for systems of\narbitrary complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 06:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2015 08:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Approximately equal numbers of random excitatory and\ninhibitory connections lead to spatially localized eigenfunctions, and an\nintricate eigenvalue spectrum in the complex plane that controls the\nspontaneous activity and induced response. A finite fraction of the eigenvalues\ncondense onto the real or imaginary axes. For large N, the spectrum has\nremarkable symmetries not only with respect to reflections across the real and\nimaginary axes, but also with respect to 90 degree rotations, with an unusual\nanisotropic divergence in the localization length near the origin. When chains\nwith periodic boundary conditions become directed, with a systematic\ndirectional bias superimposed on the randomness, a hole centered on the origin\nopens up in the density-of-states in the complex plane. All states are extended\non the rim of this hole, while the localized eigenvalues outside the hole are\nunchanged. The bias dependent shape of this hole tracks the bias independent\ncontours of constant localization length. We treat the large-N limit by a\ncombination of direct numerical diagonalization and using transfer matrices, an\napproach that allows us to exploit an electrostatic analogy connecting the\n\"charges\" embodied in the eigenvalue distribution with the contours of constant\nlocalization length. We show that similar results are obtained for more\nrealistic neural networks that obey \"Dale's Law\" (each site is purely\nexcitatory or inhibitory), and conclude with perturbation theory results that\ndescribe the limit of large bias g, when all states are extended.

Variation of amide\nresonance varies Resonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding such as occurs in the\nhydrogen bonded chains of backbone amides of protein secondary structures such\nas beta sheets and alpha helices, varying the stability of these structures.\nThe electrostatic properties including permittivity of amino acid residue\nsidegroups influence the electrostatic field component parallel or antiparallel\nto the C-N bond of each amide, giving a novel relationship between residue\nsequence and protein structure.

Specifically, we study problems\nwhere the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph, and look to\ndesign algorithms that approximate the true optimum matching using only the\npreference orderings for each agent (induced by the hidden weights) as input.\nIf no restrictions are placed on the weights, then one cannot hope to do better\nthan the simple greedy algorithm, which yields a half optimal matching.

In a confined superfluid, quantized\nvortices can support such an ordered phase, provided they evolve as an almost\nisolated subsystem containing sufficient energy. A detailed theoretical\nunderstanding of the statistical mechanics of such states thus requires a\nmicrocanonical approach. Here we develop an analytical theory of the vortex\nclustering transition in a neutral system of quantum vortices confined to a\ntwo-dimensional disk geometry, within the microcanonical ensemble. As the\nsystem energy increases above a critical value, the system develops global\norder via the emergence of a macroscopic dipole structure from the homogeneous\nphase of vortices, spontaneously breaking the Z2 symmetry associated with\ninvariance under vortex circulation exchange, and the rotational SO(2) symmetry\ndue to the disk geometry. The dipole structure emerges characterized by the\ncontinuous growth of the macroscopic dipole moment which serves as a global\norder parameter, resembling a continuous phase transition. The critical\ntemperature of the transition, and the critical exponent associated with the\ndipole moment, are obtained exactly within mean-field theory. The clustering\ntransition is shown to be distinct from the final state reached at high energy,\nknown as supercondensation. The dipole moment develops via two macroscopic\nvortex clusters and the cluster locations are found analytically, both near the\nclustering transition and in the supercondensation limit. The microcanonical\ntheory shows excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, and signatures\nof the transition are apparent even for a modest system of 100 vortices,\naccessible in current Bose-Einstein condensate experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 10:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 22:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 16:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

Understanding the\ndynamical influence of the environment and the interplay between the thermal\nprocesses related to the formation and destruction of H2 and the structure of\nthe cloud is mandatory to understand correctly the observations of H2. We\nperform high resolution MHD colliding flow simulations with the AMR code RAMSES\nin which the physics of H2 has been included. We compare the simulation results\nwith various observations including the column densities of excited rotational\nlevels. Due to a combination of thermal pressure, ram pressure and gravity, the\nclouds produced at the converging point of HI streams are highly inhomogeneous.\nH2 molecules quickly form in relatively dense clumps and spread into the\ndiffuse interclump gas. This in particular leads to the existence of\nsignificant abundances of H2 in the diffuse and warm gas that lies in between\nclumps. Simulations and observations show similar trends, specially for the\nHI-to-H2 transition. The abundances of excited rotational levels, calculated at\nequilibrium in the simulations are very similar to the observed abundances\ninferred from FUSE results. This is a direct consequence of the presence of the\nH2 enriched diffuse and warm gas. Our simulations show that H2 rapidly forms in\nthe dense clumps and, due to the complex structure of molecular clouds, quickly\nspreads at lower densities. Consequently a significant fraction of warm H2\nexists in the low density gas. This warm H2 leads to column densities of\nexcited rotational levels close to the observed ones likely revealing the\ncomplex intermix between the warm and the cold gas in molecular clouds. This\nsuggests that the 2-phase structure of molecular clouds is an essential\ningredient to fully understand molecular hydrogen in these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 10:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 15:07:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

We determine the\nsurface-brightness profile of the continuum emission using resolved\nobservations at millimeter wavelengths of the disk around TW Hya, and infer the\nsignature of dust evolution on the surface density and dust opacity. Archival\nALMA observations at 820 micron on baselines up to 410 kilolambda are compared\nto parametrized disk models to determine the surface-brightness profile. Under\nthe assumption of a constant dust opacity, a broken radial power law best\ndescribes the dust surface density, with a slope of -0.53 +/- 0.01 from the 4.1\nau radius of the (already known) inner hole to a turn-over radius of 47.1 +/-\n0.2 au, steepening to -8.0 +/- 0.1 at larger radii. The emission drops below\nthe detection limit beyond ~60 au. The shape of the dust surface density is\nconsistent with theoretical expectations for grain growth, fragmentation, and\ndrift, but its total dust content and its turn-over radius are too large for TW\nHya's age of 8-10 Myr even when taking into account a radially varying dust\nopacity. Higher resolution imaging with ALMA of TW Hya and other disks is\nrequired to establish if unseen gaps associated with, e.g., embedded planets\ntrap grains at large radii or if locally enhanced grain growth associated with\nthe CO snow line explains the extent of the millimeter-continuum surface\nbrightness profile. In the latter case, population studies should reveal a\ncorrelation between the location of the CO snow line and the extent of the\nmillimeter continuum. In the former case, and if CO freeze out promotes planet\nformation, this correlation should extend to the location of gaps as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 12:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

As ensembles are\ntypically uncalibrated, they should get statistically postprocessed. Several\nmultivariate ensemble postprocessing techniques, which additionally consider\nspatial, inter-variable and/or temporal dependencies, have been developed.\nThese can be roughly divided into two groups. The first group comprises\nparametric, mainly low-dimensional approaches that are tailored to specific\nsettings. The second group involves non-parametric reordering methods that\nimpose a specific dependence template on univariately postprocesed forecasts\nand are suitable in any dimension. In this paper, these different strategies\nare combined, with the aim to exploit the benefits of both concepts.\nSpecifically, a high-dimensional postprocessing problem is divided into\nmultiple low-dimensional instances, each of which is postprocessed via a\nsuitable multivariate parametric method. From each postprocessed\nlow-dimensional distribution, a sample is drawn, which is then reordered\naccording to the corresponding multidimensional rank structure of an\nappropriately chosen dependence template. In this context, different ranking\nconcepts for multivariate settings are discussed. Finally, all reordered\nsamples are aggregated to obtain the overall postprocessed ensemble. The new\napproach is applied to ensemble forecasts for temperature and wind speed at\nseveral locations from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts,\nusing a recent bivariate ensemble model output statistics postprocessing\ntechnique and a reordering based on the raw ensemble forecasts similar to the\nensemble copula coupling method.

We\ndemonstrate that the ranking of the alternatives is more meaningful if we use\nexergy in place of energy. The use of exergy is superior due to the inclusion\nof a factor accounting for the quality of the ratings by the expert group. The\nunevenness in the ratings by the experts is measured by entropy. The procedure\nfor the calculation of the thermodynamical indicators is explained in both\ncrisp and fuzzy environment. Finally, two case studies are carried out to\ndemonstrate effectiveness of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 13:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

We study how the observed kinematics and inferred energetics are\naffected by beam smearing of a bright unresolved NLR due to seeing. We analyse\nIFU spectroscopy of a sample of twelve QSOs initially presented by Liu et al.\n(2014). The PSF for the observations is directly obtained from the light\ndistribution of the broad Hb line component.

We find that the spatially resolved [OIII] line\nwidth on kpc scales is significantly narrower than the one before PSF\ndeblending. The ENLRs appear offset from the QSO position or more elongated\nwhich can be interpreted in favour of a conical outflow on large scales while a\nspherical geometry cannot be excluded for the unresolved NLR. We find that the\nkinetic power at 5kpc distance from the spherical model by Liu et al.

Many experiments have investigated and observed such\nstructural adaptation. However, there is still much uncertainty about how to\ndefine the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and\nstable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state\nvaries both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose\nan osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of\nstructural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in\nbone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current\nlocal mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic\nosteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two\nmain types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify\nthe reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during\nbone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The\nother is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and\nreversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to\npropose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties\nprovide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is\ngradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating\nlong-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term\nmechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model. The\nconsideration of osteocyte desensitisation and of osteocyte replacement by\nremodelling is able to capture the different phenomena and timescales observed\nduring the mechanical adaptation of bone tissues, lending support to this\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 14:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 05:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

Since optical data do not depend\non dispersion measure variations, they provide a robust and independent\nconfirmation of the radio timing solution. The aim of this paper is to find a\nglobal mathematical description of Crab pulsar's phase as a function of time\nfor the complete set of published Jodrell Bank radio ephemerides (JBE) in the\nperiod 1988-2014. We apply the mathematical techniques developed for analyzing\noptical observations to the analysis of JBE. We break the whole period into a\nseries of episodes and express the phase of the pulsar in each episode as the\nsum of two analytical functions. The first function is the best-fitting local\nbraking index law, and the second function represents small residuals from this\nlaw with an amplitude of only a few turns, which rapidly relaxes to the local\nbraking index law. From our analysis, we demonstrate that the power law index\nundergoes \"instantaneous\" changes at the time of observed jumps in rotational\nfrequency (glitches). We find that the phase evolution of the Crab pulsar is\ndominated by a series of constant braking law episodes, with the braking index\nchanging abruptly after each episode in the range of values between 2.1 and\n2.6. Deviations from such a regular phase description behave as oscillations\ntriggered by glitches and amount to fewer than 40 turns during the above\nperiod, in which the pulsar has made more than 2.0e10 turns.

While average effects provide very convenient scalar\nsummaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire\nvariety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much\nmore fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects -- a collection of\nestimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by\npercentiles. By construction the sorted effect curves completely represent and\nhelp visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot.

So after having related the 16-dim\nDirac algebra to SU$*$(4), on the one hand we have access to real, complex and\nquaternionic Lie group chains and their respective algebras, on the other hand\nit is of course possible to relate physical descriptions to the respective\nrepresentations. With emphasis on the common maximal compact subgroup USp(4),\nwe are led to projective geometry of real 3-space and various transfer\nprinciples which we use to extend previous work on the rank 3-algebras above.\nOn real spaces, such considerations are governed by the groups SO($n$,$m$) with\n$n+m=6$. The central thread, however, focuses here on line and Complex geometry\nwhich finds its well-known counterparts in descriptions of electromagnetism and\nspecial relativity as well as - using transfer principles - in Dirac, gauge and\nquantum field theory. We discuss a simple picture where Complexe of second\ngrade play the major and dominant r\\^{o}le to unify (real) projective geometry,\ncomplex representation theory and line/Complex representations in order to\nproceed to dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2015 14:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 May 2017 17:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

A special focus is placed on the political replacement\neffect described in a macroscopic model by Acemoglu and Robinson (AR-model,\nhenceforth), which can determine the phenomenon of innovation 'blocking',\npossibly leading to economic backwardness. One of the goals of our modelization\nis to obtain a mesoscopic dynamical model whose macroscopic outputs are\nqualitatively comparable with stylized facts of the AR-model.
