The shell dominates the spectrum, showing lines\ntypical for spectral types mid-A to early-F, while the presence of a late/mid\nB-type central star is indicated by photospheric hydrogen line wings and helium\nlines. Numerous metallic absorption lines have broad wings but taper to narrow\ncores. They cannot be fit by Voigt profiles.\n  We aim to describe and illustrate unusual spectral features of this star, and\nmake rough calculations to estimate physical conditions and abundances in the\nshell. Furthermore, the central star is characterized.\n  We assume mean conditions for the shell. An electron density estimate is made\nfrom the Inglis-Teller formula. Excitation temperatures and column densities\nfor Fe I and Fe II are derived from curves of growth. The neutral H column\ndensity is estimated from high Paschen members. The column densities are\ncompared with calculations made with the photoionization code Cloudy.\nAtmospheric parameters of the central star are constrained employing non-LTE\nspectrum synthesis.\n  Overall chemical abundances are close to solar. Column densities of the\ndominant ions of several elements, as well as excitation temperatures and the\nmean electron density are well accounted for by a simple model. Several\nfeatures, including the degree of ionization, are less well described.\n  HD 94509 is a Be star with a stable shell, close to the terminal-age main\nsequence. The dynamical state of the shell and the unusually shaped, but\nsymmetric line profiles, require a separate study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

In this manuscript, we show that\npatient-to-patient variability sets a fundamental limit on outcome prediction\naccuracy for a general class of mathematical models for the immune response to\ninfection. However, accuracy can be increased at the expense of delayed\nprognosis. We investigate several systems of ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) that model the host immune response to a pathogen load. Advantages of\nsystems of ODEs for investigating the immune response to infection include the\nability to collect data on large numbers of `virtual patients', each with a\ngiven set of model parameters, and obtain many time points during the course of\nthe infection. We implement patient-to-patient variability $v$ in the ODE\nmodels by randomly selecting the model parameters from Gaussian distributions\nwith variance $v$ that are centered on physiological values. We use logistic\nregression with one-versus-all classification to predict the discrete\nsteady-state outcomes of the system. We find that the prediction algorithm\nachieves near $100\\%$ accuracy for $v=0$, and the accuracy decreases with\nincreasing $v$ for all ODE models studied. The fact that multiple steady-state\noutcomes can be obtained for a given initial condition, i.e. the basins of\nattraction overlap in the space of initial conditions, limits the prediction\naccuracy for $v>0$. Increasing the elapsed time of the variables used to train\nand test the classifier, increases the prediction accuracy, while adding\nexplicit external noise to the ODE models decreases the prediction accuracy.\nOur results quantify the competition between early prognosis and high\nprediction accuracy that is frequently encountered by clinicians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 16:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

These methods generate a sequence of iterates that are\nfeasible with respect to the equality constraints associated with the\noptimality conditions of the primal-dual form. The primal method maintains\nfeasibility of the primal inequalities while driving the infeasibilities of the\ndual inequalities to zero.

Formal gradient\nanalysis for spatial processes was elaborated in previous papers, focusing on\ndistribution theory for directional derivatives associated with a response\nvariable assumed to follow a Gaussian process model. In the current work, these\nideas are extended to additionally accommodate a continuous covariate whose\ndirectional derivatives are also of interest and to relate the behavior of the\ndirectional derivatives of the response surface to those of the covariate\nsurface. It is of interest to assess whether, in some sense, the gradients of\nthe response follow those of the explanatory variable. The joint Gaussian\nstructure of all variables, including the directional derivatives, allows for\nexplicit distribution theory and, hence, kriging across the spatial region\nusing multivariate normal theory. Working within a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodeling framework, posterior samples enable all gradient analysis to occur\npost model fitting. As a proof of concept, we show how our methodology can be\napplied to a standard geostatistical modeling setting using a simulation\nexample.

Most of the prior work on MAB assumes that\nthe reward distributions of each arm are independent. But in a wide variety of\ndecision problems -- from drug dosage to dynamic pricing -- the expected\nrewards of different arms are correlated, so that selecting one arm provides\ninformation about the expected rewards of other arms as well. We propose and\nanalyze a class of models of such decision problems, which we call {\\em global\nbandits}. In the case in which rewards of all arms are deterministic functions\nof a single unknown parameter, we construct a greedy policy that achieves {\\em\nbounded regret}, with a bound that depends on the single true parameter of the\nproblem. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times\nwith probability one.

Micromagnetic simulation showed emission of\nresonator's characteristic optical-mode spin-waves from disturbances generated\nby domain-wall oscillations at nano-contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 09:43:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 10:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Although we can resort to compensation schemes\nto mitigate part of these impairments, a certain amount of residual impairments\nalways persists. In this paper, we consider a training-based point-to-point\nMIMO system with residual transmit RF impairments (RTRI) using spatial\nmultiplexing transmission. Specifically, we derive a new linear channel\nestimator for the proposed model, and show that RTRI create an estimation error\nfloor in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, we derive\nclosed-form expressions for the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR)\ndistributions, along with analytical expressions for the ergodic achievable\nrates of zero-forcing, maximum ratio combining, and minimum mean-squared error\nreceivers, respectively. In addition, we optimize the ergodic achievable rates\nwith respect to the training sequence length, and demonstrate that finite\ndimensional systems with RTRI generally require more training at high SNRs than\nthose with ideal hardware. At last, we extend our analysis to large-scale MIMO\nconfigurations, and derive deterministic equivalents of the ergodic achievable\nrates. It is shown that, by deploying large receive antenna arrays, the extra\ntraining requirements due to RTRI can be eliminated. In fact, with sufficiently\nlarge number of receive antennas, systems with RTRI may even need less training\nthan systems with ideal hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 14:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

For small amplitude flows, the forward\nproblem is described in good approximation by a large system of convolution\nequations. The input observations are highly noisy random vectors with a known\ndense covariance matrix. This leads to a large statistical linear inverse\nproblem.\n  Whereas for deterministic linear inverse problems several computationally\nefficient minimax optimal regularization methods exist, only one\nminimax-optimal linear estimator exists for statistical linear inverse\nproblems: the Pinsker estimator. However, it is often computationally\ninefficient because it requires a singular value decomposition of the forward\noperator or it is not applicable because of an unknown noise covariance matrix,\nso it is rarely used for real-world problems.
