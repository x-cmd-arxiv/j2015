As we discuss, this is of\nparticular interest for experiments involving quenches. Away from the centre of\nthe spectrum, we find that excitations appear as domain walls in the cases with\ntime-reversal symmetry, or as vortices in the cases where time-reversal\nsymmetry is absent. Therefore, a quench in a system with uniform density would\nlead to the formation of either vortices or domain walls depending on the\nsymmetry class. For the non-chiral models in the A and AI classes, a population\nimbalance between the two atomic species naturally occurs. In these cases, one\nof the two species is seen to favour a more uniform density. We also study the\nonset of localization as the disorder strength is increased for the different\nclasses, and by deriving an effective model for the non-chiral cases we show\nhow their eigenstates remain extended for larger values of the coupling with\nthe disorder, if compared to the non-chiral ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 16:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Even the most powerful convolutional neural network we can train fails\nto perform satisfactorily when trained and tested on data from different\ndatabases. This issue, known as domain adaptation and/or dataset bias in the\nliterature, is due to a distribution mismatch between data collections. Methods\naddressing it go from max-margin classifiers to learning how to modify the\nfeatures and obtain a more robust representation. Recent work showed that by\ncasting the problem into the image-to-class recognition framework, the domain\nadaptation problem is significantly alleviated \\cite{danbnn}. Here we follow\nthis approach, and show how a very simple, learning free Naive Bayes Nearest\nNeighbor (NBNN)-based domain adaptation algorithm can significantly alleviate\nthe distribution mismatch among source and target data, especially when the\nnumber of classes and the number of sources grow. Experiments on standard\nbenchmarks used in the literature show that our approach (a) is competitive\nwith the current state of the art on small scale problems, and (b) achieves the\ncurrent state of the art as the number of classes and sources grows, with\nminimal computational requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 16:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

Evidence\nsuggests reproductive isolation arises most commonly in allopatry with a higher\nspeciation rate in small populations. Current theory does not address this\ndependence in the important weak mutation regime. Here, we examine a\nbiophysical model of speciation based on the binding of a protein transcription\nfactor to a DNA binding site, and how their independent co-evolution, in a\nstabilizing landscape, of two allopatric lineages leads to incompatibilities.\nOur results give a new prediction for the monomorphic regime of evolution,\nconsistent with data, that smaller populations should develop incompatibilities\nmore quickly. This arises as: 1) smaller populations having a greater initial\ndrift load, as there are more sequences that bind poorly than well, so fewer\nsubstitutions are needed to reach incompatible regions of phenotype space; 2)\nslower divergence when the population size is larger than the inverse of\ndiscrete differences in fitness. Further, we find longer sequences develop\nincompatibilities more quickly at small population sizes, but more slowly at\nlarge population sizes. The biophysical model thus represents a robust\nmechanism of rapid reproductive isolation for small populations and large\nsequences, that does not require peak-shifts or positive selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 17:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

The discrimination\nbetween a possible dark matter signal and background is based on the light\nyield. We present a new method for evaluating the two characteristics of a\nphonon/light detector module that determine how much of the deposited energy is\nconverted to scintillation light and how efficiently a module detects the\nproduced light. In contrast to former approaches with dedicated setups, we\ndeveloped a method which allows us to use data taken with the cryogenic setup,\nduring a dark matter search phase. In this way, we accounted for the entire\nprocess that occurs in a detector module, and obtained information on the light\nemission of the crystal as well as information on the performance of the module\n(light transport and detection). We found that with the detectors operated in\nCRESST-II phase 1, about 20% of the produced scintillation light is detected. A\npart of the light is likely absorbed by creating meta-stable excitations in the\nscintillating crystals.

The\nsteady state of subsystems weakly interacting with their environment is\ndescribed by the canonical ensemble which assumes the probability distribution\nfor energy to be of the Boltzmann form. The emergence of this probability\ndistribution is ensured by the detailed balance of the transitions induced by\nthe interaction with the environment. Here we consider relaxation of an open\ncorrelated quantum system brought into contact with a reservoir in the vacuum\nstate. We refer to such a system as emissive since particles irreversibly\nevaporate into the vacuum. The steady state of the system is a statistical\nmixture of the stable eigenstates arising due to the binding energy. We found\nthat, despite the absence of the detailed balance, the stationary probability\ndistribution over these eigenstates is of the Boltzmann form in each\n$N$-particle sector. A quantum statistical ensemble corresponding to the steady\nstate is characterized by different temperatures in the different sectors, in a\ncontrast to the Gibbs ensemble.

While the independence of data from\ncensoring sensors is often assumed in previous research, we explore spatial\ndependence among observations. Our focus is on designing the fusion rule under\nthe Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework that takes into account the spatial\ndependence among observations. Two transmission scenarios are considered, one\nwhere uncensored observations are transmitted directly to the FC and second\nwhere they are first quantized and then transmitted to further improve\ntransmission efficiency. Copula-based Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)\nfor censored data is proposed with both continuous and discrete messages\nreceived at the FC corresponding to different transmission strategies.

To maximize the science gains from such GW\ndetections it is essential to identify electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The\nmost promising such counterpart is optical/IR emission powered by the\nradioactive decay of r-process elements synthesized in the neutron-rich merger\nejecta - a \"kilonova\".

We find that if pre-existing\ntemplate images for the localization region are available, then nightly\nobservations to a depth of i=24 mag and z=23 mag are required to achieve a 95%\ndetection rate; observations that commence within 12 hours of trigger will also\ncapture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta\nproperties. We also find that kilonovae can be robustly separated from other\ntypes of transients utilizing cuts on color (i-z > 0 mag) and rise time (< 4\ndays). In the absence of a pre-existing template the observations must reach ~1\nmag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate, but robust rejection of\ncontaminants can still be achieved.

In agreement with our previous studies, we find that cores of\nhigher initial mass and angular momentum produce disks that are more favorable\nto gravitational instability and fragmentation, while a higher background\nirradiation and magnetic fields moderate the disk tendency to fragment. The\nprotostellar accretion in our models is time-variable, thanks to the nonlinear\ninteraction between different spiral modes in the gravitationally unstable\ndisk, and can undergo episodic bursts when fragments migrate onto the star\nowing to the gravitational interaction with other fragments or spiral arms.\nMost bursts occur in the partly embedded Class I phase, with a smaller fraction\ntaking place in the deeply embedded Class 0 phase and a few possible bursts in\nthe optically visible Class II phase. The average burst duration and mean\nluminosity are found to be in good agreement with those inferred from\nobservations of FU-Orionis-type eruptions. The model predicts the existence of\ntwo types of bursts: the isolated ones, showing well-defined luminosity peaks\nseparated with prolonged periods (~ 10^4 yr) of quiescent accretion, and\nclustered ones, demonstrating several bursts occurring one after another during\njust a few hundred years. Finally, we estimate that 40\\%--70\\% of the\nstar-forming cores can display bursts after forming a star-disk system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 20:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The importance of the\npartial ionisation is investigated in terms of the ionisation fraction.\nMatching the solutions for the transversal component of the velocity and total\npressure at the interface between the prominence and coronal plasmas, we derive\na dispersion relation whose imaginary part describes the evolution of the\ninstability. Results are obtained in the limit of weak dissipation. Using\nsimple analytical methods, we show that dissipative instabilities appear for\nflow speeds that are lower than the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability threshold.\nWhile viscosity tends to destabilise the plasma, the effect of partial\nionisation (through the Cowling resistivity) will act towards stabilising the\ninterface. For ionisation degrees closer to a neutral gas the interface will be\nunstable for larger values of equilibrium flow. The same principle is assumed\nwhen studying the appearance of instability at the interface between\nprominences and dark plumes. The unstable mode appearing in this case has a\nvery small growth rate and dissipative instability cannot explain the\nappearance of flows in plumes. The present study improves our understanding of\nthe complexity of dynamical processes at the interface of solar prominences and\nsolar corona, and the role partial ionisation can have on the stability of the\nplasma.

A critical scientific\nchallenge facing nonaqueous Li-O$_2$ batteries is the electronically insulating\nnature of the primary discharge product, lithium peroxide, which passivates the\nbattery cathode as it is formed, leading to low ultimate cell capacities.\nRecently, strategies to enhance solubility to circumvent this issue have been\nreported, but rely upon electrolyte formulations that further decrease the\noverall electrochemical stability of the system, thereby deleteriously\naffecting battery rechargeability. In this study, we report that a significant\nenhancement (greater than four-fold) in Li-O$_2$ cell capacity is possible by\nappropriately selecting the salt anion in the electrolyte solution. Using\n$^7$Li nuclear magnetic resonance and modeling, we confirm that this\nimprovement is a result of enhanced Li$^+$ stability in solution, which in turn\ninduces solubility of the intermediate to Li$_2$O$_2$ formation. Using this\nstrategy, the challenging task of identifying an electrolyte solvent that\npossesses the anti-correlated properties of high intermediate solubility and\nsolvent stability is alleviated, potentially providing a pathway to develop an\nelectrolyte that affords both high capacity and rechargeability.

While the exponentially distributed sojourn\ntime of Markov models is widely known to be unrealistic (and it is necessary to\nconsider Weibull-type models for components such as disks), recent work has\nalso highlighted some additional infirmities with the CTMC model, such as the\nability to handle repair times. Due to the memoryless property of these models,\nany failure or repair of one component resets the \"clock\" to zero with any\npartial repair or aging in some other subsystem forgotten. It has therefore\nbeen argued that simulation is the only accurate technique available for\nmodelling the reliability of a storage system with multiple components.\n  We show how both the above problematic aspects can be handled when we\nconsider a careful set of approximations in a detailed model of the system. A\ndetailed model has many states, and the transitions between them and the\ncurrent state captures the \"memory\" of the various components. We model a\nnon-exponential distribution using a sum of exponential distributions, along\nwith the use of a CTMC solver in a probabilistic model checking tool that has\nsupport for reducing large state spaces. Furthermore, it is possible to get\nresults close to what is obtained through simulation and at much lower cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 00:08:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

The common, min-max, formulation of this goal considers the\nperformance of the best estimator over all distributions in a class.

In\nthis paper, we derive a new formula by which the theoretical relation among CV,\nWAIC, and the generalization loss is clarified and the optimal hyperparameter\ncan be directly found.\n  By the formula, three facts are clarified about predictive prior design.\nFirstly, CV and WAIC have the same second order asymptotic expansion, hence\nthey are asymptotically equivalent to each other as the optimizer of the\nhyperparameter. Secondly, the hyperparameter which minimizes CV or WAIC makes\nthe average generalization loss to be minimized asymptotically but does not the\nrandom generalization loss. And lastly, by using the mathematical relation\nbetween priors, the variances of the optimized hyperparameters by CV and WAIC\nare made smaller with small computational costs.

By taking into account\nadditional sources of randomness in Bell's type experiments, i.e.,\nsupplementary to source randomness, I calculate (in the standard quantum\nformalism) the complete quantum correlations. The main message of the quantum\ntheory of measurement (due to von Neumann) is that complete correlations can be\nessentially smaller than the conditional ones. Additional sources of randomness\ndiminish correlations. One can say another way around: transition from\nunconditional correlations to conditional can increase them essentially. This\nis true for both classical and quantum probability. The final remark is that\nclassical conditional correlations do not satisfy Bell's inequality. Thus we\nmet the following {\\it conditional probability dilemma}: either to use the\nconditional quantum probabilities, as was done by Bell and others, or complete\nquantum correlations. However, in the first case the corresponding classical\nconditional correlations need not satisfy Bell's inequality and in the second\ncase the complete quantum correlations satisfy Bell's inequality.

Radiative\ndiffusion is the primary supplier of heat to convective motions in the lower\nconvection zone, and it results in a heat input per unit volume of magnetic\nflux tubes that has been ignored by many previous thin flux tube studies. We\nuse a thin flux tube model subject to convection taken from a rotating\nspherical shell of turbulent, solar-like convection as described by Weber, Fan,\nand Miesch (2011, Astrophys. J., 741, 11; 2013, Solar Phys., 287, 239), now\ntaking into account the influence of radiative heating on flux tubes of\nlarge-scale active regions. Our simulations show that flux tubes of less than\nor equal to 60 kG subject to solar-like convective flows do not anchor in the\novershoot region, but rather drift upward due to the increased buoyancy of the\nflux tube earlier in its evolution as a result of the inclusion of radiative\ndiffusion. Flux tubes of magnetic field strengths ranging from 15 kG to 100 kG\nhave rise times of less than or equal to 0.2 years, and exhibit a Joy's Law\ntilt-angle trend. Our results suggest that radiative heating is an effective\nmechanism by which flux tubes can escape from the stably stratified overshoot\nregion, and that flux tubes do not necessarily need to be anchored in the\novershoot region to produce emergence properties similar to those of active\nregions on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 11:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational\npotential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\\text{Moving}$\n$\\text{Cluster}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small. Using a\nsimple model, we derive these effects from first principles.\n  One application would be to the Bullet Cluster, whose large tangential\nvelocity may be inconsistent with the $\\Lambda CDM$ paradigm. This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE. We argue that the MCE should be observable\nwith ALMA.\n  However, such measurements can be corrupted by the DME if typical spiral\ngalaxies are used as sources. Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral\nline profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished. It\nmight also be feasible to calculate how much the DME should affect the mean\nredshift of each image. Resolved observations of the source would be required\nto do this accurately.\n  The DME is of order the source angular size divided by the Einstein radius\ntimes the redshift variation across the source. Thus, it mostly affects nearly\nedge-on spiral galaxies in certain orientations. This suggests that observers\nshould reduce the DME by careful choice of target, a possibility we discuss in\nsome detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 12:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 May 2015 14:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 14:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

Neutron diffraction and\nneutron spectroscopy results show that the structural transition at T* is of a\nsecond-order, and that it is well described by mean-field theory. Inelastic\nneutron scattering data point towards a displacive structural transition at T*\narising from the softening of a low-energy phonon mode with an energy gap of\nDelta(120 K) = 1.05 meV. Using density functional theory the soft phonon mode\nis identified as a 'breathing' mode of the Sn12 icosahedra and is consistent\nwith the thermal ellipsoids of the Sn2 atoms found by single crystal\ndiffraction data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 15:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 17:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

Through analysis\nand simulation, we establish that the greatest densities are achieved when\nlines are painted to create spots roughly twice the length of average-sized\ncars.

Algorithmic stability is achieved due to absence of the poles at\n$y \\geqslant 0$ and $ - \\infty < x < \\infty $.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 02:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}
