When the marginal\nprobability measures are absolutely continuous (or vanish on small sets) the\ntheory of Wasserstein barycenters is well-developed (see the seminal paper\n[1]). However, exact continuous computation of Wasserstein barycenters in this\nsetting is tractable in only a small number of specialized cases. Moreover, in\nmany applications data is given as a set of probability measures with finite\nsupport. In this paper, we develop theoretical results for Wasserstein\nbarycenters in this discrete setting. Our results rely heavily on polyhedral\ntheory which is possible due to the discrete structure of the marginals.\n  Our results closely mirror those in the continuous case with a few\nexceptions. In this discrete setting we establish that Wasserstein barycenters\nmust also be discrete measures and there is always a barycenter which is\nprovably sparse. Moreover, for each Wasserstein barycenter there exists a\nnon-mass-splitting optimal transport to each of the discrete marginals. Such\nnon-mass-splitting transports do not generally exist between two discrete\nmeasures unless special mass balance conditions hold. This makes Wasserstein\nbarycenters in this discrete setting special in this regard.\n  We illustrate the results of our discrete barycenter theory with a\nproof-of-concept computation for a hypothetical transportation problem with\nmultiple marginals: distributing a fixed set of goods when the demand can take\non different distributional shapes characterized by the discrete marginal\ndistributions. A Wasserstein barycenter, in this case, represents an optimal\ndistribution of inventory facilities which minimize the squared\ndistance/transportation cost totaled over all demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 16:26:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 18:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The separation of the system estimator from the experiment\ndesign is done within this new framework by choosing and fixing the estimation\nmethod to either a maximum likelihood (ML) approach or a Bayesian estimator\nsuch as the minimum mean square error (MMSE).

Facebook\nrevealed in a 2013 white paper that its users have uploaded more than 250\nbillion photos, and are uploading 350 million new photos each day. Due to this\nhumongous amount of data, large-scale face search for mining web images is both\nimportant and challenging. Despite significant progress in face recognition,\nsearching a large collection of unconstrained face images has not been\nadequately addressed. To address this challenge, we propose a face search\nsystem which combines a fast search procedure, coupled with a state-of-the-art\ncommercial off the shelf (COTS) matcher, in a cascaded framework. Given a probe\nface, we first filter the large gallery of photos to find the top-k most\nsimilar faces using deep features generated from a convolutional neural\nnetwork.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the deep features are competitive with state-of-the-art\nmethods on unconstrained face recognition benchmarks (LFW and IJB-A).

Moreover, for typical experimental setups, we\nestimate the critical temperatures for different ordered phases and our results\nsuggest that direct experimental observation of these phases is promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 20:39:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 23:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The color tells the subject which is X with probability $q$. We\nset $q\\in \\{5/9,6/9,7/9,8/9\\}$ by controlling the configurations of red and\nblue balls in A and B. The (average) lengths of the sequence of the subjects\nare 63, 63, 54.0, and 60.5 for $q\\in \\{5/9,6/9,7/9,8/9\\}$, respectively. We\ndescribe the sequential voting process by a nonlinear P\\'olya urn model. The\nmodel suggests the possibility of a phase transition when $q$ changes.

Using density functional theory,\nwe show that single-layer chromium trihalides (SLCTs) (CrX$_3$,X=F, Cl, Br and\nI) constitute a series of stable 2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. A\nfree-standing SLCT can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal, due to a low\ncleavage energy and a high in-plane stiffness. Electronic structure\ncalculations using the HSE06 functional indicate that both bulk and\nsingle-layer CrX$_3$ are half semiconductors with indirect gaps and their\nvalence bands and conduction bands are fully spin-polarized in the same spin\ndirection. The energy gaps and absorption edges of CrBr$_3$ and CrI$_3$ are\nfound to be in the visible frequency range, which implies possible\nopt-electronic applications. Furthermore, SLCTs are found to possess a large\nmagnetic moment of 3$\\mu_B$ per formula unit and a sizable magnetic anisotropy\nenergy. The magnetic exchange constants of SLCTs are then extracted using the\nHeisenberg spin Hamiltonian and the microscopic origins of the various exchange\ninteractions are analyzed. A competition between a near 90$^\\circ$ FM\nsuperexchange and a direct antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange results in a FM\nnearest-neighbour exchange interaction. The next and third nearest-neighbour\nexchange interactions are found to be FM and AFM respectively and this can be\nunderstood by the angle-dependent extended Cr-X-X-Cr superexchange interaction.\nMoreover, the Curie temperatures of SLCTs are also predicted using Monte Carlo\nsimulations and the values can further increase by applying a biaxial tensile\nstrain. The unique combination of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism, half\nsemiconductivity and large magnetic anisotropy energies renders the SLCTs as\npromising candidates for next-generation semiconductor spintronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 01:28:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 03:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

Tools for integrating\nthese measurements into severity scores, that accurately track changes in\nillness severity, can improve clinicians ability to provide timely\ninterventions. Existing approaches for creating such scores either 1) rely on\nexperts to fully specify the severity score, or 2) train a predictive score,\nusing supervised learning, by regressing against a surrogate marker of severity\nsuch as the presence of downstream adverse events. The first approach does not\nextend to diseases where an accurate score cannot be elicited from experts. The\nsecond approach often produces scores that suffer from bias due to\ntreatment-related censoring (Paxton, 2013). We propose a novel ranking based\nframework for disease severity score learning (DSSL). DSSL exploits the\nfollowing key observation: while it is challenging for experts to quantify the\ndisease severity at any given time, it is often easy to compare the disease\nseverity at two different times. Extending existing ranking algorithms, DSSL\nlearns a function that maps a vector of patient's measurements to a scalar\nseverity score such that the resulting score is temporally smooth and\nconsistent with the expert's ranking of pairs of disease states. We apply DSSL\nto the problem of learning a sepsis severity score using a large, real-world\ndataset. The learned scores significantly outperform state-of-the-art clinical\nscores in ranking patient states by severity and in early detection of future\nadverse events. We also show that the learned disease severity trajectories are\nconsistent with clinical expectations of disease evolution. Further, using\nsimulated datasets, we show that DSSL exhibits better generalization\nperformance to changes in treatment patterns compared to the above approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 03:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

We then develop a general\nbivariate distribution commensurate with the new paradigm, its properties are\ndiscussed and its moments developed. An approximating assumption results in a\nunivariate general distribution that is shown to include as exact special cases\nwidely used distributions like generalized gamma, log-normal, F, t, and Cauchy.\nCompound distributions and their relationship to the new paradigm are\naddressed. Empirical observations that comply with predictions derived from the\nnew paradigm corroborate its scientific validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 05:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Using a theory based on\npure-dephasing Lindblad evolution, we find that the pumping is contributed by\ntwo parts of different nature, a dephasing-modified geometric part weighted by\ninitial Bloch state populations, and an interband-coherence-induced part\ncompromised by dephasing, both of them being independent of the pumping time\nscale. The overall pumping reflects an interplay of the band topology, initial\nstate populations, initial state coherence, and dephasing.

An implicit assumption is that\nthe resulting rough wall differs from a smooth wall only locally at the\nparticle scale. Here we test this assumption by considering the impact of the\nwall roughness at the periphery of the flowing layer on the flow of\nmonodisperse particles in a rotating spherical tumbler. We find that varying\nthe wall roughness significantly alters average particle trajectories even far\nfrom the wall. Rough walls induce greater poleward axial drift of particles\nnear the flowing layer surface, but decrease the curvature of the trajectories.\nIncreasing the volume fill level in the tumbler has little effect on the axial\ndrift for rough walls, but increases the drift while reducing curvature of the\nparticle trajectories for smooth walls. The mechanism for these effects is\nrelated to the degree of local slip at the bounding wall, which alters the\nflowing layer thickness near the walls, affecting the particle trajectories\neven far from the walls near the equator of the tumbler. Thus, the proper\nchoice of wall conditions is important in the accurate simulation of granular\nflows, even far from the bounding wall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 10:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 09:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The scatter in both\nscaling relations is a factor of ~2 larger at z~0.5 than at z~0.

They however face problems when\nattempting to account for structure formation: in the linear regime, density\nfluctuations can become Jeans stable and oscillate rather than collapse, though\nit is possible that this difficulty may be circumvented by invoking nonlinear\nclustering. Here we examine the behaviour in the fully nonlinear regime, of\ncollapsed objects that should mimic standard dark matter haloes. It is shown\nthat the pressure gradient associated with the unified dark matter fluid should\nbe significant in the outer parts of galaxies and clusters, and its effects\nobervable. In this case, no flat or falling rotation curve is possible for any\n(barotropic) equation of state with associated sound speed decreasing with\ndensity (a necessary condition if the fluid is to behave as pressureless matter\nat high density). The associated density profile is therefore also incompatible\nwith that inferred in the outer part of clusters.

A design criterion based on the normalized minimum determinant is\nproposed for division algebra multiblock space-time codes over fading channels;\nthis plays a similar role to the Hermite invariant for Gaussian channels. It is\nshown that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee transmission rates within\na constant gap from capacity both for slow fading channels and ergodic fading\nchannels. This performance is achieved both under maximum likelihood decoding\nand naive lattice decoding. In the case of independent identically distributed\nRayleigh fading, it is also shown that the error probability vanishes\nexponentially fast. In contrast to the standard approach in the literature\nwhich employs random lattice ensembles, the existence results in this paper are\nderived from number theory. First the gap to capacity is shown to depend on the\ndiscriminant of the chosen division algebra; then class field theory is applied\nto build families of algebras with small discriminants. The key element in the\nconstruction is the choice of a sequence of division algebras whose centers are\nnumber fields with small root discriminants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 13:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

Traditional numerical renormalization group\n(NRG) calculation of the impurity contribution $\\chi_{\\textrm{imp}}$ to\nsusceptibility, defined originally by Wilson in a flat wide band, has been\ngeneralized before to structured conduction bands. The results brought about\nnon-Fermi-liquid and diamagnetic Kondo behaviors in $\\chi_{\\textrm{imp}}$, even\nwhen the bands are not gapped at the Fermi energy.

Our results indicate\nthat those exotic behaviors observed in $\\chi_{\\textrm{imp}}$ are unphysical.\nInstead, the low-energy excitations of the impurity in arbitrary bands only\nwithout gap at the Fermi energy are still a Fermi liquid and paramagnetic. We\nalso demonstrate that unlike the traditional NRG yielding $\\chi_{\\textrm{loc}}$\nless accurate than $\\chi_{\\textrm{imp}}$, the FDM method allows a\nhigh-precision dynamical calculation of $\\chi_{\\textrm{loc}}$ at much reduced\ncomputational cost, with an accuracy at least one order higher than\n$\\chi_{\\textrm{imp}}$.

Two current-carrying plasma rings, or flux ropes, approach each\nother through the mutual attraction of their like currents, and merge, through\nmagnetic reconnection, into a single plasma torus, with substantial plasma\nheating. 2D resistive MHD and Hall MHD simulations of this process are\nreported, and new results for the temperature distribution of ions and\nelectrons are presented. A model of the based on relaxation theory is also\ndescribed, which is now extended to tight aspect ratio geometry. This model\nallows prediction of the final merged state and the heating.

Among the giant planets,\nUranus has one of the smallest known populations of co-orbitals, three objects,\nand all of them are short-lived. Asteroid 2015 DB216 has an orbital period that\nmatches well that of Uranus, and here we investigate its dynamical state.\nDirect N-body calculations are used to assess the current status of this\nobject, reconstruct its immediate dynamical past, and explore its future\norbital evolution. A covariance matrix-based Monte Carlo scheme is presented\nand applied to study its short-term stability. We find that 2015 DB216 is\ntrapped in a temporary co-orbital resonance with Uranus, the fourth known minor\nbody to do so. A detailed analysis of its dynamical evolution shows that it is\nan unstable but recurring co-orbital companion to Uranus. It currently follows\nan asymmetric horseshoe trajectory that will last for at least 10 kyr, but it\nmay remain inside Uranus' co-orbital zone for millions of years. As in the case\nof other transient Uranian co-orbitals, complex multibody ephemeral mean motion\nresonances trigger the switching between the various resonant co-orbital\nstates. The new Uranian co-orbital exhibits a secular behaviour markedly\ndifferent from that of the other known Uranian co-orbitals because of its\nhigher inclination, nearly 38 degrees. Given its rather unusual discovery\ncircumstances, the presence of 2015 DB216 hints at the existence of a\nrelatively large population of objects moving in similar orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 15:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-27"}

We find that the instability also appears for a\nmonotonically decreasing electron number density and magnetic field, a\nplane-parallel analogue of an azimuthal or meridional magnetic field in the\ncrust of a magnetar. The growth rate of the instability depends on the Hall\nproperties of the field (magnetic field intensity, electron number density and\nthe corresponding scale-heights), while being insensitive to weak resistivity.\nSince the Hall effect is the driving process for the evolution of the crustal\nmagnetic field of magnetars, we argue that this instability is critical for\nsystems containing strong meridional or azimuthal fields. We find that this\nprocess mediates the formation of localised structures with much stronger\nmagnetic field than the average, which can lead to magnetar activity and\naccelerate the dissipation of the field and consequently the production of\nOhmic heating.

For this reason,\nextensive research has been performed on surveillance scene understanding and\nanalysis. However, most studies have considered single scenes, or groups of\nadjacent scenes. The semantic similarity between different but related scenes\n(e.g., many different traffic scenes of similar layout) is not generally\nexploited to improve any automated surveillance tasks and reduce manual effort.\nExploiting commonality, and sharing any supervised annotations, between\ndifferent scenes is however challenging due to: Some scenes are totally\nun-related -- and thus any information sharing between them would be\ndetrimental; while others may only share a subset of common activities -- and\nthus information sharing is only useful if it is selective. Moreover,\nsemantically similar activities which should be modelled together and shared\nacross scenes may have quite different pixel-level appearance in each scene. To\naddress these issues we develop a new framework for distributed multiple-scene\nglobal understanding that clusters surveillance scenes by their ability to\nexplain each other's behaviours; and further discovers which subset of\nactivities are shared versus scene-specific within each cluster. We show how to\nuse this structured representation of multiple scenes to improve common\nsurveillance tasks including scene activity understanding, cross-scene\nquery-by-example, behaviour classification with reduced supervised labelling\nrequirements, and video summarization.

As an application, we prove that, if $\\mcB$ also has a\nSchauder basis (S-basis), then for each $A \\in \\C[\\mcB]$ (the closed and\ndensely defined linear operators), there exists a closed densely defined linear\noperator $A^* \\in \\C[\\mcB]$ that has all the expected properties of an adjoint.\nThus for example, the bounded linear operators, $L[\\mcB]$, is a $^*$algebra.\nThis result allows us to give a natural definition to the Schatten class of\noperators on a uniformly convex Banach space with a S-basis. In particular,\nevery theorem that is true for the Schatten class on a Hilbert space, is also\ntrue on such a space. The main tool we use is a special version of a result due\nto Kuelbs \\cite{K}, which shows that every uniformly convex Banach space with a\nS-basis can be densely and continuously embedded into a Hilbert space which is\nunique up to a change of basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 15:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-31"}

Shi, Z. Guo, Lattice Boltzmann\nmodel for nonlinear convection-diffusion equations, Phys. Rev. E 79 (2009)\n016701], we develop a general multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann\nmodel for nonlinear anisotropic convection-diffusion equation (NACDE), and show\nthat the NACDE can be recovered correctly from the present model through the\nChapman-Enskog analysis. We then test the MRT model through some classic CDEs,\nand find that the numerical results are in good agreement with analytical\nsolutions or some available results. Besides, the numerical results also show\nthat similar to the single-relaxation-time (SRT) lattice Boltzmann model or\nso-called BGK model, the present MRT model also has a second-order convergence\nrate in space. Finally, we also perform a comparative study on the accuracy and\nstability of the MRT model and BGK model by using two examples. In terms of the\naccuracy, both the theoretical analysis and numerical results show that a\n\\emph{numerical} slip on the boundary would be caused in the BGK model, and\ncannot be eliminated unless the relaxation parameter is fixed to be a special\nvalue, while the \\emph{numerical} slip in the MRT model can be overcome once\nthe relaxation parameters satisfy some constrains. The results in terms of\nstability also demonstrate that the MRT model could be more stable than the BGK\nmodel through tuning the free relaxation parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 02:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}
