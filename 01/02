While there has been much work in recent years in understanding the\nconsistency properties of learning algorithms for `binary' non-decomposable\nmetrics, little is known either about the form of the optimal classifier for a\ngeneral multi-class non-decomposable metric, or about how these learning\nalgorithms generalize to the multi-class case. In this paper, we provide a\nunified framework for analysing a multi-class non-decomposable performance\nmetric, where the problem of finding the optimal classifier for the performance\nmetric is viewed as an optimization problem over the space of all confusion\nmatrices achievable under the given distribution. Using this framework, we show\nthat (under a continuous distribution) the optimal classifier for a multi-class\nperformance metric can be obtained as the solution of a cost-sensitive\nclassification problem, thus generalizing several previous results on specific\nbinary non-decomposable metrics. We then design a consistent learning algorithm\nfor concave multi-class performance metrics that proceeds via a sequence of\ncost-sensitive classification problems, and can be seen as applying the\nconditional gradient (CG) optimization method over the space of feasible\nconfusion matrices. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient learning\nalgorithm (whose running time is polynomial in the number of classes) that is\nconsistent for a large family of multi-class non-decomposable metrics. Our\nconsistency proof uses a novel technique based on the convergence analysis of\nthe CG method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jan 2015 16:22:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

In many\ncases, genes blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as\noperons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute:\ngene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting, and block fusion are frequently\nobserved. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the\nformation and breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been\nproposed. These models, however, are not generally applicable to all types of\ngene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene\nblock evolution. To address this problem we introduce an event-based method for\ntracking gene block evolution in bacteria. Results: We show here that the\nevolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of\nevents. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes\nout of a gene block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the\nevent-based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the\nevolutionary rate, and to trace the ancestral states of their formation. We\nconclude that the event-based method can be used to help us understand the\nformation of these important bacterial genomic structures.

A graph is 1-planar if there exists\na drawing in the plane where each edge is crossed at most once, and an optimal\nn-vertex 1-planar graph has the maximum (4n - 8) number of edges. We describe a\nlinear-time algorithm for representing optimal 1-planar graphs without\nseparating 4-cycles with 3D boxes. However, not every optimal 1-planar graph\nadmits a representation with boxes. Hence, we consider contact representations\nwith the next simplest axis-aligned 3D object, L-shaped polyhedra.

Such objects are of interest since they represent the onset of\nAGN activity during the merger process. Three of the objects studied have been\nconfirmed as major mergers using near-infrared imaging, one is a confirmed\nX-ray binary AGN. All AGN are luminous and have redshifts of 0.1 < z < 0.4.\nDeep r-band images show that a majority (3/4) of the sources have disturbed\nhost morphologies and tidal features, while the remaining source is\nmorphologically undisturbed down to low surface brightness limits. The lack of\nmorphological disturbances in this galaxy despite the fact that is is a close\nbinary AGN suggests that the merger of a binary black hole can take longer than\n~1 Gyr. The narrow line regions (NLRs) have large sizes (10 kpc < r < 100 kpc)\nand consist of compact clumps with considerable relative velocities (~ 200-650\nkm/s). We detect broad, predominantly blue, wings with velocities up to ~1500\nkm/s in [OIII], indicative of powerful outflows. The outflows are compact (<5\nkpc) and co-spatial with nuclear regions showing considerable reddening,\nconsistent with enhanced star formation. One source shows an offset between gas\nand stellar kinematics, consistent with either a bipolar flow or a\ncounter-rotating gas disk. We are not able to unambiguously identify the\nsources as binary AGN using our data, X-ray or radio data is required for an\nunambiguous identification.

However, a common drawback of fluorescence labels is\nthat their brightness is limited by optical saturation and photobleaching. As\nan alternative, plasmonic metal nanoparticles are very promising as optical\nlabels with no photobleaching and low optical saturation at realistic exciting\nintensities as was demonstrated in photoacoustic and photothermal sensing,\nimaging, and theranostics. However, plasmonic nanoparticles have wide\nabsorption spectra and are not fluorescent, which limits their spectral\nselectivity and multimodal functionality, respectively. Here we demonstrate\nexperimentally, both in vitro and in vivo, that spaser (surface plasmon\namplification by stimulated emission of radiation) provides unprecedented\nefficiency as a versatile tool in biomedical research and applications. This is\ndue to the unique combination of intense near-monochromatic stimulated emission\nand strongly enhanced absorption, free of optical saturation. Using soluble and\nbiocompatible uranine dye as a gain medium surrounding the gold nanocore as a\nplasmonic resonator, we demonstrate unprecedented spaser stimulated emission\nintensity (\"giant spasing\") and a narrow spectral width (0.8 nm), which are\nmore than ~380-fold and ~30-fold, respectively, better than in quantum dots as\nthe best conventional fluorescent nanoprobes.

The other two newly identified mechanisms could\nlead to total error flux cancellation under specific conditions and are\nexpected to have major implications on the global $\\theta_{13}$ knowledge\ntoday. First, Double Chooz, in its final configuration, is the only experiment\nbenefiting from a negligible reactor flux error due to a $\\sim$90\\% geometrical\nsuppression. Second, Daya Bay and RENO could benefit from their partial\ngeometrical cancellation, yielding a potential $\\sim$50\\% error suppression,\nthus significantly improving the global $\\theta_{13}$ precision today. And\nthird, we illustrate the rationale behind further error suppression upon the\nexploitation of the inter-reactor error correlations, so far neglected. So, our\npublication is a key step forward in the context of high precision neutrino\nreactor experiments providing insight on the suppression of their intrinsic\nflux error uncertainty, thus affecting past and current experimental results,\nas well as the design of future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 07:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

Accompanying synchrotron radio emission is produced\nby the shock interaction between the jet and the dense circumnuclear medium,\nsimilar to a gamma-ray burst afterglow. An open mystery, however, is the origin\nof the late-time radio rebrightening, which occurred well after the peak of the\njetted X-ray emission. Here, we systematically explore several proposed\nexplanations for this behavior by means of multi-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations coupled to a self-consistent radiative transfer calculation of the\nsynchrotron emission. Our main conclusion is that the radio afterglow of Swift\nJ1644+57 is not naturally explained by a jet with a one-dimensional top-hat\nangular structure.

Despite the ubiquitous nature of non-Gaussian noise, its\neffect on activated transitions between metastable states has so far not been\nunderstood in generality, notwithstanding prior work focusing on specific noise\ntypes and scaling regimes. Here, we present a unified framework for a general\nclass of non-Gaussian noise, which we take as any finite-intensity noise with\nindependent and stationary increments. Our framework identifies optimal escape\npaths as minima of a stochastic action, which enables us to derive analytical\nresults for the dominant scaling of the escape rates in the weak-noise regime\ngeneralizing the conventional Arrhenius law. We show that non-Gaussian noise\nalways induces a more efficient escape, by reducing the effective potential\nbarrier compared to the Gaussian case with the same noise intensity.\nSurprisingly, for a broad class of amplitude distributions even noise of\ninfinitesimally small intensity can induce an exponentially larger escape rate.\nAs the underlying reason we identify the appearance of discontinuous minimal\naction paths, for which escape from the metastable state involves a finite\njump. We confirm the existence of such paths by calculating the prefactor of\nthe escape rate, as well as by numerical simulations. Our results highlight\nfundamental differences in the escape behaviour of systems subject to thermal\nand non-thermal fluctuations, which can be tuned to optimize switching\nbehaviour in metastable systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 09:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 07:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-01"}

Although many mathematical models have been developed to\ndescribe the formation of blood capillaries (angiogenesis) very few have been\nproposed for the regeneration of the lymphatic network. Moreover,\nlymphangiogenesis is markedly distinct from angiogenesis, occurring at\ndifferent times and in a different manner. Here a model of five ordinary\ndifferential equations is presented to describe the formation of lymphatic\ncapillaries following a skin wound. The variables represent different cell\ndensities and growth factor concentrations, and where possible the parameters\nare estimated from experimental and clinical data. The system is then solved\nnumerically and the results are compared with the available biological\nliterature. Finally, a parameter sensitivity analysis of the model is taken as\na starting point for suggesting new therapeutic approaches targeting the\nenhancement of lymphangiogenesis in diabetic wounds. The work provides a deeper\nunderstanding of the phenomenon in question, clarifying the main factors\ninvolved. In particular, the balance between TGF-$\\beta$ and VEGF levels,\nrather than their absolute values, is identified as crucial to effective\nlymphangiogenesis.

We use the {\\tt RIDGE} pipeline for the\nanalysis, in which the network of LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, VIRGO, and\nKAGRA is considered. By combining with a GW spectrogram analysis, we show that\nseveral important hydrodynamics features in the original waveforms persist in\nthe waveforms of the reconstructed signals. The characteristic excess in the\nspectrograms originates not only from rotating core-collapse, bounce and the\nsubsequent ring down of the proto-neutron star (PNS) as previously identified,\nbut also from the formation of magnetohydrodynamics jets and non-axisymmetric\ninstabilities in the vicinity of the PNS. Regarding the GW signals emitted near\nat the rotating core bounce, the horizon distance extends up to $\\sim$ 18 kpc\nfor the most rapidly rotating 3D model in this work. Following the rotating\ncore bounce, the dominant source of the GW emission shifts to the\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities. The horizon distances extend maximally up to\n$\\sim$ 40 kpc seen from the spin axis. With an increasing number of 3D models\ntrending towards explosion recently, our results suggest that in addition to\nthe best studied GW signals due to rotating core-collapse and bounce, the time\nis ripe to consider how we can do science from GWs of CCSNe much more seriously\nthan before. Particularly the quasi-periodic signals due to the\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and the detectability should deserve further\ninvestigation to elucidate the inner-working of the rapidly rotating CCSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 12:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 02:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

Halo and\nrelic sources have been detected in several tens clusters. A strong correlation\nis present between the halo and relic radio power and the X-ray luminosity.\nSince cluster X-Ray luminosity and mass are related, the correlation between\nthe radio power and X-ray luminosity could derive from a physical dependence of\nthe radio power on the cluster mass, therefore the cluster mass could be a\ncrucial parameter in the formation of these sources. The goal of this project\nis to investigate the existence of non-thermal structures beyond the Mpc scale,\nand associated with lower density regions with respect to clusters of galaxies:\ngalaxy filaments connecting rich clusters. We present a piece of evidence of\ndiffuse radio emission in intergalactic filaments. Moreover, we present and\ndiscuss the detection of radio emission in galaxy groups and in faint X-Ray\nclusters, to analyze non-thermal properties in low density regions with\nphysical conditions similar to galaxy filaments. We discuss how SKA1\nobservations will allow the investigation of this topic and the study of the\npresence of diffuse radio sources in low density regions. This will be a\nfundamental step to understand the origin and properties of cosmological\nmagnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 11:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

Preconditioned Krylov\nsubspace methods are popular for these problems, with BiCGStab and GMRES(m)\nmost frequently used for nonsymmetric systems. BiCGStab is popular because it\nhas cheap iterations, but it may fail for stiff problems, especially early on\nas the initial guess is far from the solution. Restarted GMRES is better, more\nrobust, in this phase, but restarting may lead to very slow convergence.\nTherefore, we evaluate the rGCROT method for these systems. This method\nrecycles a selected subspace of the search space (called recycle space) after a\nrestart. This generally improves the convergence drastically compared with\nGMRES(m). Recycling subspaces is also advantageous for subsequent linear\nsystems, if the matrix changes slowly or is constant. However, rGCROT\niterations are still expensive in memory and computation time compared with\nthose of BiCGStab. Hence, we propose a new, hybrid approach that combines the\ncheap iterations of BiCGStab with the robustness of rGCROT. For the first few\ntime steps the algorithm uses rGCROT and builds an effective recycle space, and\nthen it recycles that space in the rBiCGStab solver. We evaluate rGCROT on a\nturbulent channel flow problem, and we evaluate both rGCROT and the new, hybrid\ncombination of rGCROT and rBiCGStab on a porous medium flow problem. We see\nsubstantial performance gains on both problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 01:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 22:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}
