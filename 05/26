These equations correspond to a single $N$th order Lovelock term in\nthe action in $d=2N+1,\\,2N+2$ dimensions, and they capture the relevant\ngravitational dynamics when aproaching the big-bang singularity within the\nLovelock family of theories. Pure Lovelock gravity also bears out the general\nfeature that vacuum in the critical odd dimension, $d=2N+1$, is kinematic; i.e.\nwe may define an analogue Lovelock-Riemann tensor that vanishes in vacuum for\n$d=2N+1$, yet the Riemann curvature is non-zero. We completely classify\nisotropic and vacuum Kasner metrics for this class of theories in several\nisotropy types. The different families can be characterized by means of certain\nhigher order 4th rank tensors. We also analyze in detail the space of vacuum\nsolutions for five and six dimensional pure Gauss-Bonnet theory. It possesses\nan interesting and illuminating geometric structure and symmetries that carry\nover to the general case. We also comment on a closely related family of\nexponential solutions and on the possibility of solutions with complex Kasner\nexponents. We show that the latter imply the existence of closed timelike\ncurves in the geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 16:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

The\nmagnetized states are doubly degenerate and consist of a many-particle\ntwo-state system. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium quantum\ndynamics by switching on an external perturbation to induce resonant couplings\nbetween the magnetized phases, and predict the novel quantum spin dynamics\nwhich cannot be obtained in the single-particle systems. In particular, due to\nparticle-particle interactions, the transition of the Bose condensate from one\nmagnetized phase to the other is forbidden when the strength of external\nperturbation is less than a critical value, and a full transition can occur\nonly when the perturbation exceeds such critical strength.

Optical and near infrared spectra that exhibit many\nhundreds of absorption lines can allow the m/s precision levels required for\nsuch work. However, this means that studies have generally focused on\nsolar-type dwarf stars. After the main-sequence, intermediate-mass stars\n(former A-F stars) expand and rotate slower than their progenitors, thus\nthousands of narrow absorption lines appear in the optical region, permitting\nthe search for planetary Doppler signals in the data for these types of stars.\nWe present the discovery of two giant planets around the intermediate-mass\nevolved star HIP65891 and HIP107773. The best Keplerian fit to the HIP65891 and\nHIP107773 radial velocities leads to the following orbital parameters: P=1084.5\nd; m$_b$sin$i$ = 6.0 M$_{jup}$; $e$=0.13 and P=144.3 d; m$_b$sin$i$ = 2.0\nM$_{jup}$; $e$=0.09, respectively. In addition, we confirm the planetary nature\nof the outer object orbiting the giant star HIP67851. The orbital parameters of\nHIP67851c are: P=2131.8 d, m$_c$sin$i$ = 6.0 M$_{jup}$ and $e$=0.17.

Based on the evolutionary states of those five stars, we\nconclude that close-in planets do exist in multiple systems around subgiants\nand slightly evolved giants stars, but probably they are subsequently destroyed\nby the stellar envelope during the ascent of the red giant branch phase.

In contrast, much less is known\nabout the role of quantum nonlocality in these systems, mostly because the\navailable multipartite Bell inequalities involve high-order correlations among\nmany particles, which are hard to access theoretically, and even harder\nexperimentally. Standard, \"theorist- and experimentalist-friendly\" many-body\nobservables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...)\nparticles. Typically, there is no multipartite Bell inequality for this\nscenario based on such low-order correlations. Recently, however, we have\nsucceeded in constructing multipartite Bell inequalities that involve two- and\none-body correlations only, and showed how they revealed the nonlocality in\nmany-body systems relevant for nuclear and atomic physics [Science 344, 1256\n(2014)]. With the present contribution we continue our work on this problem. On\nthe one hand, we present a detailed derivation of the above Bell inequalities,\npertaining to permutation symmetry among the involved parties. On the other\nhand, we present a couple of new results concerning such Bell inequalities.\nFirst, we characterize their tightness. We then discuss maximal quantum\nviolations of these inequalities in the general case, and their scaling with\nthe number of parties. Moreover, we provide new classes of two-body Bell\ninequalities which reveal nonlocality of the Dicke states---ground states of\nphysically relevant and experimentally realizable Hamiltonians. Finally, we\nshortly discuss various scenarios for nonlocality detection in mesoscopic\nsystems of trapped ions or atoms, and by atoms trapped in the vicinity of\ndesigned nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 20:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

In the case of a systematic attack to one's\nreputation, it might not be possible to manually discern between legitimate and\nfraudulent interaction within the huge universe of possibilities of\nuser-product recommendation. Previous works have focused on this issue, but\nnone of them took into account the context, modeling, and scale that we\nconsider in this paper. Here, we propose the novel method Online-Recommendation\nFraud ExcLuder (ORFEL) to detect defamation and/or illegitimate promotion of\nonline products by using vertex-centric asynchronous parallel processing of\nbipartite (users-products) graphs. With an innovative algorithm, our results\ndemonstrate both efficacy and efficiency -- over 95% of potential attacks were\ndetected, and ORFEL was at least two orders of magnitude faster than the\nstate-of-the-art. Over a novel methodology, our main contributions are: (1) a\nnew algorithmic solution; (2) one scalable approach; and (3) a novel context\nand modeling of the problem, which now addresses both defamation and\nillegitimate promotion.

We demonstrate that characteristic\nglass-formation behavior appears upon compression under appropriate conditions\nin such systems. In particular, while a rotational glass transition occurs only\nfor the ellipses, both types of particles undergo a kinetic arrest in the\ntranslational degrees of freedom at a single density. The translational\ndynamics for the ellipses is found to be faster than that for the disks within\nthe same system, indicating that shape anisotropy promotes the translational\nmotion of particles. We further examine the influence of mixture's composition\nand aspect ratio on the glass formation. For the mixtures with an ellipse\naspect ratio of $k=2$, both translational and rotational glass transition\ndensities decrease with increasing the disk concentration at a similar rate and\nhence, the two glass transitions remain close to each other at all\nconcentrations investigated. By elevating $k$, however, the rotational glass\ntransition density diminishes at a faster rate than the translational one,\nleading to the formation of an orientational glass for the ellipses between the\ntwo transitions. Our simulations imply that mixtures of particles with\ndifferent shapes emerge as a promising model for probing the role of particle\nshape in determining the properties of glass-forming liquids. Furthermore, our\nwork illustrates the potential of using knowledge concerning the dependence of\nglass-formation properties on mixture's composition and particle shape to\nassist in the rational design of amorphous materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 00:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Lensing phenomena and circular orbits are investigated for\nplasma density distributions $N \\propto 1/r^h$ with $h \\geq 0$ in the\nSchwarzschild space-time. For rays passing by the mass near the plasma\nfrequency refractive effects can dominate, effectively turning the\ngravitational lens into a mirror.

More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our\nsystem learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences\nbetween resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to\nsolve the inference problems efficiently.

They allow us to give definitions of forward and\nbackward simulation for various types of systems. A generic categorical theory\nbehind Kleisli simulation has been developed and it guarantees the soundness of\nthose simulations with respect to finite trace semantics. Moreover, those\nsimulations can be aided by forward partial execution (FPE)---a categorical\ntransformation of systems previously introduced by the authors.\n  In this paper, we give Kleisli simulation a theoretical foundation that\nassures its soundness also with respect to infinitary traces.

However, measuring\nthe volume-weighted velocity statistics from galaxy (halo/simulation particle)\nvelocity data is challenging. For the first time, we apply the Kriging\ninterpolation to obtain the volume-weighted velocity field. Kriging is a\nminimum variance estimator. It predicts the most likely velocity for each place\nbased on the velocity at other places. We test the performance of Kriging\nquantified by the E-mode velocity power spectrum from simulations. Dependences\non the variogram prior used in Kriging, the number $n_k$ of the nearby\nparticles to interpolate and the density $n_P$ of the observed sample are\ninvestigated. First, we find that Kriging induces $1\\%$ and $3\\%$ systematics\nat $k\\sim 0.1h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ when $n_P\\sim 6\\times 10^{-2} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$\nand $n_P\\sim 6\\times 10^{-3} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, respectively. The deviation\nincreases for decreasing $n_P$ and increasing $k$. When $n_P\\lesssim 6\\times\n10^{-4} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, a smoothing effect dominates small scales, causing\nsignificant underestimation of the velocity power spectrum. Second, increasing\n$n_k$ helps to recover small scale power. However, for $n_P\\lesssim 6\\times\n10^{-4} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$ cases, the recovery is limited. Finally, Kriging is\nmore sensitive to the variogram prior for lower sample density. The most\nstraightforward application of Kriging on the cosmic velocity field does not\nshow obvious advantages over the nearest-particle method (Zheng et al. 2013)\nand could not be directly applied to cosmology so far.

Each\nstreaming session is formed by the sequential transmission of video \"chunks,\"\nsuch that each chunk arrives into the corresponding user playback buffer within\nits playback deadline. We formulate the problem as a Network Utility\nMaximization (NUM) where the objective is to fairly maximize users' video\nstreaming Quality of Experience (QoE) and then derive an iterative control\npolicy using Lyapunov Optimization, which solves the NUM problem up to any\nlevel of accuracy and yields an online protocol with control actions at every\niteration decomposing into two layers interconnected by the users' request\nqueues : i) a video streaming adaptation layer reminiscent of DASH, implemented\nat each user node; ii) a transmission scheduling layer where a max-weight\nscheduler is implemented at each base station. The proposed chunk request\nscheme is a pull strategy where every user opportunistically requests video\nchunks from the neighboring base stations and dynamically adapts the quality of\nits requests based on the current size of the request queue. For the\ntransmission scheduling component, we first describe the general max-weight\nscheduler and then particularize it to a wireless network where the base\nstations have multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) beamforming capabilities. We exploit the\nchannel hardening effect of large-dimensional MIMO channels (massive MIMO) and\ndevise a low complexity user selection scheme to solve the underlying\ncombinatorial problem of selecting user subsets for downlink beamforming, which\ncan be easily implemented and run independently at each base station.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 08:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Even\nsimple consistency requirements often turn out to be unrealizable because of\nthe complicated information flow in the distributed system: not all information\nis available in every component, and information transmitted from other\ncomponents may arrive with a delay or not at all, especially in the presence of\nfaults. The problem of checking the distributed realizability of a temporal\nspecification is, in general, undecidable. Semi-algorithms for synthesis, such\nas bounded synthesis, are only useful in the positive case, where they\nconstruct an implementation for a realizable specification, but not in the\nnegative case: if the specification is unrealizable, the search for the\nimplementation never terminates. In this paper, we introduce counterexamples to\ndistributed realizability and present a method for the detection of such\ncounterexamples for specifications given in linear-time temporal logic (LTL). A\ncounterexample consists of a set of paths, each representing a different\nsequence of inputs from the environment, such that, no matter how the\ncomponents are implemented, the specification is violated on at least one of\nthese paths. We present a method for finding such counterexamples both for the\nclassic distributed realizability problem and for the fault-tolerant\nrealizability problem. Our method considers, incrementally, larger and larger\nsets of paths until a counterexample is found. For safety specifications in\nweakly ordered architectures we obtain a decision procedure, while\ncounterexamples for full LTL and arbitrary architectures may consist of\ninfinitely many paths. Experimental results, obtained with a QBF-based\nprototype implementation, show that our method finds simple errors very\nquickly, and even problems with high combinatorial complexity, like the\nByzantine Generals' Problem, are tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 09:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 17:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

This is why phylogenetic networks, which can display such events, are\nbecoming of more and more interest in phylogenetic research. It is therefore\nnecessary to extend concepts like maximum parsimony from phylogenetic trees to\nnetworks. Several suggestions for possible extensions can be found in recent\nliterature, for instance the softwired and the hardwired parsimony concepts. In\nthis paper, we analyze the so-called big parsimony problem under these two\nconcepts, i.e. we investigate maximum parsimonious networks and analyze their\nproperties. In particular, we show that finding a softwired maximum parsimony\nnetwork is possible in polynomial time.

We pursue forward seismic modelling based\non adiabatic eigenfrequencies of equilibrium models for eight extensive\nevolutionary grids tuned to KIC 10526294, by varying the initial mass,\nmetallicity, chemical mixture, and the extent of the overshooting layer on top\nof the convective core.

Superpotentials of\ntribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,\nwhich is often taken as the Planck scale.

One of the main\nchallenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each\nsequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Due to the large volume of\nmetagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that\ncan operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard\nalignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional\napproaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it\ncontains have the potential to provide faster solutions. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of modern, large-scale machine learning\nimplementations for taxonomic affectation of next-generation sequencing reads\nbased on their k-mers profile. We show that machine learning-based\ncompositional approaches benefit from increasing the number of fragments\nsampled from reference genome to tune their parameters, up to a coverage of\nabout 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning these models\ninvolves training a machine learning model on about 10 8 samples in 10 7\ndimensions, which is out of reach of standard soft-wares but can be done\nefficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The\nresulting models are competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established\nalignment tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate\nspecies, and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however,\nthat compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with\nproblems involving a greater number of species, and more sensitive to\nsequencing errors. We finally confirm that compositional approach achieve\nfaster prediction times, with a gain of 3 to 15 times with respect to the\nBWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the\nlevel of sequencing noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 12:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The LIRG Zw 049.057 contains a compact obscured nucleus where a\nconsiderable amount of the galaxy's luminosity is generated. This nucleus\ncontains a dusty environment that is rich in molecular gas. One approach to\nprobing this kind of environment and to revealing what is hidden behind the\ndust is to study the rotational lines of molecules that couple well with the IR\nradiation emitted by the dust. Methods. We observed Zw 049.057 with PACS and\nSPIRE onboard the Herschel Space Observatory in rotational lines of H2O, H218O,\nOH, 18OH, and [O I]. We modeled the unresolved core of the galaxy using a\nspherically symmetric radiative transfer code. Results. We present the full\nSPIRE FTS spectrum of Zw 049.057, along with relevant spectral scans in the\nPACS range. We find that a minimum of two different components (nuclear and\nextended) are required in order to account for the rich molecular line\nspectrum. The nuclear component has a radius of 10-30 pc, a very high infrared\nsurface brightness (1e14 Lsun/kpc2), warm dust (Td > 100 K), and a very large\nH2 column density (NH2 = 1e24-1e25 cm-2). The modeling also indicates high\nnuclear H2O (5e-6) and OH (4e-6) abundances relative to H2 as well as a low\n16O/18O-ratio of 50-100. We also find a prominent infall signature in the [O I]\nline. We tentatively detect a 500 km/s outflow in the H2O 313->202 line.\nConclusions. The high surface brightness of the core indicates the presence of\neither a buried active galactic nucleus or a very dense nuclear starburst.nThe\nH2O abundance is comparable to that of other compact (ultra-)luminous infrared\ngalaxies such as NGC 4418 and Arp 220 - and also to hot cores in the Milky Way.\nThe enhancement of 18O is a possible indicator that the nucleus of Zw 049.057\nis in a similar evolutionary stage as the nuclei of Arp 220 - and more advanced\nthan NGC 4418.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 13:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

In contrast with payoffs\nfrom regular Asian options which are based on average asset prices, the payoffs\nfrom conditional Asian options are determined only by average prices above\ncertain threshold. Due to the limited inclusion of prices, conditional Asian\noptions further reduce the volatility in the payoffs than their regular\ncounterparts and have been promoted in the market as viable hedging and risk\nmanagement instruments for equity-linked life insurance products.

In this paper we combine results from two Herschel studies\n- a Virgo cluster study HeViCS and a broader, low-redshift H-ATLAS/GAMA study -\nand contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies. This\ncomparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multiple\nHerschel studies of early-type galaxies. A comparison between consistent\nmodified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out, revealing strong\ndifferences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar mass\nratio. In particular, the HeViCS sample lacks massive ETG with as high a\nspecific dust content as found in H-ATLAS. This is most likely connected with\nthe difference in environment for the two samples. We calculate nearest\nneighbour environment densities in a consistent way, showing that H-ATLAS ETG\noccupy sparser regions of the local Universe, whereas HeViCS ETG occupy dense\nregions. This is also true for ETG that are not Herschel-detected but are in\nthe Virgo and GAMA parent samples. Spectral energy distributions are fit to the\npanchromatic data. From these we find that in H-ATLAS the specific star\nformation rate anticorrelates with stellar mass and reaches values as high as\nin our Galaxy. On the other hand HeViCS ETG appear to have little star\nformation. Based on the trends found here, H-ATLAS ETG are thought to have more\nextended star formation histories and a younger stellar population than HeViCS\nETG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 13:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

A number of physical models are still competing to\nexplain the jet structure and kinematics revealed by radio images using the\nVLBI technique. Robust measurements of longitudinal and transverse velocity\nfield in the jets would provide crucial information for these models. This is a\ndifficult task, particularly for transversely resolved jets in objects like 3C\n273 and M87. To address this task, we have developed a new technique for\nidentifying significant structural patterns (SSP) of smooth, transversely\nresolved flows and obtaining a velocity field from cross-correlation of these\nregions in multi-epoch observations. Detection of individual SSP is performed\nusing the wavelet decomposition and multiscale segmentation of the observed\nstructure. The cross-correlation algorithm combines structural information on\ndifferent scales of the wavelet decomposition, providing a robust and reliable\nidentification of related SSP in multi -epoch images. The algorithm enables\nrecovering structural evolution on scales down to 0.25 full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of the image point spread function (PSF). We present here\nexamples of applying this algorithm to obtain the first detailed transverse\nvelocity fields and to study the kinematic evolution in the parsec-scale jets\nin 3C 273 and M87.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 13:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The useful ingredients for this are the equilibrium entropy\nassociated with thermal density matrix and the relative entropy between an\narbitrary density matrix and the thermal density matrix.

To understand the mechanism of development of age spots,\ncharacteristics of age spots are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism\nintroduced in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. An age spot is\npathologically a group of aggregated basal cells, which contain lipofuscin\nbodies. Accumulation of lipofuscin bodies is a sign of aging of a cell.\nCharacteristics of age spots include: inhomogeneity in distribution, growing\nflatly before becoming protruding, irregularity on shape, inhomogeneity on the\ncolor and on the protruding degree of a spot, and softness of a protruding\nspot. After analyzing these characteristics, we make a hypothesis on the\nprocess of development of an age spot. A. Aging of a tissue is the basis for\ndevelopment of age spots. B. A flat spot results from accumulation of\nlipofuscin containing cells. When an aged cell remains, this cell can\naccelerate the aging of its neighbor cells by increasing damage sensitivity and\nreducing repair efficiency of the local tissue. By a viscous circle, more and\nmore neighbor cells become aged and they form a flat spot, which has an\nirregular shape. C. A protruding spot develops when some of the cells in a flat\nspot die and release lipofuscin bodies. For the survival of an organism, the un\ndegradable lipofuscin bodies have to be isolated by a capsule made by fibrotic\nmembrane, for maintaining the structural integrity of local epidermis.\nSuccessive deaths of lipofuscin containing cells make the capsule include more\nand more dead substances by layers of fibrotic membrane. In this way, the spot\n\"grows\" in three-dimension, resulting in protruding of the spot. In conclusion,\ndevelopment of an age spot is a result of accumulation of aged cells in aged\nskin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 15:31:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 10:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-06"}

With a new concept of Misrepair, this theory reaches a unified\nunderstanding of aging: aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of\nMisrepairs of its structure. Misrepair accumulation theory (MA theory) is\ndistinct and it can improve our understanding of life on several aspects. I. MA\ntheory is fundamentally different from other theories by: A. proposing a\ngeneralized concept of Misrepair; B. pointing out the evolutionary advantage of\naging mechanism; and C. distinguishing between aging of a cell and aging of a\ntissue. II. MA theory overcomes the limitations of traditional theories on\ninterpreting the phenomena of tissue fibrosis and cancer development. Tissue\nfibrosis, as a result of accumulation of Misrepairs with collagen fibers, is a\npowerful evidence for demonstrating the central role of Misrepairs in aging.\nCancer development is a result of accumulation of DNA Misrepairs in somatic\ncells, which needs to proceed over many generations of cells in a regenerable\ntissue. III. MA theory improves also our understanding on longevity, premature\naging, adaptation, and species evolution. The potential of longevity of an\norganism is hidden in the complexity of its structure. IV.

In addition, we study the shadow that the collapsing cloud\ncasts on the sky of the asymptotic observer. We find that the resulting\nredshift and properties of the shadow depend crucially on whether the final\noutcome of the complete gravitational collapse is a black hole or a naked\nsingularity. In the black hole case, the shadow is due to the high redshift\nacquired by the photons as they approach the event horizon, implying that their\nenergy is gradually redshifted toward zero within a few crossing times\nassociated with the event horizon radius. In contrast to this, a naked\nsingularity not only absorbs photons originating from the source, but it also\nemits infinitely redshifted photons with and without angular momenta. This\nemission introduces an abrupt cutoff in the frequency shift of the photons\ndetected in directions close to the radial one, and it is responsible for the\nshadow masking the source in the naked singularity case. Furthermore, even\nthough the shadow forms and begins to grow immediately after the observer\ncrosses the Cauchy horizon, it takes many more crossing times than in the black\nhole case for the source to be occulted from the observer's eyes. We discuss\npossible implications of our results for testing the weak cosmic censorship\nhypothesis. Even though at late times the image of the source perceived by the\nobserver looks the same in both cases, the dynamical formation of the shadow\nand the redshift images has distinct features and time scales in the black hole\nversus the naked singularity case. For stellar collapse, these time scales seem\nto be too short to be resolved with existing technology. However, our results\nmay be relevant for the collapse of seeds leading to supermassive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 15:42:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 14:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

The lobes are separate bodies, though sufficiently similar to\nhave formed in the same environment.

A collisional origin of the\ncontact binary is suggested, and the low bulk density of the aggregate and\nabundance of volatile species show that a very gentle merger must have\noccurred.

Today there is a considerable interest\nin estimating the geometric mean of a SPD matrix set in the manifold of SPD\nmatrices endowed with the Fisher information metric. The resulting mean has\nseveral important invariance properties and has proven very useful in diverse\nengineering applications such as biomedical and image data processing. While\nfor two SPD matrices the mean has an algebraic closed form solution, for a set\nof more than two SPD matrices it can only be estimated by iterative algorithms.\nHowever, none of the existing iterative algorithms feature at the same time\nfast convergence, low computational complexity per iteration and guarantee of\nconvergence. For this reason, recently other definitions of geometric mean\nbased on symmetric divergence measures, such as the Bhattacharyya divergence,\nhave been considered. The resulting means, although possibly useful in\npractice, do not satisfy all desirable invariance properties. In this paper we\nconsider geometric means of co-variance matrices estimated on high-dimensional\ntime-series, assuming that the data is generated according to an instantaneous\nmixing model, which is very common in signal processing. We show that in these\ncircumstances we can approximate the Fisher information geometric mean by\nemploying an efficient AJD algorithm. Our approximation is in general much\ncloser to the Fisher information geometric mean as compared to its competitors\nand verifies many invariance properties. Furthermore, convergence is\nguaranteed, the computational complexity is low and the convergence rate is\nquadratic. The accuracy of this new geometric mean approximation is\ndemonstrated by means of simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 12:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

The planetary motion in such systems depends strongly on\nboth the parameters of the stellar system (stellar separation and eccentricity)\nand the architecture of the planetary system (number of planets and their\norbital behaviour). In case a terrestrial planet moves in the so-called\nhabitable zone (HZ) of its host star, the habitability of this planet depends\non many parameters. A crucial factor is certainly the amount of water.

Traditionally, estimates of running times of such sampling algorithms\nare computed using the number of steps in the chain needed to reach the\nstationary distribution. This quantity is generally defined as mixing time and\nis often difficult to compute. In this paper, we suggest an alternative\nestimate based on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, by establishing a link between\nthe maximization of KSE and the minimization of the mixing time. Since KSE are\neasier to compute in general than mixing time, this link provides a new faster\nmethod to approximate the minimum mixing time that could be interesting in\ncomputer sciences and statistical physics. Beyond this, our finding will also\nbe of interest to the out-of-equilibrium community, by providing a new rational\nto select stationary states in out-of-equilibrium physics: it seems reasonable\nthat in a physical system with two simultaneous equiprobable possible dynamics,\nthe final stationary state will be closer to the stationary state corresponding\nto the fastest dynamics (smallest mixing time).Through the empirical link found\nin this letter, this state will correspond to a state of maximal\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy. If this is true, this would provide a more satisfying\nrule for selecting stationary states in complex systems such as climate than\nthe maximization of the entropy production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 08:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}
