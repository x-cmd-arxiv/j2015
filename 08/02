Here we focus in particular on static\nfriction, the minimal sliding force necessary to depin one lattice from the\nother. If the colloid and the optical lattices are mutually commensurate, the\ncolloid sliding is always pinned by static friction; but when they are\nincommensurate the presence or absence of pinning can be expected to depend\nupon the system parameters. If a 2D analogy to the mathematically established\nAubry transition of one-dimensional systems were to hold, an increasing\nperiodic corrugation strength $U_0$ should turn an initially free-sliding\nmonolayer into a pinned state through a well-defined dynamical phase\ntransition. We address this problem by the simulated sliding of a realistic\nmodel 2D colloidal lattice, confirming the existence of a clear and sharp\nsuperlubric-pinned transition for increasing corrugation strength. Unlike the\n1D Aubry transition which is continuous, the 2D transition exhibits a definite\nfirst-order character. With no change of symmetry, the transition entails a\nstructural character, with a sudden increase of the colloid-colloid interaction\nenergy, accompanied by a compensating downward jump of the colloid-corrugation\nenergy. The transition value for the corrugation amplitude $U_0$ depends upon\nthe misalignment angle $\\theta$ between the optical and the colloidal lattices,\nsuperlubricity surviving until larger corrugations for angles away from the\nenergetically favored orientation, which is itself generally slightly\nmisaligned, as shown in recent work. The observability of the\nsuperlubric-pinned colloid transition is proposed and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 17:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

For a general discrete\nmemoryless broadcast interference channel (DM-BIC), an achievable scheme based\non message splitting, superposition and binning is proposed and a concise\nrepresentation of the corresponding achievable rate region R is obtained. Two\npartial-order broadcast conditions interference-oblivious less noisy and\ninterference-cognizant less noisy are defined, thereby extending the usual less\nnoisy condition for a regular broadcast channel by taking interference into\naccount. Under these conditions, a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent\nto a rate region based on a simpler scheme, where the broadcast transmitter\nuses only superposition. Furthermore, if interference is strong for the\ninterference-oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, the capacity region is given by the\naforementioned two equivalent rate regions.

Moreover, we\napply randomly permuted ADMM (RPADMM) to nonseparable multi-block convex\noptimization, and prove its expected convergence for a class of nonseparable\nquadratic programming problems. When the linear constraint vanishes, the\n2-block proximal ADMM and RPADMM reduce to the 2-block cyclic proximal BCD\nmethod and randomly permuted BCD (RPBCD). Our study provides the first iterate\nconvergence result for 2-block cyclic proximal BCD without assuming the\nboundedness of the iterates. We also theoretically establish the expected\niterate convergence result concerning multi-block RPBCD for convex quadratic\noptimization. In addition, we demonstrate that RPBCD may have a worse\nconvergence rate than cyclic proximal BCD for 2-block convex quadratic\nminimization problems. Although the results on RPADMM and RPBCD are restricted\nto quadratic minimization models, they provide some interesting insights: 1)\nrandom permutation makes ADMM and BCD more robust for multi-block convex\nminimization problems; 2) cyclic BCD may outperform RPBCD for \"nice\" problems,\nand therefore RPBCD should be applied with caution when solving general convex\noptimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 04:47:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 06:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 00:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 00:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

Recently, a novel type of antisymmetric exchange interaction,\nnamely the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), has been uncovered and\nfound to influence the formation of topological defects. Exploring how the DMI\naffects the dynamics of topological defects is therefore an important task.\nHere we investigate the dynamic domain wall (DW) under a strong DMI and find\nthat the DMI induces an annihilation of topological vertical Bloch lines (VBLs)\nby lifting the four-fold degeneracy of the VBL. As a result, velocity reduction\noriginating from the Walker breakdown is completely suppressed, leading to a\nsoliton-like constant velocity of the DW. Furthermore, the strength of the DMI,\nwhich is the key factor for soliton-like DW motion, can be quantified without\nany side effects possibly arising from current-induced torques or extrinsic\npinnings in magnetic films.

However, comparing to sophisticated deep learning\narchitectures such as convolutional neural networks, these methods usually\nyield inferior results when applied to particular machine learning tasks. One\npossible reason is that these text embedding methods learn the representation\nof text in a fully unsupervised way, without leveraging the labeled information\navailable for the task. Although the low dimensional representations learned\nare applicable to many different tasks, they are not particularly tuned for any\ntask. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a semi-supervised\nrepresentation learning method for text data, which we call the\n\\textit{predictive text embedding} (PTE). Predictive text embedding utilizes\nboth labeled and unlabeled data to learn the embedding of text. The labeled\ninformation and different levels of word co-occurrence information are first\nrepresented as a large-scale heterogeneous text network, which is then embedded\ninto a low dimensional space through a principled and efficient algorithm. This\nlow dimensional embedding not only preserves the semantic closeness of words\nand documents, but also has a strong predictive power for the particular task.\nCompared to recent supervised approaches based on convolutional neural\nnetworks, predictive text embedding is comparable or more effective, much more\nefficient, and has fewer parameters to tune.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 06:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

The observations, obtained with the first station\nof the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1), show unprecedented detail of solar\nemissions across a wide bandwidth during a Type III/IIIb storm. Our flux\ncalibration demonstrates that the LWA1 can detect Type III bursts much weaker\nthan 1 SFU, much lower than previous observations, and that the distribution of\nfluxes in these bursts varies with frequency. The high sensitivity and low\nnoise in the data provide strong constraints to models of this type of plasma\nemission. The continuous generation of electron beams in the corona revealed by\nthe high density Type III storm is evidence for ubiquitous magnetic\nreconnection in the lower corona. Such an abundance of reconnection events not\nonly contributes to the total coronal energy budget, but also provides an\nengine by which to form the populations of seed particles responsible for\nproton-rich solar energetic particle events. An active region with such levels\nof reconnection and the accompanying type III/IIIb storms is here proposed to\nbe associated with an increase of SEP production if a CME erupts. The data's\nconstraints on existing theories of type IIIIb production are used to make an\nassociation of the observed type IIIb storm to specific electron beam paths\nwith increased inhomogeneities in density, temperature, and or turbulence. This\nscenario ties in the observed timing of III and IIIb storms, constrained\ntheories of type III and IIIb emission, and the ability of the emitting AR to\nproduce a strong SEP event.

The first part of the paper will\nset up the necessary tools to understand this correspondence for interesting\ncases of the minimal SME photon sector.

We then\nstudy some specific character sums that show up when dealing with false poles.\nIn contrast with the context of the trivial character, we here need to show\nfakeness of certain poles in addition to the candidate poles contributed by\n$B_1$-facets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 13:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

An explicit\nnumerical scheme is employed in both deterministic and stochastic examples. The\nscheme is checked for accuracy against known exact analytical solutions for\ndeterministic equations. In the stochastic case with $F=0$, solutions yield\nsample paths for the Brownian sheet whose statistics match well exact values.\nGenerally the boundary conditions are chosen to be initial values $Y(x,0)$ and\nboundary values $Y(0,t)$ on the quarter-plane or subsets thereof, which have\nbeen shown to lead to existence and uniqueness of solutions. For the linear\ncase solutions are compared at various grid sizes and wave-like solutions were\nfound, with and without noise, for non-zero initial and boundary conditions.\nSurprisingly, wave-like structures seemed to emerge with zero initial and\nboundary conditions and purely noise source terms with no signal. Equations\nconsidered with nonlinear $F$ included quadratic and cubic together with the\nsine-Gordon equation. For the latter, wave-like structures were apparent with\n$\\sigma \\le 0.25$ but they tended to be shattered at larger values of $\\sigma$.\nPrevious work on stochastic sine-Gordon equations is briefly reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2015 09:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-10"}

In the\npresent work we demonstrate that this paradoxical property can arise even in\nquite simple systems such as a chain of reactions obeying mass action kinetics.\nBy mathematical analysis of simple reaction networks, we pin-point the reason\nwhy the standard relaxation time does not provide relevant information on the\npotentially long transient times of typical infinitesimal perturbations.\nOverall, we consider four characteristic times and study their behavior in both\nsimple chains and in more complex reaction networks taken from the publicly\navailable database \"Biomodels.\" In all these systems involving mass action\nrates, Michaelis-Menten reversible kinetics, or phenomenological laws for\nreaction rates, we find that the characteristic times corresponding to\nlifetimes of tracers and of concentration perturbations can be much longer than\n$\\tau$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 17:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}
