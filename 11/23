In this paper we consider a\ngeneral framework of local 2k + 1 point schemes containing LeVeque's scheme\n(denoted as LTS-Godunov) as a member. A modified equation analysis allows us to\ninterpret each numerical cell interface coefficient of the framework as a\npartial numerical viscosity coefficient.\n  We identify the least and most diffusive TVD schemes in this framework. The\nmost diffusive scheme is the 2k + 1-point Lax-Friedrichs scheme (LTS-LxF). The\nleast diffusive scheme is the Large Time Step scheme of LeVeque based on Roe\nupwinding (LTS-Roe). Herein, we prove a generalization of Harten's lemma: all\npartial numerical viscosity coefficients of any local unconditionally TVD\nscheme are bounded by the values of the corresponding coefficients of the\nLTS-Roe and LTS-LxF schemes.\n  We discuss the nature of entropy violations associated with the LTS-Roe\nscheme, in particular we extend the notion of transonic rarefactions to the LTS\nframework. We provide explicit inequalities relating the numerical viscosities\nof LTS-Roe and LTS-Godunov across such generalized transonic rarefactions, and\ndiscuss numerical entropy fixes. Finally, we propose a one-parameter family of\nLarge Time Step TVD schemes spanning the entire range of the admissible total\nnumerical viscosity. Extensions to nonlinear systems are obtained through the\nRoe linearization. The 1D Burgers equation and the Euler system are used as\nnumerical illustrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 16:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

A\nclassic algorithm for these problems constructs and simulates a\nnon-deterministic finite automaton corresponding to the expression, resulting\nin an $O(mn)$ running time (where $m$ is the length of the pattern and $n$ is\nthe length of the text). This running time can be improved slightly (by a\npolylogarithmic factor), but no significantly faster solutions are known. At\nthe same time, much faster algorithms exist for various special cases of\nregular expressions, including dictionary matching, wildcard matching, subset\nmatching, word break problem etc.\n  In this paper, we show that the complexity of regular expression matching can\nbe characterized based on its {\\em depth} (when interpreted as a formula). Our\nresults hold for expressions involving concatenation, OR, Kleene star and\nKleene plus. For regular expressions of depth two (involving any combination of\nthe above operators), we show the following dichotomy: matching and membership\ntesting can be solved in near-linear time, except for \"concatenations of\nstars\", which cannot be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time assuming the\nStrong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For regular expressions of depth\nthree the picture is more complex. Nevertheless, we show that all problems can\neither be solved in strongly sub-quadratic time, or cannot be solved in\nstrongly sub-quadratic time assuming SETH.\n  An intriguing special case of membership testing involves regular expressions\nof the form \"a star of an OR of concatenations\", e.g., $[a|ab|bc]^*$. This\ncorresponds to the so-called {\\em word break} problem, for which a dynamic\nprogramming algorithm with a runtime of (roughly) $O(n\\sqrt{m})$ is known.

For nearly two decades, Rayleigh analysis\nof dielectric and piezoelectric response at sub-coercive fields has been used\nas a phenomenological tool to determine the relative contribution of domain\nwalls in influencing polar properties in these systems. The high value of the\nextrinsic Rayleigh coefficient at the MPB is generally attributed to enhanced\ndomain mobility. Using coercive field as a measure of hindrance to domain\nmobility, in this paper, we have examined the correlation between the extrinsic\nRayleigh coefficient, piezoelectric response, and coercive field (EC) by a\ncomparative study on three different high performance piezoelectrics (i)\n(BaTi0.88Sn0.12)-(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3, (ii) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and (iii) PbTiO3-BiScO3\nacross their respective MPBs.

Contrary to the common perception, our study reveals that\nlarge value of the Rayleigh coefficient at the MPB is not necessarily\nindicative of enhanced domain mobility. We argue that the large piezoresponse\nin MPB systems is a result of complex interplay of field induced motion of the\ninterphase boundaries and domain walls. In the lead-based systems the\ninterphase boundary motion hinders domain wall mobility. The large value of the\nRayleigh coefficient and piezoresponse in the Pb-based systems is because of\nthe dominant role of the interphase boundary motion instead of the enhanced\ndomain wall mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 02:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 09:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

Supervised domain adaptation methods\nminimize cross-domain differences using pairs of aligned images that contain\nthe same object or scene in both the source and target domains, thus learning a\ndomain-invariant representation. However, they require manual alignment of such\nimage pairs. Fully unsupervised adaptation methods rely on minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the feature distributions across domains.

On theone hand, can deep directed models be success-fully\ntrained without intractable posterior infer-ence and difficult optimization of\nvery deep neu-ral networks in inference and generative mod-els? These are\nunavoidable when recent suc-cessful directed model like VAE (Kingma &Welling,\n2014) is trained on complex dataset likereal images. On the other hand, can\nDAEs getclean samples of data distribution from heavilycorrupted samples which\ncan be considered oftractable prior distribution far from data mani-fold?\nso-called global denoising scheme.Our results show positive responses of\nthesequestions and this work can provide fairly simpleframework for generative\nmodels of very com-plex dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 06:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 19:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

We have carried out a detailed study on structure and\nlattice dynamics of the equilibrium phase (AA). AA undergoes a phase transition\nto TTZ at around $\\sim$ 39-43 GPa followed by TTZ to HNS-1 at around 80-90 GPa\nunder the studied temperature range of 0-650 K. The accelerated and decelerated\ncompression of $a$ and $c$ lattice constants suggest that the ambient phase of\nAA transforms to a tetragonal phase and then to a low symmetry structure with\nless anisotropy up on further compression. We have noticed that the angle made\nby Type-II azides with $c$-axis shows a rapid decrease and reaches a minimum\nvalue at 12 GPa, and thereafter increases up to 50 GPa. Softening of the shear\nelastic moduli is suggestive of a mechanical instability of AA under high\npressure. In addition, we have also performed density functional perturbation\ntheory calculations to obtain the vibrational spectrum of AA at ambient as well\nas at high pressures. Further, we have made a complete assignment of all the\nvibrational modes which is in good agreement with the experimental observations\nat ambient pressure. Also the calculated pressure dependent IR spectra show\nthat the N-H stretching frequencies undergo a red and blue-shift corresponding\nto strengthening and weakening of hydrogen bonding, respectively below and\nabove 4 GPa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 08:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

This model has been traditionally studied in\ncomplete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex\nsystems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as\ncomplex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the\nfield of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we\nprovide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global\ndynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which\nencompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis\nof several numerical results.

In this work, we focus on the\nquality of the synthesized solution: we aim to infer synchronization placements\nthat not only ensure correctness, but also meet some quantitative objectives\nsuch as optimal program performance on a given computing platform.\n  The key step that enables solution optimization is the construction of a set\nof global constraints over synchronization placements such that each model of\nthe constraints set corresponds to a correctness-ensuring synchronization\nplacement. We extract the global constraints from generalizations of\ncounterexample traces and the control-flow graph of the program. The global\nconstraints enable us to choose from among the encoded synchronization\nsolutions using an objective function. We consider two types of objective\nfunctions: ones that are solely dependent on the program (e.g., minimizing the\nsize of critical sections) and ones that are also dependent on the computing\nplatform. For the latter, given a program and a computing platform, we\nconstruct a performance model based on measuring average contention for\ncritical sections and the average time taken to acquire and release a lock\nunder a given average contention.\n  We empirically evaluated that our approach scales to typical module sizes of\nmany real world concurrent programs such as device drivers and multithreaded\nservers, and that the performance predictions match reality. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach for optimizing the\nplacement of synthesized synchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 10:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

CUDA is now a\npopular programming model for general purpose computations on GPUs and a great\nnumber of applications were ported to CUDA obtaining speedups of orders of\nmagnitude comparing to optimized CPU implementations. Hybrid approaches that\ncombine the message passing model with the shared memory model for parallel\ncomputing are a solution for very large applications. We considered a\nheterogeneous cluster that combines the CPU and GPU computations using MPI and\nCUDA for developing a high performance linear algebra library. Our library\ndeals with large linear systems solvers because they are a common problem in\nthe fields of science and engineering. Direct methods for computing the\nsolution of such systems can be very expensive due to high memory requirements\nand computational cost. An efficient alternative are iterative methods which\ncomputes only an approximation of the solution. In this paper we present an\nimplementation of a library that uses a hybrid model of computation using MPI\nand CUDA implementing both direct and iterative linear systems solvers. Our\nlibrary implements LU and Cholesky factorization based solvers and some of the\nnon-stationary iterative methods using the MPI/CUDA combination. We compared\nthe performance of our MPI/CUDA implementation with classic programs written to\nbe run on a single CPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 11:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

An impact of an\nanion (acetate) on the cation solvation regularities is discussed. Unlike\noxygen, nitrogen of the morpholine ring is a strong electrophilic binding\ncenter. This site is responsible for the interactions of the cation with the\nsolvent and with the anion. In protic MBILs, the role of nitrogen is delegated\nto the proton, which is linked to nitrogen. The acetate anion weakens solvation\nof the cation due to occupation of space near nitrogen or proton. The analysis\nreveals a favorable solvation of MBILs in ACN, which is a prerequisite for a\nnew high-performance electrolyte system. The reported structural data are\nvalidated through a point-to-point comparison with the MP2 post-Hartree-Fock\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 12:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

Secondly, the face appearance varies more dramatically\nacross large poses, ranging from frontal view to profile view. Thirdly,\nlabelling landmarks in large poses is extremely challenging since the invisible\nlandmarks have to be guessed. In this paper, we propose a solution to the three\nproblems in an new alignment framework, called 3D Dense Face Alignment (3DDFA),\nin which a dense 3D face model is fitted to the image via convolutional neutral\nnetwork (CNN).

In this\npaper, we present a study of the CLVI and CLVP in continuum spectra considering\ndifferent contributions of scattering and absorption opacity for different\nspectral type stars with spherical atmospheres. We solve the polarized\nradiative transfer equation in the presence of continuum scattering,\nconsidering spherical stellar model atmospheres. We developed two independent\ncodes based on Feautrier and short characteristics methods to cross-check our\nresults.

In\npractice however, most evaluation scenarios only allow us to conclusively\ndetermine the relevance towards the particular assessor that provided the\njudgments. A factor that cannot be ignored when extending conclusions made from\nassessors towards users, is the possible disagreement on relevance, assuming\nthat a single gold truth label does not exist. This paper presents and analyzes\nthe Predicted Relevance Model (PRM), which allows predicting a particular\nresult's relevance for a random user, based on an observed assessment and\nknowledge on the average disagreement between assessors. With the PRM, existing\nevaluation metrics designed to measure binary assessor relevance, can be\ntransformed into more robust and effectively graded measures that evaluate\nrelevance towards a random user. It also leads to a principled way of\nquantifying multiple graded or categorical relevance levels for use as gains in\nestablished graded relevance measures, such as normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (nDCG), which nowadays often use heuristic and data-independent gain\nvalues. Given a set of test topics with graded relevance judgments, the PRM\nallows evaluating systems on different scenarios, such as their capability of\nretrieving top results, or how well they are able to filter out non-relevant\nones. Its use in actual evaluation scenarios is illustrated on several\ninformation retrieval test collections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 14:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

As a\ngeneralization of fractal analysis, multifractal analysis (MFA) is a useful way\nto systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and\nexperimental fractal patterns. Some algorithms for MFA of unweighted complex\nnetworks have been proposed in the past a few years, including the sandbox (SB)\nalgorithm recently employed by our group. In this paper, a modified SB\nalgorithm (we call it SBw algorithm) is proposed for MFA of weighted\nnetworks.First, we use the SBw algorithm to study the multifractal property of\ntwo families of weighted fractal networks (WFNs): \"Sierpinski\" WFNs and \"Cantor\ndust\" WFNs. We also discuss how the fractal dimension and generalized fractal\ndimensions change with the edge-weights of the WFN. From the comparison between\nthe theoretical and numerical fractal dimensions of these networks, we can find\nthat the proposed SBw algorithm is efficient and feasible for MFA of weighted\nnetworks. Then, we apply the SBw algorithm to study multifractal properties of\nsome real weighted networks ---collaboration networks. It is found that the\nmultifractality exists in these weighted networks, and is affected by their\nedge-weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 14:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared\nto the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have\nnegative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero\nlike batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts\ntoward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the\nunit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and\nPReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust\ndeactivation state.

Therefore,\nELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while\nthey do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence.

Dieser Vorgang wird\n\"Klassifizierung\" genannt. Dazu verwendet er die Struktur des Graphen sowie\ntextuelle Informationen, die den Knoten zugeordnet sind. Die von Aggarwal und\nLi beschriebene experimentelle Analyse ergab, dass er auch auf dynamischen\nGraphen mit 19396 bzw. 806635 Knoten, von denen nur 14814 bzw. 18999\nbeschriftet waren, innerhalb von weniger als einer Minute auf einem Kern einer\nIntel Xeon 2.5 GHz CPU mit 32 G RAM ausgef\\\"uhrt werden kann. Zus\\\"atzlich wird\ndie Ver\\\"offentlichung von Aggarwal und Li kritisch er\\\"ortert und und es\nwerden m\\\"ogliche Erweiterungen des DYCOS-Algorithmus vorgeschlagen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 13:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}
