Our result establishes in a formal way that\nKronecker coefficients are more difficult than Littlewood-Richardson\ncoefficients, unless P=NP.\n  We also show that there exists a #P-formula for a particular subclass of\nKronecker coefficients whose positivity is NP-hard to decide. This is an\nevidence that, despite the hardness of the positivity problem, there may well\nexist a positive combinatorial formula for the Kronecker coefficients. Finding\nsuch a formula is a major open problem in representation theory and algebraic\ncombinatorics.\n  Finally, we consider the existence of the partition triples $(\\lambda, \\mu,\n\\pi)$ such that the Kronecker coefficient $k^\\lambda_{\\mu, \\pi} = 0$ but the\nKronecker coefficient $k^{l \\lambda}_{l \\mu, l \\pi} > 0$ for some integer\n$l>1$.

This requires at least five distinct observations per star. In\nthe early data reductions the number of observations may be insufficient for a\nfive-parameter solution, and even after the full mission many stars will remain\nunder-observed, including faint stars at the detection limit and transient\nobjects. In such cases it is reasonable to determine only the two position\nparameters.

We aim to\ndevelop a recipe to calculate sensible formal uncertainties that can be used in\nall cases of under-observed stars. Prior information about the typical ranges\nof stellar parallaxes and proper motions is incorporated in the astrometric\nsolution by means of Bayes' rule. Numerical simulations based on the Gaia\nUniverse Model Snapshot (GUMS) are used to investigate how the prior influences\nthe actual errors and formal uncertainties when different amounts of Gaia\nobservations are available. We develop a criterion for the optimum choice of\npriors, apply it to a wide range of cases, and derive a global approximation of\nthe optimum prior as a function of magnitude and galactic coordinates.

Such descriptions can be thought of as\nthe effective low energy description of QCD-like gauge theories near their\nstrong coupling scale where terms involving higher dimension operators are\ngenerated. Our low energy theory consists of scalar fields describing operators\nsuch as $\\bar{q} q$ and $\\bar{q} F^{(2n)} q$. Such scalars can have kinetic\nmixing terms that generate effective momentum dependent contributions to the\nmass matrix. We show that these can destabilize the translationally invariant\nvacuum. It is possible that in some real gauge theory such operators could\nbecome sufficiently dominant to realize such phases and it would be interesting\nto look for them in lattice simulations. We present a holographic model of the\nsame phenomena which includes RG running. A key phenomenological motive to look\nat such states is recent work that shows that the non-linear response in $R^2$\ngravity to such short range fluctuations can mimic a cosmological constant.\nIntriguingly in a cosmology with such a Starobinsky inflation term, to generate\nthe observed value of the present day acceleration would require stripes at the\nelectroweak scale.

Using atomistic computer simulation to\npredict this residence time and the associated dissociation process is a\ndesirable but extremely difficult task due to the long timescales involved.\nThis gets further complicated by the presence of biophysical factors such as\nsteric and solvation effects. In this work, we perform molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations of the unbinding of a popular prototypical hydrophobic\ncavity-ligand system using a metadynamics based approach that allows direct\nassessment of kinetic pathways and parameters. When constrained to move in an\naxial manner, we find the unbinding time to be on the order of 4000 sec. In\naccordance with previous studies, we find that the ligand must pass through a\nregion of sharp dewetting transition manifested by sudden and high fluctuations\nin solvent density in the cavity. When we remove the steric constraints on\nligand, the unbinding happens predominantly by an alternate pathway, where the\nunbinding becomes 20 times faster, and the sharp dewetting transition instead\nbecomes continuous. We validate the unbinding timescales from metadynamics\nthrough a Poisson analysis, and by comparison through detailed balance to\nbinding timescale estimates from unbiased MD.

Considering the current attacking landscape, it is\nclear that developing secure software should be a main concern in all software\ndevelopment projects. In traditional software projects, security issues require\ndetailed planning in an initial planning phase, typically resulting in a\ndetailed security analysis (e.g., threat and risk analysis), a security\narchitecture, and instructions for security implementation (e.g., specification\nof key sizes and cryptographic algorithms to use). Agile software development\nmethods like Scrum are known for reducing the initial planning phases (e.g.,\nsprint 0 in Scrum) and for focusing more on producing running code. Scrum is\nalso known for allowing fast adaption of the emerging software to changes of\ncustomer wishes. For security, this means that it is likely that there are no\ndetailed security architecture or security implementation instructions from the\nstart of the project. It also means that a lot of design decisions will be made\nduring the runtime of the project. Hence, to address security in Scrum, it is\nnecessary to consider security issues throughout the whole software development\nprocess. Secure Scrum is a variation of the Scrum framework with special focus\non the development of secure software throughout the whole software development\nprocess.

Our framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): dark matter has a higher\ntemperature in clusters, and hence is in a mixture of superfluid and normal\nphase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a number of\nstriking observational signatures, which we briefly discuss.

Both the longitudinal and transverse\nac drives produce locking steps whose widths oscillate with increasing ac drive\namplitude. We examine the role of collective skyrmion interactions and find\nthat additional fractional locking steps occur for both longitudinal and\ntransverse ac drives. At higher skyrmion densities, the system undergoes a\nseries of dynamical order-disorder transitions, with the skyrmions forming a\nmoving solid on the phase locking steps and a fluctuating dynamical liquid in\nregimes between the steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 20:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

It depends on a basis B, containing n x m\nunit cells of L, and the relevant root of P_B(q,T) was observed to converge\nquickly to T_c in the limit n,m to infinity. Moreover, in exactly solvable\ncases there is no finite-size dependence at all.\n  We reformulate this method as an eigenvalue problem within the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra. This corresponds to taking m to infinity first, so the\nbases B are semi-infinite cylinders of circumference n. The limit implies\nfaster convergence in n, while maintaining the n-independence in exactly\nsolvable cases. In this setup, T_c(n) is determined by equating the largest\neigenvalues of two topologically distinct sectors of the transfer matrix.\nCrucially, these two sectors determine the same critical exponent in the\ncontinuum limit, and the observed fast convergence is thus corroborated by\nresults of conformal field theory. We obtain similar results for the dense and\ndilute phases of the O(N) loop model, using now a transfer matrix within the\ndilute periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra.\n  The eigenvalue formulation allows us to double the size n for which T_c(n)\ncan be obtained, using the same computational effort.

Given the incomplete and noisy nature of these automatically\nextracted rules, Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) seem a natural model to use, but\nthe exact way of leveraging MLNs is by no means obvious. We investigate three\nways of applying MLNs to our task. In the first, we simply use the extracted\nscience rules directly as MLN clauses. Unlike typical MLN applications, our\ndomain has long and complex rules, leading to an unmanageable number of\ngroundings. We exploit the structure present in hard constraints to improve\ntractability, but the formulation remains ineffective. In the second approach,\nwe instead interpret science rules as describing prototypical entities, thus\nmapping rules directly to grounded MLN assertions, whose constants are then\nclustered using existing entity resolution methods. This drastically simplifies\nthe network, but still suffers from brittleness. Finally, our third approach,\ncalled Praline, uses MLNs to align the lexical elements as well as define and\ncontrol how inference should be performed in this task. Our experiments,\ndemonstrating a 15\\% accuracy boost and a 10x reduction in runtime, suggest\nthat the flexibility and different inference semantics of Praline are a better\nfit for the natural language question answering task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 23:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

A graph has the $n$-containment\nproperty if for every finite initial fire, there is a strategy to contain the\nfire by protecting $n$ vertices at each turn. A graph has the constant\ncontainment property if there is an integer $n$ such that it has the\n$n$-containment property. Our first result is that any locally finite connected\ngraph with quadratic growth has the constant containment property; the converse\ndoes not hold. This result provides a unified way to recover previous results\nin the literature, in particular the class of graphs satisfying the constant\ncontainment property is infinite. A second result is that in the class of\ngraphs with bounded degree, having the constant containment property is\npreserved by quasi-isometry. Some sample consequences of the second result are\nthat any regular tiling of the Euclidean plane has the fire containment\nproperty; no regular tiling of the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space has the\ncontainment property if $n>2$; and no regular tiling of the $n$-dimensional\nhyperbolic space has the containment property if $n\\geq 2$.

For example, in an advertising experiment, a\ncompany wishes to evaluate two marketing agents in terms of their efficacy in\nviral marketing, and assign a contract to the winner agent. Contrary to\ntraditional experimental design, this problem has two new implications. First,\nthe experiment induces a game among agents, where each agent can select from\nmultiple versions of the treatment it administers. Second, the action of one\nagent -- selection of treatment version -- may affect the actions of another\nagent, with the resulting strategic interference complicating the evaluation of\nagents. An incentive-compatible experiment design is one with an equilibrium\nwhere each agent selects its natural action, which is the action that would\nmaximize the performance of the agent if there was no competition (e.g.,\nexpected number of conversions if agent was assigned the contract). Under a\ngeneral formulation of experimental design, we identify sufficient conditions\nthat guarantee incentive-compatible experiments. These conditions rely on the\nexistence of statistics that can estimate how agents would perform without\ncompetition, and their use in constructing score functions to evaluate the\nagents. In the setting with no strategic interference, we also study the power\nof the design, i.e., the probability that the best agent wins, and show how to\nimprove the power of incentive-compatible designs. From the technical side, our\ntheory uses a range of statistical methods such as hypothesis testing,\nvariance-stabilizing transformations and the Delta method, all of which rely on\nasymptotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2015 03:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

By modeling not only the test\nmass and the vacuum chamber but also its walls and the exterior environment,\nthe method allows to probe new effects on the scalar field profile and the\ninduced acceleration of atoms. In the case of a weakly perturbing test mass,\nthe effect of the wall is to enhance the field profile and to lower the\nacceleration inside the chamber by up to one order of magnitude. In the\nthin-shell regime, results are found to be in good agreement with the\nanalytical estimations, when measurements are realized in the immediate\nvicinity of the test mass. Close to the vacuum chamber wall, the acceleration\nbecomes negative and potentially measurable. This prediction could be used to\ndiscriminate between fifth-force effects and systematic experimental\nuncertainties, by doing the experiment at several key positions inside the\nvacuum chamber. For the chameleon potential $V(\\phi) = \\Lambda^{4+\\alpha} /\n\\phi^\\alpha$ and a coupling function $A(\\phi) = \\exp(\\phi /M)$, one finds $M\n\\gtrsim 7 \\times 10^{16} \\mathrm{GeV}$, independently of the power-law index.\nFor $V(\\phi) = \\Lambda^4 (1+ \\Lambda/ \\phi)$, one finds $M \\gtrsim 10^{14}\n\\mathrm{GeV}$. A sensitivity of $a\\sim 10^{-11} \\mathrm{m/s^2} $ would probe\nthe model up to the Planck scale. Finally, a proposal for a second experimental\nset-up, in a vacuum room, is presented. In this case, Planckian values of $M$\ncould be probed provided that $a \\sim 10^{-10} \\mathrm{m/s^2}$, a limit\nreachable by future experiments.

RSF use the log-rank split\ncriterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to\nevaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index\nfor survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the\nsplit criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest.\nThis discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting\nand evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria\nanalytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more\nunbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that\nthe log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In\nsimulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate\nthat the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be\nimproved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node\nsplitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or\nthe fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely,\nlog-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank\nsplitting are implemented in the R~package ranger.

The cut finite element method is a fictitious domain method with\nNitsche type enforcement of Dirichlet conditions together with stabilization of\nthe elements at the boundary which is stable and enjoy optimal order\napproximation properties. A computational difficulty is, however, the geometric\ncomputations related to quadrature on the cut elements which must be accurate\nenough to achieve higher order approximation. With boundary value correction we\nmay use only a piecewise linear approximation of the boundary, which is very\nconvenient in a cut finite element method, and still obtain optimal order\nconvergence. The boundary value correction is a modified Nitsche formulation\ninvolving a Taylor expansion in the normal direction compensating for the\napproximation of the boundary. Key to the analysis is a consistent\nstabilization term which enables us to prove stability of the method and a\npriori error estimates with explicit dependence on the meshsize and distance\nbetween the exact and approximate boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2015 11:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

Most ontology matching\nalgorithms are based on two types of strategies: terminology-based strategies,\nwhich align concepts based on their names or descriptions, and structure-based\nstrategies, which exploit concept hierarchies to find the alignment. In many\ndomains, there is additional information about the relationships of concepts\nrepresented in various ways, such as Bayesian networks, decision trees, and\nassociation rules. We propose to use the similarities between these\nrelationships to find more accurate alignments. We accomplish this by defining\nsoft constraints that prefer alignments where corresponding concepts have the\nsame local relationships encoded as knowledge rules. We use a probabilistic\nframework to integrate this new knowledge-based strategy with standard\nterminology-based and structure-based strategies. Furthermore, our method is\nparticularly effective in identifying correspondences between complex concepts.\nOur method achieves substantially better F-score than the previous\nstate-of-the-art on three ontology matching domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2015 11:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

One of the main design goals of honeypots is to\nstay unnoticed by attackers as long as possible. The longer the intruder\ninteracts with the honeypot, the more valuable information about the attack can\nbe collected. Of course, another main goal of honeypots is to not open new\nvulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Thus, it is necessary to harden the\nhoneypot and the surrounding environment. This paper presents Apate, a Linux\nKernel Module (LKM) that is able to log, block and manipulate system calls\nbased on preconfigurable conditions like Process ID (PID), User Id (UID), and\nmany more. Apate can be used to build and harden High Interaction Honeypots.\nApate can be configured using an integrated high level language. Thus, Apate is\nan important and easy to use building block for upcoming High Interaction\nHoneypots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jul 2015 15:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

Design\ndecisions of one domain are affected by the constraints posed by others.\nReliable NAS design should address the requirements of the system, and\nsimultaneously meet the constraints posed by other domains and this is called\nco-design in literature. Co-design requires clear definition of interfaces\namong these domains. Control design in NAS is affected by the timing\nimperfections posed by other domains. In this investigation, we first study the\ndifferent sources of timing imperfections in NAS, and classify them based on\ntheir occurrence. The concept of jitter is used to define the timing\nimperfections induced by various system components. Using this analysis, we\nclassify the jitter based on their behavior and domain of occurrence. Our\nanalysis shows that the jitter induced in NAS can be classified based on domain\nas- hardware, software and communication. Next, we use this analysis to model\nthe jitter from the components of NAS. Modeling timing imperfections helps in\ncapturing the interfaces among the domains, and we use the concept of design\ncontracts to capture the interfaces. Design contracts describe the semantic\nmapping among the domains and are specified using the jitter margins.\nImplementing design contracts requires knowledge of the jitter margin and, the\nresults from control theory are used to this extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 17:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

Hence, a stochastic failure rate function can be developed for each\nelectrical component. Later, this function is used as the underlying rate of a\ndoubly stochastic Poisson process (known as Cox processes). Furthermore, this\nCox process is used for on-line estimation of the Mean Residual Life (MRL)\nusing the observed stress levels.
