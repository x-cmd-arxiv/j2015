The\nwidespread use of computing devices in daily life has underscored the need for\nzero-effort deauthentication schemes. However, the quest for eliminating user\neffort may lead to hidden security flaws in the authentication schemes. As a\ncase in point, we investigate a prominent zero-effort deauthentication scheme,\ncalled ZEBRA, which provides an interesting and a useful solution to a\ndifficult problem as demonstrated in the original paper. We identify a subtle\nincorrect assumption in its adversary model that leads to a fundamental design\nflaw. We exploit this to break the scheme with a class of attacks that are much\neasier for a human to perform in a realistic adversary model, compared to the\nna\\\"ive attacks studied in the ZEBRA paper. For example, one of our main\nattacks, where the human attacker has to opportunistically mimic only the\nvictim's keyboard typing activity at a nearby terminal, is significantly more\nsuccessful compared to the na\\\"ive attack that requires mimicking keyboard and\nmouse activities as well as keyboard-mouse movements. Further, by understanding\nthe design flaws in ZEBRA as cases of tainted input, we show that we can draw\non well-understood design principles to improve ZEBRA's security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 16:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 15:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 15:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 11:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 08:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 18:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

The\nenrichment function is not enforced but \"allowed\" in a consistent way and the\noverall methodology is much more general and also enables other enrichment\nfunctions. The proposed method is closely related to detached-eddy simulation\nas near-wall turbulence is modeled statistically and large eddies are resolved\nin the bulk flow. Interpreted in terms of a three-scale separation within the\nvariational multiscale method, the standard scale resolves large eddies and the\nenrichment scale represents boundary layer turbulence in an averaged sense.

In this\npaper we investigate the evolution of these binaries all the way to contact and\nthe possibility that these systems can be progenitors of double neutron star\nbinaries. The small orbital separations of observed double neutron star\nbinaries suggest that the progenitor systems underwent a common envelope phase\nat least once during their evolution. Bethe & Brown (1998) proposed that\nmassive binary twins will undergo a common envelope evolution while both\ncomponents are ascending the red giant branch or asymptotic giant branch\nsimultaneously, also known as double-core evolution. Using models generated\nfrom the stellar evolution code Evolve Zero Age Main Sequence, we determine the\nrange of mass ratios resulting in both components simultaneously ascending the\nRGB or AGB as a function of the difference in birth times, t. We find that,\neven for a generous t=5 Myr, the minimum mass ratio qmin=0.933 for an 8 Solar\nMass primary and increases for larger primaries. We use a hydrodynamics code,\nStarSmasher, to study specifically the evolution of q=1 common envelope systems\nas a function of initial component mass, age, and orbital separation. We find\nthe dynamical stability limit, the largest orbital separation where the binary\nbecomes dynamically unstable, as a function of the component mass and age.\nFinally, we calculate the efficiency of ejecting matter during the inspiral\nphase to extrapolate the properties of the remnant binary from our numerical\nresults, assuming the common envelope is completely ejected. We find that for\nthe nominal core masses, there is a minimum orbital separation for a given\ncomponent mass such that the helium cores survive common envelope evolution in\na tightly bound binary and are viable progenitors for double neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 18:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

This method is applied to give a robust\ninterpretation to the $f_4$ statistic used to identify admixture, and to design\na new statistic that measures covariances in mean times to most recent common\nancestor between two pairs of sequences. The method more generally interprets\npopulation genetic statistics in terms of sums of specific functions over\nancestral genomes, thereby providing concrete, broadly interpretable\ninterpretations for these statistics.

From the information retrieval perspective, the\nquality of a visualization can be evaluated by considering the extent that the\nneighborhood relation of each data point is maintained while the number of\nunrelated points that are retrieved is minimized. This property can be\nquantified as a trade-off between the mean precision and mean recall of the\nvisualization. While there have been some approaches to formulate the\nvisualization objective directly as a weighted sum of the precision and recall,\nthere is no systematic way to determine the optimal trade-off between these two\nnor a clear interpretation of the optimal value. In this paper, we investigate\nthe properties of $\\alpha$-divergence for information visualization, focusing\nour attention on a particular range of $\\alpha$ values. We show that the\nminimization of the new cost function corresponds to maximizing a geometric\nmean between precision and recall, parameterized by $\\alpha$. Contrary to some\nearlier methods, no hand-tuning is needed, but we can rigorously estimate the\noptimal value of $\\alpha$ for a given input data. For this, we provide a\nstatistical framework using a novel distribution called Exponential Divergence\nwith Augmentation (EDA).

The data are largely from the CORAVEL spectrophotometer and\nthe Moscow version, with a typical uncertainty of $\\leq1$~km~s$^{-1}$, and a\ntime span from 1 to 20 years. A systemic velocity was obtained by removing the\npulsation component using a high order Fourier series.

The binary fraction was analyzed as a function of\nmagnitude, and yields an apparent decrease in this fraction for fainter stars.\nWe interpret this as incompleteness at fainter magnitudes, and derive the\npreferred binary fraction of $29\\pm8$\\% ( $20\\pm6$\\% per decade of orbital\nperiod) from the brightest 40 stars. Comparison of this fraction in this period\nrange (1-20 years) implies a large fraction for the full period range. This is\nreasonable in that the high accuracy velocities are sensitive to the longer\nperiods and smaller orbital velocity amplitudes in the period range sampled\nhere. Thus the Cepheid velocity sample provides a sensitive detection in the\nperiod range between short period spectroscopic binaries and resolved\ncompanions.

The work in this paper is the genesis of an attempt to\nbuild an on-board real-time face and eye tracking system for human drivers to\ndetect loss of attention due to drowsiness or fatigue. A major function of this\non-board system is quick customization. This is carried out when a new driver\ncomes in. The face and eye images are recorded while instructing the driver for\nmaking specific poses. The eigen faces and eigen eyes are generated at several\nresolution levels and stored in the on-board computer. The discriminating eigen\nspace of face and eyes are determined and stored in the on-board flash memory\nfor detection and tracking of face and eyes and classification of eyes (open or\nclosed) as well. Therefore, fast SVD of image covariance matrix at various\nlevels of resolution needs to be carried out to generate the eigen database. As\na preliminary step, we review the existing symmetric SVD algorithms and\nevaluate their feasibility for such an application.

The morphology of the system delineates three distinct\nregions: the cavity wall layer with time-dependent and species-variant\nenhancements; a torus rich in complex organic ices, but not reflected in\ngas-phase abundances; and the remaining outer envelope abundant in simpler\nsolid and gaseous molecules. Strongly irradiated regions, such as the cavity\nwall layer, are subject to frequent photodissociation in the solid phase.\nSubsequent recombination of the photoproducts leads to frequent reactive\ndesorption, causing gas-phase enhancements of several orders of magnitude. This\nmechanism remains to be quantified with laboratory experiments. Direct\nphotodesorption is found to be relatively inefficient.

In the strict clock case, the method consists in using\nthe one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to directly test if the phylogeny\nis clock-like, in other words, if it follows a Poisson law. The ECD is computed\nfrom the discretized branch lengths and the parameter $\\lambda$ of the expected\nPoisson distribution is calculated as the average branch length over the\nensemble of trees. To compensate for the auto-correlation in the ensemble of\ntrees and pseudo-replication we take advantage of thinning and effective sample\nsize, two features provided by Bayesian inference MCMC samplers. Finally, it is\nobserved that tree topologies with very long or very short branches lead to\nPoisson mixtures and in this case we propose the use of the two-sample KS test\nwith samples from two continuous branch length distributions, one obtained from\nan ensemble of clock-constrained trees and the other from an ensemble of\nunconstrained trees. Moreover, in this second form the test can also be applied\nto test for relaxed clock models. The use of a statistically equivalent\nensemble of phylogenies to obtain the branch lengths ECD, instead of one\nconsensus tree, yields considerable reduction of the effects of small sample\nsize and provides again of power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 20:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 12:43:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 16:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 19:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

The sensors observe random samples in parallel and communicate with a\nfusion center, who makes the global decision based on the sensor inputs. On one\nhand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely\ntransmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio\ntest (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected\nsample size as error rates tend to zero. On the other hand, for systems with\nlimited power and bandwidth resources, decentralized solutions that only send a\nsummary of local samples (we particularly focus on a one-bit communication\nprotocol) to the fusion center is of great importance. To this end, we first\nconsider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized\nstatistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a\nuniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its\nsuboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of\nthe quantized statistics under both hypotheses. We then propose a decentralized\nGSPRT based on level-triggered sampling. That is, each sensor runs its own\nGSPRT repeatedly and reports its local decision to the fusion center\nasynchronously. We show that this scheme is asymptotically optimal as the local\nthresholds and global thresholds grow large at different rates. Lastly, two\nparticular models and their associated applications are studied to compare the\ncentralized and decentralized approaches. Numerical results are provided to\ndemonstrate that the proposed level-triggered sampling based decentralized\nscheme aligns closely with the centralized scheme with substantially lower\ncommunication overhead, and significantly outperforms the uniform sampling and\nquantization based decentralized scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 22:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-17"}

With a\npriori knowledge of the environment, global path planning provides a\ncollision-free route through the workspace. The global path plan can be\ncalculated with a variety of informed search algorithms, most notably the A*\nsearch method, guaranteed to deliver a complete and optimal solution that\nminimizes the path cost. Path planning optimization typically looks to minimize\nthe distance traversed from start to goal, yet many mobile robot applications\ncall for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective\noptimization (MOO) problem. Past studies have applied genetic algorithms to MOO\npath planning problems, but these may have the disadvantages of computational\ncomplexity and suboptimal solutions. Alternatively, the algorithm in this paper\napproaches MOO path planning with the use of Pareto fronts, or finding\nnon-dominated solutions. The algorithm presented incorporates Pareto optimality\ninto every step of A* search, thus it is named A*-PO. Results of simulations\nshow A*-PO outperformed several variations of the standard A* algorithm for MOO\npath planning.

However,\nmost existing studies do not address the \"free rider\" issue, that is, nodes far\naway from query nodes and irrelevant to them are included in the detected\ncommunity. Some state-of-the-art models have attempted to address this issue,\nbut not only are their formulated problems NP-hard, they do not admit any\napproximations without restrictive assumptions, which may not always hold in\npractice.\n  In this paper, given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q, we\nstudy community search using the k-truss based community model. We formulate\nour problem of finding a closest truss community (CTC), as finding a connected\nk-truss subgraph with the largest k that contains Q, and has the minimum\ndiameter among such subgraphs. We prove this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore,\nit is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $(2-\\varepsilon)$, for\nany $\\varepsilon >0 $. However, we develop a greedy algorithmic framework,\nwhich first finds a CTC containing Q, and then iteratively removes the furthest\nnodes from Q, from the graph. The method achieves 2-approximation to the\noptimal solution. To further improve the efficiency, we make use of a compact\ntruss index and develop efficient algorithms for k-truss identification and\nmaintenance as nodes get eliminated. In addition, using bulk deletion\noptimization and local exploration strategies, we propose two more efficient\nalgorithms. One of them trades some approximation quality for efficiency while\nthe other is a very efficient heuristic.

This\ninterfacial nature of IDM interaction has been recently revisited because of\nits scientific and technological potential. Here, we demonstrate an\nexperimental technique to straightforwardly observe the IDM interaction, namely\nBrillouin light scattering. The non-reciprocal spin wave dispersions,\nsystematically measured by Brillouin light scattering, allow not only the\ndetermination of the IDM energy densities beyond the regime of perpendicular\nmagnetization but also the revelation of the inverse proportionality with the\nthickness of the magnetic layer, which is a clear signature of the interfacial\nnature.

We unveil two phenomena of lights available for\npositioning: 1) the light strength varies according to different light sources,\nwhich can be easily detected by light sensors embedded in COTS devices (e.g.,\nsmart-phone, smart-glass and smart-watch); 2) the light strength is stable in\ndifferent times of the day thus exploiting it can avoid frequent site-survey\nand database maintenance. Hence, a user could locate oneself by differentiating\nthe light source of received light strength (RLS). However, different from\nexisting positioning systems that exploit special LEDs, ubiquitous visible\nlights lack fingerprints that can uniquely identify the light source, which\nresults in an ambiguity problem that an RLS may correspond to multiple\npositions. Moreover, RLS is not only determined by device's position, but also\nseriously affected by its orientation, which causes great complexity in\nsite-survey. To address these challenges, we first propose and validate a\nrealistic light strength model that can attributes RLS to arbitrary positions\nwith heterogenous orientations. This model is further perfected by taking\naccount of the device diversity, influence of multiple light sources and\nshading of obstacles. Then we design a localizing scheme that harness user's\nmobility to generate spatial-related RLS to tackle the position-ambiguity\nproblem of a single RLS, which is robust against sunlight interference, shading\neffect of human-body and unpredictable behaviours (e.g., put the device in\npocket) of user.

In this\npaper we revisit the original paper on evolutionary graph theory in light of\nthese extensions to consider these developments in an integrated way. In\nparticular we find general criteria for when an evolutionary graph with general\nweights satisfies the Moran probability for the set of six common evolutionary\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 10:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-25"}

This paper explains an implementation of a\nstand-alone rendering system on GPUs which supports the bounding volume\nhierarchy and stochastic progressive photon mapping. The key characteristic of\nthe system is that it uses only GLSL shaders without relying on any platform\ndependent feature. The system can thus run on many platforms that support\nOpenGL, making photorealistic rendering on GPUs widely accessible.

Our\ncomputations were carried out for the O VI and Fe XXIV absorption of the O VII\nand Fe XXV triplet emission lines, respectively. The fluorescent emission by\nthe Li-like ions and continuum absorption of the He-like ion triplet lines are\nalso investigated. We determine the absorption of the triplet lines as a\nfunction of Li-like ion column density and velocity dispersion of the emitting\nand absorbing medium. We find O VI line absorption can significantly alter the\nO VII triplet line ratios in optically-thin plasmas, by primarily absorbing the\nintercombination lines, and to a lesser extent, the forbidden line. Because of\nintrinsic line absorption by O VI inside a photoionised plasma, the predicted\nratio of forbidden to intercombination line intensity for the O VII triplet\nincreases from 4 up to an upper limit of 16. This process can explain the\ntriplet line ratios that are higher than expected and that are seen in some\nX-ray observations of photoionised plasmas.

The method is a modification of the\nSTDDM proposed by [Z. Chen and X. Xiang, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51 (2013), pp.\n2331--2356]. After decomposing the domain into $N$ non-overlapping layers, the\nSTDDM is composed of two series steps of sources transfers and wave expansions,\nwhere $N-1$ truncated PML problems on two adjacent layers and $N-2$ truncated\nhalf-space PML problems are solved successively. While the PSTDDM consists\nmerely of two parallel source transfer steps in two opposite directions, and in\neach step $N-1$ truncated PML problems on two adjacent layers are solved\nsuccessively. One benefit of such a modification is that the truncated PML\nproblems on two adjacent layers can be further solved by the PSTDDM along\ndirections parallel to the layers. And therefore, we obtain a block-wise PSTDDM\non the decomposition composed of $N^2$ squares, which reduces the size of\nsubdomain problems and is more suitable for large-scale problems. Convergences\nof both the layer-wise PSTDDM and the block-wise PSTDDM are proved for the case\nof constant wave number. Numerical examples are included to show that the\nPSTDDM gives good approximations to the discrete Helmholtz equations with\nconstant wave numbers and can be used as an efficient preconditioner in the\npreconditioned GMRES method for solving the discrete Helmholtz equations with\nconstant and heterogeneous wave numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 12:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 04:22:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 08:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 2019 02:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

We find\nthat the data strongly prefers models in which the sources of the ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays inject predominantly intermediate mass nuclei, with\ncomparatively few protons or heavy nuclei, such as iron or silicon. If the\nnumber density of sources per comoving volume does not evolve with redshift,\nthe injected spectrum must be very hard ($\\alpha\\simeq 1$) in order to fit the\nspectrum observed at Earth. Such a hard spectral index would be surprising and\ndifficult to accommodate theoretically. In contrast, much softer spectral\nindices, consistent with the predictions of Fermi acceleration ($\\alpha\\simeq\n2$), are favored in models with negative source evolution. With this\ntheoretical bias, these observations thus favor models in which the sources of\nthe highest energy cosmic rays are preferentially located within the\nlow-redshift universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 14:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

We compare our results in terms of galaxy red/blue\nfractions and luminous-to-faint ratio (LFR) on the Red Sequence (RS) with\nrecent observational data reaching beyond z=1.5. Different selection criteria\nwere tested in order to retrieve galaxies belonging to the RS: either by their\nquiescence degree measured from their specific SFR (\"Dead Sequence\"), or by\ntheir position in a colour-colour plane which is also a function of sSFR. In\nboth cases, the colour cut and the limiting magnitude threshold were let\nevolving with redshift, in order to follow the natural shift of the\ncharacteristic luminosity in the LF.\n  We find that the Butcher-Oemler effect is wavelength-dependent, with the\nfraction of blue galaxies increasing steeper in optical colours than in NIR.\nBesides, only when applying a lower limit in terms of fixed absolute magnitude,\na steep BO effect can be reproduced, while the blue fraction results less\nevolving when selecting samples by stellar mass or an evolving magnitude limit.\nWe then find that also the RS-LFR behaviour, highly debated in the literature,\nis strongly dependent on the galaxy selection function: in particular its very\nmild evolution recovered when measured in terms of stellar mass, is in\nagreement with values reported for some of the highest redshift confirmed\n(proto)clusters. As to differences through environments, we find that normal\ngroups and (to a lesser extent) cluster outskirts present the highest values of\nboth star forming fraction and LFR at low z, while fossil groups and cluster\ncores the lowest: this separation among groups begins after z~0.5, while\nearlier all group star forming properties are undistinguishable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 14:17:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 11:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

In the usual ZRP, sites can accommodate an arbitrary number of\nparticles, and for a class of hopping rates and high enough density, the steady\nstate exhibits a condensate which holds a finite fraction of the total number\nof particles. The sites of the disordered zero-range process considered here\nhave finite capacities chosen randomly from the Pareto distribution. From the\nexact steady state measure of the model, we identify the conditions for\ncondensate formation, in terms of parameters that involve both interactions\n(through the hop rates) and randomness (through the distribution of the site\ncapacities). Our predictions are supported by results obtained from a direct\nnumerical sampling of the steady state and from Monte Carlo simulations. Our\nstudy reveals that for a given realization of disorder, the condensate can\nrelocate on the subset of sites with largest capacities.

The wide range of applications and their public\nacceptance has motivated researchers to work in this research domain. Several\napplications such as SMS based information access using database management\nservices, SMS based information retrieval through internet (search engine), SMS\nbased information extraction, question answering, image retrieval etc. have\nbeen emerged. With the aim to understand the functionality involved in these\nsystems, an extensive review of a few of these SMSbISs has been planned and\nexecuted by us. These systems are classified into four categories based on the\nobjectives and domains of the applications. As a result of this study a well\nstructured functional model is presented here. The model is evaluated in\ndifferent dimensions, which is presented in this paper. In addition to this a\nchronological progress with respect to research and development in this\nupcoming field is compiled in this paper. Such an extensive review presented in\nthis paper would definitely help the researchers and developers to understand\nthe technical aspects of this field. The functional framework presented here\nwould be useful to the system designers to design and develop an SMS based\nInformation System of any specific domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 10:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

Remarkably, some scholars have observed such an\nincome distribution in some democratic countries, e.g. USA.
