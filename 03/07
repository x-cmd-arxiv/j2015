As a main result,\nwe show that the relaxation dynamics of the double occupancy and of the\nstaggered moment are different.

While ultrasound is largely established for use in diagnostic\nimaging and heating therapies, its application for neuromodulation is\nrelatively new and not well understood.

This\nquestion is at the heart of surface coating applications, various complex\nformation phenomena, as well as in the context of cellular and viral\nbiophysics. It has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical polymer\nphysics; for realistic systems the quantitative understanding is however often\nachievable only by computer simulations. In this study, we present the findings\nof such extensive Monte-Carlo in silico experiments for polymer-surface\nadsorption in confined domains. We study the inverted critical adsorption of\nfinite-length polyelectrolytes in three fundamental geometries: planar slit,\ncylindrical pore, and spherical cavity. The scaling relations extracted from\nsimulations for the critical surface charge density $\\sigma_c$-defining the\nadsorption-desorption transition-are in excellent agreement with our analytical\ncalculations based on the ground-state analysis of the Edwards equation. In\nparticular, we confirm the magnitude and scaling of $\\sigma_c$ for the concave\ninterfaces versus the Debye screening length $1/\\kappa$ and the extent of\nconfinement $a$ for these three interfaces for small $\\kappa a$ values. For\nlarge $\\kappa a$ the critical adsorption condition approaches the planar limit.\nThe transition between the two regimes takes place when the radius of surface\ncurvature or half of the slit thickness $a$ is of the order of $1/\\kappa$. We\nalso rationalize how $\\sigma_c(\\kappa)$ gets modified for semi-flexible versus\nflexible chains under external confinement. We examine the implications of the\nchain length onto critical adsorption-the effect often hard to tackle\ntheoretically-putting an emphasis on polymers inside attractive spherical\ncavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 19:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

The latter probes the average intensity of\nthe dust heating radiation field and scales statistically with the effective\nSFR surface density in star-forming galaxies including (ultra-)luminous\ninfrared galaxies [(U)LIRGs].

In contrast to the expectations of the classical\ntheory of magnetotransport, this intrinsically quantum mechanical phenomenon\ngives rise to the longitudinal magnetoresistance for any three dimensional\nmetal. However, the emergence of the axial anomaly does not guarantee the\nexistence of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. We show this through an\nexplicit calculation of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in the quantum\nlimit using the Boltzmann equation, for both short-range neutral and long-range\nionic impurity scattering processes. We demonstrate that the ionic scattering\ncontributes a large positive magnetoconductivity $\\propto B^2$ in the quantum\nlimit, which can cause a strong negative magnetoresistance for any three\ndimensional or quasi-two dimensional metal. In contrast, the finite range\nneutral impurities and zero range point impurities can lead to both positive\nand negative longitudinal magnetoresistance depending on the underlying band\nstructure. In the presence of both neutral and ionic impurities, the\nlongitudinal magnetoresistance of a generic metal in the quantum limit\ninitially becomes negative, and ultimately becomes positive after passing\nthrough a minimum.

Strong outflows are also found for the cluster H$\\alpha$ AGN.\nH$\\alpha$ star-forming galaxies in the merging cluster follow the z~0\nmass-metallicity relation, showing systematically higher metallicity (~0.15-0.2\ndex) than H$\\alpha$ emitters outside the cluster (projected R>2.5 Mpc). This\nsuggests that the shock front may have triggered remaining metal-rich gas which\ngalaxies were able to retain into forming stars. Our observations show that the\nmerger of impressively massive (~10$^{15}$M$_\\odot$) clusters can provide the\nconditions for significant star-formation and AGN activity, but, as we witness\nstrong feedback by star-forming galaxies and AGN (and given how massive the\nmerging cluster is), such sources will likely quench in a few 100 Myrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Both wind models are generally in good agreement\nwith these observations for HI and certain low ionization metal lines, but show\npoorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including SiIII and OVI\nthat are well-observed by COS-Halos. These discrepancies suggest that both wind\nmodels predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/or\nthat the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. This may reflect our model\nassumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. Our ezw simulation\nincludes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heating\nits ISM gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to be\nbroadly consistent with observations, but also substantial OVI absorption that\nis inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in the\nreal Universe does not cool.

Instead of confronting the primary\ndecay rates, as is usually done, we focus attention on the effective decay\nrates that are straightforwardly related with the number of emitted particles.\nProton kinetic energy spectra of $^5_\\Lambda$He, $^7_\\Lambda$Li,\n$^9_\\Lambda$Be, $^{11}_\\Lambda$B, $^{12}_{\\Lambda}$C, $^{13}_\\Lambda$C,\n$^{15}_{\\Lambda}$N and $^{16}_{\\Lambda}$O, measured by FINUDA, are evaluated\ntheoretically. The Independent Particle Shell Model (IPSM) is used as the\nnuclear structure framework, while the dynamics is described by the\nOne-Meson-Exchange (OME) potential. Only for the $^{5}_{\\Lambda}$He,\n$^{7}_{\\Lambda}$Li, and $^{12}_{\\Lambda}$C hypernuclei is it possible to make a\ncomparison with the data, since for the rest there is no published experimental\ninformation on number of produced hypernuclei. Considering solely the\none-nucleon-induced ($1N$-NM) decay channel, the theory reproduces correctly\nthe shapes of all three spectra at medium and high energies ($E_p \\geq 40 $\nMeV). Yet, it greatly overestimates their magnitudes, as well as the\ncorresponding transition rates when the full OME ($\\pi+K+\n\\eta+\\rho+\\omega+K^*$) model is used. The agreement is much improved when only\nthe $\\pi+K$ mesons with soft dipole cutoff parameters participate in the decay\nprocess.

Maxwell's macroscopic equations are mathematically exact\nand self-consistent differential equations that relate the electromagnetic (EM)\nfield to its sources, namely, electric charge-density $\\rho_{free}$, electric\ncurrent-density $J_{free}$, polarization P, and magnetization M. At the level\nof Maxwell's macroscopic equations, there is no need for models of electric and\nmagnetic dipoles. For example, whether a magnetic dipole is an Amperian\ncurrent-loop or a Gilbertian pair of north and south magnetic monopoles has no\neffect on the solution of Maxwell's equations.\n  Electromagnetic fields carry energy as well as linear and angular momenta,\nwhich they can exchange with material media - the seat of the sources of the EM\nfield - thereby exerting force and torque on these media. In the Lorentz\nformulation of classical electrodynamics, the electric and magnetic fields, E\nand B, exert forces and torques on electric charge and current distributions.\nAn electric dipole is then modeled as a pair of electric charges on a stick (or\nspring), and a magnetic dipole is modeled as an Amperian current loop, so that\nthe Lorentz force law can be applied to the corresponding (bound) charges and\n(bound) currents of these dipoles. In contrast, the Einstein-Laub formulation\ncircumvents the need for specific models of the dipoles by simply providing a\nrecipe for calculating the force-density and torque-density exerted by the E\nand H fields on charge, current, polarization and magnetization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 00:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}

However, as is well known, the choices of the degree of\npolynomial kernel and the regularization parameter are still open in the realm\nof model selection. The first aim of this paper is to develop a strategy to\nselect these parameters. On one hand, based on the worst-case learning rate\nanalysis, we show that the regularization term in polynomial kernel regression\nis not necessary. In other words, the regularization parameter can decrease\narbitrarily fast when the degree of the polynomial kernel is suitable tuned. On\nthe other hand,taking account of the implementation of the algorithm, the\nregularization term is required. Summarily, the effect of the regularization\nterm in polynomial kernel regression is only to circumvent the \" ill-condition\"\nof the kernel matrix. Based on this, the second purpose of this paper is to\npropose a new model selection strategy, and then design an efficient learning\nalgorithm. Both theoretical and experimental analysis show that the new\nstrategy outperforms the previous one. Theoretically, we prove that the new\nlearning strategy is almost optimal if the regression function is smooth.\nExperimentally, it is shown that the new strategy can significantly reduce the\ncomputational burden without loss of generalization capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 08:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}

In this work we extend the theory to the density\nresponse function. We write the generic diagram for the density-response\nspectrum as the sum of partitions. In a partition the original diagram is\nevaluated using time-ordered Green's functions (GF) on the left-half of the\ndiagram, antitime-ordered GF on the right-half of the diagram and lesser or\ngreater GF gluing the two halves. As there exist more than one way to cut a\ndiagram in two halves, to every diagram corresponds more than one partition. We\nrecognize that the most convenient diagrammatic objects for constructing a\ntheory of positive spectra are the half-diagrams. Diagrammatic approximations\nobtained by summing the squares of half-diagrams do indeed correspond to a\ncombination of partitions which, by construction, yield a positive spectrum. We\ndevelop the theory using bare GF and subsequently extend it to dressed GF. We\nfurther prove a connection between the positivity of the spectral function and\nthe analytic properties of the polarizability.

We further prove that the nonconvex $\\ell_q$-analysis\noptimization can do recovery with a lower sample complexity and in a wider\nrange of cosparsity than its convex counterpart. In addition, we develop an\niteratively reweighted method to solve the optimization problem under the\nvariational framework. Theoretical analysis shows that our method is capable of\npursuing a local minima close to the global minima. Also, empirical results of\npreliminary computational experiments illustrate that our nonconvex method\noutperforms both its convex counterpart and other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 12:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}

Interesting\nphenomena can be observed and QCD tests can be performed, through the detection\nof one or more mesons. The collinear emission from high energy (anti)proton\nbeams of a hard pion or vector meson, can be calculated similarly to the\nemission of a hard photon from an electron \\cite{Kuraev:2013izz}. This is a\nwell known process in QED, and it is called the \"Quasi-Real Electron method\",\nwhere the incident particle is an electron and a hard photon is emitted leaving\nan 'almost on shell' electron impinging on the target \\cite{Baier:1973ms}. Such\nprocess is well known as Initial State Emission (ISR) method of scanning over\nincident energy, and can be used, in the hadron case, to produce different kind\nof particles in similar kinematical conditions. In case of emission of a\ncharged light meson, $\\pi$ or $\\rho$-meson, in proton-proton(anti-proton)\ncollisions, the meson can be deviated in a magnetic field and detected. The\ncollinear emission (along the beam direction) of a charged meson may be used to\nproduce high energy (anti)neutron beams. This can be very useful to measure the\ndifference of the cross sections of (anti)proton and (anti)neutron scattering\nfrom the target and may open the way for checking sum rules with antiparticles.\nHard meson emission allows also to enhance the cross section when the energy\nloss from one of the incident particles lowers the total energy up to the mass\nof a resonance. The cross section can be calculated, on the basis of factorized\nformulas, where the probability of emission of the light mesons multiplies the\ncross section of the sub-process. Multiplicity distributions for neutral and\ncharged meson production are also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 12:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}

We then introduce the canonical proper-time theory. For\ncompleteness, we give a brief outline of the canonical proper-time approach to\nelectrodynamics and mechanics, and then introduce the canonical proper-time\napproach to relativistic quantum theory. This theory leads to three new\nrelativistic wave equations. In each case, the canonical generator of\nproper-time translations is strictly positive definite, so that it represents a\nparticle. We show that the canonical proper-time extension of the Dirac\nequation for Hydrogen gives results that are consistently closer to the\nexperimental data, when compared to the Dirac equation.
