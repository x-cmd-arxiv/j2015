The presence of a small-mass planet (M$_p<$0.1\\,M$_{Jup}$) seems, to\ndate, not to depend on metallicity, however, theoretical simulations have shown\nthat stars with subsolar metallicities may be favoured for harbouring smaller\nplanets. A large, dedicated survey of metal-poor stars with the HARPS\nspectrograph has thus been carried out to search for Neptunes and super-Earths.\nAims. In this paper, we present the analysis of \\object{HD175607}, an old G6\nstar with metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.62. We gathered 119 radial velocity\nmeasurements in 110 nights over a time span of more than nine years. Methods.\nThe radial velocities were analysed using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, a genetic\nalgorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, and a Gaussian processes\nanalysis. The spectra were also used to derive stellar properties. Several\nactivity indicators were analysed to study the effect of stellar activity on\nthe radial velocities. Results. We find evidence for the presence of a small\nNeptune-mass planet (M$_{p}\\sin i = 8.98\\pm1.10$\\,M$_{\\oplus}$) orbiting this\nstar with an orbital period $P = 29.01\\pm0.02$\\, days in a slightly eccentric\norbit ($e=0.11\\pm0.08$). The period of this Neptune is close to the estimated\nrotational period of the star. However, from a detailed analysis of the radial\nvelocities together with the stellar activity, we conclude that the best\nexplanation of the signal is indeed the presence of a planetary companion\nrather than stellar related. An additional longer period signal ($P\\sim\n1400$\\,d) is present in the data, for which more measurements are needed to\nconstrain its nature and its properties. Conclusions. HD\\,175607 is the most\nmetal-poor FGK dwarf with a detected low-mass planet amongst the currently\nknown planet hosts. This discovery may thus have important consequences for\nplanet formation and evolution theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 16:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

The Banks-Casher relation\nties the chiral condensate to the density of low lying modes; thus, it is\nplausible that removal of such modes could lead to a regime where spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking does not occur. Surprising, a pattern of identical\ncorrelation functions was observed that is larger than can be explained by a\nrestoration of chiral symmetry. This suggests that a larger symmetry---one that\nis not present in the QCD lagrangian---emerges when these modes are removed.\nPreviously it was argued that this emergent symmetry was SU(4). However, when\nthe low-lying modes are removed, the correlation functions of sources in the\nSU(4) 15-plet of spin-1 mesons appear to coincide with the correlation function\nof the SU(4) singlet. A natural explanation for this is an emergent symmetry\nlarger than SU(4). In this work, it is shown that there exists no continuous\nsymmetry whose generators in the field theory are spatial integrals of local\noperators that can account for the full pattern of identical correlation\nfunctions unless the apparent coincidence of the singlet channel with the\n15-plet is accidental.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 16:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 18:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 21:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

The first part of the paper discusses this\nclaim in the context of arguments against and proposals addressing the\ndevelopment of computer programs with first-person meanings.

The second part of the paper presents\npreliminary proposals and achievements, resulting of actual software\nimplementations, within a research approach that aims to develop software\nagents that intrinsically understand their actions and what happens to them.

The cold first-person meanings of the agent's actions and of\nwhat happens to it are defined using these acquired notions.

Interestingly, such intriguing features are\nonly reflected in the expression for the local power when the volume $\\Omega$\nis finite. Otherwise, for closed systems with $\\Omega \\to \\infty$, we recover a\nclassical-like single-particle expression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 17:53:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 10:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In most cases, the loss functions used in\nmachine learning assume symmetric noise models, and seek to estimate the\nunknown function parameters. However, loss functions such as quantile and\nquantile Huber generalize the symmetric $\\ell_1$ and Huber losses to the\nasymmetric setting, for a fixed quantile parameter. In this paper, we propose\nto jointly infer the quantile parameter and the unknown function parameters,\nfor the asymmetric quantile Huber and quantile losses. We explore various\nproperties of the quantile Huber loss and implement a convexity certificate\nthat can be used to check convexity in the quantile parameter.

This paper\npresents an optimal design of time and location aware mobile data pricing,\nwhich incentivizes users to smooth traffic and reduce network congestion. We\nderive the optimal pricing scheme through analyzing a two-stage decision\nprocess, where the operator determines the time and location aware prices by\nminimizing his total cost in Stage I, and each mobile user schedules his mobile\ntraffic by maximizing his payoff (i.e., utility minus payment) in Stage II. We\nformulate the two-stage decision problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and\npropose a derivative-free algorithm to solve the problem for any increasing\nconcave user utility functions. We further develop low complexity algorithms\nfor the commonly used logarithmic and linear utility functions. The optimal\npricing scheme ensures a win-win situation for the operator and users.\nSimulations show that the operator can reduce the cost by up to 97.52% in the\nlogarithmic utility case and 98.70% in the linear utility case, and users can\nincrease their payoff by up to 79.69% and 106.10% for the two types of\nutilities, respectively, comparing with a time and location independent pricing\nbenchmark.

Moreover, a new\nalgorithm to estimate the subband RT is devised, where the RT estimates for the\nlower octave subbands are extrapolated from the RT estimates of the upper\nsubbands by means of a simple model for the frequency-dependency of the subband\nRT. The evaluation results of the ACE challenge reveal that this approach\nallows to estimate the subband RT with an estimation error which is in a\nsimilar range as for the presented fullband RT estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 20:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

The young systems PZ Tel and HD 1160, hosting known\nlow-mass companions, were observed during the commissioning of the new planet\nfinder SPHERE with several imaging and spectroscopic modes. Aims. We aim to\nrefine the physical properties and architecture of both systems. Methods. We\nuse SPHERE commissioning data and REM observations, as well as literature and\nunpublished data from VLT/SINFONI, VLT/NaCo, Gemini/NICI, and Keck/NIRC2.\nResults. We derive new photometry and confirm the nearly daily photometric\nvariability of PZ Tel A. Using literature data spanning 38 yr, we show that the\nstar also exhibits a long-term variability trend. The 0.63-3.8 mic SED of PZ\nTel B allows us to revise its properties: spectral type M7+/-1, Teff=2700+/-100\nK, log(g)<4.5 dex, log(L/L_Sun)=-2.51+/-0.10 dex, and mass 38-72 MJ. The 1-3.8\nmic SED of HD 1160 B suggests a massive brown dwarf or a low-mass star with\nspectral type M5.5-7.0, Teff=3000+/-100 K, [M/H]=-0.5-0.0 dex,\nlog(L/L_Sun)=-2.81+/-0.10 dex, and mass 39-168 MJ. We confirm the deceleration\nand high eccentricity (e>0.66) of PZ Tel B. For e<0.9, the inclination,\nlongitude of the ascending node, and time of periastron passage are well\nconstrained. The system is seen close to an edge-on geometry. We reject other\nbrown dwarf candidates outside 0.25\" for both systems, and massive giant\nplanets (>4 MJ) outside 0.5\" for the PZ Tel system. We also show that K1-K2\ncolor can be used with YJH low-resolution spectra to identify young L-type\ncompanions, provided high photometric accuracy (<0.05 mag) is achieved.\nConclusions.

From previous studies, it has drawn attention as being\nthe coldest (~600K) companion ever directly imaged around a neighboring star.\nWe present new high-contrast data obtained during the commissioning of the\nSPHERE instrument at the VLT.

Hence, we review\nthe current state of bulge formation in cosmological simulations, and discuss\nopen questions that can be addressed in the near future by simulators, with a\nparticular focus on merger-driven bulge growth. Galaxy mergers have long been\nassumed to produce classical bulges in disk galaxies. Under this\nbulge-formation model, though, the high rates of mergers in Cold Dark Matter\ngalaxy formation theory predict many more classical bulges than are observed.\nFurthermore, simulations of galaxy formation continue to generally produce too\nmassive of bulges. Feedback offers a promising avenue for reducing\nmerger-driven bulge growth by maintaining high gas fractions in galaxies and\nejecting low-angular momentum gas driven to the centers of galaxies. After\nreviewing the results of relevant research that has been published to date, we\nuse cosmological simulations to explore the ability of feedback to reduce or\neven prevent bulge growth during mergers. In dwarf galaxies, mergers actually\nreduce the central concentration of galaxies as the induced burst of star\nformation drives out low angular momentum material. This result shows the\npotential for feedback to reduce central mass growth. However, we also\ndemonstrate that it is very difficult for current stellar feedback models to\nreproduce the small bulges observed in more massive disk galaxies like the\nMilky Way. We argue that feedback models need to be improved, or an additional\nsource of feedback such as AGN is necessary to generate the required outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 21:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Market ask price is\nalways greater than market bid price, and these prices move upwards and\ndownwards due to new arrivals, market trades, and cancellations. We model these\ntwo price processes as \"bouncing geometric Brownian motions (GBMs)\", which are\ndefined as exponentials of two mutually reflected Brownian motions.

As the $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ gauge boson does not couple to\nproton constituents or electrons at tree level, the current bounds are fairly\nloose, especially for $M_{Z'} \\gtrsim 1\\, \\rm GeV$. For $2m_{\\mu} < M_{Z'} <\nM_Z/2$ we develop search strategies using the $pp \\rightarrow Z \\to 4\\, \\mu$\nchannel. The cleanliness of the final state, combined with the fact that $pp\n\\to Z \\to 4 e$, $Z \\to 2e\\,2\\mu$ can be used as background control samples,\nallow us to spot $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ $Z'$ with couplings $\\mathcal O(10^{-3})$\ntimes the Standard Model couplings.

In\nthe ALM the lift and drag forces are replaced by an imposed body force which is\ntypically smoothed over several grid points using a Gaussian kernel with some\nprescribed smoothing width $\\epsilon$. To date, the choice of $\\epsilon$ has\nmost often been based on numerical considerations related to the grid spacing\nused in LES. However, especially for finely resolved LES with grid spacings on\nthe order of or smaller than the chord-length of the blade, the best choice of\n$\\epsilon$ is not known. In this work, a theoretical approach is followed to\ndetermine the most suitable value of $\\epsilon$. Firstly, we develop an\nanalytical solution to the linearized flow response to a Gaussian lift and drag\nforce and use the results to establish a relationship between the local and\nfar-field velocity required to specify lift and drag forces. Then, focusing\nfirst on the lift force, we find $\\epsilon$ and the force center location that\nminimize the square difference between the velocity fields induced by the\nGaussian force and 2D potential flow over Joukowski airfoils. We find that the\noptimal smoothing width $\\epsilon^{\\rm opt}$ is on the order of 14-25\\% of the\nchord length of the blade, and the center of force is located at about 13-26\\%\ndownstream of the leading edge of the blade, for the cases considered.

Here, we refine this result to show that in the\n(2,2,2) case, any nonlocal nonsignaling distribution can always be uniquely\nexpressed as a convex combination of exactly one PR box and (up to) eight local\ndeterministic distributions. In this representation each PR box will always\noccur only with a fixed set of eight local deterministic distributions with\nwhich it is affiliated. This decomposition has multiple applications: we\ndemonstrate an analytical proof that the minimum detection efficiency for which\nnonlocality can be observed is $\\eta>2/3$ even for theories constrained only by\nthe no-signaling principle, and we develop new algorithms that speed the\ncalculation of important statistical functions of Bell test data.

Fluctuations along the\nlongitudinal direction, on the other hand, can result in decorrelation of\nanisotropic flows in different regions of pseudo rapidity ($\\eta$).\nDecorrelation of the $2$nd and $3$rd order anisotropic flows with different\n$\\eta$ gaps for final charged hadrons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is\nstudied in an event-by-event (3+1)D ideal hydrodynamic model with fully\nfluctuating initial conditions from A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model. The\ndecorrelation of anisotropic flows of final hadrons with large $\\eta$ gaps are\nfound to originate from the spatial decorrelation along the longitudinal\ndirection in the AMPT initial conditions through hydrodynamic evolution. The\ndecorrelation is found to consist of both a linear twist and random fluctuation\nof the event-plane angles.

As social media data can be obtained in near\nreal-time and at low cost, it is often used for \"now-casting\" indices such as\nlevels of flu activity or unemployment. The term \"social sensing\" is often used\nin this context to describe the idea that users act as \"sensors\", publicly\nreporting their health status or job losses. Sensor activity during a time\nperiod is then typically aggregated in a \"one tweet, one vote\" fashion by\nsimply counting. At the same time, researchers readily admit that social media\nusers are not a perfect representation of the actual population. Additionally,\nusers differ in the amount of details of their personal lives that they reveal.\nIntuitively, it should be possible to improve now-casting by assigning\ndifferent weights to different user groups.\n  In this paper, we ask \"How does social sensing actually work?\" or, more\nprecisely, \"Whom should we sense--and whom not--for optimal results?\". We\ninvestigate how different sampling strategies affect the performance of\nnow-casting of two common offline indices: flu activity and unemployment rate.\nWe show that now-casting can be improved by 1) applying user filtering\ntechniques and 2) selecting users with complete profiles. We also find that,\nusing the right type of user groups, now-casting performance does not degrade,\neven when drastically reducing the size of the dataset. More fundamentally, we\ndescribe which type of users contribute most to the accuracy by asking if\n\"babblers are better\".

Removal of\nfrequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and\nscattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition. As a step toward a more comprehensive ISM propagation delay\ncorrection, we demonstrate through a simulation that we can accurately recover\nimpulse response functions (IRFs), such as those that would be introduced by\nmulti-path scattering, with a realistic signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate\nthat timing precision is improved when scatter-corrected TOAs are used, under\nthe assumptions of a high signal-to-noise and highly scattered signal.

Possibilities include heating in the chromosphere causing optically\nthin or thick emission from free-bound transitions of Hydrogen, and heating of\nthe photosphere causing enhanced H$^-$ continuum brightness. To investigate\nthese possibilities, we combine observations from IRIS, SDO/HMI, and the\nground-based FIRS instrument, covering wavelengths in the far-UV, near-UV,\nvisible, and infrared during the X1 flare SOL20140329T17:48. Fits of blackbody\nspectra to infrared and visible wavelengths are reasonable, yielding radiation\ntemperatures $\\sim$6000-6300 K. The NUV emission, formed in the upper\nphotosphere under undisturbed conditions, exceeds these simple fits during the\nflare, requiring extra emission from the Balmer continuum in the chromosphere.\nThus, the continuum originates from enhanced radiation from photosphere\n(visible-IR) and chromosphere (NUV). From the standard thick-target flare\nmodel, we calculate the energy of the nonthermal electrons observed by RHESSI\nand compare it to the energy radiated by the continuum emission. We find that\nthe energy contained in most electrons $>$40 keV, or alternatively, of\n$\\sim$10-20% of electrons $>$20 keV is sufficient to explain the extra\ncontinuum emission of $\\sim4-8 \\times 10^{10}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. Also,\nfrom the timing of the RHESSI HXR and the IRIS observations, we conclude that\nthe NUV continuum is emitted nearly instantaneously when HXR emission is\nobserved with a time difference of no more than 15 s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 05:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

They can be clearly separated by [alpha\\Fe] and several other\nelemental abundance ratios including [Cu/Fe]. Very recently, a non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) study revealed that relatively large\ndepartures exist between LTE and non-LTE results in copper abundance analysis.\nWe aim to derive the copper abundances for the stars from the sample of Nissen\net al (2010) with both LTE and non-LTE calculations. Based on our results, we\nstudy the non-LTE effects of copper and investigate whether the high-alpha\npopulation can still be distinguished from the low-alpha population in the\nnon-LTE [Cu/Fe] results. Our differential abundance ratios are derived from the\nhigh-resolution spectra collected from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectrographs.\nApplying the MAFAGS opacity sampling atmospheric models and spectrum synthesis\nmethod, we derive the non-LTE copper abundances based on the new atomic model\nwith current atomic data obtained from both laboratory and theoretical\ncalculations. The copper abundances determined from non-LTE calculations are\nincreased by 0.01 to 0.2 dex depending on the stellar parameters compared with\nthe LTE results. The non-LTE [Cu/Fe] trend is much flatter than the LTE one in\nthe metallicity range -1.6<[Fe/H]<-0.8. Taking non-LTE effects into\nconsideration, the high- and low-alpha stars still show distinguishable copper\nabundances, which appear even more clear in a diagram of non-LTE [Cu/Fe] versus\n[Fe/H]. The non-LTE effects are strong for copper, especially in metal-poor\nstars. Our results confirmed that there are two distinct halo populations in\nthe solar neighborhood. The dichotomy in copper abundance is a peculiar feature\nof each population, suggesting that they formed in different environments and\nevolved obeying diverse scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 06:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Inspired by the\neffectiveness of recently developed feature learning, we provide a novel Deep\nImage Saliency Computing (DISC) framework for fine-grained image saliency\ncomputing. In particular, we model the image saliency from both the coarse- and\nfine-level observations, and utilize the deep convolutional neural network\n(CNN) to learn the saliency representation in a progressive manner.\nSpecifically, our saliency model is built upon two stacked CNNs. The first CNN\ngenerates a coarse-level saliency map by taking the overall image as the input,\nroughly identifying saliency regions in the global context. Furthermore, we\nintegrate superpixel-based local context information in the first CNN to refine\nthe coarse-level saliency map. Guided by the coarse saliency map, the second\nCNN focuses on the local context to produce fine-grained and accurate saliency\nmap while preserving object details. For a testing image, the two CNNs\ncollaboratively conduct the saliency computing in one shot. Our DISC framework\nis capable of uniformly highlighting the objects-of-interest from complex\nbackground while preserving well object details. Extensive experiments on\nseveral standard benchmarks suggest that DISC outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods and it also generalizes well across datasets without\nadditional training.

In this work, we study the\n\\emph{geometric} structure of the associated non-convex objective function, in\nthe context of ReLU networks and starting from a random initialization of the\nnetwork parameters. We identify some conditions under which it becomes more\nfavorable to optimization, in the sense of (i) High probability of initializing\nat a point from which there is a monotonically decreasing path to a global\nminimum; and (ii) High probability of initializing at a basin (suitably\ndefined) with a small minimal objective value. A common theme in our results is\nthat such properties are more likely to hold for larger (\"overspecified\")\nnetworks, which accords with some recent empirical and theoretical\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 09:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 16:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 05:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

For instance, a locomotion primitive might be adapted to\ndifferent terrain inclinations or desired walking speeds. Such an adaptation is\noften achievable by modifying a small number of hyperparameters. However,\nlearning, when performed on real robotic systems, is typically restricted to a\nsmall number of trials. Bayesian optimization has recently been proposed as a\nsample-efficient means for contextual policy search that is well suited under\nthese conditions. In this work, we extend entropy search, a variant of Bayesian\noptimization, such that it can be used for active contextual policy search\nwhere the agent selects those tasks during training in which it expects to\nlearn the most. Empirical results in simulation suggest that this allows\nlearning successful behavior with less trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 09:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 09:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

Using\nthe median instead of the mean can partially resolve this issue but not\ncompletely. For the univariate case, a robust version of the median is the\nLeast Trimmed Absolute Deviation (LTAD) robust estimator introduced\nin~\\cite{Tableman1994}, which has desirable asymptotic properties such as\nrobustness, consistently, high breakdown and normality.

As a\nconsequence, we obtain the mathematical expression of the whole picture of the\nasymptotic behavior of the walker, including dependences on initial states, in\nthe long-time limit. We also clarify relevant symmetries, which are essential\nfor topological insulators, of the complete two-phase QW, and then derive the\ntopological invariant. Having established both mathematical rigorous results\nand the topological invariant of the complete two-phase QW, we provide solid\narguments to understand localization of QWs in term of topological invariant.\nFurthermore, by applying a concept of {\\it topological protections}, we clarify\nthat localization of the two-phase QW with one defect, studied in the previous\nwork\\cite{endosan}, can be related to localization of the complete two-phase QW\nunder symmetry preserving perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 11:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 17:27:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 06:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

Most of the results we\npresent are already scattered throughout the mathematics literature but our\nexposition collects them together and is driven by examples. Many interesting\naspects of these functions are hidden in their Fourier coefficients with\nrespect to unipotent subgroups and a large part of our focus is to explain and\nderive general theorems on these Fourier expansions. Specifically, we give\ncomplete proofs of the Langlands constant term formula for Eisenstein series on\nadelic groups G(A) as well as the Casselman--Shalika formula for the p-adic\nspherical Whittaker function associated to unramified automorphic\nrepresentations of G(Q_p).

In particular, we\nprovide a detailed treatment of supersymmetry constraints on string amplitudes\nwhich enforce differential equations of the same type that are satisfied by\nautomorphic forms. Our treatise concludes with a detailed list of interesting\nopen questions and pointers to additional topics which go beyond the scope of\nthis book.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 12:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 18:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

Despite an\nabundant literature, many issues remain unclear. In particular, all definitions\nof segregation are implicitely tied to a single indicator, usually rely on an\nambiguous definition of income classes, without any consensus on how to define\nneighbourhoods and to deal with the polycentric organization of large cities.\nIn this paper, we address all these questions within a unique conceptual\nframework. We avoid the challenge of providing a direct definition of\nsegregation and instead start from a definition of what segregation is not.\nThis naturally leads to the measure of representation that is able to identify\nlocations where categories are over- or underrepresented. From there, we\nprovide a new measure of exposure that discriminates between situations where\ncategories co-locate or repel one another. We then use this feature to provide\nan unambiguous, parameter-free method to find meaningful breaks in the income\ndistribution, thus defining classes. Applied to the 2014 American Community\nSurvey, we find 3 emerging classes -- low, middle and higher income -- out of\nthe original 16 income categories. The higher-income households are\nproportionally more present in larger cities, while lower-income households are\nnot, invalidating the idea of an increased social polarisation. Finally, using\nthe density -- and not the distance to a center which is meaningless in\npolycentric cities -- we find that the richer class is overrepresented in high\ndensity zones, especially for larger cities. This suggests that density is a\nrelevant factor for understanding the income structure of cities and might\nexplain some of the differences observed between US and European cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 12:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 08:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

These motors generate sliding forces between adjacent\nmicrotubule doublets within the axoneme, the motile cytoskeletal structure\ninside the flagellum. To create regular, oscillatory beating patterns, the\nactivities of the axonemal dyneins must be coordinated both spatially and\ntemporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains\nthat build up within the moving axoneme, but it is not known which components\nof stress or strain are involved, nor how they feed back on the dyneins. To\nanswer this question, we used isolated, reactivate axonemes of the unicellular\nalga Chlamydomonas as a model system. We derived a theory for beat regulation\nin a two-dimensional model of the axoneme. We then tested the theory by\nmeasuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes, which have asymmetric\nbeats, and mutant axonemes, in which the beat is nearly symmetric, using\nhigh-precision spatial and temporal imaging. We found that regulation by\nsliding forces fails to account for the measured beat, due to the short lengths\nof Chlamydomonas cilia. We found that regulation by normal forces (which tend\nto separate adjacent doublets) cannot satisfactorily account for the symmetric\nwaveforms of the mbo2 mutants. This is due to the model's failure to produce\nreciprocal inhibition across the axes of the symmetrically beating axonemes.\nFinally, we show that regulation by curvature accords with the measurements.\nUnexpectedly, we found that the phase of the curvature feedback indicates that\nthe dyneins are regulated by the dynamic (i.e. time-varying) component of\naxonemal curvature, but not by the static one. We conclude that a high-pass\nfiltered curvature signal is a good candidate for the signal that feeds back to\ncoordinate motor activity in the axoneme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 13:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

Moreover, code of different nature often obfuscates direct\ncomparison, as well as determination of the cause of deviation, between\nsimulator and actual robot swarm behaviour. To tackle these issues we have\ndeveloped a C-based simulator that allows those working with Kilobots to use\nthe same programme code in both the simulator and the physical robots. Use of\nour simulator, coined Kilombo, significantly simplifies and speeds up\ndevelopment, given that a simulation of 1000 robots can be run at a speed 100\ntimes faster than real time on a desktop computer, making high-throughput\npre-screening possible of potential algorithms that could lead to desired\nemergent behaviour.

The related energy density variation is set up\nanalytically, whereas its volume integration is carried out numerically. This\nfacilitates the consideration of more realistic neutron star characteristics\nwithin the model compared to analytical treatments. At the same time, our\nmethod retains the possibility to yield general information about neutron star\nmagnetic field and composition structures that are likely to be stable. In\ncontrast to numerical studies, classes of parametrized systems can be studied\nat once, finally constraining realistic configurations for interior neutron\nstar magnetic fields.

Our\nexperiments show that Rand4DColor is very fast, computing a valid\n(4Degree)-coloring in less than one third of the time slots required for local\nbroadcasting, where Degree is the maximum node degree in the network. Regarding\nother O(Degree)-coloring algorithms Rand4DColor is at least 4 to 5 times\nfaster. Additionally, the algorithm is robust even in networks with mobile\nnodes and an additional listening phase at the start of the algorithm makes\nRand4DColor robust against the late wake-up of large parts of the network.\nRegarding (Degree+1)-coloring algorithms, we observe that ColorRed it is\nsignificantly faster than the considered variant of the Yu et al. coloring\nalgorithm, which is the only other (Degree+1)-coloring algorithm for the SINR\nmodel. Further improvement can be made with an error-correcting variant that\nincreases the runtime by allowing some uncertainty in the communication and\nafterwards correcting the introduced conflicts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 15:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

In Newtonian gravity the pressure within a star merely\nplays the role of opposing self-gravity. In general relativity all sources of\nenergy and momentum contribute to the gravity. As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. For neutron stars the maximum mass---so\ncalled Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit---is significantly smaller than the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. This follows from the fact that the general\nrelativistic correction to hydrostatic equilibrium within a neutron star is\nsignificant throughout the star, including the central part where the mass\ncontained within radial coordinate, $m(r)$, and the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration, $Gm(r)/r^2$, are small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 15:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 14:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

EEG data are generally only available in small quantities, they are\nhigh-dimensional with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and there is considerable\nvariability between individual subjects and recording sessions. Our proposed\ntechniques specifically address these challenges for feature learning.\nCross-trial encoding forces auto-encoders to focus on features that are stable\nacross trials. Similarity-constraint encoders learn features that allow to\ndistinguish between classes by demanding that two trials from the same class\nare more similar to each other than to trials from other classes. This\ntuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets.\nHydra-nets allow for separate processing pathways adapting to subsets of a\ndataset and thus combine the advantages of individual feature learning (better\nadaptation of early, low-level processing) with group model training (better\ngeneralization of higher-level processing in deeper layers). This way, models\ncan, for instance, adapt to each subject individually to compensate for\ndifferences in spatial patterns due to anatomical differences or variance in\nelectrode positions. The different techniques are evaluated using the publicly\navailable OpenMIIR dataset of EEG recordings taken while participants listened\nto and imagined music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 15:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 22:04:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2015 18:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 16:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

Molecular gas has been found in the halo at a distance of ~20 kpc\nfrom the galaxy centre, associated with HI shells. The molecular gas lies\ninside some IR and UV bright star-forming filaments that have recently been\nobserved in the direction of the radio jets. These archival data show that\nthere is dust and very weak star formation on scales of hundreds of parsecs.\n  On top of analysing combined archival data, we have performed searches of\nHCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) emission with ATCA at the interaction of the northern\nfilaments and the HI shell of Cen A. Measuring the dense gas is another\nindicator of star formation efficiency inside the filaments.

Using a standard conversion factor leads to long\ndepletion times (7 Gyr). We then corrected the mass estimates from metallicity\neffect by using gas-to-dust mass ratio as a proxy. From MUSE data, we estimated\nthe metallicity spread (0.4-0.8 Zsun) in the filament, corresponding to\ngas-to-dust ratios of ~200-400. The CO/H2 conversion ratio is corrected for low\nmetallicity by a factor between 1.4 and 3.2. Such a low-metallicity correction\nleads to even more massive clouds with higher depletion times (16 Gyr). We\nfinally present ALMA observations that detect 3 unresolved CO(2-1) clumps of\nsize <37x21 pc and masses around 10^4 Msun. The velocity width of the CO\nemission line is ~10 km/s, leading to a rather high virial parameter.

As such, there should be no remaining doubt\nregarding its validity. However, finite-size scaling, which derives from it,\nhas long been poorly understood above the upper critical dimension $d_c$ in\nmodels with free boundary conditions. Besides its fundamental significance for\nscaling theories, the issue is important at a practical level because\nfinite-size, statistical-physics systems, with free boundaries above $d_c$, are\nexperimentally accessible with long-range interactions.

In the frame of two temperature thermal plasma modeling, this model\nallows self-consistent calculation of the sheath potential drop, the Schottky\ncorrection factor for the work function of the wall material, the thermionic\nelectron current density, and the heat fluxes of the charged particles from the\nplasma to the wall. The model is applied to the cathode spot at the tungsten\ncathode in argon. It is shown that the Shottky correction factor plays a\ncrucial role in modeling high-intensity arcs. It is demonstrated that a virtual\ncathode can be formed in the atmospheric pressure argon plasma at the cathode\nsurface temperature of 4785 K if the cathode current density is sufficiently\nsmall. The heat flux to the thermionic cathode due to charged particles and the\nheat flux to the plasma due to thermionic electrons are calculated. The model\ncan be reduced to the case of cold walls where the thermionic electron emission\nand the wall erosion processes are small and can be neglected. The sheath\npotential drop and the heat fluxes calculated by this model can be used as\nboundary conditions at the wall for the electric potential and for the energy\nequations for the electrons and heavy particles (ions and neutrals).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 15:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

It could be shown that,\nhowever, a simple and intuitively comprehensible extension of the Social Force\nModel shows the inflection point. Motivated by this observation in this\ncontribution the relation of the Social Force Model with the Kladek formula for\nthe speed-density relation of urban motorized traffic is discussed. Furthermore\nthe models are compared to results data from experiments on vehicular, cycling,\nand pedestrian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 08:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-07"}

We present\na theoretical argument (with a detailed numerical confirmation) showing that a\nclassical deterministic solution before a finite-time blowup, $t < t_b$, must\nbe continued as a stochastic process after the blowup, $t > t_b$, representing\na unique physically relevant description in the inviscid limit. This theory is\nbased on the dynamical system formulation written for the logarithmic time\n$\\tau = \\log(t-t_b)$, which features a stable traveling wave solution for the\ninviscid Burgers equation, but a stochastic traveling wave for the Sabra model.\nThe latter describes a universal onset of stochasticity immediately after the\nblowup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 17:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 19:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}
