The importance of social\nhierarchy in a social network is that the topological structure of the social\nhierarchy is essential in both shaping the nature of social interactions\nbetween individuals and unfolding the structure of the social networks. The\nsocial hierarchy found in a social network can be utilized to improve the\naccuracy of link prediction, provide better query results, rank web pages, and\nstudy information flow and spread in complex networks. In this paper, we model\na social network as a directed graph G, and consider the social hierarchy as\nDAG (directed acyclic graph) of G, denoted as GD. By DAG, all the vertices in G\ncan be partitioned into different levels, the vertices at the same level\nrepresent a disjoint group in the social hierarchy, and all the edges in DAG\nfollow one direction. The main issue we study in this paper is how to find DAG\nGD in G. The approach we take is to find GD by removing all possible cycles\nfrom G such that G = U(G) + GD where U(G) is a maximum Eulerian subgraph which\ncontains all possible cycles. We give the reasons for doing so, investigate the\nproperties of GD found, and discuss the applications. In addition, we develop a\nnovel two-phase algorithm, called Greedy-&-Refine, which greedily computes an\nEulerian subgraph and then refines this greedy solution to find the maximum\nEulerian subgraph. We give a bound between the greedy solution and the optimal.\nThe quality of our greedy approach is high. We conduct comprehensive\nexperimental studies over 14 real-world datasets. The results show that our\nalgorithms are at least two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2015 16:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

This basis consists of discretising the\nVDF in a series of angular bins, with the VDF being only a function of the DM\nspeed $v$ within each bin. In contrast to other methods, such as spherical\nharmonic expansions, the use of this basis allows us to guarantee that the\nresulting VDF is everywhere positive and therefore physical. We present a\nrecipe for calculating the event rates corresponding to the discrete VDF for an\narbitrary number of angular bins $N$ and investigate the discretisation error\nwhich is introduced in this way. For smooth, Standard Halo Model-like\ndistribution functions, only $N=3$ angular bins are required to achieve an\naccuracy of around $10-30\\%$ in the number of events in each bin. Shortly after\nconfirmation of the DM origin of the signal with around 50 events, this\naccuracy should be sufficient to allow the discretised velocity distribution to\nbe employed reliably.

This task is the phase retrieval problem. Through the technique\nof lifting, this nonconvex problem may be convexified into a semidefinite\nrank-one matrix recovery problem, known as PhaseLift. Under a linear number of\nexact Gaussian measurements, PhaseLift recovers the unknown vector exactly with\nhigh probability. Under noisy measurements, the solution to a variant of\nPhaseLift has error proportional to the $\\ell_1$ norm of the noise. In the\npresent paper, we study the robustness of this variant of PhaseLift to a case\nwith noise and gross, arbitrary corruptions. We prove that PhaseLift can\ntolerate a small, fixed fraction of gross errors, even in the highly\nunderdetermined regime where there are only $O(n)$ measurements. The lifted\nphase retrieval problem can be viewed as a rank-one robust Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) problem under generic rank-one measurements. From this\nperspective, the proposed convex program is simpler that the semidefinite\nversion of the sparse-plus-low-rank formulation standard in the robust PCA\nliterature. Specifically, the rank penalization through a trace term is\nunnecessary, and the resulting optimization program has no parameters that need\nto be chosen. The present work also achieves the information theoretically\noptimal scaling of $O(n)$ measurements without the additional logarithmic\nfactors that appear in existing general robust PCA results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Feb 2015 20:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

The collection of four studies in this dissertation\nculminates in a sociocultural perspective on motivation and identity. This\nperspective uses two extremes of how students experience physics as a lens for\nunderstanding motivation: fear and self-preservation versus integrity and\nself-expression. Rather than viewing motivation as a property of the student,\nor viewing students as inherently interested or disinterested in physics, the\ntheoretical perspective on motivation and identity helps examine features of\nthe learning environments that determine how students experience themselves\nthrough physics class.

Here we characterize the\ninformation flow through a complete sensorimotor circuit: from stimulus, to\nsensory neurons, to interneurons, to motor neurons, to muscles, to motion.\nSpecifically, we apply a recently developed framework for quantifying\ninformation flow to a previously published ensemble of models of salt\nklinotaxis in the nematode worm C. elegans. The models are grounded in the\nneuroanatomy and currently known neurophysiology of the worm. The unknown model\nparameters were optimized to reproduce the worm's behavior. Information flow\nanalysis reveals several key principles underlying how the models operate: (1)\nInterneuron class AIY is responsible for integrating information about positive\nand negative changes in concentration, and exhibits a strong left/right\ninformation asymmetry. (2) Gap junctions play a crucial role in the transfer of\ninformation responsible for the information symmetry observed in interneuron\nclass AIZ. (3) Neck motor neuron class SMB implements an information gating\nmechanism that underlies the circuit's state-dependent response. (4) The neck\ncarries non-uniform distribution about changes in concentration. Thus, not all\ndirections of movement are equally informative. Each of these findings\ncorresponds to an experimental prediction that could be tested in the worm to\ngreatly refine our understanding of the neural circuit underlying klinotaxis.\nInformation flow analysis also allows us to explore how information flow\nrelates to underlying electrophysiology. Despite large variations in the neural\nparameters of individual circuits, the overall information flow architecture\ncircuit is remarkably consistent across the ensemble, suggesting that\ninformation flow analysis captures general principles of operation for the\nklinotaxis circuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 00:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

To\naddress this question, we examine stability properties of a generic gene\nregulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many characteristics of aging and\nthe associated population mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the\ncritical dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on the\nanalysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in\nDrosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly\ncritical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in\nthe form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and\ncauses the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a\nform of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life mortality\ndeceleration observed at very late ages for large populations. We show that\naging contains a stochastic component, related to accumulation of regulatory\nerrors in transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to imperfection of\nsignaling cascades in the network and of responses to environmental factors. We\nalso establish that there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting\ngenetic control. Since mortality in humans, where it is characterized best, is\nstrongly associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, our findings\nsupport the idea that aging is the driving force behind the development of\nchronic human diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 12:41:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 06:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

In our experiments,\nWestfall-Young light dramatically outperforms the current state-of-the-art\napproach in terms of both runtime and memory efficiency on popular real-world\nbenchmark datasets for pattern mining. The key to this efficiency is that\nunlike all existing methods, our algorithm neither needs to solve the\nunderlying frequent itemset mining problem anew for each permutation nor needs\nto store the occurrence list of all frequent patterns. Westfall-Young light\nopens the door to significant pattern mining on large datasets that previously\nled to prohibitive runtime or memory costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 14:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

It depends on other\nstrategies such as perimeter routing to find a detour path, which can be long\nand result in inefficiency of the routing protocol. In this paper, we propose a\nnew approach called Intermediate Target based Geographic Routing (ITGR) to\nsolve the long detour path problem. The basic idea is to use previous\nexperience to determine the destination areas that are shaded by the holes. The\nnovelty of the approach is that a single forwarding path can be used to\ndetermine a shaded area that may cover many destination nodes. We design an\nefficient method for the source to find out whether a destination node belongs\nto a shaded area. The source then selects an intermediate node as the tentative\ntarget and greedily forwards packets to it, which in turn forwards the packet\nto the final destination by greedy routing. ITGR can combine multiple shaded\nareas to improve the efficiency of representation and routing. We perform\nsimulations and demonstrate that ITGR significantly reduces the routing path\nlength, compared with existing geographic routing protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 14:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

While characteristic motif distribution have been found in many\nnetworks, very little is known today about the evolution of network motifs.\nThis paper studies the most important motifs in social networks, triangles, and\nhow directed triangle motifs change over time. Our chosen subject is one of the\nlargest Online Social Networks, Google+. Google+ has two distinguishing\nfeatures that make it particularly interesting: (1) it is a directed network,\nwhich yields a rich set of triangle motifs, and (2) it is a young and fast\nevolving network, whose role in the OSN space is still not fully understood.\nFor the purpose of this study, we crawled the network over a time period of six\nweeks, collecting several snapshots. We find that some triangle types display\nsignificant dynamics, e.g., for some specific initial types, up to 20% of the\ninstances evolve to other types. Due to the fast growth of the OSN in the\nobserved time period, many new triangles emerge. We also observe that many\ntriangles evolve into less-connected motifs (with less edges), suggesting that\ngrowth also comes with pruning. We complement the topological study by also\nconsidering publicly available user profile data (mostly geographic locations).\nThe corresponding results shed some light on the semantics of the triangle\nmotifs. Indeed, we find that users in more symmetric triangle motifs live\ncloser together, indicating more personal relationships. In contrast,\nasymmetric links in motifs often point to faraway users with a high in-degree\n(celebrities).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 15:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2015 07:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}
