Particular emphasis is placed on\nthe behavior as a function of a Collins-Soper evolution parameter quantifying\nthe relative rapidity of the struck quark and the initial hadron, e.g., in a\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process.

In particular, we give formulas for the expected value of the number\nof faces, the volume, the surface area, and other intrinsic volumes, including\nthe following multidimensional generalization of the Spitzer--Widom formula\n(1961) on the perimeter of planar walks: $$ E V_1 (conv(0, S_1, \\dots, S_n)) =\n\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{E \\|S_k\\|}{k}, $$ where $V_1$ denotes the first intrinsic\nvolume, which is proportional to the mean width.\n  These results have applications to geometry, and in particular, imply the\nformula by Gao and Vitale (2001) for the intrinsic volumes of special\npath-simplexes, called canonical orthoschemes, which are finite-dimensional\napproximations of the closed convex hull of a Wiener spiral. Moreover, there is\na direct connection between spherical intrinsic volumes of these simplexes and\nthe probabilities $p_n$.\n  We also prove similar results for convex hulls of random walk bridges, and\nmore generally, for partial sums of exchangeable random vectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 17:26:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 00:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 22:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Most of the trailing can be corrected during\npost-processing, by modelling the charge trapping and moving electrons back to\nwhere they belong. However, such correction is not perfect -- and damage is\ncontinuing to accumulate in orbit.

There are two separable challenges: If the model used to\ncorrect CTI is perfectly the same as that used to add CTI, $99.68$ % of\nspurious ellipticity is corrected in our setup.

Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft\ngluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale\nwhich is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The\nthermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the\njet.

We solve the kinetic equation using both\n(semi-)analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain the first\nexact, analytic, solutions to the ultrarelativistic Fokker-Planck equation in\none-dimensional phase-space.

Here, we show that\nis possible to define searches capable of probing a large patch of this\ndifficult region, with S/B ~ 1 and significances often well beyond 5 sigma. The\nbasic strategy is to leverage the large energy gain of LHC Run 2, leading to a\nsizable population of stop pair events recoiling against a hard jet.

In this\nseries of papers, we use an extensive suite of three-dimensional (3D) numerical\nsimulations to quantify the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC.\nRosenblum et al. (2011) first showed that ODDC can either spontaneously form\nlayers, which significantly enhance the transport of heat and chemical species\ncompared to mi- croscopic transport, or remain in a state dominated by large\nscale gravity waves, in which there is a more modest enhancement of the\nturbulent transport rates. Subsequent studies in this series have focused on\nidentifying under what condi- tions layers form (Mirouh et al. 2012), and\nquantifying transport through layered systems (Wood et al. 2013). Here we\nproceed to characterize transport through systems that are unstable to the ODDC\ninstability, but do not undergo spon- taneous layer formation. We measure the\nthermal and compositional fluxes in non-layered ODDC from both 2D and 3D\nnumerical simulations and show that 3D simulations are well approximated by\nsimilar simulations in a 2D domain. We find that the turbulent mixing rate in\nthis regime is weak and can, to a first level approximation, be neglected. We\nconclude by summarizing the findings of papers I through III into a single\nprescription for transport by ODDC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 21:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

IRX ratios of all the\nSNRs in the sample are found to be moderately greater than unity, indicating\nthat dust grains are a more efficient coolant than gas although gas cooling may\nnot be negligible. The IRX ratios of the LMC SNRs are systematically lower than\nthose of the Galactic SNRs. As both dust cooling and gas cooling pertain to the\nproperties of the interstellar medium, the lower IRX ratios of the LMC SNRs may\nreflect the characteristics of the LMC, and the lower dust-to- gas ratio (a\nquarter of the Galactic value) is likely to be the most significant factor. The\nobserved IRX ratios are compared with theoretical predictions that yield IRX\nratios an order of magnitude larger. This discrepancy may originate from the\ndearth of dust in the remnants due to either the local variation of the dust\nabundance in the preshock medium with respect to the canonical abundance or the\ndust destruction in the postshock medium.

The previous major efforts on big data benchmarking either propose a\ncomprehensive but a large amount of workloads, or only select a few workloads\naccording to so-called popularity, which may lead to partial or even biased\nobservations. In this paper, on the basis of a comprehensive big data benchmark\nsuite---BigDataBench, we reduced 77 workloads to 17 representative workloads\nfrom a micro-architectural perspective. On a typical state-of-practice\nplatform---Intel Xeon E5645, we compare the representative big data workloads\nwith SPECINT, SPECCFP, PARSEC, CloudSuite and HPCC. After a comprehensive\nworkload characterization, we have the following observations. First, the big\ndata workloads are data movement dominated computing with more branch\noperations, taking up to 92% percentage in terms of instruction mix, which\nplaces them in a different class from Desktop (SPEC CPU2006), CMP (PARSEC), HPC\n(HPCC) workloads. Second, corroborating the previous work, Hadoop and Spark\nbased big data workloads have higher front-end stalls. Comparing with the\ntraditional workloads i. e. PARSEC, the big data workloads have larger\ninstructions footprint. But we also note that, in addition to varied\ninstruction-level parallelism, there are significant disparities of front-end\nefficiencies among different big data workloads. Third, we found complex\nsoftware stacks that fail to use state-of-practise processors efficiently are\none of the main factors leading to high front-end stalls. For the same\nworkloads, the L1I cache miss rates have one order of magnitude differences\namong diverse implementations with different software stacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 02:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

The\nneed for such protocol arises due to conflicting requirements (e.g., access to\nthe system should be restricted but emergency access should be provided). One\ncan design such systems with a tamper detection approach (based on the\nintuition of \"break the glass door\"). However, in a distributed system, such\ntampering, which are denoted as auditable events, is visible only for a single\nnode. This is unacceptable since the actions they take in these situations can\nbe different than those in the normal mode. Moreover, eventually, the auditable\nevent needs to be cleared so that system resumes the normal operation.\n  With this motivation, in this paper, we present a protocol for auditable\nrestoration, where any process can potentially identify an auditable event.\nWhenever a new auditable event occurs, the system must reach an \"auditable\nstate\" where every process is aware of the auditable event. Only after the\nsystem reaches an auditable state, it can begin the operation of restoration.\nAlthough any process can observe an auditable event, we require that only\n\"authorized\" processes can begin the task of restoration. Moreover, these\nprocesses can begin the restoration only when the system is in an auditable\nstate. Our protocol is self-stabilizing and has bounded state space. It can\neffectively handle the case where faults or auditable events occur during the\nrestoration protocol. Moreover, it can be used to provide auditable restoration\nto other distributed protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 04:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

Scheduling parallel jobs is performed as a\nmeans to balance the load of a system in order to improve the performance of a\nparallel application. Parallel job scheduling is presented as a mapping between\ntwo graphs: one represents the dependency of jobs and the other represents the\ninterconnection among processors. The usual implementation of parallel job\nscheduling algorithms is via the master-slave paradigm. The master-slave\nparadigm has inherent communication bottleneck that reduces the performance of\nthe system when more processors are needed to process the jobs. The multiagent\napproach attempts to distribute the communication latency among the processors\nwhich improves the performance of the system as the number of participating\nprocessors increases. Presented in this paper is a framework for the behavior\nof an autonomous agent that cooperates with other agents to achieve a community\ngoal of minimizing the processing time. Achieving this goal means an agent must\ntruthfully share information with other agents via {\\em normalization}, {\\em\ntask sharing}, and {\\em result sharing} procedures. The agents consider a\nparallel scientific application as a finite-horizon game where truthful\ninformation sharing results into performance improvement for the parallel\napplication. The performance of the multiagent-based algorithm is compared to\nthat of an existing one via a simulation of the wavepacket dynamics using the\nquantum trajectory method (QTM) as a test application. The average parallel\ncost of running the QTM using the multiagent-based system is lower at higher\nnumber of processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 06:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

The difficulty lies in\nthe fact that, for a recent applications with high-dimensional covariates, the\nnumber of possible high-order interaction features would be extremely large.\nIdentifying statistically significant features from such a huge pool of\ncandidates would be highly challenging both in computational and statistical\nsenses. To work with this problem, we consider a two stage algorithm where we\nfirst select a set of high-order interaction features by marginal screening,\nand then make statistical inferences on the regression model fitted only with\nthe selected features. Such statistical inferences are called post-selection\ninference (PSI), and receiving an increasing attention in the literature. One\nof the seminal recent advancements in PSI literature is the works by Lee et al.\nwhere the authors presented an algorithmic framework for computing exact\nsampling distributions in PSI. A main challenge when applying their approach to\nour high-order interaction models is to cope with the fact that PSI in general\ndepends not only on the selected features but also on the unselected features,\nmaking it hard to apply to our extremely high-dimensional high-order\ninteraction models. The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by\nintroducing a novel efficient method for PSI. Our key idea is to exploit the\nunderlying tree structure among high-order interaction features, and to develop\na pruning method of the tree which enables us to quickly identify a group of\nunselected features that are guaranteed to have no influence on PSI. The\nexperimental results indicate that the proposed method allows us to reliably\nidentify statistically significant high-order interaction features with\nreasonable computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 08:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

This is, however, computationally\nchallenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be\nconsidered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is\nsufficiently small. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for\nLASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models. Our basic\nstrategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently\nproposed safe feature screening (SFS) rule. An SFS rule has a property that, if\na feature satisfies the rule, then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active\nin the LASSO solution, meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the\nLASSO training process. If a large number of features can be screened-out\nbefore training the LASSO, the computational cost and the memory requirment can\nbe dramatically reduced. However, applying such an SFS rule to each of the\nextremely large number of high-order interaction features would be\ncomputationally infeasible. Our key idea for solving this computational issue\nis to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction\nfeatures. Specifically, we introduce a pruning condition called safe feature\npruning (SFP) rule which has a property that, if the rule is satisfied in a\ncertain node of the tree, then all the high-order interaction features\ncorresponding to its descendant nodes can be guaranteed to be non-active at the\noptimal solution.

Since the WBF and GF contributions are sensitive\nto different sources of physics beyond the Standard Model, we devise search\nstrategies to disentangle and isolate these production modes. While gluon\nfusion remains non-negligible in WBF-type selections, sizeable new physics\ncontributions to the latter can still be constrained. As an example of the\nlatter point we investigate the sensitivity that can be obtained for a\nmeasurement of the quartic Higgs-gauge boson couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 09:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

This fact\nposes challenges to the validity of some scenarios to address the black hole\ninformation problem.

It is shown that the quantum gravitational constraint is well defined\npast the singularity and that its effective dynamics possesses a bounce into an\nexpanding regime. The classical singularity is avoided, and a semiclassical\nspacetime satisfying vacuum Einstein's equations is recovered on the \"other\nside\" of the bounce. We argue that such metric represents the interior region\nof a white-hole spacetime, but for which the corresponding \"white-hole mass\"\ndiffers from the original black hole mass. Furthermore, we find that the value\nof the white-hole mass is proportional to the third power of the starting black\nhole mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 10:01:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 15:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

Analyzing the\nevolution of the photospheric magnetic flux and the coronal structure, we find\nthat the flux emergence triggered the eruption by interaction with overlying\nflux in a non-standard way. The new flux neither had the opposite orientation\nnor a location near the polarity inversion line, which are favorable for strong\nreconnection with the arcade flux under which it emerged. Moreover, its flux\ncontent remained significantly smaller than that of the arcade (approximately\n40 %). However, a loop system rooted in the trailing active region ran in part\nunder the arcade between the active regions, passing over the site of flux\nemergence. The reconnection with the emerging flux, leading to a series of jet\nemissions into the loop system, caused a strong but confined rise of the loop\nsystem. This lifted the arcade between the two active regions, weakening its\ndownward tension force and thus destabilizing the considerably sheared flux\nunder the arcade. The complex event was also associated with supporting\nprecursor activity in an enhanced network near the active regions, acting on\nthe large-scale overlying flux, and with two simultaneous confined flares\nwithin the active regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 11:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

This requires a break in the RLF\nlocated at log L_r~40.6 [erg/s].

We investigate the force-extension relation of branched filaments,\ngrafted on an elastic structure at one end and pushing with the free ends\nagainst the leading edge cell membrane. Single filaments are modeled as\nworm-like chains, whose thermal bending fluctuations are restricted by the\nleading edge cell membrane, resulting in an effective force. Branching can\nincrease the stiffness considerably; however the effect depends on branch point\nposition and filament orientation, being most pronounced for intermediate tilt\nangles and intermediate branch point positions. We describe filament networks\nwithout cross-linkers to focus on the effect of branching.

The primary system we model includes lighter fluid in the South and\nheavier fluid in the North with resulting slow meridional circulation and fast\nmean zonal motion. In a two-layer system the velocity shear between the layers\nresults in baroclinic instability which equilibrates with time and, due to\ninteraction with beta-effect generates zonal jets. This system is archetypal\nfor various geophysical systems including the general circulation and jet\nstreams in the Earths atmosphere, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current or the\nareas in the vicinity of western boundary currents where baroclinic instability\nand multiple zonal jets are observed. The gradient of the surface elevation and\nthe thickness of the upper layer are measured in the experiments using the\nAltimetric Imaging Velocimetry and the Optical Thickness Velocimetry techniques\nrespectively.

The\nmeridional wavelength of the jets varies linearly with the baroclinic radius of\ndeformation and is also in a good agreement with a modified Rhines scale.

It thus contains many\nimportant known examples of integrable equations, like the sine-Gordon,\nLiouville, KdV, mKdV, Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations, and is\nalso home to many new families of integrable equations. Our paper is concerned\nwith the question of the local isometric immersion in ${\\bf E}^{3}$ of the\npseudospherical surfaces defined by the solutions of equations belonging to the\nclass of Chern and Tenenblat. In the case of the sine-Gordon equation, it is a\nclassical result that the second fundamental form of the immersion depends only\non a jet of finite order of the solution of the pde.

The idea is to mix the\nvortex's internal gauge flux with an external flux using off-diagonal kinetic\nmixing. Such `dark' vortices could play a phenomenological role in models with\nboth cosmic strings and a dark gauge sector. When coupled to gravity they also\nprovide explicit ultra-violet completions for codimension-two brane-localized\nflux, which arises in extra-dimensional models when the same flux that\nstabilizes extra-dimensional size is also localized on space-filling branes\nsituated around the extra dimensions. We derive simple formulae for observables\nsuch as defect angle, tension, localized flux and on-vortex curvature when\ncoupled to gravity, and show how all of these are insensitive to much of the\nmicroscopic details of the solutions, and are instead largely dictated by\nlow-energy quantities. We derive the required effective description in terms of\na world-sheet brane action, and derive the matching conditions for its\ncouplings. We consider the case where the dimensions transverse to the bulk\ncompactify, and determine how the on- and off-vortex curvatures and other bulk\nfeatures depend on the vortex properties. We find that the brane-localized flux\ndoes not gravitate, but just renormalizes the tension in a magnetic-field\nindependent way. The existence of an explicit UV completion puts the effective\ndescription of these models on a more precise footing, verifying that\nbrane-localized flux can be consistent with sensible UV physics and resolving\nsome apparent paradoxes that can arise with a naive (but commonly used)\ndelta-function treatment of the brane's localization within the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 14:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 04:16:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In the case of gentle evaporation,\nlower energy electrons are significantly more efficient at heating the\natmosphere and driving up-flows sooner than higher energy electrons. We also\nfind that the threshold between explosive and gentle evaporation is not fixed\nat a given beam energy flux, but also depends strongly on the electron energy\nand duration of heating. Further, at low electron energies, a much weaker beam\nflux is required to drive explosive evaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 15:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

Ruin occurs when the central\nbranch is ruined. We find out that with one subsidiary ($I=1$), the finite time\nruin probability of the central branch may be explicitly written out in terms\nof the finite time ruin probability of the subsidiary, provided that the CB in\nthe absence of subsidiary bailouts is a deterministic drift. To study other\nproblems, like for example the optimization of dividends to the CB with one\nsubsidiary over a barrier, it is convenient to restrict to the case of\nphase-type claims to the subsidiary, and study the Markovian phase process at\nthe moments when the CB process reaches new minima. The resulting structure is\nquite close to that of the phase of a PH/G/1 queue at the moments when it\nreaches new minima, and this yields in principle numeric approaches to several\nproblems, based on the iterative calculation of the Laplace transforms of the\nupwards and downwards ladder times (also called excursions, and busy periods).\nIn this work we propose a different approach of further providing matrix\nexponential approximations for the distributions of the ladder times.

Gamification is an effective tool for attracting citizen\nscientists to provide solutions to research problems. While citizen science\ngames Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire have been used successfully to study protein\nand RNA folding and neuron mapping, so far gamification has not been applied to\nproblems in quantum physics. Does the fact that everyday experiences are based\non classical physics hinder the use of non-expert citizen scientists in the\nrealm of quantum mechanics? Here we report on Quantum Moves, an online platform\ngamifying optimization problems in quantum physics. We show that human players\nare able to find solutions to difficult problems associated with the task of\nquantum computing. Players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails,\nand analyses of their solutions provide insights into the problem of\noptimization of a more profound and general nature. Based on player strategies,\nwe have thus developed a new, few-parameter heuristic optimization method which\nefficiently outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The\nnumerical complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases for\nshorter process durations. To better understand this, we have made a\nlow-dimensional rendering of the optimization landscape. These studies show why\ntraditional optimization methods fail near the quantum speed limit, and they\nbring promise that combined analyses of optimization landscapes and heuristic\nsolution strategies may benefit wider classes of optimization problems in\nquantum physics and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2015 09:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 13:28:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 07:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}
