This\ndiscipline, while still young, exploits the spin of electrons. Most quantum\ndevices exploiting this property of electrons consists of alternating magnetic\nand nonmagnetic thin layers on a semiconductor substrate. One of the best tools\nused for characterizing these structures is the so-called Ballistic Electron\nEmission Microscope (BEEM). Originally, it was dedicated to the imaging of\nburied objects and to the study of the potential barrier formed at the\ninterface of a metal and a semiconductor. With the development of spintronics,\nthe BEEM became an essential spectroscopy technique but still fundamentally\nmisunderstood. The first realistic model, based on the non-equilibrium Keldysh\nformalism, was proposed to describe the transport of electrons during BEEM\nexperiments. However, despite its success, its use was limited to the study of\nsemi-infinite structures through a calculation method called decimation of\nGreen functions. In this context, we have extended this model to the case of\nthin films and hetero-structures like spinvalves: starting from the same\npostulate that electrons follow the band structure of materials in which they\npropagate, we have established an iterative formula allowing calculation of the\nGreen functions of the finite system by tight-binding method and encoded it in\na F90 code. In parallel, we have developed a simpler method which allows to\navoid passing through the non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism. Despite its\nsimplicity, we have shown that this intuitive approach gives some physical\ninterpretation qualitatively similar to the non-equilibrium approach. However,\nfor a more detailed study, the use of \"non-equilibrium approach\" is inevitable,\nespecially for the detection of thickness effects linked to layer interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 16:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

Here we present\nstrong evidence that this assumption is incorrect. The alternating maxima\nlikely result from the presence of one or more near-resonant modes which appear\nin the stellar spectra and are slightly but significantly offset from 3/2 times\nthe fundamental frequency. We show that a previously proposed explanation for\nthe presence of these peaks is inadequate. The phase-slip of the dominant\nnear-resonant peak in RR Lyr is shown to be fully correlated with the parity of\nthe observed alternations, providing further strong evidence that the process\nis nonresonant and cannot be characterized as period-doubling. The dominant\nnear-resonant peak in V808 Cyg has side-peaks spaced at twice the Blazhko\nfrequency. This apparent modulation indicates that the peak corresponds to a\nvibrational mode and also adds strong support to the beating-modes model of the\nBlazhko effect which can account for the doubled frequency.

To correctly include within\nstandard DFT slab calculations the influence of the SP, which is a bulk\nproperty, on a surface confined property such as the graphene's doping, we\nattach a double gold layer at the C-terminated bottom of the slab which\nintroduces a metal induced gap state that pins the chemical potential within\nthe gap. Furthermore, expanding the interlayer distances at the bottom of the\nslab creates a local dipole moment which counters that arising from the slab's\npolar character and allows to align the location of the graphene's Dirac point\n(DP) for cubic SiC(111) with the chemical potential. Thus, the DP shifts\nobtained for other polytypes under the same slab model become an almost direct\nmeasurement of the SP-induced doping. Our results confirm the recent proposal\nthat the SP induces the experimentally observed p-type doping in the graphene\nlayer which can achieve DP shifts of up to several hundreds of meV (or\nequivalently, $\\sim 10^{13} e$/cm$^2$) for specific polytypes. The doping is\nfound to increase with the hexagonality of the polytype and its thickness. For\nthe slab thickensses considered (6-12 SiC bilayers) an ample, almost\ncontinuous, range of doping values can be achieved by tuning the number of\nstacking defects and their location with respect to the surface.

For our analysis we isolate a partially defined\ndynamical system, to which we refer as the {\\em quantised dynamics} of the\nmonomial ideal.\n  In addition we revisit several previously considered constructions. These\ninclude Matsumoto's subshift C*-algebras, as well as the tensor and the Pimsner\nalgebras associated with dynamical systems or graphs. We sort out the various\nrelations by giving concrete conditions and counterexamples that orientate the\noperator algebras of our context.\n  It appears that the boundary C*-algebras do not arise as the quotient with\nthe compact operators unconditionally. We establish a dichotomy to this effect\nby examining the resulting tensor algebras. We identify their boundary\nrepresentations, we analyse their C*-envelopes, and we give criteria for\nhyperrigidity. Moreover we completely classify them in terms of the data\nprovided by the monomial ideals. For tensor algebras of C*-correspondences and\nbounded isomorphisms this is achieved up to the level of local conjugacy (in\nthe sense of Davidson and Roydor) for the quantised dynamics. For tensor\nalgebras of subproduct systems and algebraic isomorphisms this is achieved up\nto the level of equality of monomial ideals modulo permutations of the\nvariables.\n  In the process we accomplish more in different directions. Most notably we\nshow that tensor algebras form a complete invariant for isomorphic (resp.\nsimilar) subproduct systems of homogeneous ideals up to isometric (resp.\nbounded) isomorphisms.\n  The results on local conjugacy are obtained via an alternative proof of the\nbreakthrough result of Davidson and Katsoulis on piecewise conjugate systems.\nFor our purposes we use appropriate compressions of the Fock representation. We\nthen apply this alternative proof locally for the partially defined quantised\ndynamics. In this way we avoid the topological graphs machinery and pave the\nway for further applications. These include operator algebras of dynamical\nsystems over commuting contractions or over row commuting contractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 17:40:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 19:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

Solar-like states of differential rotation, arising\nwhen convection is rotationally constrained, are characterized by a very\ndifferent convective Reynolds stress than anti-solar regimes, wherein\nconvection only weakly senses the Coriolis force. We find that the angular\nmomentum transport by convective Reynolds stress plays a central role in\nestablishing the meridional flow profiles in these simulations.

However, this approach has a serious drawback: if the process being\nmodeled has a moving average component, then the autoregressive model order is\ntheoretically infinite, and in finite sample large empirical model orders may\nbe necessary, resulting in weak Granger-causal inference. This is particularly\nrelevant when the process has been filtered, downsampled, or observed with\n(additive) noise - all of which induce a moving average component and are\ncommonplace in application domains as diverse as econometrics and the\nneurosciences. By contrast, the class of autoregressive moving average models -\nor, equivalently, linear state space models - is closed under digital\nfiltering, downsampling (and other forms of aggregation) as well as additive\nobservational noise. Here, we show how Granger causality, conditional and\nunconditional, in both time and frequency domains, may be calculated simply and\ndirectly from state space model parameters, via solution of a discrete\nalgebraic Riccati equation.

A data structure state can therefore be used as an oracle\nto derive information about its history. As a result, for history-sensitive\napplications, such as privacy in e-voting, incremental signature schemes, and\nregulatory compliant data retention; it is imperative to conceal historical\ninformation contained within data structure states.\n  Data structure history can be hidden by making data structures history\nindependent.

There are two existing notions of history\nindependence -- weak history independence (WHI) and strong history independence\n(SHI). WHI does not protect against insider adversaries and SHI mandates\ncanonical representations, resulting in inefficiency.\n  We postulate the need for a broad, encompassing notion of history\nindependence, which can capture WHI, SHI, and a broad spectrum of new history\nindependence notions.

A boundary condition is the assignment of a collision map at each\ntangent space on the boundary of $M$ that gives the post-collision state of the\nsystem as a function of the pre-collision state. Our main result is a complete\ndescription of the space of linear collision maps satisfying energy and (linear\nand angular) momentum conservation, time reversibility, and the natural\nrequirement that impulse forces only act at the point of contact of the\ncolliding bodies.

Amongst\nthe common investigation methods deployed, we carried out three magnetotelluric\n(MT) surveys located above three of the most promising geothermal fields of\nMartinique, namely the Anses d'Arlet, the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e and the Pitons du\nCarbet prospects. A total of about 100 MT stations were acquired showing single\nor multi-dimensional behaviors and static shift effects. After processing data\nwith remote reference, 3-D MT inversions of the four complex elements of MT\nimpedance tensor without pre-static-shift correction, have been performed for\neach sector, providing three 3-D resistivity models down to about 12 to 30 km\ndepth. The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3-D inversion\nthrough generation of a 3-D resistivity model including the bathymetry around\nMartinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of\nthe model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to\nthe calculated MT response during the 3-D inversion process for comparison with\nthe observed data. 3-D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited\nfrom different geological history, show 3-D resistivity distribution and\nspecificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the\ngeothermal field related to the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e strato-volcano, is\ncharacterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic\ntypical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of\ngeothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse\nd'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be\nconnected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main\nstructural axis.

It is shown that the\nfrequent crossing of the Jones matrix eigenvalues as a function of wavelength\nleads to a non-physical interchange of the calculated principal axes; a method\nto remove this unwanted mathematical artefact and to restore the order of the\nsystem eigenvalues and the corresponding principal axes is provided. A\ncomparison of the two approaches reveals that the PDL method provides a smaller\nstandard deviation and therefore lower limit of detection in refractometric\nsensing. Furthermore, the polarization analysis of the measured spectra allows\nfor the identification of the principal states of polarization of the sensor\nsystem and consequentially for the calculation of the transmission spectrum for\nany incident polarization state. The stability of the orientation of the system\nprincipal axes is also investigated as a function of wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 20:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

With a 60 year-old history, superradiance has played a prominent role\nin optics, quantum mechanics and especially in relativity and astrophysics. In\nGeneral Relativity, black-hole superradiance is permitted by the ergoregion,\nthat allows for energy, charge and angular momentum extraction from the vacuum,\neven at the classical level. Stability of the spacetime is enforced by the\nevent horizon, where negative energy-states are dumped. Black-hole\nsuperradiance is intimately connected to the black-hole area theorem, Penrose\nprocess, tidal forces, and even Hawking radiation, which can be interpreted as\na quantum version of black-hole superradiance.

Using our global,\nself-consistent, multi-band model of nearby well-observed supernovae, we find\nthat the covariances of these quantities are strong and that the confidence\nellipsoids are oriented in the direction of the correlations, which reduces\ntheir significance. By proper treatment of the covariance matrix of the model,\nwe discover a significant intrinsic width to the correlations between $L_{\\rm\npl}$, $E_{\\rm exp}$, and $M_{\\rm Ni}$, where the uncertainties due to the\ndistance and the extinction dominate. For fixed $E_{\\rm exp}$, the spread in\n$M_{\\rm Ni}$ is about 0.25 dex, which we attribute to the differences in the\nprogenitor internal structure.

Here we go one step forward and use the DTWA\nmethod to study the dynamics of correlations in 2D systems with many spins and\ndifferent types of long-range couplings, in regimes where other numerical\nmethods are generally unreliable. We compute spatial and time-dependent\ncorrelations for spin-couplings that decay with distance as a power-law and\ndetermine the velocity at which correlations propagate through the system.\nSharp changes in the behavior of those velocities are found as a function of\nthe power-law decay exponent. Our predictions are relevant for a broad range of\nsystems including solid state materials, atom-photon systems and ultracold\ngases of polar molecules, trapped ions, Rydberg, and magnetic atoms. We\nvalidate the DTWA predictions for small 2D systems and 1D systems, but\nultimately, in the spirt of quantum simulation, experiments will be needed to\nconfirm our predictions for large 2D systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 21:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 19:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A double-isothermal model of an isothermal\nstellar system, embedded in an isothermal dark halo core provides an excellent\nfit to the various observed stellar surface density distributions. The stellar\nsystem can be well characterised by King profiles with a broad distribution of\nconcentration parameters c. The core scale length of the stellar system a_* is\nsensitive to the central dark matter density rho_0. In contrast to\nsingle-component systems, the cut-off radius of the stellar system, rs_t,\nhowever does not trace the tidal radius but the core radius r_c of its dark\nmatter halo. c is therefore sensitive to the ratio of the stellar to the dark\nmatter velocity dispersion, sigma_*/sigma_0. Simple empirical relationships are\nderived that allow to calculate the dark halo core parameters rho_0, r_c and\nsigma_0, given the observable quantities sigma_*, a_* and c. The DIS model is\napplied to the Milky Way's dSphs. Their halo velocity dispersions lie in a\nnarrow range of 10km/s <= sigma_0 <= 18km/s with halo core radii of 280pc <=\nr_c <= 1.3kpc and r_c=2a_*. All dSphs follow closely the same universal dark\nhalo core scaling relation rho_0*r_c=75 Msolar/pc^2 that characterises the\ncores of more massive galaxies over several orders of magnitude in mass. The\ndark matter core mass is a strong function of core radius. Inside a fixed\nradius r_u, with r_u the logarithmic mean of the dSph's core radii, the total\nenclosed mass M_u is however roughly constant, although outliers should exist.\nFor our dSphs we find r_u=400pc and M_u=2.6*10^7 Msolar. The core densities of\nthe Galaxy's dSphs are very high, with rho_0=0.2 Msolar/pc^3. They should\ntherefore be tidally undisturbed. Observational evidence for tidal effects\nmight then provide a serious challenge for the cold dark matter scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 22:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 22:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 08:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It boils down\ninto a form of wave function that undergoes a smooth stochastic drift of the\nphase in a local basis, the Quantum Drift (QD) model. This drift is nothing\nelse but a local energy fluctuation. Unlike Quantum Jumps (QJ) models, no jumps\nare present in the density as the evolution is unitary. As a first application,\nwe address the transport through a resonant state $\\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle $\nthat undergoes decoherence. We show the equivalence with the decoherent steady\nstate transport in presence of a B\\\"{u}ttiker's voltage probe. In order to test\nthe dynamics, we consider two many-spin systems whith a local energy\nfluctuation. A two-spin system is reduced to a two level system (TLS) that\noscillates among $\\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle $ $\\equiv $ $ \\left\\vert \\uparrow\n\\downarrow \\right\\rangle $ and $\\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle \\equiv $ $\\left\\vert\n\\downarrow \\uparrow \\right\\rangle $. We show that QD model recovers not only\nthe exponential damping of the oscillations in the low perturbation regime, but\nalso the non-trivial bifurcation of the damping rates at a critical point, i.e.\nthe quantum dynamical phase transition. We also address the spin-wave like\ndynamics of local polarization in a spin chain. The QD average solution has\nabout half the dispersion respect to the mean dynamics than QJ.

Further, for\nseveral models of epidemic spread on networks (e.g., the `flu-like' SIS model),\nit has been shown that an epidemic dies out quickly if the spectral radius of\nthe graph is below a certain threshold that depends on the model parameters.\nThis motivates a strategy to control epidemic spread by reducing the spectral\nradius of the underlying network.\n  In this paper, we develop a suite of provable approximation algorithms for\nreducing the spectral radius by removing the minimum cost set of edges\n(modeling quarantining) or nodes (modeling vaccinations), with different time\nand quality tradeoffs. Our main algorithm, \\textsc{GreedyWalk}, is based on the\nidea of hitting closed walks of a given length, and gives an\n$O(\\log^2{n})$-approximation, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes; it also\nperforms much better in practice compared to all prior heuristics proposed for\nthis problem.

Both of these new\ndatasets reach a depth of at least F814W$<$27 and clearly detect the blue\nhorizontal branch (BHB) of the field as a distinct feature of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram. We measure the density of BHB stars and the ratio of\nBHB to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to our\nprevious work. We find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of a\npower-law for the 2-D projected surface density with an index of\n2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\\alpha <$1.2 inside of\n3 kpc. Our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field BHB stars in\nM31 are part of the halo population. However, the total halo profile is now\nknown to differ from this BHB profile, which suggests that we have isolated the\nmetal-poor component. This component appears to have an unbroken power-law\nprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halo\nstellar mass. Discrepancies between the BHB density profile and other\nmeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the different\nprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than the\nprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. These\nprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of BHB/RGB stars in\nour observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 01:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We review possible mechanisms for emission on\nthese time scales and discuss computational challenges associated with their\ndetection: namely, the substantial volume of data involved in a search for very\nlong transients can require vast computer memory and processing time.

The intrinsic reference system of\nthe photon is determined by the \"action\" of a gauge potential, the Berry\npotential, on the helicity of the photon.

We present \"boxing\": a novel, yet conceptually simple, approach for\nfeeding input data to LFTJ. Our extensive analysis shows that this approach is\nI/O efficient, being worst-case optimal (in a certain sense). Furthermore, if\ninput data is only a constant factor larger than the available memory, then a\nboxed LFTJ essentially maintains the CPU data-complexity of the vanilla LFTJ.\nNext, focusing on LFTJ applied to the triangle query, we show that for many\ngraphs boxed LFTJ matches the I/O complexity of the recently by Hu, Tao and\nYufei proposed specialized algorithm MGT for listing tiangles in an out-of-core\nsetting.

We have assessed the HI component and its\nrelation to the optical galaxy, the cosmic web type (voids, sheets, filaments\nand knots), the overdensity parameter and analyzed the nearest galaxy\nneighbours. The aim is to understand the role of interactions and cosmological\naccretion flows in the XMP observational properties, particularly the\ntriggering and feeding of the star formation. We find that XMPs behave\nsimilarly to Blue Compact Dwarfs; they preferably populate low-density\nenvironments in the local Universe: ~60% occupy underdense regions, and ~75%\nreside in voids and sheets. This is more extreme than the distribution of\nirregular galaxies, and in contrast to those regions preferred by elliptical\ngalaxies (knots and filaments). We further find results consistent with\nprevious observations; while the environment does determine the fraction of a\ncertain galaxy type, it does not determine the overall observational\nproperties. With the exception of five documented cases (four sources with\ncompanions and one recent merger), XMPs do not generally show signatures of\nmajor mergers and interactions; we find only one XMP with a companion galaxy\nwithin a distance of 100 kpc, and the HI gas in XMPs is typically well-behaved,\ndemonstrating asymmetries mostly in the outskirts. We conclude that metal-poor\naccretion flows may be driving the XMP evolution.

The calculation\nof the potential of mean force profiles for the initial separation of the first\nfew terminal base pairs in a DNA oligomer reveal that forces ranging between\n130 and 230 pN are needed to disrupt the first base pair, values of an order of\nmagnitude larger than those needed to disrupt base pairs in partially unzipped\nDNA. The force peak has an \"echo,\" of approximately 50 pN, at the distance that\nunzips the second base pair. We show that the high peak needed to initiate\nunzipping derives from a free energy basin that is distinct from the basins of\nsubsequent base pairs because of entropic contributions and we highlight the\nmicroscopic origin of the peak. Our results suggest a new window of exploration\nfor single molecule experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 11:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In bilayers, for instance, interactions are\npredicted to open a gap at charge neutrality, turning the system into an\ninsulator, as observed experimentally. In mono and (Bernal-stacked) trilayers,\ninteractions, although still important, do not have an equally drastic effect,\nand these systems remain conducting at low temperature. It may be expected that\ninteraction effects become weaker for thicker multilayers, whose behavior\nshould eventually converge to that of graphite. Here we show that this\nexpectation does not correspond to reality by investigating the case of\nBernal-stacked tetralayer graphene (4LG). We reveal the occurrence of a robust\ninsulating state in a narrow range of carrier densities around charge\nneutrality, incompatible with the behavior expected from the single-particle\nband structure. The phenomenology resembles that observed in bilayers, but the\nstronger conductance suppression makes the insulating state in 4LG visible at\nhigher temperature. To account for our findings, we suggest a natural\ngeneralization of the interaction-driven, symmetry-broken states proposed for\nbilayers. This generalization also explains the systematic even-odd effect of\ninteractions in Bernal-stacked layers of different thickness that is emerging\nfrom experiments, and has implications for the multilayer-to-graphite\ncrossover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 13:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

The result\ngeneralises reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and kinetic RMHD (Schekochihin\net al. 2009) for pressure-anisotropic plasmas, allowing for species drifts---a\nsituation routinely encountered in the solar wind and presumably ubiquitous in\nhot dilute astrophysical plasmas (e.g. intracluster medium). Two main\nobjectives are achieved. First, in a non-Maxwellian plasma, the relationships\nbetween fluctuating fields (e.g., the Alfven ratio) are order-unity modified\ncompared to the more commonly considered Maxwellian case, and so a quantitative\ntheory is developed to support quantitative measurements now possible in the\nsolar wind. The main physical feature of low-frequency plasma turbulence\nsurvives the generalisation to non-Maxwellian distributions: Alfvenic and\ncompressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled, with the latter passively\nadvected by the former; the Alfvenic cascade is fluid, satisfying RMHD\nequations (with the Alfven speed modified by pressure anisotropy and species\ndrifts), whereas the compressive cascade is kinetic and subject to\ncollisionless damping. Secondly, the organising principle of this turbulence is\nelucidated in the form of a generalised kinetic free-energy invariant. It is\nshown that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function reduce the rate\nof phase mixing and the efficacy of magnetic stresses; these changes influence\nthe partitioning of free energy amongst the various cascade channels. As the\nfirehose or mirror instability thresholds are approached, the dynamics of the\nplasma are modified so as to reduce the energetic cost of bending\nmagnetic-field lines or of compressing/rarefying them. Finally, it is shown\nthat this theory can be derived as a long-wavelength limit of non-Maxwellian\nslab gyrokinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 14:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 13:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

The proposed scenario includes a new ingredient of a binary system\nthat breaks-up inside a common envelope. We use the binary c software to\ncalculate the post break-up evolution of the system, and show that both low\nmass stars end as helium WDs. One of the two lower mass stars that ends further\nout, the tertiary star, transfers mass to the ONeMg WD remnant of the massive\nstar, and triggers the AIC. The inner low mass main sequence star evolves\nlater, induces AIC if the tertiary had not done it already, and spins-up the NS\nto form a millisecond pulsar. This scenario is not extremely sensitive to many\nof the parameters, such as the eccentricity of the tertiary star and the\norbital separation of the secondary star after the low mass binary system\nbreaks loose inside the envelope, and to the initial masses of these stars. The\nproposed scenario employs an efficient envelope removal by jets launched by the\ncompact object immersed in the giant envelope, and the newly proposed grazing\nenvelope evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 15:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 17:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The\nvariables belonging to a relevant subset should have a strong integration with\nthe other variables of the same relevant subset, and a much weaker interaction\nwith the other system variables. On this basis, extending previous works on\nneural networks, an information-theoretic measure is introduced, i.e. the\nDynamical Cluster Index, in order to identify good candidate relevant subsets.\nThe method does not require any previous knowledge of the relationships among\nthe system variables, but relies on observations of their values in time. We\nshow its usefulness in several application domains, including: (i) random\nboolean networks, where the whole network is made of different subnetworks with\ndifferent topological relationships (independent or interacting subnetworks);\n(ii) leader-follower dynamics, subject to noise and fluctuations; (iii)\ncatalytic reaction networks in a flow reactor; (iv) the MAPK signaling pathway\nin eukaryotes. The validity of the method has been tested in cases where the\ndata are generated by a known dynamical model and the Dynamical Cluster Index\nmethod is applied in order to uncover significant aspects of its organization;\nhowever it is important to stress that it can also be applied to time series\ncoming from field data without any reference to a model. Given that it is based\non relative frequencies of sets of values, the method could be applied also to\ncases where the data are not ordered in time. Several indications to improve\nthe scope and effectiveness of the Dynamical Cluster Index to analyze the\norganization of complex systems are finally given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 10:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

In micro-to-macro theoretical models of economic exchanges based\non kinetic equations, the income distribution depends only on the asymptotic\nequilibrium solutions, while mobility estimates also involve the detailed\nstructure of the transition probabilities of the model, and are thus an\nimportant tool for assessing its validity. Empirical data show a remarkably\ngeneral negative correlation between economic inequality and mobility, whose\nexplanation is still unclear. It is therefore particularly interesting to study\nthis correlation in analytical models. In previous work we investigated the\nbehavior of the Gini inequality index in kinetic models in dependence on\nseveral parameters which define the binary interactions and the taxation and\nredistribution processes: saving propensity, taxation rates gap, tax evasion\nrate, welfare means-testing etc. Here, we check the correlation of mobility\nwith inequality by analyzing the mobility dependence from the same parameters.\nAccording to several numerical solutions, the correlation is confirmed to be\nnegative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 14:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}
