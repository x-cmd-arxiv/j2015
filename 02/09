The conventional way to do this involves an\neigenvalue-decomposition of a matrix related to the beam matrix, and may be\napplied to the case of 1, 2 or 3 particle degrees of freedom. For 2 degrees of\nfreedom, a different normalization method involving \"real Dirac matrices\" has\nrecently been proposed.

Generally, documents become long due to two different reasons -\nverbosity and multi-topicality. First, verbosity means that the same topic is\nrepeatedly mentioned by terms related to the topic, so that term frequency is\nmore increased than the well-summarized one. Second, multi-topicality indicates\nthat a document has a broad discussion of multi-topics, rather than single\ntopic. Although these document characteristics should be differently handled,\nall previous methods of term frequency normalization have ignored these\ndifferences and have used a simplified length-driven approach which decreases\nthe term frequency by only the length of a document, causing an unreasonable\npenalization. To attack this problem, we propose a novel TF normalization\nmethod which is a type of partially-axiomatic approach. We first formulate two\nformal constraints that the retrieval model should satisfy for documents having\nverbose and multi-topicality characteristic, respectively. Then, we modify\nlanguage modeling approaches to better satisfy these two constraints, and\nderive novel smoothing methods.

We\ndemonstrate the use of this technique to measure changes in the Advanced LIGO\ninput mode cleaner cavity geometry as a function of input power, and\nsubsequently infer the optical absorption at the mirror surfaces at the level\nof 1 ppm per mirror. We also demonstrate the generation of a useful error\nsignal for thermal state of the Advanced LIGO power recycling cavity by\ncontinuously tracking the first order spatial mode resonance frequency. Such an\nerror signal could be used as an input to thermal compensation systems to\nmaintain the interferometer cavity geometries in the presence of transients in\ncirculating light power levels, thereby maintaining optimal sensitivity and\nmaximizing the duty-cycle of the detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 18:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

Such a period is often critical for timely data\nprocessing. Hence, we call it a memory-performance critical section.\nUnfortunately, in multicore architecture, non-real-time applications on\ndifferent cores may also demand high memory bandwidth at the same time, which\ncan substantially increase the time spent on the memory performance critical\nsections.\n  In this paper, we present BWLOCK, user-level APIs and a memory bandwidth\ncontrol mechanism that can protect such memory performance critical sections of\nsoft real-time applications. BWLOCK provides simple lock like APIs to declare\nmemory-performance critical sections. If an application enters a\nmemory-performance critical section, the memory bandwidth control system then\ndynamically limit other cores' memory access rates to protect memory\nperformance of the application until the critical section finishes.\n  From case studies with real-world soft real-time applications, we found (1)\nsuch memory-performance critical sections do exist and are often easy to\nidentify; and (2) applying BWLOCK for memory critical sections significantly\nimprove performance of the soft real-time applications at a small or no cost in\nthroughput of non real-time applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 19:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

This brings the\nnumber of similar binaries among the Kepler sample to six, and the two new\nsystems have the shortest orbital periods among them. The white dwarf in KIC\n9164561 has the largest thermal bloating, compared to its cold degenerate\nradius, of about a factor of 14. We utilize RV measurements of the A star in\nKIC 9164561 to determine the white dwarf mass rather accurately: 0.197 +/-\n0.005 Msun. The mass of the white dwarf in KIC 10727668 is based on the Doppler\nboosting signal in the Kepler photometry, and is less accurately determined to\nbe 0.266 +/- 0.035 Msun. Based on the inferred radii and effective temperatures\nof these two white dwarfs we are able to make an independent theoretical\nestimate of their masses to within ~0.01 Msun based on evolutionary models of\ntheir cooling history after they lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes.

In this work we consider a well\nstudied stochastic network which is perhaps the simplest example of a model\nwith more than one dimensional workload process. In the regime considered here,\nthe singular control problem corresponding to the EWF does not have a simple\nform explicit solution, however by considering an associated free boundary\nproblem one can give a representation for an optimal controlled process as a\ntwo dimensional reflected Brownian motion in a Lipschitz domain whose boundary\nis determined by the solution of the free boundary problem. Using the form of\nthe optimal solution we propose a sequence of control policies, given in terms\nof suitable thresholds, for the scaled stochastic network control problems and\nprove that this sequence of policies is asymptotically optimal.

In respect of multi-view learning, however,\nit is limited by its capability of only handling data represented by two-view\nfeatures, while in many real-world applications, the number of views is\nfrequently many more. Although the ad hoc way of simultaneously exploring all\npossible pairs of features can numerically deal with multi-view data, it\nignores the high order statistics (correlation information) which can only be\ndiscovered by simultaneously exploring all features.\n  Therefore, in this work, we develop tensor CCA (TCCA) which straightforwardly\nyet naturally generalizes CCA to handle the data of an arbitrary number of\nviews by analyzing the covariance tensor of the different views. TCCA aims to\ndirectly maximize the canonical correlation of multiple (more than two) views.\nCrucially, we prove that the multi-view canonical correlation maximization\nproblem is equivalent to finding the best rank-1 approximation of the data\ncovariance tensor, which can be solved efficiently using the well-known\nalternating least squares (ALS) algorithm. As a consequence, the high order\ncorrelation information contained in the different views is explored and thus a\nmore reliable common subspace shared by all features can be obtained. In\naddition, a non-linear extension of TCCA is presented.

Previous asymptotic results for the Hele-Shaw finger\nproblem with kinetic undercooling suggest that for a given value of the kinetic\nundercooling parameter, there is a discrete set of possible finger shapes, each\nanalytic at the nose and occupying a different fraction of the channel width.\nIn the limit in which the kinetic undercooling parameter vanishes, the fraction\nfor each family approaches 1/2, suggesting that this 'selection' of 1/2 by\nkinetic undercooling is qualitatively similar to the well-known analogue with\nsurface tension.

Anyone with\naccess to the Web is able to play a part on Wikipedia, an open and free\nencyclopedia. Wikipedia, available in many languages, is one of the most\nvisited websites in the world and arguably one of the primary sources of\nknowledge on the Web. However, not everyone is contributing to Wikipedia from a\ndiversity point of view; several groups are severely underrepresented. One of\nthose groups is women, who make up approximately 16% of the current contributor\ncommunity, meaning that most of the content is written by men. In addition,\nalthough there are specific guidelines of verifiability, notability, and\nneutral point of view that must be adhered by Wikipedia content, these\nguidelines are supervised and enforced by men.\n  In this paper, we propose that gender bias is not about participation and\nrepresentation only, but also about characterization of women. We approach the\nanalysis of gender bias by defining a methodology for comparing the\ncharacterizations of men and women in biographies in three aspects: meta-data,\nlanguage, and network structure.

A point $x$ of P.I.L. was called\nregular if P.I.L. has the natural Riemann Surface structure at $x$ and was\ncalled irregular otherwise. The notion of the signature $sign(x,c)$ of $x$ with\nrespect to a critical point $c$, which was shown to be a local invariant of\nP.I.L. was introduced and developed. It was shown that $sign(x,c)$ is\nnontrivial for some critical points $c$ if and only if $x$ is an irregular\npoint. It was shown that the local topology of P.I.L. at an irregular point $x$\nhas a property, that removing $x$ from any its neighborhood breaks some\npath-connected component of that neighborhood into an uncountable number of\npath-connected components. Finally, various signatures, including signatures of\nthe invariant lifts of super-attracting and attracting cycles and certain\nsignatures of the invariant lift of a parabolic cycle, were computed. All these\nsignatures had a maximal element. In this work we show that the local topology\nof P.I.L. at irregular points with different types of signatures is different.\nNamely, we prove that the local topology at an irregular point $x$ has a\nproperty, that for any neighborhood $V$ of $x$ and for some point $y\\ne x$ in\n$V$, the open set $V-\\{y\\}$ consists of uncountable number of path-connected\ncomponents, if and only if the signature $sign(x,c)$, for some critical point\n$c$, has no maximal element.

Soon after its\nemergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over\nscaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students\nto take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA\ndesign also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions\nwith students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of\nbelievability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive\nlearning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA,\nAffective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and\nimplement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with\nstudents with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of\npedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory\nto design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors\nof students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to\nlearn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and\nAffectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage\nthem to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can\ninteract with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the\nagent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an\neducator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent\ncan perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators\ninto the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system,\nwhich can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a\nnatural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 05:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

The study includes an\nanalytical treatment of the evolution of the envelop lost by the star within\nthe jet, and calculations of the related high-energy radiation.\n  The model readily explains the day-long, variable on timescales of hours, GeV\ngamma-ray flare from \\c454, observed during November 2010 on top of a\nweeks-long plateau. In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a\nstrong wind generated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal\nparticles accelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself\ncould be produced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the\ninitial impact of the jet. In the framework of the proposed scenario, the\nobservations constrain the key model parameters of the source, including the\nmass of the central black hole: $M_{\\rm BH}\\simeq 10^9 M_{\\odot}$, the total\njet power: $L_{\\rm j}\\simeq 10^{48}\\,\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$, and the Doppler factor\nof the gamma-ray emitting clouds, $\\delta\\simeq 20$.

A study on the\nplasma continuous spectrum shows that in low beta, large aspect ratio plasma,\nthe main impact of anisotropy lies in the modification of the BAE gap and the\nsound frequency, if the q profile is conserved. The SA model preserves the BAE\ngap structure as ideal MHD, while in CGL the lowest frequency branch does not\ntouch zero frequency at the resonant flux surface where $m+nq=0$, inducing a\ngap at very low frequency.

A time-dependent rate equation, implemented in\nthe detailed level accounting approximation, is utilized to study the dynamical\nevolution of the level population and emission properties of the highly\ntransient plasmas. For x-ray pulses with photon energy in the range of 937-1030\neV, where $1s\\rightarrow 2p$ resonance absorption from single core-hole (SCH)\nstates of neon charge states exist, inner-shell resonant absorption (IRA)\neffects play important roles in the time evolution of population and DCH\nspectroscopy.

Among various\ncell types, the Red Blood Cell (RBC) possesses a relatively simple cytoskeletal\nstructure. Underneath the membrane, the RBC cytoskeleton takes the form of a\ntwo dimensional triangular network, consisting of nodes of actins (and other\nproteins) and edges of spectrins. Recent experiments focusing on the malaria\ninfected RBCs (iRBCs) showed that there is a correlation between the elongation\nof spectrins in the cytoskeletal network and the stiffening of the iRBCs. Here\nwe rationalize the correlation between these two observations by combining the\nworm-like chain (WLC) model for single spectrins and the Effective Medium\nTheory (EMT) for the network elasticity. We specifically focus on how the\ndisorders in the cytoskeletal network affect its macroscopic elasticity.\nAnalytical and numerical solutions from our model reveal that the stiffness of\nthe membrane increases with increasing end-to-end distances of spectrins, but\nhas a non-monotonic dependence on the variance of the end-to-end distance\ndistributions. These predictions are verified quantitively by our AFM and\nmicropipette aspiration measurements of iRBCs.

The first one is to find\na trajectory in the configuration space of a mobile manipulator so as to follow\na given trajectory in the task space. The second objective consists in locally\nadjusting the trajectory in the configuration space in order to avoid\ncollisions with potentially moving obstacles and self-collisions in\nunstructured and dynamic environments. The perception is exclusively based on a\nset of proximity sensors distributed on the robot mechanical structure and\nvisual information are not required. Thanks to the adoption of this kind of\nproximity distributed perception, the approach does not require a 3D model of\nthe robot and allows the real-time collision avoidance without the need of a\nsensorized environment. To achieve the features cited above, a behaviour-based\ntechnique known as Null-Space-Based (NSB) approach has been adopted with some\nmodifications.On one hand, the concept of a total pseudo-energy based on the\ninformation from the distributed sensors has been introduced. On the other\nhand, a method to combine different tasks has been proposed to guarantee the\nsmoothness of the realtime trajectory adjustments. Another significant feature\nof the method is the strict coordination between the base and the arm\nexploiting the redundant degrees of freedom, that is a relevant topic in mobile\nmanipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 12:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

The superiority of the adaptive clustering with respect to the\naverage-linkage algorithm follows because it achieves a good compromise on\nthreshold values: Thresholds based on the cut-off distance are sufficiently\nsmall to assure the homogeneity and also large enough to guarantee at least a\npair of merging sets. This approach is applied to a set of possible\nsubstituents in a chemical series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 14:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

Improving the tools that model the\nspatial distributions of SOC stocks at national scales is a priority, both for\nmonitoring changes in SOC and as an input for global carbon cycles studies. In\nthis paper, we compare and evaluate two recent and promising modelling\napproaches. First, we considered several increasingly complex boosted\nregression trees (BRT), a convenient and efficient multiple regression model\nfrom the statistical learning field. Further, we considered a robust\ngeostatistical approach coupled to the BRT models. Testing the different\napproaches was performed on the dataset from the French Soil Monitoring\nNetwork, with a consistent cross-validation procedure. We showed that when a\nlimited number of predictors were included in the BRT model, the standalone BRT\npredictions were significantly improved by robust geostatistical modelling of\nthe residuals. However, when data for several SOC drivers were included, the\nstandalone BRT model predictions were not significantly improved by\ngeostatistical modelling. Therefore, in this latter situation, the BRT\npredictions might be considered adequate without the need for geostatistical\nmodelling, provided that i) care is exercised in model fitting and validating,\nand ii) the dataset does not allow for modelling of local spatial\nautocorrelations, as is the case for many national systematic sampling schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 15:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

Here Hindustani Music has been\nused as a reference frame for tracking the changing perception of emotions. It\nhas been found that different emotions perceived from Hindustani Music form a\nparticular sequential pattern when their corresponding pitch periods are\nanalyzed using the standard deviations and mean successive squared\ndifferences.This sequential pattern of emotions coincides with their\ncorresponding sequential pattern of tempos or average number of steady states.\nOn the basis of this result we further found that the range of perception of\nemotions has diminished significantly these days compared to what it was\nbefore. The proportion of responses for the perceived emotions like Anger,\nSerenity, Romantic and Sorrow has also decreased to a great extent than what it\nwas previously. The proportion of responses for the perceived emotion Anxiety\nhas increased phenomenally. Both standard deviation and mean successive squared\ndifference are two very good measures in tracking the changing perception of\nemotions. The overall pattern of the change of perceived emotions has\ncorresponded to the psychological and sociological change of human life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 18:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-02"}

Based on the conformational Hamiltonian and the idea of slow\nvariables (molecular torsions) slaving fast ones the conversion from the\ndifferentiate state to pluripotent state is defined as the quantum transition\nbetween conformational states. The transitional rate is calculated and an\nanalytical form for the rate formulas is deduced. Then the dependence of the\nrate on the number of torsion angles of the gene and the magnitude of the rate\ncan be estimated by comparison with protein folding. The reaction equations of\nthe conformational change of the pluripotency genes in chemical reprogramming\nare given. The characteristic time of the chemical reprogramming is calculated\nand the result is consistent with experiments. The dependence of the transition\nrate on physical factors such as temperature, PH value and the volume and shape\nof the coherent domain is analyzed from the rate equation. It is suggested that\nby decreasing the coherence degree of some pluripotency genes a more effective\napproach to the physically induced pluripotency can be made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 02:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}
