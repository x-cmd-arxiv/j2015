This study analyzes a\nTwitter dataset because it provides the exact geographic distance between\ncorresponding users. We start by introducing a strong definition of \"friend\" on\nTwitter (i.e., a definition of bidirectional friendship), requiring\nbidirectional communication. Next, we utilize geo-tagged mentions delivered by\nusers to determine their locations, where \"@username\" is contained anywhere in\nthe body of tweets. To provide analysis results, we first introduce a friend\ncounting algorithm. From the fact that Twitter users are likely to post\nconsecutive tweets in the static mode, we also introduce a two-stage distance\nestimation algorithm. As the first of our main contributions, we verify that\nthe number of friends of a particular Twitter user follows a well-known\npower-law distribution (i.e., a Zipf's distribution or a Pareto distribution).\nOur study also provides the following newly-discovered friendship degree\nrelated to the issue of space: The number of friends according to distance\nfollows a double power-law (i.e., a double Pareto law) distribution, indicating\nthat the probability of befriending a particular Twitter user is significantly\nreduced beyond a certain geographic distance between users, termed the\nseparation point. Our analysis provides concrete evidence that Twitter can be a\nuseful platform for assigning a more accurate scalar value to the degree of\nfriendship between two users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 16:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 12:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 07:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 08:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

In contrast to\nclassical transport, the transported charge was shown to be quantized and\npurely determined by the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust to\nperturbations. On a fundamental level, the quantized charge transport can be\nconnected to a topological invariant, the Chern number, first introduced in the\ncontext of the integer quantum Hall effect. A Thouless quantum pump may\ntherefore be regarded as a 'dynamical' version of the integer quantum Hall\neffect. Here, we report on the realization of such a topological charge pump\nusing ultracold bosonic atoms that form a Mott insulator in a dynamically\ncontrolled optical superlattice potential. By taking in-situ images of the atom\ncloud, we observe a quantized deflection per pump cycle. We reveal the genuine\nquantum nature of the pump by showing that, in contrast to ground state\nparticles, a counterintuitive reversed deflection occurs when particles are\nprepared in the first excited band. Furthermore, we were able to directly\ndemonstrate that the system undergoes a controlled topological phase transition\nin higher bands when tuning the superlattice parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 17:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Local bifurcations are characterised\nby a single or a pair of characteristic exponents crossing the imaginary axis.\nThe approach of such bifurcations in the presence of noise can be inferred from\nthe slowing down of the correlation decay. On the other hand, little is known\nabout global bifurcations involving high-dimensional attractors with positive\nLyapunov exponents.\n  The global stability of chaotic attractors may be characterised by the\nspectral properties of the Koopman or the transfer operators governing the\nevolution of statistical ensembles. It has recently been shown that a boundary\ncrisis in the Lorenz flow coincides with the approach to the unit circle of the\neigenvalues of these operators associated with motions about the attractor, the\nstable resonances. A second type of resonances, the unstable resonances, is\nresponsible for the decay of correlations and mixing on the attractor. In the\ndeterministic case, those cannot be expected to be affected by general boundary\ncrises.\n  Here, however, we give an example of chaotic system in which slowing down of\nthe decay of correlations of some observables does occur at the approach of a\nboundary crisis. The system considered is a high-dimensional, chaotic climate\nmodel of physical relevance. Moreover, coarse-grained approximations of the\ntransfer operators on a reduced space, constructed from a long time series of\nthe system, give evidence that this behaviour is due to the approach of\nunstable resonances to the unit circle. That the unstable resonances are\naffected by the crisis can be physically understood from the fact that the\nprocess responsible for the instability, the ice-albedo feedback, is also\nactive on the attractor. Implications regarding response theory and the design\nof early-warning signals are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 17:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 15:56:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 22:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Both shocks have impact angles of 30$^o$ in relation to the\nSun-Earth line. Lastly, we choose a frontal perpendicular shock, FPS, whose\nshock normal is along the Sun-Earth line, with the same Mach number as IOS-1.\nWe find that, in the IOS-1 case, due to the north-south asymmetry, the\nmagnetotail is deflected southward, leading to a mild compression. The\ngeomagnetic activity observed in the nightside ionosphere is then weak. On the\nother hand, in the head-on case, the FPS compresses the magnetotail from both\nsides symmetrically. This compression triggers a substorm allowing a larger\namount of stored energy in the magnetotail to be released to the nightside\nionosphere, resulting in stronger geomagnetic activity. By comparing IOS-2 and\nFPS, we find that, despite the IOS-2 having a larger Mach number, the FPS leads\nto a larger geomagnetic response in the nightside ionosphere. As a result, we\nconclude that IP shocks with similar upstream conditions, such as magnetic\nfield, speed, density, and Mach number, can have different geoeffectiveness,\ndepending on their shock normal orientation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 17:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 22:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

Jets blowing tangentially to the\nmain flow allow to force the wake with variable frequency and amplitude.\nDepending on the forcing conditions, two flow regimes can be distinguished.\nFirst, in case of broadband actuation with frequencies comprising the natural\nwake time scale, the convection of the jet structures enhances wake\nentrainment, shortens the length of the recirculating flow and increases drag.\nSecondly, at higher actuation frequencies, shear-layer deviation leads to\nfluidic boat-tailing of the wake. It additionally lowers its turbulent kinetic\nenergy thus reducing the entrainment of momentum towards the recirculating\nflow. The combination of both mechanisms produces a raise of the base pressure\nand reduces the drag of the model. Both actuation regimes are characterized by\ncomplementary velocity, pressure and drag measurements at several upstream\nconditions and control parameters. By adding curved surfaces to deviate the\njets by the Coanda effect, periodic actuation is reinforced and drag reductions\nof about 20% are achieved.

Although this model is valid in simple situations, such as the\npresence of a beam splitter, it is not necessarily valid when a system with\nmany degrees of freedom is involved. In order to address this issue, we\nconsider in this paper various atomic transitions corresponding to\namplification or attenuation using the master-equation- (ME-) based approach to\nmodel the QN and to compare the results with the SC-CM. For a four-level system\nthat consists of a transition producing a broad gain peak and a transition\nproducing an absorption dip, which results in perfect transparency at the\ncenter, we observe a catastrophic breakdown of the SC-CM. We also show that for\na general two-level atomic system, the SC-CM does not apply, except in the\nlimiting case when only either amplification or attenuation exists. A special\ncase where the two models predict the same result is a {\\Lambda}-type\nthree-level electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system in which the\nQN at zero detuning vanishes while the system is in the dark state. We also\nstudy an optically pumped five-level gain EIT system which has a perfect\ntransparency dip superimposed on a gain profile, and yields the negative\ndispersion suitable for use in enhancing the sensitivity-bandwidth product of\nan interferometric gravitational wave detector. In this case, we find that, for\nsome set of parameters, the QN is vanishingly small at the center of the dip,\nand the SC-CM agrees closely with the ME model. However, we also find that for\nsome other set of parameters, the SC-SM model disagrees strongly with the ME\nmodel. All these cases illustrate a wide range of variations in the degree of\ndisagreement between the predictions of the SC-CM and the ME approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 18:41:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2015 15:32:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 22:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 15:20:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 19:34:02 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 21:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate. These three-hair relations were found to hold in neutron stars that\nrotate rigidly, as is the case in old pulsars, but neutron stars can also\nrotate differentially, as is the case for proto-neutron stars and hypermassive\ntransient remnants of binary mergers. We here extend the three-hair relations\nto differentially rotating stars for the first time with a generic rotation law\nusing two approximations: a weak-field scheme (an expansion in powers of the\nneutron star compactness) and a perturbative differential rotation scheme (an\nexpansion about rigid rotation).

FIRE incorporates explicit stellar feedback\nin the multi-phase ISM, with energetics from stellar population models. We find\nthat stellar feedback, without \"fine-tuned\" parameters, greatly alleviates\nsmall-scale problems in CDM.

Results: The\nIntra-Cluster Medium (ICM) temperature shows a remarkable drop from\n8.5$_{-0.6}^{+0.8}$ keV to 2.7$_{-0.4}^{+0.7}$ keV across the northern radio\nrelic. The temperature drop is consistent with a Mach number ${\\cal\nM}_n=2.7^{+0.7}_{-0.4}$ and a shock velocity\n$v_{shock:n}=2300_{-400}^{+700}\\rm\\,km\\,s^{-1}$.

However, the ICM temperature\nbeyond this relic is much higher than beyond the northern one, which gives a\nMach number ${\\cal M}_s=1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ and shock velocity\n$v_{shock:s}=2040_{-410}^{+550}\\rm \\,km\\,s^{-1}$.

For the northern radio relic, the Mach numbers derived from X-ray and\nradio observations agree with each other. Based on the shock velocities, we\nestimate that CIZA J2242.8+5301 is observed approximately 0.6 Gyr after core\npassage. The magnetic field pressure at the northern relic is estimated to be\n9% of the thermal pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 20:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

Simulation by CRR offers an alternative way of coping with\nthe complexity of range computation.

They are however static\nprocesses that do not adapt to the states they measure. Advances in the field\nof adaptive measurement have shown that this limitation can be overcome by\n\"wrapping\" the von Neumann projectors in a higher-dimensional circuit which\nexploits the interplay between measurement outcomes and measurement settings.\nUnfortunately, the design of adaptive measurement has often been ad hoc and\nsetup-specific. We shall here develop a unified framework for designing\noptimized measurements. Our approach is two-fold: The first is algebraic and\nformulates the problem of measurement as a simple matrix diagonalization\nproblem. The second is algorithmic and models the optimal interaction between\nmeasurement outcomes and measurement settings as a cascaded network of\nconditional probabilities. Finally, we demonstrate that several figures of\nmerit, such as Bell factors, can be improved by optimized measurements. This\nleads us to the promising observation that measurement detectors which---taken\nindividually---have a low quantum efficiency can be be arranged into circuits\nwhere, collectively, the limitations of inefficiency are compensated for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2015 20:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The H infinity norm of a system measures its robustness by quantifying\nthe worst-case behavior of a system perturbed by a unit-energy disturbance.\nHowever, the disturbance that induces such worst-case behavior requires perfect\ncoordination among all disturbance channels. Given that many systems of\ninterest, such as the power grid, the internet and automated vehicle platoons,\nare large-scale and spatially distributed, such coordination may not be\npossible, and hence the H infinity norm, used as a measure of robustness, may\nbe too conservative. We therefore propose a cardinality constrained variant of\nthe H infinity norm in which an adversarial disturbance can use only a limited\nnumber of channels. As this problem is inherently combinatorial, we present a\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation based on the l1 norm that yields an\nupper bound on the cardinality constrained robustness problem. We further\npropose a simple rounding heuristic based on the optimal solution of SDP\nrelaxation which provides a lower bound. Motivated by privacy in large-scale\nsystems, we also extend these relaxations to computing the minimum gain of a\nsystem subject to a limited number of inputs. Finally, we also present a SDP\nbased optimal controller synthesis method for minimizing the SDP relaxation of\nour novel robustness measure.

We\nused the Chandra X-ray Observatory to study M37, a 500-Myr-old open cluster\nthat has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$). M37\nwas observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ksec, to\nmeasure stellar X-ray luminosities ($L_{\\mathrm{X}}$), a proxy for coronal\nactivity, across a wide range of masses. The cluster's membership catalog was\nrevisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric data\nand each star's distance to the cluster center. The result is a comprehensive\nsample of 1699 M37 members: 426 with $P_{\\rm rot}$, 278 with X-ray detections,\nand 76 with both. We calculate Rossby numbers, $R_o = P_{\\rm rot}/\\tau$, where\n$\\tau$ is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the X-ray-to-bolometric\nluminosity, $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$, to minimize mass dependencies in our\ncharacterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 Myr. We find\nthat fast rotators, for which $R_o<0.09\\pm0.01$, show saturated levels of\nactivity, with log($L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm bol}$)$=-3.06\\pm0.04$.

This\nframework is based on a representation of the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius\ngroups of unitary operators in a smooth orthonormal basis of the L2 space of\nthe dynamical system, acquired from time-ordered data through the diffusion\nmaps algorithm. Using this representation, we compute Koopman eigenfunctions\nthrough a regularized advection-diffusion operator, and employ these\neigenfunctions in dimension reduction maps with projectible dynamics and high\nsmoothness for the given observation modality. In systems with pure point\nspectra, we construct a decomposition of the generator of the Koopman group\ninto mutually commuting vector fields that transform naturally under changes of\nobservation modality, which we reconstruct in data space through a\nrepresentation of the pushforward map in the Koopman eigenfunction basis. We\nalso establish a correspondence between Koopman operators and Laplace-Beltrami\noperators constructed from data in Takens delay-coordinate space, and use this\ncorrespondence to provide an interpretation of diffusion-mapped delay\ncoordinates for this class of systems. Moreover, we take advantage of a special\nproperty of the Koopman eigenfunction basis, namely that the basis elements\nevolve as simple harmonic oscillators, to build nonparametric forecast models\nfor probability densities and observables.

More generally, adaptive seeding is a stochastic optimization\nframework where the choices in the first stage affect the realizations in the\nsecond stage, over which we aim to optimize.\n  Our main result is a $(1-1/e)^2$-approximation for the adaptive seeding\nproblem for any monotone submodular function. While adaptive policies are often\napproximated via non-adaptive policies, our algorithm is based on a novel\nmethod we call \\emph{locally-adaptive} policies.

This method\nenables the $(1-1/e)^2$-approximation for general monotone submodular functions\nand circumvents some of the impossibilities associated with non-adaptive\npolicies.\n  We also introduce a fundamental problem in submodular optimization that may\nbe of independent interest: given a ground set of elements where every element\nappears with some small probability, find a set of expected size at most $k$\nthat has the highest expected value over the realization of the elements.

For the\nprobability to detect the target before dissociating from DNA the TF-search\ntimes self-consistently depend heavily on whether or not an auxiliary operator\n(an accessible sequence similar to the main operator) is present in the genome\nsection. Importantly, within our model the extent to which the interconversion\nrates between search and recognition states depend on the underlying nucleotide\nsequence is varied. A moderate dependence maximises the capability to\ndistinguish between the main operator and similar sequences. Moreover, these\nauxiliary operators serve as starting points for DNA looping with the main\noperator, yielding a spectrum of target detection times spanning several orders\nof magnitude. Auxiliary operators are shown to act as funnels facilitating\ntarget detection by TFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 05:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

For iron-based superconductors (Fe-SC), the correct definition of\ntheir phase diagrams is crucial because of the close interplay between their\ncrystallo-chemical and magnetic properties, on one side, and the possible\ncoexistence of magnetism and superconductivity, on the other. The two most\ndifficult issues for understanding the Fe-SC phase diagrams are: 1) the origin\nof the structural transformation taking place during cooling and its\nrelationship with magnetism; 2) the correct description of the region where a\ncrossover between the magnetic and superconducting electronic ground states\ntakes place. Hence a proper and accurate definition of the structural, magnetic\nand electronic phase boundaries provides an extremely powerful tool for\nmaterial scientists. For this reason, an exact definition of the thermodynamic\nphase fields characterizing the different structural and physical properties\ninvolved is needed, although it is not easy to obtain in many cases.

In 2013 the\nXMM-Newton X-ray and UV data were complemented by optical photometric and\nspectroscopic observations.\n  Results: CSS081231 displays two-pole accretion in the high state. The\nmagnetic fields of the two poles are 36 and 69 MG, indicating a non-dipolar\nfield geometry. The X-ray spectrum of the main accreting pole with the lower\nfield comprises a hot thermal component from the cooling accretion plasma,\n$kT_{plas}$ of a few tens of keV, and a much less luminous blackbody-like\ncomponent from the accretion area with $kT_{\\rm bb} \\sim$ 50-100\\,eV. The\nhigh-field pole which was located opposite to the mass-donating star accretes\nat a low rate and has a plasma temperature of about 4\\,keV. At both occasions\nthe X-ray eclipse midpoint precedes the optical eclipse midpoint by 3.2\nseconds. The center of the X-ray bright phase shows accretion-rate dependent\nlongitudinal motion of ~20 degrees.\n  Conclusions: CSS081231 is a bright polar that escaped detection in the RASS\nsurvey because it was in a low accretion state. Even in the high state it lacks\nthe prominent soft component previously thought ubiquitous in polars. Such an\nexcess may still be present in the unobserved extreme ultraviolet. All polars\ndiscovered in the XMM-Newton era lack the prominent soft component.

In this setup, the lepton flavor violation originating from\n$k^{\\pm\\pm}$ exchanges is suppressed and the model is less constrained, where\nsome couplings can take sizable values. As reported in our previous work, the\nloop suppression factor at the three loop level would be too strong and\nrealized neutrino masses in a three loop scenario could be smaller than the\nobserved minuscule values. The sizable couplings can help us to enhance\nneutrino masses without drastically large scalar trilinear couplings appearing\nin a neutrino mass matrix, which tends to drive the vacuum stability to become\njeopardized at the one loop level. Now the doubly charged scalar $k^{\\pm\\pm}$\nhas less constraint via lepton flavor violation and the vacuum can be quite\nstable, and thus a few hundred GeV mass in $k^{\\pm\\pm}$ is possible, which is\nwithin the LHC reach and this model can be tested in the near future. Note that\nthe other $h_1^\\pm$ and $h_2^\\pm$ should be heavy at least around a few TeV. We\nsuitably arrange the charges of an additional global $U(1)$ symmetry, where the\ndecay constant of the associated Nambu-Goldstone boson can be around a TeV\nscale consistently. Also, this model is indirectly limited through a global\nanalysis on results of the LHC Higgs search and issues on a dark matter\ncandidate, the lightest Majorana neutrino. After $h_1^\\pm$ and $h_2^\\pm$ are\ndecoupled, this particle couples to the standard model particles only through\ntwo charge parity even scalars in theory and thus information on this scalar\nsector is important.

This definition allows us to derive interesting properties of power\nlaw networks. We observe that for exponents of the degree distribution in the\nrange $[1,2]$ such networks exhibit double power law phenomenon that was\nobserved for several real-world networks. Our observation indicates that this\nphenomenon could be explained by just pure graph theoretical properties.\n  The second aim of our work is to give a novel theoretical explanation why\nmany algorithms run faster on real-world data than what is predicted by\nalgorithmic worst-case analysis. We show how to exploit the power law degree\ndistribution to design faster algorithms for a number of classical P-time\nproblems including transitive closure, maximum matching, determinant, PageRank\nand matrix inverse. Moreover, we deal with the problems of counting triangles\nand finding maximum clique. Previously, it has been only shown that these\nproblems can be solved very efficiently on power law graphs when these graphs\nare random, e.g., drawn at random from some distribution. However, it is\nunclear how to relate such a theoretical analysis to real-world graphs, which\nare fixed. Instead of that, we show that the randomness assumption can be\nreplaced with a simple condition on the degrees of adjacent vertices, which can\nbe used to obtain similar results. As a result, in some range of power law\nexponents, we are able to solve the maximum clique problem in polynomial time,\nalthough in general power law networks the problem is NP-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 09:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

Unfortunately, many (often redundant) dynamic checks are implied\nin each property access and the semantic complexity of JS makes it difficult to\noptimize away these tests through program analysis. We introduce two techniques\nto effectively eliminate a large proportion of dynamic checks related to object\nproperty accesses.\n  Typed shapes enable code specialization based on object property types\nwithout potentially complex and expensive analyses. Shape propagation allows\nthe elimination of redundant shape checks in inline caches. These two\ntechniques combine particularly well with Basic Block Versioning (BBV), but\nshould be easily adaptable to tracing Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers and method\nJITs with type feedback.\n  To assess the effectiveness of the techniques presented, we have implemented\nthem in Higgs, a type-specializing JIT compiler for JS.

Empirical results show that across the 26\nbenchmarks tested, these techniques eliminate on average 48% of type tests,\nreduce code size by 17% and reduce execution time by 25%.

The objective of this study is\nto facilitate the analysis of the maritime accident investigation reports, by\nmeans of extracting contributory causes with more feasibility. A careful\ninvestigation of contributory causes from the reports provide opportunity to\nimprove safety in future.\n  Two methods have been employed in this study to extract the causal relations.\nThey are 1) Pattern classification method and 2) Connectives method. The\nearlier one uses naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) as classifiers.\nThe latter simply searches for the words connecting cause and effect in\nsentences.\n  The causal patterns extracted using these two methods are compared to the\nmanual (human expert) extraction.

We study a facilitated diffusion framework with switching between\nthree search modes: a bulk mode and two sliding modes triggered by\nconformational changes between two protein conformations. In one conformation\n(search mode) the TF interacts unspecifically with the DNA backbone resulting\nin fast sliding. In the other conformation (recognition mode) it interacts\nspecifically and strongly with DNA base pairs leading to slow displacement.\nFrom the bulk, a TF associates with the DNA at a random position that is\ncorrelated with the previous dissociation point, which implicitly is a function\nof the DNA structure.

A central line of research is concerned with the\nidentification of classes of instances for which CSP can be solved in\npolynomial time; such classes are often called \"islands of tractability.\" A\nprominent way of defining islands of tractability for CSP is to restrict the\nrelations that may occur in the constraints to a fixed set, called a constraint\nlanguage, whereas a constraint language is conservative if it contains all\nunary relations. This paper addresses the general limit of the mentioned\ntractability results for CSP and #CSP, that they only apply to instances where\nall constraints belong to a single tractable language (in general, the union of\ntwo tractable languages isn't tractable). We show that we can overcome this\nlimitation as long as we keep some control of how constraints over the various\nconsidered tractable languages interact with each other.

In this\npaper we study the magnitudes of compact sets in Euclidean spaces. We first\ndescribe the asymptotics of the magnitude of such sets in both the small and\nlarge-scale regimes. We then consider the magnitudes of compact convex sets\nwith nonempty interior in Euclidean spaces of odd dimension, and relate them to\nthe boundary behaviour of solutions to certain naturally associated higher\norder elliptic boundary value problems in exterior domains. We carry out\ncalculations leading to an algorithm for explicit evaluation of the magnitudes\nof balls, and this establishes the convex magnitude conjecture of Leinster and\nWillerton [9] in the special case of balls in dimension three. In general we\nshow that the magnitude of an odd-dimensional ball is a rational function of\nits radius. In addition to Fourier-analytic and PDE techniques, the arguments\nalso involve some combinatorial considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 13:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 15:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-14"}

It is based on the assumption that the energy\nof the ground state is a functional only of the density profile. The method is\nextremely successful within the effective force approach, noticeably the Skyrme\nor Gogny forces, in reproducing the nuclear binding energies and other bulk\nproperties along the whole mass table. Although the Density Functional is in\nthis case represented formally as the Hartree-Fock mean field of an effective\nforce, the corresponding single-particle states in general do not reproduce the\nphenomenology particularly well. To overcome this difficulty, a strategy has\nbeen developed where the effective force is adjusted to reproduce directly the\nsingle particle energies, trying to keep the ground state energy sufficiently\nwell reproduced. An alternative route, that has been developed along several\nyears, for solving this problem is to introduce the mean field fluctuations, as\nrepresented by the collective vibrations of the nuclear system, and their\ninfluence on the single particle dynamics and structure. This is the basis of\nthe particle-vibration coupling model. In this paper we present a formal theory\nof the particle-vibration coupling model based on the Green' s function method.\nThe theory extends to realistic effective forces the macroscopic\nparticle-vibration coupling models and the (microscopic) Nuclear Field Theory.\nIt is formalized within the functional derivative approach to many-body theory.\nAn expansion in diagrams is devised for the single particle self-energy and the\nphonon propagator.

Oftentimes, a system\ncan only satisfy its guarantees if certain environment assumptions hold, which\nmotivates their inclusion in the system specification. Experience with modern\nsynthesis approaches shows that synthesized systems tend to satisfy their\nspecifications by actively working towards the violation of the assumptions\nrather than satisfying assumptions and guarantees together. Such uncooperative\nbehavior is undesirable because it violates the aim of synthesis: the system\nshould try to satisfy its guarantees and use the assumptions only when needed.\nAlso, the assumptions often describe the valid behavior of other components in\na bigger system, which should not be obstructed unnecessarily.\n  In this paper, we present a hierarchy of cooperation levels between system\nand environment. Each level describes how well the system enforces both the\nassumptions and guarantees.

The synthesized systems can also exploit cooperative environment\nbehavior during operation to reach a higher cooperation level that is not\nenforceable by the system initially.

A CB rents resources from CSP\nand in turn provides service to users to generate profit. Contract between CB\nand user is that of pay-what-you-use/pay-per-use. However CB faces the\nchallenge of Quantized Billing Cycles as it negotiates with CSP. We design two\nalgorithms, one fully online and the other partially online, which maximizes\nthe profit of the CB. The key idea is to regulate users demand using dynamic\npricing. Our algorithm is inspired by the Ski-Rental problem. We derive\ncompetitive ratio of these algorithms and also conduct simulations using real\nworld traces to prove the efficiency of our algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 15:09:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 12:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

(2014) demonstrated that an atmosphere with\n1.3-4 bar of CO2 and H2O, in addition to 5-20% H2, could have raised the mean\nannual and global surface temperature of early Mars above the freezing point of\nwater. Such warm temperatures appear necessary to generate the rainfall (or\nsnowfall) amounts required to carve the ancient martian valleys. Here, we use\nour best estimates for early martian outgassing rates, along with a 1-D\nphotochemical model, to assess the conversion efficiency of CO, CH4, and H2S to\nCO2, SO2, and H2. Our outgassing estimates assume that Mars was actively\nrecycling volatiles between its crust and interior, as Earth does today. H2\nproduction from serpentinization and deposition of banded iron-formations is\nalso considered. Under these assumptions, maintaining an H2 concentration of\n~1-2% by volume is achievable, but reaching 5% H2 requires additional H2\nsources or a slowing of the hydrogen escape rate below the diffusion limit. If\nthe early martian atmosphere was indeed H2-rich, we might be able to see\nevidence of this in the rock record. The hypothesis proposed here is consistent\nwith new data from the Curiosity Rover, which show evidence for a long-lived\nlake in Gale Crater near Mt. Sharp. It is also consistent with measured oxygen\nfugacities of martian meteorites, which show evidence for progressive mantle\noxidation over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 15:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

We\ndescribe the simplest solutions of these systems in spherical symmetry, the\nspherically symmetric static states, and some scaling properties they obey. We\nalso describe some approximate analytic solutions for these states.\n  The EKG system underlies a theory of wave dark matter, also known as scalar\nfield dark matter (SFDM), boson star dark matter, and Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) dark matter. We discuss a possible connection between the theory of wave\ndark matter and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, which is a scaling relation\nobserved to hold for disk galaxies in the universe across many decades in mass.\nWe show how fixing boundary conditions at the edge of the spherically symmetric\nstatic states implies Tully-Fisher-like relations for the states.
