Using the FLASH code, we solved the 3D ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. Our model consists of a straight, density\nenhanced and gravitationally stratified magnetic flux tube. We perturbed the\nsystem initially, leading to a transverse oscillation of the structure, and\nfollowed its evolution for a number of periods. A realistic radiative cooling\nis implemented. Results are compared to available analytical theory. We find\nthat in the linear regime (i.e. low amplitude perturbation and slow cooling)\nthe obtained period and damping time are in good agreement with theory. The\ncooling leads to an amplification of the oscillation amplitude. However, the\ndifference between the cooling and non-cooling cases is small (around 6% after\n6 oscillations). In high amplitude runs with realistic cooling, instabilities\ndeform the loop, leading to increased damping. In this case, the difference\nbetween cooling and non-cooling is still negligible at around 12%. A set of\nsimulations with higher density loops are also performed, to explore what\nhappens when the cooling takes place in a very short time (tcool = 100 s). We\nstrengthen the results of previous analytical studies that state that the\namplification due to cooling is ineffective, and its influence on the\noscillation characteristics is small, at least for the cases shown here.\nFurthermore, the presence of a relatively strong damping in the high amplitude\nruns even in the fast cooling case indicates that it is unlikely that cooling\ncould alone account for the observed, flare-related undamped oscillations of\ncoronal loops. These results may be significant in the field of coronal\nseismology, allowing its application to coronal loop oscillations with observed\nfading-out or cooling behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 16:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-30"}

We show that the distortions arise from a leakage of the CMB\ndipole into the y-channel which couples to all multipoles, mostly affecting the\nrange $\\ell$ < ~400. This should be visible in Planck's y-maps with an\nestimated signal-to-noise ratio of about 12. We note however that such\nfrequency-dependent terms carry no new information on the nature of the CMB\ndipole. This implies that the real significance of Planck's Doppler coupling\nmeasurements is actually lower than reported by the collaboration. Finally, we\nquantify the level of contamination in tSZ and primordial y-type distortions\nand show that it is above the sensitivity of proposed next generation CMB\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 17:41:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 17:08:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 15:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The proposed techniques are termed as\n{\\em quad-LED complex modulation (QCM)} and {\\em dual-LED complex modulation\n(DCM)}. The proposed QCM scheme uses four LEDs (hence the name `quad-LED');\nwhile the magnitudes of the real and imaginary parts are conveyed through\nintensity modulation of LEDs, the sign information is conveyed through spatial\nindexing of LEDs. The proposed DCM scheme, on the other hand, exploits the\npolar representation of a complex symbol; it uses only two LEDs (hence the name\n`dual-LED'), one LED to map the magnitude and another LED to map the phase of a\ncomplex modulation symbol. These techniques do not need Hermitian symmetry\noperation to generate LED compatible positive real transmit signals.

Each spine contains a synaptic contact site that may connect\nits parent dendrite to the axons of neighboring neurons. Dendritic spines are\nmarkedly distinct in shape and size, and certain types of stimulation prompt\nspines to evolve, in fairly predictable fashion, from thin nascent morphologies\nto the mushroom-like shapes associated with mature spines. This striking\nprogression is coincident with the (re)configuration of the neuronal network\nduring early development, learning and memory formation, and has been\nconjectured to be part of the machinery that encodes these processes at the\nscale of individual neuronal connections. It is well established that the\nstructural plasticity of spines is strongly dependent upon the actin\ncytoskeleton inside the spine.

However, unlike their crystalline\ncounterparts, disordered solids are not well understood. One of the primary\nobstacles is the lack of a theoretical framework for thinking about disorder\nand its relation to mechanical properties. To this end, we study an idealized\nsystem of frictionless athermal soft spheres that, when compressed, undergoes a\njamming phase transition with diverging length scales and clean power-law\nsignatures. This critical point is the cornerstone of a much larger \"jamming\nscenario\" that has the potential to provide the essential theoretical\nfoundation necessary for a unified understanding of the mechanics of disordered\nsolids. We begin by showing that jammed sphere packings have a valid linear\nregime despite the presence of \"contact nonlinearities.\" We then investigate\nthe critical nature of the transition, focusing on diverging length scales and\nfinite-size effects. Next, we argue that jamming plays the same role for\ndisordered solids as the perfect crystal plays for crystalline solids. Not only\ncan it be considered an idealized starting point for understanding disordered\nmaterials, but it can even influence systems that have a relatively high amount\nof crystalline order. The behavior of solids can thus be thought of as existing\non a spectrum, with the perfect crystal and the jamming transition at opposing\nends. Finally, we introduce a new principle wherein the contribution of an\nindividual bond to one global property is independent of its contribution to\nanother. This principle allows the different global responses of a disordered\nsystem to be manipulated independently and provides a great deal of flexibility\nin designing materials with unique, textured and tunable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 18:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-30"}

On the other\nhand, we apply the results of both methods to three widely used approaches for\nthe resummation of logarithmically enhanced contributions at small transverse\nmomenta: the MC@NLO and POWHEG Monte Carlo approaches, and analytic\nresummation. While the three sets of results are largely compatible in the\nlow-pT region, they exhibit sizable differences at large pT. We show that these\ndifferences can be significantly reduced by suitable modifications of formally\nsubleading terms in the Monte Carlo implementations. We apply our study to the\nStandard Model Higgs boson and to the neutral Higgs bosons of the\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Model for representative scenarios of the parameter space,\nwhere the top- and bottom-quark diagrams enter the cross section at different\nstrength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

This is in contrast to the\naverage case, where most of the algorithms are scalable. In the present paper,\nwe bridge this gap, by proposing several new algorithms (including those based\non greedy, majorization-minimization, minorization-maximization, and relaxation\nalgorithms) that not only scale to large sizes but that also achieve\ntheoretical approximation guarantees close to the state-of-the-art, and in some\ncases achieve new tight bounds.

The strain grading process necessarily introduces misfit\ndislocations into a heterostructure, and these defects introduce lateral strain\ninhomogeneities, mosaic tilt, and threading dislocations. The use of a SiGe\nnanomembrane as the virtual substrate enables the strain relaxation to be\nentirely elastic, eliminating the need for misfit dislocations.

We present a multi-wavelength analysis of the evolved supernova\nremnants MCSNR J0506-7025 and MCSNR J0527-7104 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nMethods. We used data from XMM-Newton, the Australian Telescope Compact Array,\nand the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey to study their broadband emission\nand used Spitzer and HI data to gain a picture of their environments. We\nperformed a multi-wavelength morphological study and detailed radio and X-ray\nspectral analyses to determine their physical characteristics. Results. Both\nremnants were found to have bright X-ray cores, dominated by Fe L-shell\nemission, consistent with reverse shock heated ejecta with determined Fe masses\nin agreement with Type Ia explosion yields. A soft X-ray shell, consistent with\nswept-up interstellar medium, was observed in MCSNR J0506-7025, suggestive of a\nremnant in the Sedov phase. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedov\nself-similar solution, we estimated the age of MCSNR J0506-7025 to be ~16-28\nkyr, with an initial explosion energy of (0.07-0.84)x10^51 erg. A soft shell\nwas absent in MCSNR J0527-7104, with only ejecta emission visible in an\nextremely elongated morphology extending beyond the optical shell. We suggest\nthat the blast wave has broken out into a low density cavity, allowing the\nshock heated ejecta to escape. We found that the radio spectral index of MCSNR\nJ0506-7025 is consistent with the standard ~0.5 for SNRs. Radio polarisation at\n6 cm indicates a higher degree of polarisation along the western front and at\nthe eastern knot, with a mean fractional polarisation across the remnant of\nP~(20 \\pm 6)%. Conclusions. The detection of Fe-rich ejecta in the remnants\nsuggests that both resulted from Type Ia explosions. The newly identified\nFe-rich cores in MCSNR J0506-7025 and MCSNR J0527-7104 makes them members of\nthe expanding class of evolved Fe-rich remnants in the Magellanic Clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 21:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

To\naccommodate the tremendous wireless data demands, efficient spectrum-sharing\napproaches are highly desired. To this end, this paper introduces a new\nspectrum sharing solution for indoor environments based on the usage of a\nreconfigurable reflect-array in the middle of the wireless channel. By\noptimally controlling the phase shift of each element on the reflect-array, the\nuseful signals for each transmission pair can be enhanced while the\ninterferences can be canceled. As a result, multiple wireless users in the same\nroom can access the same spectrum band at the same time without interfering\neach other. Hence, the network capacity can be dramatically increased. To prove\nthe feasibility of the proposed solution, an experimental testbed is first\ndeveloped and evaluated. Then, the effects of the reflect-array on transport\ncapacity of the indoor wireless networks are investigated. Through experiments,\ntheoretical deduction, and simulations, this paper demonstrates that\nsignificantly higher spectrum-spatial efficiency can be achieved by using the\nsmart reflect-array without any modification of the hardware and software in\nthe users' devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 22:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

In a recently published paper\nChatterjee & Ford (2015; henceforth CF15) has proposed that gas-disk migration\ntraps planets in a MMR. After gas dispersal, orbits of these trapped planets\nare altered through interaction with a residual planetesimal disk. They found\nthat for massive enough disks planet-planetesimal disk interactions can break\nresonances and naturally create moderate to large positive offsets from the\ninitial period ratio for large ranges of planetesimal disk and planet\nproperties. Divergence from resonance only happens if the mass of planetesimals\nthat interact with the planets is at least a few percent of the total planet\nmass. This threshold, above which resonances are broken and the offset from\nresonances can grow, naturally explains why the asymmetric large offsets were\nnot seen in more massive planet pairs found via past radial velocity surveys.\nIn this article we will highlight some of the key findings of CF15. In\naddition, we report preliminary results from an extension of this study, that\ninvestigates the effects of planet-planetesimal disk interactions on initially\nnon-resonant planet pairs. We find that planetesimal scattering typically\nincreases period ratios of non-resonant planets. If the initial period ratios\nare below and in proximity of a resonance, under certain conditions, this\nincrement in period ratios can create a deficit of systems with period ratios\njust below the exact integer corresponding to the MMR and an excess just above.\nFrom an initially uniform distribution of period ratios just below a 2:1 MMR,\nplanetesimal interactions can create an asymmetric distribution across this MMR\nsimilar to what is observed for the Kepler planet pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 22:40:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2015 17:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

Due to the vast number of environmental degrees of freedom, it is\nchallenging to accurately calculate decoherence times $T_2$, especially when\nthe qubit and environment are highly correlated.\n  Hybrid or mixed electron-nuclear spin qubits, such as donors in silicon,\npossess 'optimal working points' (OWPs) which are sweet-spots for reduced\ndecoherence in magnetic fields. Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs\nwas previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid\nqubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the\nnuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding\nof the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$.\n  I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which\n(i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in\nmultiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath\nand (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and\nclassical-field decoherence. To achieve these, the cluster correlation\nexpansion was adapted to include electron-nuclear state mixing. In addition, an\nanalysis supported by experiment was carried out to characterise the nuclear\nspin bath for a bismuth donor as the hybrid qubit, a simple analytical formula\nfor $T_2$ was derived with predictions in agreement with experiment, and the\nestablished method of dynamical decoupling was combined with operating near\nOWPs in order to maximise $T_2$. Finally, the decoherence of a $^{29}$Si spin\nin proximity to the hybrid qubit was studied, in order to establish the\nfeasibility for its use as a quantum register.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 00:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

We compute this decomposition and related quantities explicitly for\nthe nearest-neighbor Ising model on the 1D chain, the Bethe lattice with\ncoordination number k=3, and the 2D square lattice, illustrating its generality\nand the functional insights it gives near and away from phase transitions.

As the Chern-Simons theory for the 2+1-dimensional quantum Hall\neffect, such a hydrodynamic effective field theory provides a universal\ndescription of topological band insulators, even in the presence of\ninteractions, and that of putative fractional topological insulators. In this\npaper, we undertake this task by using the functional bosonization. The\neffective field theory in the functional bosonization is written in terms of a\ntwo-form gauge field, which couples to a $U(1)$ gauge field that arises by\ngauging the continuous symmetry of the target system (the $U(1)$ particle\nnumber conservation). Integrating over the $U(1)$ gauge field by using the\nelectromagnetic duality, the resulting theory describes topological band\ninsulators as a condensation phase of the $U(1)$ gauge theory (or as a monopole\ncondensation phase of the dual gauge field). The hydrodynamic description, and\nthe implication of its duality, of the surface of topological insulators are\nalso discussed. We also touch upon the hydrodynamic theory of fractional\ntopological insulators by using the parton construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 05:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

For\ncool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar\nages from measured rotation pe- riods and HR Diagram positions.

There\nis a significant sample of old Kepler objects of inter- est, or KOIs, which\nhave both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic\nmeasurements from which ages can be accurately derived. In this work we\ndetermine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs to both\ncompare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets and\nenlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars.

This\nmulti-way network is a suitable model for 3-user device-to-device\ncommunications. The main goal of this paper is to characterize the capacity\nregion of the underlying Gaussian 3-way channel (3WC) within a constant gap. To\nthis end, a capacity outer bound is derived using cut-set bounds and\ngenie-aided bounds. For achievability, the 3WC is first transformed into an\nequivalent star-channel. This latter is then decomposed into a set of\n`successive' sub-channels, leading to a sub-channel allocation problem. Using\nbackward decoding, interference neutralization, and known results on the\ncapacity of the star-channel relying of physical-layer network coding, an\nachievable rate region for the 3WC is obtained. It is then shown that the\nachievable rate region is within a constant gap of the developed outer bound,\nleading to the desired capacity approximation. Interestingly, in contrast to\nthe Gaussian two-way channel (TWC), adaptation is necessary in the 3WC.\nFurthermore, message splitting is another ingredient of the developed scheme\nfor the 3WC which is not required in the TWC.

Here we report the quantum capacitance measurements together\nwith conductance measurements on a hBN protected few layer BP ($\\sim$ 6 layer)\nin a dual gated field effect transistor (FET) geometry. The measured DOS from\nour quantum capacitance is compared with the density functional theory (DFT).\nOur results reveal that the transport gap for quantum capacitance is smaller\nthan that in conductance measurements due to the presence of localized states\nnear the band edge. The presence of localized states is confirmed by the\nvariable range hopping seen in our temperature-dependence conductivity. A large\nasymmetry is observed between the electron and hole side. The asymmetric nature\nis attributed to the anisotropic band dispersion of BP. Our measurements\nestablish the uniqueness of quantum capacitance in probing the localized states\nnear the band edge, hitherto not seen in the conductance measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 12:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

Usually, a trade-off between precision and coverage is hard to find, and\nit depends on the methodology used to build the lexicon. Manually annotated\nlexica provide a high precision but lack in coverage, whereas automatic\nderivation from pre-existing knowledge guarantees high coverage at the cost of\na lower precision. Since the automatic derivation of prior polarities is less\ntime consuming than manual annotation, there has been a great bloom of these\napproaches, in particular based on the SentiWordNet resource. In this paper, we\ncompare the most frequently used techniques based on SentiWordNet with newer\nones and blend them in a learning framework (a so called 'ensemble method'). By\ntaking advantage of manually built prior polarity lexica, our ensemble method\nis better able to predict the prior value of unseen words and to outperform all\nthe other SentiWordNet approaches. Using this technique we have built\nSentiWords, a prior polarity lexicon of approximately 155,000 words, that has\nboth a high precision and a high coverage.

Given current\nsensitivity, projected improvements in PTAs and the predicted strength of the\nGW signals, the detection of GWs with PTAs could occur within the next decade.\nOne way we can improve a PTA is to reduce the measurement noise present in the\npulsar timing residuals. If the pulsars included in the array display\nuncorrelated noise, the root mean square (RMS) of the timing residuals is\npredicted to scale as $\\mathrm{T}^{-1/2}$, where T is the dwell time per\nobservation. In this case, the sensitivity of the array can be increased by\nincreasing T. We studied the 17 pulsars in the five year North American\nNanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) data set to determine\nif the noise in the timing residuals of the pulsars observed was consistent\nwith this property.

The main\ncontribution of this paper is a framework to compute the FT that employs\nadaptive approximations of univariate fibers, and that is not tied to any\ntensorized discretization. The algorithm can be coupled with any univariate\nlinear or nonlinear approximation procedure. We demonstrate that this approach\ncan generate multivariate function approximations that are several orders of\nmagnitude more accurate, for the same cost, than those based on the\nconventional approach of compressing the coefficient tensor of a tensor-product\nbasis.

This effect occurs passively by just presence of the\nantiresonant terms and is explained in terms of the time-energy uncertainty\nprinciple for the simple reason that at a very short interaction time, the\nuncertainty in the energy is of order of the energy of a single excitation,\nthereby leading to a distribution of the population among the zero, singly and\ndoubly excited states. The population distribution, correlations and\nentanglement are shown to be substantially depend on whether the modes decay\nindependently or collectively to an exterior reservoir. In particular, when the\nmodes decay independently with equal rates, entanglement with the complete\ndistinguishability of the modes is observed. The modes can be made mutually\ncoherent if they decay with unequal rates. However, the visibility in the\nsingle-photon interference cannot exceed $50\\%$. When the modes experience\ncollective damping, they are indistinguishable even if decay with equal rates\nand the visibility can, in principle, be as large as unity.

Indeed, strong gravitational lensing images display several\nlensed components, both point-like and diffuse, around the lensing galaxy.\nThose objects limit the study of the galaxy luminosity to its inner parts.\nTherefore, the usual fitting methods perform rather badly on such images.\nPrevious studies of strong lenses luminosity profiles using software such as\nGALFIT or IMFITFITS and various PSF-determining methods have resulted in\ndiscrepant results. The present work aims at investigating the causes of those\ndiscrepancies, as well as at designing more robust techniques for studying the\nmorphology of early-type lensing galaxies with the ability to subtract a lensed\nsignal from their luminosity profiles. We design a new method to independently\nmeasure each shape parameter, namely, the position angle, ellipticity, and\nhalf-light radius of the galaxy. Our half-light radius measurement method is\nbased on an innovative scheme for computing isophotes that is well suited to\nmeasuring the morphological properties of gravitational lensing galaxies. Its\nrobustness regarding various specific aspects of gravitational lensing image\nprocessing is analysed and tested against GALFIT. It is applied to a sample of\nsystems from the CASTLES database. Simulations show that when restricted to\nsmall, inner parts of the lensing galaxy, the technique presented here is more\ntrustworthy than GALFIT. It gives more robust results than GALFIT, which shows\ninstabilities regarding the fitting region, the value of the Sersic index, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. It is therefore better suited than GALFIT for\ngravitational lensing galaxies. It is also able to study lensing galaxies that\nare not much larger than the PSF.

Byzantine failures are the\nmost general type of failure: a faulty process can exhibit any arbitrary\nbehavior. Because of this, they are also the most difficult to analyze and to\nhandle algorithmically. The main contribution of the paper is a signature-free\nreduction of Byzantine failures to crash failures. Assuming $t<\\min(n',n/3)$,\nthe paper presents an algorithm that simulates a system of $n'$ processes where\nup to $t$ may crash, on top of a basic system of $n$ processes where up to $t$\nmay be Byzantine. While topological techniques have been used to relate the\ncomputability of Byzantine failure-prone systems to that of crash failure-prone\nones, this simulation is the first, to our knowledge, that establishes this\nrelation directly, in an algorithmic way.\n  In addition to extending the basic BG simulation to message-passing systems\nand failures more severe than process crashes, being modular and direct, this\nsimulation provides us with a deeper insight in the nature and understanding of\ncrash and Byzantine failures in the context of asynchronous message-passing\nsystems. Moreover, it also allows crash-tolerant algorithms, designed for\nasynchronous read/write systems, to be executed on top of asynchronous\nmessage-passing systems prone to Byzantine failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 11:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

The\norigin of LFQPOs is still debated. To understand the cause of the peak\nbroadening, we utilized a recently developed time-frequency analysis, HHT, for\ntracking the evolution of the 4-Hz LFQPO from XTE J1550 564. By adaptively\ndecomposing the ~4-Hz oscillatory component from the light curve and acquiring\nits instantaneous frequency, the Hilbert spectrum illustrates that the LFQPO is\ncomposed of a series of intermittent oscillations appearing occasionally\nbetween 3 Hz and 5 Hz. We further characterized this intermittency by computing\nthe confidence limits of the instantaneous amplitudes of the intermittent\noscillations, and constructed both the distributions of the QPO's high and low\namplitude durations, which are the time intervals with and without significant\n~4-Hz oscillations, respectively. The mean high amplitude duration is 1.45 s\nand 90% of the oscillation segments have lifetimes below 3.1 s. The mean low\namplitude duration is 0.42 s and 90% of these segments are shorter than 0.73 s.\nIn addition, these intermittent oscillations exhibit a correlation between the\noscillation's rms amplitude and mean count rate. This correlation could be\nanalogous to the linear rms-flux relation found in the 4-Hz LFQPO through\nFourier analysis. We conclude that the LFQPO peak in the power spectrum is\nbroadened owing to intermittent oscillations with varying frequencies, which\ncould be explained by using the Lense-Thirring precession model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-16"}

In next-generation heterogeneous networks where\nultra-dense small-cell base stations are deployed,\nsimultaneous-wireless-information-and-power-transfer (SWIPT) is feasible over\nshort ranges. One challenge for designing a WPC system is the severe near-far\nproblem where a user attempts to decode an information-transfer (IT) signal in\nthe presence of extremely strong SWIPT signals. Jointly quantizing the mixed\nsignals causes the IT signal to be completely corrupted by quantization noise\nand thus the SWIPT signals have to be suppressed in the analog domain. This\nmotivates the design of a framework in this paper for analog spatial\ncancellation in a multi-antenna WPC system. In the framework, an analog circuit\nconsisting of simple phase shifters and adders, is adapted to cancel the SWIPT\nsignals by multiplying it with a cancellation matrix having unit-modulus\nelements and full rank, where the full rank retains the spatial-multiplexing\ngain of the IT channel. The unit-modulus constraints render the conventional\nzero-forcing method unsuitable. Therefore, the paper presents a novel\nsystematic approach for constructing cancellation matrices. For the\nsingle-SWIPT-interferer case, the matrices are obtained as truncated\nFourier/Hadamard matrices after compensating for propagation phase shifts over\nthe SWIPT channel. For the more challenging multiple-SWIPT-interferer case, it\nis proposed that each row of the cancellation matrix is constructed as a\nKronecker-product of component vectors, with each component vectors designed to\nnull the signal from a corresponding SWIPT interferer similarly as in the\npreceding case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:28:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 06:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 18:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity.

Initially random-like and sparse PS patterns became robust\nafter three weeks in vitro (WIVs). They were characterized by a high number of\noccurrences and short inter-paired spike intervals (IPSIs). Spatially, the\ndegree of complexity increased by recruiting new neighboring sites in PS as a\nculture matured. Moreover, PS activity participated in establishing functional\nconnectivity between different sites within the developing network. Employing\ntransfer entropy (TE) as an information transfer measure, we show that PS\nactivity is robustly involved in establishing effective connectivities. Spiking\nactivity at both individual sites and network level robustly followed each PS\nwithin a short time interval. PS may thus be considered a spiking predictor.\nThese findings suggest that PS activity is preserved in spontaneously active in\nvitro networks as part of a robust coding mechanism as encountered in vivo. We\nsuggest that, presumably in lack of any external sensory stimuli, PS may act as\nan internal surrogate stimulus to drive neural activity at different\ndevelopmental stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-02"}

In particular, cosmic-ray muons are detected as long, straight\ntracks passing through multiple pixels. The distribution of track lengths can\nbe related to the thickness of the active (depleted) region of the camera image\nsensor through the known angular distribution of muons at sea level. We use a\nsample of cosmic-ray muon tracks recorded by the Distributed Electronic\nCosmic-ray Observatory to measure the thickness of the depletion region of the\ncamera image sensor in a commercial smart phone, the HTC Wildfire S. The track\nlength distribution prefers a cosmic-ray muon angular distribution over an\nisotropic distribution. Allowing either distribution, we measure the depletion\nthickness to be between 13.9~$\\mu$m and 27.7~$\\mu$m. The same method can be\napplied to additional models of image sensor. Once measured, the thickness can\nbe used to convert track length to incident polar angle on a per-event basis.\nCombined with a determination of the incident azimuthal angle directly from the\ntrack orientation in the sensor plane, this enables direction reconstruction of\nindividual cosmic-ray events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2015 05:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}
