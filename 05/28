The algorithm exhibits this\nflexibility, both with respect to loss and anisotropy in the formation layers\nas well as junction tilting, via employing special planar slabs that coat each\n\"flattened\" (i.e., originally tilted) planar interface, locally redirecting the\nincident wave within the coating slabs to cause wave fronts to interact with\nthe flattened interfaces as if they were still tilted with a specific,\nuser-defined orientation. Moreover, since the coating layers are homogeneous\nrather than exhibiting continuous material variation, a minimal number of these\nlayers must be inserted and hence reduces added simulation time and\ncomputational expense. As said coating layers are not reflectionless however,\nthey do induce artificial field scattering that corrupts legitimate field\nsignatures due to the (effective) interface tilting. Numerical results, for two\nhalf-spaces separated by a tilted interface, quantify error trends versus\nmaterial and sensor characteristics.

The projected principal component analysis\nwill be employed to enhance the accuracy of inferred factors when a\nsemi-parametric (approximate) factor model is assumed.

The assumptions on F are\nthat it does not depend on the front itself, but can depend on space and time.\nMoreover, it can vanish and change sign. To solve this problem the Level-Set\nMethod [Osher, Sethian; 1988] is widely used, and the Generalized Fast Marching\nMethod [Carlini et al.; 2008] has recently been introduced. The novelty of our\nmethod is that its overall computational complexity is predicted to be\ncomparable to that of the Fast Marching Method [Sethian; 1996], [Vladimirsky;\n2006] in most instances. This latter algorithm is O(N^n log N^n) if the\ncomputational domain comprises N^n points. Our strategy is to use it in regions\nwhere the speed is bounded away from zero -- and switch to a different\nformalism when F is approximately 0. To this end, a collection of so-called\nsideways partial differential equations is introduced. Their solutions locally\ndescribe the evolving front and depend on both space and time. The\nwell-posedness of those equations, as well as their geometric properties are\naddressed. We then propose a convergent and stable discretization of those\nPDEs. Those alternative representations are used to augment the standard Fast\nMarching Method. The resulting algorithm is presented together with a thorough\ndiscussion of its features. The accuracy of the scheme is tested when F depends\non both space and time. Each example yields an O(1/N) global truncation error.\nWe conclude with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 19:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Its mass and\ninteractions are suppressed by a heavy symmetry breaking scale, $f_a$, whose\nvalue is roughly greater than $10^{9}$ GeV (or, conversely, the axion mass,\n$m_a$, is roughly less than $10^4\\ \\mu \\text{eV}$). The density of axions in\nthe universe, which cannot exceed the relic dark matter density and is a\nquantity of great interest in axion experiments like ADMX, is a result of the\nearly-universe interplay between cosmological evolution and the axion mass as a\nfunction of temperature.

Dark matter\nproduction at the LHC in this model is typically accompanied by collinear\nradiation of dark photons whose decay products can form lepton jets. We analyze\nthe dynamics of collinear dark photon emission both analytically and\nnumerically.

Moreover as a UV resonance line, Lya\npossesses several unique characteristics that make it useful to study the ISM\nand ionizing stellar population at all cosmic epochs. In this review I present\na summary of Lya observations of galaxies in the nearby universe. At UV\nmagnitudes reachable with current facilities, only ~5% of the local galaxy\npopulation shows a Lya equivalent width (EW_Lya) that exceeds 20\\AA. This\nfraction increases dramatically at higher z, but only in the local universe can\nwe study galaxies in detail and assemble unprecedented multi-wavelength\ndatasets. I discuss many local Lya observations, showing that when galaxies\nshow net Lya emission, they ubiquitously produce large halos of scattered Lya,\nthat dominate the integrated luminosity. We discuss how global EW_Lya and the\nLya escape fraction (fescLya) are higher (EW_Lya >~ 20\\AA\\ and fescLya> 10%) in\ngalaxies that represent the less massive and younger end of the distributions\nfor local objects. This is connected with various properties, such that\nLya-emitters have lower metallicities (median value of 12+log(O/H) ~ 8.1) and\ndust reddening. However, the presence of galactic outflows is also vital to\nDoppler shift the Lya line out of resonance with the HI, as high EW_Lya is\nfound only among galaxies with winds faster than ~50km/s. The evidence is then\nassembled into a coherent picture, and the requirement for star formation\ndriven feedback is discussed in the context of an evolutionary sequence where\nthe ISM is accelerated and/or subject to fluid instabilities, which reduce the\nscattering of Lya. Concluding remarks take the form of perspectives upon the\nmost pressing questions that can be answered by observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 20:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

The expicit restricted isometry property\n(RIP) measurement matrices are needed in practice. Since 2007 R. DeVore, J.\nBourgain et al and R. Calderbank et al have given several deterministic\ncosntrcutions of RIP matrices from various mathematical objects. On the other\nhand the strong coherence property of a measurement matrix was introduced by\nBajwa and Calderbank et al for the recovery of signals under the noisy\nmeasuremnt. In this paper we propose new explicit construction of real valued\nRIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing from algebraic geometry. Our\nconstruction indicates that using more general algebraic-geometric objects\nrather than curves (AG codes), RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing\ncan be constructed with much smaller coherence and much bigger sparsity orders.\nThe RIP matrices from algebraic geometry also have a nice asymptotic bound\nmatching the bound from the previous constructions of Bourgain et al and the\nsmall-bias sets. On the negative side, we prove that the RIP matrices from\nDeVore's construction, its direct algebraic geometric generalization and one of\nour new construction do not satisfy the strong coherence property. However we\ngive a modified version of AG-RIP matrices which satisfies the strong coherence\nproperty. Therefore the new RIP matrices in compressed sensing from our\nmodified algebraic geometric construction can be used for the recovery of\nsignals from the noisy measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 20:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

One canonical cell-fate decision that\ncancer cells undergo is Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its\nreverse Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET). While transitioning between\nthese two phenotypes - epithelial and mesenchymal - cells can also attain a\nhybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (i.e. partial or intermediate EMT) phenotype.\nCells in this phenotype have mixed epithelial (e.g. adhesion) and mesenchymal\n(e.g. migration) properties, thereby allowing them to move collectively as\nclusters of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). If these clusters enter the\ncirculation, they can be more apoptosis-resistant and more capable of\ninitiating metastatic lesions than cancer cells moving individually with wholly\nmesenchymal phenotypes, having undergo a complete EMT. Here, we review the\noperating principles of the core regulatory network for EMT/MET that acts as a\nthree-way switch giving rise to three distinct phenotypes - epithelial,\nmesenchymal and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal. We further characterize this\nhybrid E/M phenotype in terms of its capabilities in terms of collective cell\nmigration, tumor-initiation, cell-cell communication, and drug resistance.

In this paper, we focus on a very\nsensitive and increasingly exposed type of data: location data. There are two\nmain scenarios in which fake traces are of extreme value to preserve location\nprivacy: publishing datasets of location trajectories, and using location-based\nservices. Despite advances in protecting (location) data privacy, there is no\nquantitative method to evaluate how realistic a synthetic trace is, and how\nmuch utility and privacy it provides in each scenario. Also, the lack of a\nmethodology to generate privacy-preserving fake traces is evident. In this\npaper, we fill this gap and propose the first statistical metric and model to\ngenerate fake location traces such that both the utility of data and the\nprivacy of users are preserved. We build upon the fact that, although\ngeographically they visit distinct locations, people have strongly semantically\nsimilar mobility patterns, for example, their transition pattern across\nactivities (e.g., working, driving, staying at home) is similar. We define a\nstatistical metric and propose an algorithm that automatically discovers the\nhidden semantic similarities between locations from a bag of real location\ntraces as seeds, without requiring any initial semantic annotations. We\nguarantee that fake traces are geographically dissimilar to their seeds, so\nthey do not leak sensitive location information. We also protect contributors\nto seed traces against membership attacks. Interleaving fake traces with mobile\nusers' traces is a prominent location privacy defense mechanism. We\nquantitatively show the effectiveness of our methodology in protecting against\nlocalization inference attacks while preserving utility of sharing/publishing\ntraces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 21:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

However, self-assembly in the presence of strong\ninteractions results in general in kinetic trapping, so suggesting a limit to\nthe size of an (equilibrium) structure that can be self-assembled from\ndistinguishable components. Here we study numerically a two-dimensional\nhierarchical assembly scheme already considered in experiment. We show that\nthis scheme is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong `native'\ninteractions (interactions designed to stabilize the intended structure), and\nso, in principle, offers a way to make large information-rich structures. In\nthis scheme the size of an assembled structure scales exponentially with the\nstage of assembly, and assembly can continue as long as random motion is able\nto bring structures into contact. The resulting superstructure could provide a\ntemplate for building in the third dimension. The chief drawback of this scheme\nis that it is particularly susceptible to kinetic traps that result from\n`non-native' interactions (interactions not required to stabilize the intended\nstructure); the scale on which such a scheme can be realized therefore depends\nupon how effectively this latter kind of interaction can be suppressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 21:53:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2015 22:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

Second, such an approach\ndoes not consider the diverse memory access characteristics of different\napplications running on CPUs and HWAs, leading to low performance for\nlatency-sensitive CPU applications and deadline misses for some HWAs, including\nGPUs.\n  In this paper, we propose a Simple Quality of service Aware memory Scheduler\nfor Heterogeneous systems (SQUASH), that overcomes these problems using three\nkey ideas, with the goal of meeting deadlines of HWAs while providing high CPU\nperformance. First, SQUASH prioritizes a HWA when it is not on track to meet\nits deadline any time during a deadline period. Second, SQUASH prioritizes HWAs\nover memory-intensive CPU applications based on the observation that the\nperformance of memory-intensive applications is not sensitive to memory\nlatency.

Here we analyze the\nradial velocities measured for 152 out of 380 observed stars in the 2-6 Myr old\nstar cluster IC 348 as part of the SDSS-III APOGEE. The radial velocity\ndistribution of these stars is fitted with one or two Gaussians, convolved with\nthe measurement uncertainties including binary orbital motions. Including a\nsecond Gaussian improves the fit; the high-velocity outliers that are best fit\nby this second component may either (1) be contaminants from the nearby Perseus\nOB2 association, (2) be a halo of ejected or dispersing stars from IC 348, or\n(3) reflect that IC 348 has not relaxed to a Gaussian velocity distribution. We\nmeasure a velocity dispersion for IC 348 of $0.72 \\pm 0.07$ km s$^{-1}$ (or\n$0.64 \\pm 0.08$ km s$^{-1}$ if two Gaussians are fitted), which implies a\nsupervirial state, unless the gas contributes more to the gravitational\npotential than expected. No evidence is found for a dependence of this velocity\ndispersion on distance from the cluster center or stellar mass. We also find\nthat stars with lower extinction (in the front of the cloud) tend to be\nredshifted compared with stars with somewhat higher extinction (towards the\nback of the cloud). This data suggests that the stars in IC 348 are converging\nalong the line of sight. We show that this correlation between radial velocity\nand extinction is unlikely to be spuriously caused by the small cluster\nrotation of $0.024 \\pm 0.013$ km s$^{-1}$ arcmin$^{-1}$ or by correlations\nbetween the radial velocities of neighboring stars.

The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key\ncryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However,\nit is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In\nparticular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature\nschemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.\nSeveral quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has\nbeen explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security\ngoals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security\ndefinitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the\nquantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on\ndifferent verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty\nsignature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical\n-- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two\nexisting quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security\nframework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature\nprotocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case,\nproving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability.\nNotably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key\ndistribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 23:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-15"}

These models focus on isolated\nsystems with only one defender, despite being part of a more complex system\nwith multiple players. Furthermore, many real systems such as transportation\nnetworks and the power grid exhibit interdependencies between targets and,\nconsequently, between decision makers jointly charged with protecting them. To\nunderstand such multidefender strategic interactions present in security, we\ninvestigate game theoretic models of security games with multiple defenders.\nUnlike most prior analysis, we focus on the situations in which each defender\nmust protect multiple targets, so that even a single defender's best response\ndecision is, in general, highly non-trivial. We start with an analytical\ninvestigation of multidefender security games with independent targets,\noffering an equilibrium and price-of-anarchy analysis of three models with\nincreasing generality. In all models, we find that defenders have the incentive\nto over-protect targets, at times significantly. Additionally, in the simpler\nmodels, we find that the price of anarchy is unbounded, linearly increasing\nboth in the number of defenders and the number of targets per defender.\nConsidering interdependencies among targets, we develop a novel mixed-integer\nlinear programming formulation to compute a defender's best response, and make\nuse of this formulation in approximating Nash equilibria of the game. We apply\nthis approach towards computational strategic analysis of several models of\nnetworks representing interdependencies, including real-world power networks.\nOur analysis shows how network structure and the probability of failure spread\ndetermine the propensity of defenders to over- or under-invest in security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 04:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

Using the full gas-grain network model, we\nreproduced the N$_2$H$^+$ ring in a disk model with millimeter grains. The\nchemical conversion of CO and N$_2$ to less volatile species (sink effect\nhereinafter) is found to affect the N$_2$H$^+$ distribution. Since the\nefficiency of the sink depends on various parameters such as activation\nbarriers of grain surface reactions, which are not well constrained, we also\nconstructed the no-sink model; the total (gas and ice) CO and N$_2$ abundances\nare set constant, and their gaseous abundances are given by the balance between\nadsorption and desorption.

This algorithm comprises four steps: polynomial\nselection, relation collection, linear algebra and finally, individual\nlogarithm computation. The first step outputs two polynomials defining two\nnumber fields, and a map from the polynomial ring over the integers modulo each\nof these polynomials to $\\mathbb{F}\\_{p^n}$. After the relation collection and\nlinear algebra phases, the (virtual) logarithm of a subset of elements in each\nnumber field is known. Given the target element in $\\mathbb{F}\\_{p^n}$, the\nfourth step computes a preimage in one number field. If one can write the\ntarget preimage as a product of elements of known (virtual) logarithm, then one\ncan deduce the discrete logarithm of the target.

Consequently, the\nhierarchy of cumulant equations is not closed. But because atmospheric flows\nare inhomogeneous and anisotropic, the nonlinearity may manifest itself only\nweakly through interactions of mean fields with disturbances such as thermals\nor eddies. In such situations, truncations of the hierarchy of cumulant\nequations hold promise as a closure strategy.\n  We review how truncations at second order can be used to model and elucidate\nthe dynamics of atmospheric flows. Two examples are considered. First, we study\nthe growth of a dry convective boundary layer, which is heated from below,\nleading to turbulent upward energy transport and growth of the boundary layer.\nWe demonstrate that a quasilinear truncation of the equations of motion, in\nwhich interactions of disturbances among each other are neglected but\ninteractions with mean fields are taken into account, can capture the growth of\nthe convective boundary layer even if it does not capture important turbulent\ntransport terms. Second, we study the evolution of two-dimensional large-scale\nwaves representing waves in Earth's upper atmosphere. We demonstrate that a\ncumulant expansion truncated at second order (CE2) can capture the evolution of\nsuch waves and their nonlinear interaction with the mean flow in some\ncircumstances, for example, when the wave amplitude is small enough or the\nplanetary rotation rate is large enough. However, CE2 fails to capture the flow\nevolution when nonlinear eddy--eddy interactions in surf zones become\nimportant. Higher-order closures can capture these missing interactions.\n  The results point to new ways in which the dynamics of turbulent boundary\nlayers may be represented in climate models, and they illustrate different\nclasses of nonlinear processes that can control wave dissipation and momentum\nfluxes in the troposphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 11:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 11:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 08:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-29"}

In the case of high\nmass-loss rates, this study is complicated by the high optical depths and the\nintricate coupling between gas and dust radiative transfer characteristics. An\nimportant aspect of the physics of gas-dust interactions is the strong\ninfluence of dust on the excitation of several molecules, including H2O. Aims:\nThe dust and gas content of the envelope surrounding the high mass-loss rate\nOH/IR star OH 127.8+0.0, as traced by Herschel observations, is studied, with a\nfocus on the H2O content and the dust-to-gas ratio.

The intrinsic\nNIR luminosity scatter of SNe Ia is estimated to be around 0.10 mag, which is\nsmaller than what can be derived for a similarly heterogeneous sample at\noptical wavelengths. In conclusion, we find that SNe Ia are at least as good\nstandard candles in the NIR as in the optical. We showed that it is feasible to\nextended the NIR SN Ia Hubble diagram to z=0.2 with very modest sampling of the\nNIR LCs, if complemented by well-sampled optical LCs. Our results suggest that\nthe most efficient way to extend the NIR Hubble diagram to high redshift would\nbe to obtain a single observation close to the NIR maximum.

The algorithms behind and\nacceleration techniques for Monte Carlo radiative transfer are discussed\nextensively in the literature, and many different Monte Carlo codes are\npublicly available. On the contrary, the design of a suite of components that\ncan be used for the distribution of sources and sinks in radiative transfer\ncodes has received very little attention. The availability of such models, with\ndifferent degrees of complexity, has many benefits. For example, they can serve\nas toy models to test new physical ingredients, or as parameterised models for\ninverse radiative transfer fitting. For 3D Monte Carlo codes, this requires\nalgorithms to efficiently generate random positions from 3D density\ndistributions. We describe the design of a flexible suite of components for the\nMonte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. The design is based on a combination\nof basic building blocks (which can be either analytical toy models or\nnumerical models defined on grids or a set of particles) and the extensive use\nof decorators that combine and alter these building blocks to more complex\nstructures. For a number of decorators, e.g. those that add spiral structure or\nclumpiness, we provide a detailed description of the algorithms that can be\nused to generate random positions. Advantages of this decorator-based design\ninclude code transparency, the avoidance of code duplication, and an increase\nin code maintainability. Moreover, since decorators can be chained without\nproblems, very complex models can easily be constructed out of simple building\nblocks. Finally, based on a number of test simulations, we demonstrate that our\ndesign using customised random position generators is superior to a simpler\ndesign based on a generic black-box random position generator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 14:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

Throughout the middle and upper atmospheres, temperatures\nincrease upon introducing ozone due to strong UV absorption. This heating of\nthe middle atmosphere strongly reduces the zone of carbon dioxide condensation,\nhence the potential formation of carbon dioxide clouds.

One is\nthe interaction of the velocity components in the radial and azimuthal\ndirections, due to the fictitious centrifugal force in the equations of motion.\nThe rate of the vorticity production at the pipe wall depends on the initial\ndata at entry, and hence is unknown a priori; it must be determined as part of\nthe solution.

As a consequence, the left-handed truly neutral neutrino\nin an axial-vector field of emission can be converted into a right-handed one\nand vice versa. This predicts the unidenticality of masses, energies and\nmomenta of neutrinos of the different components. Recognizing such a difference\nin masses, energies, momenta and accepting that the left-handed axial-vector\nneutrino and the right-handed antineutrino of true neutrality refer to\nlong-lived C-odd leptons, and the right-handed truly neutral neutrino and the\nleft-handed axial-vector antineutrino are of short-lived fermions of C-oddity,\nwe would write a new CP-even Dirac equation taking into account the flavor\nsymmetrical axial-vector mass, energy and momentum matrices. Their presence\nexplains the spontaneous mirror symmetry violation, confirming that an\naxial-vector current conservation law has never violated. They reflect the\navailability of a mirror Minkowski space in which a neutrino is characterized\nby left as well as by right space-time coordinates. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that whatever the main purposes experiments about a quasielastic\naxial-vector mass say in favor of an axial-vector mirror Minkowski space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 03:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 03:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}
