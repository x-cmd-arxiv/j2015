A polar code\nconstruction is any algorithm that selects $K$ best among $N$ possible polar\nbit-channels at the design signal-to-noise-ratio (design-SNR) in terms of bit\nerror rate (BER). Optimal polar code construction is hard and therefore many\nsuboptimal polar code constructions have been proposed at different\ncomputational complexities. Polar codes are also non-universal meaning the code\nchanges significantly with the design-SNR. However, it is not known which\nconstruction algorithm at what design-SNR constructs the best polar codes. We\nfirst present a comprehensive survey of all the well-known polar code\nconstructions along with their full implementations.

In particular, we extend the well-known\nBollob\\'{a}s--Eldridge Theorem, proving that if $\\Delta (G_{1}) \\leq n-2,\n\\Delta(G_{2}) \\leq n-2, \\Delta(G_{3}) \\leq n-1$, and $|E_1| + |E_2| + |E_3|\n\\leq 2n-3$, then either $(G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3})$ packs or is one of 7 possible\nexceptions. Hopefully, the concept of list packing will help to solve some\nproblems on ordinary graph packing, as the concept of list coloring did for\nordinary coloring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 19:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

However,\nexisting mmW communications standards are hindered by two problems: deafness\nand single link scheduling. The deafness problem, that is, a misalignment\nbetween transmitter and receiver beams, demands a time consuming beam-searching\noperation, which leads to an alignment-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the\nexisting mmW standards schedule a single link in each time slot and hence do\nnot fully exploit the potential of mmW communications, where directional\ncommunications allow multiple concurrent transmissions. These two problems are\naddressed in this paper, where a joint beamwidth selection and power allocation\nproblem is formulated by an optimization problem for short range mmW networks\nwith the objective of maximizing effective network throughput. This\noptimization problem allows establishing the fundamental alignment-throughput\ntradeoff, however it is computationally complex and requires exact knowledge of\nnetwork topology, which may not be available in practice. Therefore, two\nstandard-compliant approximation solution algorithms are developed, which rely\non underestimation and overestimation of interference. The first one exploits\ndirectionality to maximize the reuse of available spectrum and thereby\nincreases the network throughput, while imposing almost no computational\ncomplexity. The second one is a more conservative approach that protects all\nactive links from harmful interference, yet enhances the network throughput by\n100% compared to the existing standards. Extensive performance analysis\nprovides useful insights on the directionality level and the number of\nconcurrent transmissions that should be pursued.

However, the notions of both\n\"stability\" and \"instability\" in this result are significantly weaker than one\nwould like to obtain. In this paper, we prove that if a perturbation of the\nform $\\pounds_t \\delta g$---with $\\delta g$ a solution to the linearized\nEinstein equation---has negative canonical energy, then that perturbation must,\nin fact, grow exponentially in time. The key idea is to make use of the $t$- or\n($t$-$\\phi$)-reflection isometry, $i$, of the background spacetime and\ndecompose the initial data for perturbations into their odd and even parts\nunder $i$. We then write the canonical energy as $\\mathscr E\\ = \\mathscr K +\n\\mathscr U$, where $\\mathscr K$ and $\\mathscr U$, respectively, denote the\ncanonical energy of the odd part (kinetic energy) and even part (potential\nenergy). One of the main results of this paper is the proof that $\\mathscr K$\nis positive definite for any black hole background.

The operation\nscheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum\nphysical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the\nscheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution\ndue to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation\nscheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions\ninfluence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between\npredecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.\nThe proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies\nby applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum\ndata flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the\nquantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified\nforce-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and\nquantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven\ninstruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while\nmaking iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct\nscheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step\nthat finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to\nthe quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single\nbest ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of\ndifferent FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using\ninformation about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of\nthe target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 02:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

To counteract this problem, calcium ions are present at\nhigh concentrations throughout body fluids -- at concentrations exceeding the\nsaturation point. This condition leads to the opposite situation where unwanted\nmineral sedimentation may occur. Remarkably, ectopic or out-of-place\nsedimentation into soft tissues is rare, in spite of the thermodynamic driving\nfactors. This fortunate fact is due to the presence of auto-regulatory proteins\nthat are found in abundance in bodily fluids. Yet, many important inflammatory\ndisorders such as atherosclerosis and osteoarthritis are associated with this\nundesired calcification. Hence, it is important to gain an understanding of the\nregulatory process and the conditions under which it can go awry. In this\nmanuscript, we adapt mean-field classical nucleation theory to the case of\nsurface-shielding in order to study the regulation of sedimentation of calcium\nphosphate salts in biological tissues through the mechanism of post-nuclear\nshielding of nascent mineral particles by binding proteins. We develop a\nmathematical description of this phenomenon using a countable system of\nhyperbolic partial differential equations.

We\ndemonstrate performance of this methodology on problems from flow thorough\nporous media. However, one can extend it to other models. We construct\nmathematical properties such that the solutions to Darcy and Darcy-Brinkman\nequations satisfy them. The mathematical properties include the total minimum\nmechanical power, minimum dissipation theorem, reciprocal relation, and maximum\nprinciple for the vorticity. All the developed theorems have firm mechanical\nbases and are independent of numerical methods. So, these can be utilized for\nsolution verification of finite element, finite volume, finite difference,\nlattice Boltzmann methods and so forth.

One possible outcome of such a\nmerger would be a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (known as\na millisecond magnetar). These magnetars may be \"supra-massive\", implying they\nwould collapse to black holes after losing centrifugal support due to magnetic\ndipole spindown. By systematically analyzing the BAT-XRT light curves of all\nshort GRBs detected by {\\em swift}, we test how well the data are consistent\nwith this central engine model of short GRBs. We find that the so-called\n\"extended emission\" observed with BAT in some short GRBs are fundamentally the\nsame component as the \"internal X-ray plateau\" as observed in many short GRBs,\nwhich is defined as a plateau in the lightcurve followed by a very rapid drop.\nBased on how likely a short GRB hosts a magnetar, we characterize the entire\n{\\em Swift} short GRB sample into three categories: the \"internal plateau\"\nsample, the \"external plateau\" sample, and the \"no plateau\" sample. The derived\nmagnetar surface magnetic field $B_{\\rm p}$ and the initial spin period $P_0$\nfall into the reasonable range. No GRBs in the internal plateau sample have the\ntotal energy exceeding the maximum energy budget of a millisecond magnetar.\nAssuming that the rapid fall time at the end of the internal plateau is the\ncollapse time of a supra-massive magnetar to a black hole, and applying the\nmeasured mass distribution of NS-NS systems in our Galaxy, we constrain the\nneutron star equation of state (EOS).

Since, under the renormalization group\n(RG) flow, different interaction terms get different loop-corrections, it is\nuncertain, whether these functions remain fixed under this flow. We investigate\nthis question for the $U(1)$-Higgs-model to 1-loop order in the framework of\nEpstein-Glaser renormalization. Our main result reads: choosing the\nrenormalization mass scale(s) in a way corresponding to the minimal subtraction\nscheme, the geometrical interpretation as a spontaneously broken gauge theory\ngets lost under the RG-flow. This holds also for the clearly stronger property\nof BRST-invariance of the Lagrangian.

Better measurements of\nnanodust will allow us to determine where it comes from and the extent to which\nit interacts with the solar wind. When one of these nanodust grains impacts a\nspacecraft, it creates an expanding plasma cloud, which perturbs the\nphotoelectron currents.

Reflecting this, there has been a\ngrowing interest in studying information-flow properties which change during\nprogram execution, including concepts such as declassification, revocation, and\nrole-change.\n  A static verification of a dynamic information flow policy, from a semantic\nperspective, should only need to concern itself with two things: 1) the\ndependencies between data in a program, and 2) whether those dependencies are\nconsistent with the intended flow policies as they change over time. In this\npaper we provide a formal ground for this intuition. We present a\nstraightforward extension to the principal flow-sensitive type system\nintroduced by Hunt and Sands (POPL '06, ESOP '11) to infer both end-to-end\ndependencies and dependencies at intermediate points in a program. This allows\ntypings to be applied to verification of both static and dynamic policies. Our\nextension preserves the principal type system's distinguishing feature, that\ntype inference is independent of the policy to be enforced: a single, generic\ndependency analysis (typing) can be used to verify many different dynamic\npolicies of a given program, thus achieving a clean separation between (1) and\n(2).\n  We also make contributions to the foundations of dynamic information flow.\nArguably, the most compelling semantic definitions for dynamic security\nconditions in the literature are phrased in the so-called knowledge-based\nstyle. We contribute a new definition of knowledge-based termination\ninsensitive security for dynamic policies. We show that the new definition\navoids anomalies of previous definitions and enjoys a simple and useful\ncharacterisation as a two-run style property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

Using the Unruh-DeWitt detectors we find an adiabatic\nexpansion of the detection properties along linear trajectories with slowly\nvarying acceleration in Minkowski, which allows us to calculate the spectrum\ndetected, finding the thermal spectrum as the zeroth order contribution. Using\nthe ETF we study the perception of Hawking radiation by observers following\nradial trajectories outside a Schwarzschild black hole. One of the most\nimportant results is that, in general, free-falling observers crossing the\nevent horizon do detect some radiation, even when the field is in the Unruh\nvacuum state, due to a Doppler blue-shift that diverges at the horizon. We give\na general expression for the ETF, which has a clear interpretation in terms of\nwell-known physical phenomena. We discuss which contribution to the perception\ncomes from the radiation emitted by the black hole, and which contribution is\ndue to the Unruh effect caused by the movement of the observer. We conclude\nthat the Unruh effect is not only due to the observer's proper acceleration and\ncannot even be defined locally, but is due to the observer's acceleration with\nrespect to the asymptotic region. We apply the ETF to the analysis of different\nphysical situations, in particular to a possible buoyancy scenario near the\nhorizon due to Hawking radiation pressure. Finally, we propose a non-stationary\nvacuum state, which we call pulsating vacuum, for the radiation field outside a\nstellar object hovering closely to form an event horizon. In this vacuum state,\nwe get nearly Hawking radiation emitted by the object, while avoiding the known\nproblems of the information paradox and the trans-planckian problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

However, the lack of power in the CMB temperature\nanisotropies at large angular scales (low-$\\ell$), as has been confirmed by the\nrecent Planck data also (up to $\\ell=40$), although statistically not very\nstrong (less than $3\\sigma$), is still an open problem.

In the present work we also follow this approach and consider a set of\nPPS which have features and constrain the parameters of those using WMAP 9 year\nand Planck data employing Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The\nprominent feature of all the models of PPS that we consider is an infra-red cut\noff which leads to suppression of power at large angular scales. We consider\nmodels of PPS with maximum three extra parameters and use Akaike information\ncriterion ($AIC$) and Bayesian information criterion ($BIC$) of model and\nBayesian information criterion ($BIC$) of model selection to compare the\nmodels. For most models, we find good constraints for the cut off scale $k_c$,\nhowever, for other parameters our constraints are not that good. We find that\nsharp cut off model gives best likelihood value for the WMAP 9 year data, but\nis as good as power law model according to $AIC$.

Our main results are\nas follows: a) Kepler-41b is significantly larger and less dense than\npreviously found because a lower orbital inclination is favoured by SC data.\nThis also affects the determination of the geometric albedo that is lower than\npreviously derived: Ag < 0.135; b) Kepler-44b is moderately smaller and denser\nthan reported in the discovery paper; c) good agreement was achieved with\npublished Kepler-43, Kepler-75, and KOI-205 system parameters, although the\nhost stars Kepler-75 and KOI-205 were found to be slightly richer in metals and\nhotter, respectively; d) the previously reported non-zero eccentricities of\nKepler-39b and Kepler-74b might be spurious. If their orbits were circular, the\ntwo companions would be smaller and denser than in the eccentric case. The\nradius of Kepler-39b is still larger than predicted by theoretical isochrones.\nIts parent star is hotter and richer in metals than previously determined.\n[ABRIDGED]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 14:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

The original was too\ntechnical. The current version uses intuitive notions from black hole physics\nto explain the model of inflationary cosmology based on the Holographic Space\nTime formalism. The reason that the initial state of the universe had low\nentropy is that more generic states have no localized excitations, since in\nHST, localized excitations are defined by constraints on the fundamental\nvariables. The only way to obtain a radiation dominated era, is for each\ntime-like geodesic to see an almost uniform gas of small black holes as its\nhorizon expands, such that the holes evaporate into radiation before they\ncollide and coalesce. Comparing the time slicing that follows causal diamonds\nalong a trajectory, with the global FRW slicing, one sees that systems outside\nthe horizon had to undergo inflation, with a number of e-folds fixed by the\npresent and inflationary cosmological constants, and the black hole number\ndensity on FRW slices just after inflation ends.

The spin-textile and the degeneracy of the ground state (g.s.)\ntogether with the factors affecting the stability of the g.s., such as the gap\nand the level density in the neighborhood of the g.s., have been studied. Based\non a rigorous treatment of the spin-degrees of freedom, the spin-textiles can\nbe understood in a $N$-body language. In addition to the ferro-, polar, and\ncyclic phases, the g,s, might in a mixture of them when $0< M< 2N$ ($M$ is the\ntotal magnetization). The great difference in the stability and degeneracy of\nthe g.s. caused by varying $\\varphi $ (which marks the features of the\ninteraction) and $M$ is notable.\n  Since the root mean square radius $R_{rms}$ is an observable, efforts have\nbeen made to derive a set of formulae to relate $R_{rms}$ and $% N$, $\\omega\n$(frequency of the trap), and $\\varphi $. These formulae provide a way to check\nthe theories with experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 02:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nalgorithms for that aim are often difficult to be implemented for\nhigh-dimensional variable selection problems, such as the ones arising in\nepistatic analysis. Variational approximation is an alternative to MCMC, and\nvariational linear regression (VLR) is an effective solution for the variable\nselection problems, but lacks accuracy in some QTL mapping problems where there\nare many more variables than samples. In this paper, we propose an effective\nmethod with aim to improve the accuracy of VLR in the case of above by\ndynamically reducing components (variable or markers) with known effects (zero\nor fixed). We show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of\nVLR with little increase in computational cost.
