A transition between different\nsearching strategies for navigating in metropolitan maps has been observed for\nlarge, complex metropolitan networks. This evidence suggests the existence of\nanother limit associated to the cognitive overload and caused by large amounts\nof information to process. In this light, we analyzed the world's 15 largest\nmetropolitan networks and estimated the information limit for determining a\ntrip in a transportation system to be on the order of 8 bits. Similar to the\n\"Dunbar number,\" which represents a limit to the size of an individual's\nfriendship circle, our cognitive limit suggests that maps should not consist of\nmore than about $250$ connections points to be easily readable. We also show\nthat including connections with other transportation modes dramatically\nincreases the information needed to navigate in multilayer transportation\nnetworks: in large cities such as New York, Paris, and Tokyo, more than $80\\%$\nof trips are above the 8-bit limit. Multimodal transportation systems in large\ncities have thus already exceeded human cognitive limits and consequently the\ntraditional view of navigation in cities has to be revised substantially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 17:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

The types of singularities that occur in this context have been\nstudied by Mori, Koll\\'ar, Reid, and others, beginning in the 1980s with the\nintroduction of the minimal model program. Normal singularities that are\nterminal, canonical, log terminal, and log canonical, and their non-normal\ncounterparts, are typically studied using a resolution of singularities (or a\nsemiresolution) and finding numerical conditions that relate the canonical\nclass of the variety to that of its resolution. In order to do this, it has\nbeen assumed that a variety $X$ has a $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class:\nsome multiple $mK_X$ of the canonical class is Cartier. In particular, this\ndivisor can be pulled back under a resolution $f: Y \\rightarrow X$ by pulling\nback its local sections. Then one has a relation $K_Y \\sim \\frac{1}{m}f^*(mK_X)\n+ \\sum a_iE_i$. It is then the coefficients of the exceptional divisors $E_i$\nthat determine the type of singularities that belong to $X$. It might be asked\nwhether this $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier hypothesis is necessary in studying\nsingularities in birational classification. In \\cite{dFH09}, de Fernex and\nHacon construct a boundary divisor $\\Delta$ for arbitrary normal varieties, the\nresulting divisor $K_X + \\Delta$ being $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier even though $K_X$\nitself is not. This they call (for reasons that will be made clear) an\n$m$-compatible boundary for $X$, and they proceed to show that the\nsingularities defined in terms of the pair $(X, \\Delta)$ are none other than\nthe singularities just described, when $K_X$ happens to be\n$\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier. In the present paper, we extend the results of\n\\cite{dFH09} still further, to include demi-normal varieties without a\n$\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 18:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

In the small battery regime, when\n$\\bar{B}<\\bar{E}$, we clarify the dependence of the capacity on the\ndistribution of $E_t$ and the value of $\\bar{B}$. There are three steps to\nproving this result which can be of interest in their own right: 1) we\ncharacterize the capacity of this channel as an $n$-letter mutual information\nrate under various assumptions on the availability of energy arrival\ninformation; 2) we characterize the approximately optimal online power control\npolicy that maximizes the long-term average throughput of the system; 3) we\nshow that the information-theoretic capacity of this channel is equal, within a\nconstant gap, to its long-term average throughput. This last result provides a\nconnection between the information- and communication-theoretic formulations of\nthe energy-harvesting communication problem that have been so far studied in\nisolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 19:52:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 17:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

The model reveals the following implications of star formation\nand feedback processes in galaxy formation. First, the observed metallicity\nrelations provide a stringent upper limit for the averaged outflow mass-loading\nfactors of local galaxies, which is ~20 for M_*~10^9Msun galaxies and\nmonotonically decreases to ~1 for M_*~10^{11}Msun galaxies. Second, the\ninferred upper-limit for the outflow mass-loading factor sensitively depends on\nwhether the outflow is metal-enriched with respect to the ISM metallicity. If\nhalf of the metals ejected from SNe leave the galaxy in metal-enriched winds,\nthe outflow mass-loading factor for galaxies at any mass can barely be higher\nthan ~10, which puts strong constraints on galaxy formation models. Third, the\nrelatively lower stellar-phase to gas-phase metallicity ratio for lower-mass\ngalaxies indicate that low-mass galaxies are still rapidly enriching their\nmetallicities in recent times, while high-mass galaxies are more settled, which\nseems to show a downsizing effect in the metallicity evolution of galaxies. The\nanalysis presented in the paper demonstrates the importance of accurate\nmeasurements of galaxy metallicities and the cold gas fraction of galaxies at\ndifferent redshifts for constraining star formation and feedback processes, and\ndemonstrates the power of these relations in constraining the physics of galaxy\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We find lognormal distributions\nof effective radius and core radius, with medians of $\\approx$2.5 pc and\n$\\approx$1.3 pc, respectively. Our results provide strong evidence for a\ncharacteristic size of young, massive clusters. The average effective radius\nand core radius increase somewhat with cluster age. Little to no change in\neffective radius is observed with increasing galactocentric distance, except\nperhaps for clusters younger than 100 Myr. We find a shallow correlation\nbetween effective radius and mass for the full cluster sample, but a stronger\ncorrelation is present for clusters 200-300 Myr in age. Finally, the majority\nof the clusters are best fit by an EFF model with index $\\eta\\leq3.0$. There is\nno strong evidence for change in $\\eta$ with cluster age, mass, or\ngalactocentric distance. Our results suggest that clusters emerge from early\nevolution with similar radii and are not strongly affected by the tidal field\nof M83. Mass loss due to stellar evolution and/or GMC interactions appear to\ndominate cluster expansion in the age range we study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 20:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down.

In contrast, multivariate methods measure the\nrelative contribution of a gene to the classification by taking the other genes\nin the data into consideration. Multivariate methods select fewer genes in\ngeneral. However, the selection process of multivariate methods may be\nsensitive to the presence of irrelevant genes, noises in the expression and\noutliers in the training data.

We\nanalyze the properties of these methods and systematically test the\neffectiveness of our proposed method on two cancer microarray datasets. Our\nexperiments on a leukemia dataset and a small, round blue cell tumors dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid method.

For cuprate superconductors, a\nphenomenology based on coexisting competing orders with superconductivity in\nthe ground state of these doped Mott insulators is shown to provide a\nconsistent account for a wide range of experimental findings. In the case of\niron-based superconductors, studies of the low-energy excitations reveal\ninteresting similarities and differences when compared with cuprate\nsuperconductors. In contrast to the single-band cuprate superconductivity with\nan insulating parent state, the ferrous superconductors are multi-band\nmaterials with a semi-metallic parent state and exhibit two-gap\nsuperconductivity when doped. On the other hand, both systems exhibit strong\nantiferromagnetic correlation and Fermi-surface distortion, leading to\nunconventional pairing symmetries with sign-changing order parameters on\ndifferent parts of the Fermi surface. These findings suggest that the pairing\npotentials in both the cuprate and the ferrous superconductors are generally\nrepulsive, thus favor a pairing mechanism that is electronically driven and a\npairing strength that is closely related to the electronic correlation.

Stochastic theories that treat semi-Markov age-dependent\nprocesses using e.g., the Bellman-Harris equation, do not resolve a\npopulation's age-structure and are unable to quantify population-size\ndependencies. Conversely, current theories that include size-dependent\npopulation dynamics (e.g., mathematical models that include carrying capacity\nsuch as the Logistic equation) cannot be easily extended to take into account\nage-dependent birth and death rates. In this paper, we present a systematic\nderivation of a new fully stochastic kinetic theory for interacting\nage-structured populations. By defining multiparticle probability density\nfunctions, we derive a hierarchy of kinetic equations for the stochastic\nevolution of an ageing population undergoing birth and death. We show that the\nfully stochastic age-dependent birth-death process precludes factorization of\nthe corresponding probability densities, which then must be solved by using a\nBBGKY-like hierarchy. However, explicit solutions are derived in two simple\nlimits and compared with their corresponding mean-field results. Our results\ngeneralize both deterministic models and existing master equation approaches by\nproviding an intuitive and efficient way to simultaneously model age- and\npopulation-dependent stochastic dynamics applicable to the study of demography,\nstem cell dynamics, and disease evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 03:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

However, this\nrule may be violated in polymer systems and as a consequence various\ninstabilities may arise. The main objective of this paper is to analyze\ntheoretically the influence of slip boundary conditions on the hydrodynamic\nstability of the interface between two immiscible viscous layers subjected to\nsimple shear flow. It is found that the growth rate of long-wave disturbances\nis fairly sensitive to the slip at the interface between layers as well as at\nthe external boundary. These phenomena are shown to give different\ncontributions to the stability of shear flow depending on viscosity, thickness,\nand density ratios of the layers. Particularly, the interfacial slip can\nincrease the perturbation growth rate and lead to unstable flow. An important\nconsequence of this effect is the violation of stability for sheared layers\nwith equal viscosities and densities in a broad range of thickness ratios.

We perform an extensive study of the\nproperties of dropout's uncertainty.

We give\nmistake bound learning algorithms in two settings: in the first, the objective\nof the LP is known to the learner but there is an arbitrary, fixed set of\nconstraints which are unknown. Each example is defined by an additional known\nconstraint and the goal of the learner is to predict the optimal solution of\nthe LP given the union of the known and unknown constraints. This models the\nproblem of predicting the behavior of a rational agent whose goals are known,\nbut whose resources are unknown. In the second setting, the objective of the LP\nis unknown, and changing in a controlled way. The constraints of the LP may\nalso change every day, but are known. An example is given by a set of\nconstraints and partial information about the objective, and the task of the\nlearner is again to predict the optimal solution of the partially known LP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 15:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 20:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 16:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

Here we suggest that hybrid\nsingle-molecule nanoparticle junctions can serve as efficient thermoelectric\nconverters. The introduction of a semiconducting nanoparticle introduces new\ntuning capabilities, which are absent in conventional metal-molecule-metal\njunctions. Using a generic model for the molecule and nanoparticle with\nrealistic parameters, we demonstrate that the thermopower can be of the order\nof hundreds of microvolts per degree Kelvin, and that the thermoelectric figure\nof merit can reach values close to one, an improvement of four orders of\nmagnitude improvement over existing measurements. This favorable performance\npersists over a wide range of experimentally relevant parameters, and is robust\nagainst disorder (in the form of surface-attached molecules) and against\nelectron decoherence at the nanoparticle molecule interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 15:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

Previous work has shown that ultrasound produced by absorption of\nlight at the epidermis reflects on the bone surfaces within the finger. When\nthe reflected signals are backprojected in the region of interest, artifacts\nare produced, confounding interpretation of the images. In this work, we\npresent an approach where the photoacoustic signals known to originate from the\nepidermis, are treated as virtual ultrasound transmitters, and a separate\nreconstruction is performed as in ultrasound reflection imaging. This allows us\nto identify the bone surfaces. Further, the identification of the joint space\nis important as this provides a landmark to localize a region-of-interest in\nseeking the inflamed synovial membrane. The ability to delineate bone surfaces\nallows us not only to identify the artifacts, but also to identify the\ninterphalangeal joint space without recourse to new US hardware or a new\nmeasurement. We test the approach on phantoms and on a healthy human finger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 15:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

The dual representation of $\\varphi-$divergences based\non the Fenchel-Legendre duality is the main interest of this study. It provides\na way to estimate $\\varphi-$divergences by a simple plug-in of the empirical\ndistribution without any smoothing technique. Resulting estimators are\nthoroughly studied theoretically and with simulations showing that the so\ncalled minimum $\\varphi-$divergence estimator (MD$\\varphi$DE) is generally non\nrobust and behaves similarly to the maximum likelihood estimator. We give some\narguments supporting the non robustness property, and give insights on how to\nmodify the classical approach. An alternative class of $\\varphi-$divergences\nrobust estimators based on the dual representation is presented. We study\nconsistency and robustness properties from an influence function point of view\nof the new estimators. In a second part, we invoke the Basu-Lindsay approach\nfor approximating $\\varphi-$divergences and provide a comparison between these\napproaches. The so called dual $\\varphi-$divergence is also discussed and\ncompared to our new estimator. A full simulation study of all these approaches\nis given in order to compare efficiency and robustness of all mentioned\nestimators against the so-called minimum density power divergence, showing\nencouraging results in favor of our new class of minimum dual\n$\\varphi-$divergences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 15:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2015 12:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

The ultrarelativistic decoupling\ntransformation is applied to free Dirac particles (in the Weyl basis) and to\nhigh-energy tachyons, which are faster-than-light particles described by a\nfully Lorentz-covariant equation. The effective gravitational interactions are\nfound.
