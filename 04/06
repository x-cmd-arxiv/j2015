In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to\ndetermine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to\ntest hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our\nmethod allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that\nwas not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating\ninference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised\nmachine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal\nis to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an\nobserved outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by\ncross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples,\nin order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best\npredictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is\ntailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's\noutcome. The challenge is that the \"ground truth\" for a causal effect is not\nobserved for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or\nwithout the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious\nhow to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been\naccurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for\nthis problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which\nthey perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects.

Hence, higher number of bits per symbol can be\ntransmitted and the bandwidth of each subcarrier can be widened. Widening the\nbandwidth of each subcarrier leads to (i) higher bandwidth efficiency; (ii)\nlower complexity; (iii) lower sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO);\n(iv) reduced peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); and (iv) reduced latency.

Dataflow has the potential to\nprovide better spatial resolution of water quality features because it\ngenerates many closely spaced (< 10 m) measurements. Regardless of the\nmeasurement technique, parameter values at unsampled locations must be\ninterpolated from nearby measurement points in order to generate a\ncomprehensive picture of spatial variations.

The underlying idea of this algorithm is\nto closely approximate the rank function with a smooth function of singular\nvalues, and then minimize the resulting approximation subject to the linear\nconstraints. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled via a scaling\nparameter $\\delta$, where a smaller $\\delta$ corresponds to a more accurate\nfitting. The consequent optimization problem for any finite $\\delta$ is\nnonconvex. Therefore, in order to decrease the risk of ending up in local\nminima, a series of optimizations is performed, starting with optimizing a\nrough approximation (a large $\\delta$) and followed by successively optimizing\nfiner approximations of the rank with smaller $\\delta$'s. To solve the\noptimization problem for any $\\delta > 0$, it is converted to a new program in\nwhich the cost is a function of two auxiliary positive semidefinete variables.\nThe paper shows that this new program is concave and applies a\nmajorize-minimize technique to solve it which, in turn, leads to a few convex\noptimization iterations. This optimization scheme is also equivalent to a\nreweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM), where weighting update depends on\nthe used approximating function. For any $\\delta > 0$, we derive a necessary\nand sufficient condition for the exact recovery which are weaker than those\ncorresponding to NNM. On the numerical side, the proposed algorithm is compared\nto NNM and a reweighted NNM in solving affine rank minimization and matrix\ncompletion problems showing its considerable and consistent superiority in\nterms of success rate, especially, when the number of measurements decreases\ntoward the lower-bound for the unique representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2015 20:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The key advantages of these estimators are twofold. First,\nthey guarantee by construction a good conditioning of the estimate and second,\nbeing a derivative of robust Tyler estimators, they inherit their robustness\nproperties, notably their resilience to the presence of outliers. Nevertheless,\none major problem that poses the use of RTEs in practice is represented by the\nquestion of setting the regularization parameter $\\rho$. While a high value of\n$\\rho$ is likely to push all the eigenvalues away from zero, it comes at the\ncost of a larger bias with respect to the population covariance matrix. A deep\nunderstanding of the statistics of RTEs is essential to come up with\nappropriate choices for the regularization parameter. This is not an easy task\nand might be out of reach, unless one considers asymptotic regimes wherein the\nnumber of observations $n$ and/or their size $N$ increase together. First\nasymptotic results have recently been obtained under the assumption that $N$\nand $n$ are large and commensurable. Interestingly, no results concerning the\nregime of $n$ going to infinity with $N$ fixed exist, even though the\ninvestigation of this assumption has usually predated the analysis of the most\ndifficult $N$ and $n$ large case. This motivates our work. In particular, we\nprove in the present paper that the RTEs converge to a deterministic matrix\nwhen $n\\to\\infty$ with $N$ fixed, which is expressed as a function of the\ntheoretical covariance matrix. We also derive the fluctuations of the RTEs\naround this deterministic matrix and establish that these fluctuations converge\nin distribution to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a\ncovariance depending on the population covariance and the parameter $\\rho$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 10:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The\ntheoretical modeling of such systems is a very difficult problem. In this work\nwe present a theoretical framework that is based on the rigged Hilbert space\nformulation. The few-body problem is solved by exact diagonalization using a\nbasis in which bound, resonant, and non-resonant scattering states are included\non an equal footing. Current experiments with ultracold atoms offer a\nfascinating opportunity to study universal properties of few-body systems with\na high degree of control over parameters such as the external trap geometry,\nthe number of particles, and even the interaction strength. In particular,\nparticles can be allowed to tunnel out of the trap by applying a magnetic-field\ngradient that effectively lowers the potential barrier. The result is a tunable\nopen quantum system that allows detailed studies of the tunneling mechanism. In\nthis Contribution we introduce our method and present results for the decay\nrate of two distinguishable fermions in a one-dimensional trap as a function of\nthe interaction strength. We also study the numerical convergence. Many of\nthese results have been previously published (R. Lundmark, C. Forss\\'en, and J.\nRotureau, arXiv: 1412.7175).

The accumulated effects eventually will change the surface\nconditions in terms of elastic constants and stiffness and more importantly,\nthe gradient of such properties along the thickness. This is a typical\nfunctionally graded materials (FGM) structure and has been studied extensively\nfor structural applications under multiple loadings such as thermal and\nelectromagnetic fields in recent years. For acoustic wave resonators, such\nstudies are equally important and the wave propagation in FGM structures can be\nused in the evaluation and assessment of performance, reliability, and life of\nsensors based on acoustic waves such as the quartz crystal microbalances (QCM).\nNow we studied the thickness-shear vibrations of FGM plates with properties of\nAT-cut quartz crystal varying along the thickness in a general pattern\nrepresented by a trigonometric function with both sine and cosine functions of\nthe thickness coordinate. The solutions are obtained by using Fourier expansion\nof the plate deformation. We also obtained the frequency changes of the\nfundamental and overtone modes which are strongly coupled for the evaluation of\nresonator structures with property variation or design to take advantages of\nFGM in novel applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 11:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The primary aim of this investigation is to\nexplore the construction of an ensemble for an initial prototyping of this new\nconcept. Using the probabilistic forecasts from three models hosted at the\nCommunity Coordinated Modeling Center (NASA-GSFC) and the NOAA forecasts, we\ndeveloped an ensemble forecast by linearly combining the flaring probabilities\nfrom all four methods. Performance-based combination weights were calculated\nusing a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm that applies a decision threshold $P_{th}$\nto the combined probabilities and maximizing the Heidke Skill Score (HSS).\nUsing the data for 13 recent solar active regions between years 2012 - 2014, we\nfound that linear combination methods can improve the overall probabilistic\nprediction and improve the categorical prediction for certain values of\ndecision thresholds. Combination weights vary with the applied threshold and\nnone of the tested individual forecasting models seem to provide more accurate\npredictions than the others for all values of $P_{th}$. According to the\nmaximum values of HSS, a performance-based weights calculated by averaging over\nthe sample, performed similarly to a equally weighted model. The values\n$P_{th}$ for which the ensemble forecast performs the best are 25 \\% for\nM-class flares and 15 \\% for X-class flares. When the human-adjusted\nprobabilities from NOAA are excluded from the ensemble, the ensemble\nperformance in terms of the Heidke score, is reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 00:52:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 05:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2015 00:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Maxwell applied simultaneously the vector terminology and\nthe quaternion analysis to depict the electromagnetic theory. This method\nedified the paper to introduce the quaternion and octonion spaces into the\nfield theory, in order to describe the physical feature of electromagnetic and\ngravitational fields, while their coordinates are able to be the complex\nnumber. The octonion space can be separated into two subspaces, the quaternion\nspace and the S-quaternion space. In the quaternion space, it is able to infer\nthe field potential, field strength, field source, field equations, and so\nforth, in the gravitational field. In the S-quaternion space, it is able to\ndeduce the field potential, field strength, field source, and so forth, in the\nelectromagnetic field. The results reveal that the quaternion space is\nappropriate to describe the gravitational features; meanwhile the S-quaternion\nspace is proper to depict the electromagnetic features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 08:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}
