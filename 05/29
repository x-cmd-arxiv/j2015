Dramatic\ncrescent-shaped dust concentrations have been seen in recent radio images at\nsub-mm wavelengths. These disk asymmetries could represent the initial phases\nof planet formation in the dust trap scenario, provided that grain sizes are\nspatially segregated. A testable prediction of azimuthal dust trapping is that\nprogressively larger grains should be more sharply confined and furthermore the\ntrapped grains should follow a distribution that is markedly different from the\ngas. However, gas tracers such as CO and the infrared emission from small\ngrains are both very optically thick where the submm continuum originates, so\nobservations have been unable to test the trapping predictions or to identify\ncompact concentrations of larger grains required for planet formation by\ncore-accretion. Here we report multifrequency observations of HD142527, from\n34GHz to 700GHz, that reveal a compact concentration of ~cm-sized grains, with\na few Earth masses, embedded in a large-scale crescent of ~mm-sized particles.\nThe emission peaks at wavelengths shorter than ~1mm are optically thick and\ntrace the temperature structure resulting from shadows cast by the inner\nregions. Given this temperature structure, we infer that the largest dust\ngrains are concentrated in the 34 GHz clump. We conclude that dust trapping is\nefficient for approximately cm-sized grains and leads to enhanced\nconcentrations, while the smaller grains largely reflect the gas distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 16:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

The radial position of the observed DCO+ peak is\nreproduced in our model only if the region's temperature is between 11-16K,\nlower than expected from models constrained by continuum and SED. Altering the\ndensity has little effect on the DCO+ position, but increased density is needed\nto reproduce the disk traced in C18O. The DCO+ emission around VLA1623A is the\nproduct of shadowing of the envelope by the disk. Disk-shadowing causes a drop\nin the gas temperature outside of the disk on >200AU scales, encouraging\ndeuterated molecule production. This indicates that the physical structure of\nthe disk-envelope interface differs from the rest of the envelope, highlighting\nthe drastic impact that the disk has on the envelope and temperature structure.\nThe results presented here show that DCO+ is an excellent cold temperature\ntracer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 17:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

In a first step, we show how to express\ntotal entropy production by properly identified time-independent affinities and\ncurrents without making a linear response assumption. In linear response,\nkinetic coefficients akin to Onsager coefficients can be identified.\nSpecializing to a Fokker-Planck type dynamics, we show that these coefficients\ncan be expressed as a sum of an adiabatic contribution and one reminiscent of a\nGreen-Kubo expression that contains deviations from adiabaticity. Furthermore,\nwe show that the generalized kinetic coefficients fulfill an Onsager-Casimir\ntype symmetry tracing back to microscopic reversibility. This symmetry allows\nfor non-identical off-diagonal coefficients if the driving protocols are not\nsymmetric under time-reversal. We then derive a novel constraint on the kinetic\ncoefficients that is sharper than the second law and provides an\nefficiency-dependent bound on power. As one consequence, we can prove that the\npower vanishes at least linearly when approaching Carnot efficiency. We\nillustrate our general framework by explicitly working out the paradigmatic\ncase of a Brownian heat engine realized by a colloidal particle in a\ntime-dependent harmonic trap subject to a periodic temperature profile.

In contrast to\nindirect dark matter searches using positrons, antiprotons, or gamma-rays,\nwhich suffer from relatively high and uncertain astrophysical backgrounds,\nsearches with antideuterons benefit from very suppressed conventional\nbackgrounds, offering a potential breakthrough in unexplored phase space for\ndark matter. This article is based on the first dedicated cosmic-ray\nantideuteron workshop, which was held at UCLA in June 2014. It reviews broad\nclasses of dark matter candidates that result in detectable cosmic-ray\nantideuteron fluxes, as well as the status and prospects of current\nexperimental searches. The coalescence model of antideuteron production and the\ninfluence of antideuteron measurements at particle colliders are discussed.\nThis is followed by a review of the modeling of antideuteron propagation\nthrough the magnetic fields, plasma currents, and molecular material of our\nGalaxy, the solar system, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the atmosphere.\nFinally, the three ongoing or planned experiments that are sensitive to\ncosmic-ray antideuterons, BESS, AMS-02, and GAPS, are detailed. As cosmic-ray\nantideuteron detection is a rare event search, multiple experiments with\northogonal techniques and backgrounds are essential. Many theoretical and\nexperimental groups have contributed to these studies over the last decade,\nthis review aims to provide the first coherent discussion of the relevant dark\nmatter theories that antideuterons probe, the challenges to predictions and\ninterpretations of antideuteron signals, and the experimental efforts toward\ncosmic antideuteron detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 18:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 18:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

On $\\mathbb R \\times S^1$,\nthe resurgent relation between perturbation theory and non-perturbative physics\nis encoded in new saddles, which are associated with the affine root system of\nthe ${\\frak o}(N) $ algebra. These events may be viewed as fractionalizations\nof the 2d-saddles. The first beta function coefficient, given by the dual\nCoxeter number, can then be intepreted as the sum of the multiplicities (dual\nKac labels) of these fractionalized objects. Surprisingly, the new saddles in\n$O(N)$ models in compactified space are in one-to-one correspondence with\nmonopole-instanton saddles in $SO(N)$ gauge theory on $\\mathbb R^3 \\times S^1$.\nThe Grassmannian sigma models ${ \\rm Gr}(N, M)$ have 2d instantons, which\nfractionalize into $N$ kink-instantons. The small circle dynamics of both sigma\nmodels can be described as a dilute gas of the one-events and two-events,\nbions. One-events are the leading source of a variety of non-perturbative\neffects, and produce the strong scale of the 2d theory in the compactified\ntheory. We show that in both types of sigma models the neutral bion emulates\nthe role of IR-renormalons. We also study the topological theta angle\ndependence in both the $O(3)$ model and ${ \\rm Gr}(N, M)$, and describe the\nmulti-branched structure of the observables in terms of the theta-angle\ndependence of the saddle amplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 19:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

Due to the coupling of\nelectric and magnetic effects, these materials show a strong potential to\ncontrol electricity and magnetism and, more generally, the properties and\npropagation of light. One of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive recent\nresults in multiferroics is directional anisotropy, the asymmetry of light\npropagation with respect to the direction of propagation. The absorption in the\nmaterial can be different for forward and backward propagation of light, which\nin extreme case may lead to complete suppression of absorption in one\ndirection. Another remarkable effect in multiferroics is directional\nbirefringence, i.e. different velocities of light for different directions of\npropagation. In this paper, we demonstrate giant directional birefringence in a\nmultiferroic samarium ferroborate. The effect is easily observed for linear\npolarization of light in the range of millimeter-wavelengths, and survives down\nto very low frequencies. The dispersion and absorption close to the\nelectromagnon resonance can be controlled and fully suppressed in one\ndirection. Therefore, samarium ferroborate is a universal tool for optical\ncontrol: with a magnetic field as an external parameter it allows switching\nbetween two functionalities: polarization rotation and directional anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 19:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2015 10:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-23"}

Because of local conservation laws, the production\nof a $q$-$\\bar q$ pair will lead to correlations of adjacently produced mesons\n(mostly pions). Adjacently produced mesons however can be signalled by their\nrapidity difference $\\Delta y$ falling within the window of $|\\Delta y |\n$$\\lesssim$$ 1/(dN/dy)$, on account of the space-time-rapidity ordering of\nproduced mesons in a flux tube fragmentation.

Many processes have been advocated as responsible for\nsuch a trend (also known as mass quenching), e.g., feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs), and the formation of classical bulges. We determine a\nrefined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local Universe. To\nthis aim we use the Halpha narrow-band imaging follow-up survey (Halpha3) of\nfield galaxies selected from the HI Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey (ALFALFA)\nin the Coma and Local superclusters. By complementing this local determination\nwith high-redshift measurements from the literature, we reconstruct the star\nformation history of main-sequence galaxies as a function of stellar mass from\nthe present epoch up to z=3. In agreement with previous studies, our analysis\nshows that quenching mechanisms occur above a threshold stellar mass M_knee\nthat evolves with redshift as propto (1+z)^{2}. Moreover, visual morphological\nclassification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharp\nincrease in the fraction of visually-classified strong bars with mass, hinting\nthat strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the sSFR above\nM_knee. We test this hypothesis using a simple but physically-motivated\nnumerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quench\nstar formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. We conclude that\nstrong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the inner\nparts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely required\nto quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies.\nIntriguingly, when we extrapolate our model to higher redshifts, we\nsuccessfully recover the observed redshift evolution for M_knee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 20:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 16:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

I find that the temporal distribution of\nmass extinction events over the past 550 Myr can be explained just as well by a\nuniform random distribution as by other models, such as variations in the\nstellar density local to the Sun arising from the Sun's orbit. Given the\nuncertainties in the Galaxy model and the Sun's current phase space\ncoordinates, as well as the errors in the geological data, it is not possible\nto draw a clear connection between terrestrial extinction and the solar motion.\nIn a separate study, I find that the solar motion, which modulates the Galactic\ntidal forces imposed on Oort cloud comets, does not significantly influence\nthis cratering rate. My dynamical models, together with the solar apex motion,\ncan explain the anisotropic perihelia of long period comets without needing to\ninvoke the existence of a Jupiter-mass solar companion. Finally, I find that\nvariations in the Earth's obliquity play a dominant role in triggering\nterrestrial deglaciations over the past 2 Myr.

Fluid-body\ninteraction is handled using Peskin's IB method; however, unlike existing IB\napproaches to such problems, we do not rely on penalty or fractional-step\nformulations. Instead, we use an unsplit scheme that ensures the no-slip\nconstraint is enforced exactly in terms of the Lagrangian velocity field\nevaluated at the IB markers. Fractional-step approaches, by contrast, can\nimpose such constraints only approximately. Imposing these constraints exactly\nrequires the solution of a large linear system that includes the fluid velocity\nand pressure as well as Lagrange multiplier forces that impose the motion of\nthe body. To solve this system efficiently, we develop a preconditioner for the\nconstrained IB formulation that is based on an analytical approximation to the\nSchur complement. This approach is enabled by the near translational and\nrotational invariance of Peskin's IB method. We demonstrate that only a few\ncycles of a geometric multigrid method for the fluid equations are required in\neach application of the preconditioner, and we demonstrate robust convergence\nof the overall Krylov solver despite the approximations made in the\npreconditioner.

The unprecedented\nprecision and dense kinematic coverage of these data can aid in future\nextractions of polarized parton distributions, tests of perturbative QCD\npredictions for the quark polarization at large $x$, a better understanding of\nquark-hadron duality, and more precise values for higher-twist matrix elements\nin the framework of the Operator Product Expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 22:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 14:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

We define the sum of $k$\nneighbours' similarity as the accuracy metric alpha, the number of user\npartitions, across which we select the $k$ neighbours, as the security metric\nbeta. We generalise the $k$ Nearest Neighbour attack to beta k Nearest\nNeighbours attack. Differing from the existing approach that selects neighbours\nacross the entire candidate list randomly, our method selects neighbours from\neach exclusive partition of size $k$ with a decreasing probability. Theoretical\nand experimental analysis show that to provide an accuracy-assured\nrecommendation, our Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection method yields\na better trade-off between the recommendation accuracy and system security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 01:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 08:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 01:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

Verbal comprehension questions appear very\nfrequently in IQ tests, which measure human's verbal ability including the\nunderstanding of the words with multiple senses, the synonyms and antonyms, and\nthe analogies among words. In this work, we explore whether such tests can be\nsolved automatically by artificial intelligence technologies, especially the\ndeep learning technologies that are recently developed and successfully applied\nin a number of fields. However, we found that the task was quite challenging,\nand simply applying existing technologies (e.g., word embedding) could not\nachieve a good performance, mainly due to the multiple senses of words and the\ncomplex relations among words. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework consisting of three components. First, we build a classifier to\nrecognize the specific type of a verbal question (e.g., analogy,\nclassification, synonym, or antonym). Second, we obtain distributed\nrepresentations of words and relations by leveraging a novel word embedding\nmethod that considers the multi-sense nature of words and the relational\nknowledge among words (or their senses) contained in dictionaries. Third, for\neach type of questions, we propose a specific solver based on the obtained\ndistributed word representations and relation representations.

In a previous paper, we demonstrated that flybys --\nan interaction where two independent halos inter-penetrate but detach at a\nlater time and do not merge -- occur much more frequently than previously\nbelieved. In particular, we found that the frequency of flybys increases at low\nredshift and is comparable to or even greater than the frequency of mergers for\nhalos $\\gtrsim 10^{11} M_\\odot/h$. In this paper, we classify flybys according\nto their orbits and the level of perturbation exacted on both the halos\ninvolved.

The typical flyby mass-ratio is $\\sim 0.1$ at high $z$\nfor all halos, while at low $z$, massive primary halos undergo flybys with\nsmall secondary halos. We estimate the perturbation from the flyby on both the\nprimary and the secondary and find that a typical flyby is mostly\nnon-perturbative for the primary halo. However, since a massive primary\nexperiences so many flybys at any given time, they are nearly continually a\nvictim of a perturbative event.

This is a challenging problem due to the large\ndiscrepancy between online shopping images, usually taken in ideal\nlighting/pose/background conditions, and user photos captured in uncontrolled\nconditions. To address this problem, we propose a Dual Attribute-aware Ranking\nNetwork (DARN) for retrieval feature learning. More specifically, DARN consists\nof two sub-networks, one for each domain, whose retrieval feature\nrepresentations are driven by semantic attribute learning. We show that this\nattribute-guided learning is a key factor for retrieval accuracy improvement.\nIn addition, to further align with the nature of the retrieval problem, we\nimpose a triplet visual similarity constraint for learning to rank across the\ntwo sub-networks. Another contribution of our work is a large-scale dataset\nwhich makes the network learning feasible.

While the solar array efficiency degraded\nirreversibly down to ~77% of its original level over roughly 1 1/2 solar\ncycles, Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in the solid state recorder (SSR) have been\nreversed by the memory protection mechanism. We compare the daily CRF observed\nby the Oulu station with the daily SOHO SEU rate and with the Degradation curve\nof the solar arrays. The Oulu CRF and the SOHO SSR SEU rate are both modulated\nby the solar cycle and are highly correlated, except for sharp spikes in the\nSEU rate, caused by isolated SEP events, which also show up as discontinuities\nin the otherwise slowly decreasing solar ray efficiency. This allows to\ndiscriminate between effects with solar and non-solar origin and to compare the\nrelative strength of both. We find that during solar cycle 23 (1996 Apr 1 --\n2008 Aug 31) only 6% of the total number of SSR SEUs were caused by SEPs; the\nremaining 94% were due to galactic cosmic rays. During the maximum period of\ncycle 23 (2000 Jan 1 -- 2003 Dec 31), the SEP contribution increased to 22%,\nand during 2001, the year with the highest SEP rate, to 30%. About 40% of the\ntotal solar array degradation during the 17 years from Jan 1996 through Feb\n2013 can be attributed to proton events, i.e. the effect of a series of\nshort-lived, violent SEP events is comparable to the cycle-integrated damage by\ncosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 07:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

Obtaining information on the region at the base of a jet can\nshed light into the subject and some years ago this has been done through a\nsearch for a rotational signature at the jet line spectrum. The existence of\nsuch signatures, however, remains controversial. In order to contribute to the\nclarification of this issue, in this paper we show that the Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) can potentially help to distinguish between rotation and\nprecession effects in protostellar jet images. We apply the PCA to synthetic\nspectro-imaging datacubes generated as an output of numerical simulations of\nprotostellar jets. In this way we generate a benchmark to which a PCA\ndiagnostics of real observations can be confronted. Using the computed emission\nline profiles for [O I]6300A and [S II]6716A, we recover and analyze the\neffects of rotation and precession in tomograms generated by PCA. We show that\ndifferent combinations of the eigenvectors can be used to enhance and to\nidentify the rotation features present in the data. Our results indicate that\nthe PCA can be useful for disentangling rotation from precession in jets with\nan inclination of the jet with respect to the plane of the sky as high as 45\ndegrees. We have been able to recover the initially imposed rotation jet\nprofile for models at moderate inclination angle (< 15 degrees) and without\nprecession (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 09:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

Therefore, 2D materials with\nfinite band gap, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, e.g. MoS2\nWSe2) or phosphorene, are required for the low power consumption FETs.

A complete determination of\nthe key parameters of superdiffusive transport comprises the power-law index,\nthe superdiffusion coefficient, the related transition scale at which the\nenergetic particle profiles turn to decay as power laws, and the energy\nspectral index of the shock accelerated particles. Assuming large-scale spatial\nhomogeneity of the background plasma, the power-law behaviour can been derived\nfrom both a (microscopic) propagator formalism and a (macroscopic) fractional\ntransport equation.

A previously proposed generalized kinetic energy density is\nutilized to implement mGGAs in the framework of Kohn--Sham current\ndensity-functional theory (KS-CDFT). A unique feature of the non-perturbative\nimplementation of these functionals is the ability to seamlessly explore a wide\nrange of magnetic fields up to 1 a.u. ($\\sim 235000$T) in strength. CDFT\nfunctionals based on the TPSS and B98 forms are investigated and their\nperformance is assessed by comparison with accurate CCSD(T) data. In the weak\nfield regime magnetic properties such as magnetizabilities and NMR shielding\nconstants show modest but systematic improvements over GGA functionals.\nHowever, in strong field regime the mGGA based forms lead to a significantly\nimproved description of the recently proposed perpendicular paramagnetic\nbonding mechanism, comparing well with CCSD(T) data. In contrast to functionals\nbased on the vorticity these forms are found to be numerically stable and their\naccuracy at high field suggests the extension of mGGAs to CDFT via the\ngeneralized kinetic energy density should provide a useful starting point for\nfurther development of CDFT approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 10:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

The underlying microscopic model comprises local\nexchange interactions between the electron spin and magnetic moment and the\nlocal couplings between the electronic charge and lattice displacements. An\neffective action for the spin and lattice variables is constructed in which the\ninteractions among the spin and lattice components are determined by the\nunderlying electronic structure. In this way, expressions are obtained for the\nelectronically mediated couplings between the spin and lattice degrees of\nfreedom, besides the well known inter-atomic force constants and spin-spin\ninteractions. These former susceptibilities provide an atomistic ab initio\ndescription for the coupled spin and lattice dynamics. It is important to\nnotice that this theory is strictly bilinear in the spin and lattice variables\nand provides a minimal model for the coupled dynamics of these subsystems and\nthat the two subsystems are treated on the same footing.

As a result, the root of the tree cannot be inferred as part of\nthe analysis because the likelihood of the data does not depend on the position\nof the root. Yet defining the root of a phylogenetic tree is a key component of\nphylogenetic inference because it provides a point of reference for polarising\nancestor/descendant relationships and therefore interpreting the tree. In this\npaper we investigate the effect of relaxing the reversibility assumption and\nallowing the position of the root to be another unknown in the model. We\npropose two hierarchical models that are centred on a reversible model but\nperturbed to allow non-reversibility. The models differ in the degree of\nstructure imposed on the perturbations. The analysis is performed in the\nBayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the\nperformance of the two non-reversible models in analyses of simulated data sets\nusing two types of topological priors. We then apply the models to a real\nbiological data set, the radiation of polyploid yeasts, for which there is a\nrobust biological opinion about the root position. Finally we apply the models\nto a second biological data set for which the rooted tree is controversial: the\nribosomal tree of life. We compare the two non-reversible models and conclude\nthat both are useful in inferring the position of the root from real biological\ndata sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 12:11:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 11:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Its spectrum is very\nrich in emission lines, including many metallic lines. It has been also\nproposed to have a close companion. We use the metallic emission lines to study\nthe accretion structures and to test the companion hypothesis. We analyse 54\nspectra taken in 5 years of quiescence time. We study the line profile\nvariability and the radial velocity of the metallic emission lines. We use the\nvelocity signatures of different species with various excitation conditions and\ntheir time dependency to track the dynamics associated to accretion. We observe\nperiodic velocity variations in the line components consistent with rotational\nmodulation. The modulation is stronger for lines with higher excitation\npotentials. We propose that the narrow line components are produced in the\npost-shock region, while the broad components originate in the more extended,\npre-shock material. All the emission lines suffer velocity modulation due to\nthe rotation of the star. The broad components are responsible for the\nline-dependent veiling observed in EX Lupi. Rotationally-modulated\nline-dependent veiling can explain the radial velocity signatures, making the\nclose-in companion hypothesis unnecessary. The accretion structure is locked to\nthe star and very stable during the 5 years of observations. Not all stars with\nsimilar spectral types and accretion rates show the same metallic emission\nlines, maybe related to differences in temperature and density in their\naccretion structure(s). The contamination of photospheric lines by accretion\nprocesses can be turned into a very useful tool to determine the innermost\ndetails of the accretion channels in the proximities of the star. Emission\nlines from very stable accretion columns will nevertheless be a very strong\nlimitation for the detection of companions by radial velocity in young stars.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 12:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

The realisation of\nthree-dimensional (3D) nanostructures by etching requires technologies beyond\nplanar masks. We present a method to fabricate a 3D mask that allows to etch\nthree-dimensional monolithic nanostructures by using only CMOS-compatible\nprocesses. The mask is written in a hard-mask layer that is deposited on two\nadjacent inclined surfaces of a Si wafer. By projecting in single step two\ndifferent 2D patterns within one 3D mask on the two inclined surfaces, the\nmutual alignment between the patterns is ensured. Thereby after the mask\npattern is defined, the etching of deep pores in two oblique directions yields\na three-dimensional structure in Si. As a proof of concept we demonstrate 3D\nmask fabrication for three-dimensional diamond-like photonic band gap crystals\nin silicon. The fabricated crystals reveal a broad stop gap in optical\nreflectivity measurements. We propose how 3D nanostructures with five different\nBravais lattices can be realised, namely cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic,\nmonoclinic, and hexagonal, and demonstrate a mask for a 3D hexagonal crystal.\nWe also demonstrate the mask for a diamond-structure crystal with a 3D array of\ncavities. In general, the 2D patterns for the different surfaces can be\ncompletely independent and still be in perfect mutual alignment. Indeed, we\nobserve an alignment accuracy of better than 3.0 nm between the 2D mask\npatterns on the inclined surfaces, which permits one to etch well-defined\nmonolithic 3D nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 13:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 13:35:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 09:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

This is particularly the case when large parallel processing\nfacilities are available. These facilities could be computational or physical\nfacets of the process being optimized. E.g. in biological experiments many\nexperimental set ups allow several samples to be simultaneously processed.\nBatch methods, however, require modeling of the interaction between the\nevaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios.

Within this call, a mission concept called\neLISA has been proposed. This observatory has a current initial configuration\nconsisting of 4 laser links between the three satellites, which are separated\nby a distance of one million kilometers, constructing a single channel\nMichelson interferometer. However, the final configuration for the observatory\nwill not be fixed until the end of this decade. With this in mind, we\ninvestigate the effect of different eLISA-like configurations on massive black\nhole detections. This work compares the results of a Bayesian inference study\nof 120 massive black hole binaries out to a redshift of $z\\sim13$ for a $10^6$m\narm-length eLISA with four and six links, as well as a $2\\times10^6$m\narm-length observatory with four links. We demonstrate that the original eLISA\nconfiguration should allow us to recover the luminosity distance of the source\nwith an error of less than 10% out to a redshift of $z\\sim4$, and a sky error\nbox of $\\leq10^2\\,deg^2$ out to $z\\sim0.1$. In contrast, both alternative\nconfigurations suggest that we should be able to conduct the same parameter\nrecovery with errors of less than 10% in luminosity distance out to $z\\sim12$\nand $\\leq10^2\\,deg^2$ out to $z\\sim0.4$. Using the information from these\nstudies, we also infer that if we were able to construct a 2Gm, 6-link\ndetector, the above values would shift to $z\\sim20$ for luminosity distance and\n$z\\sim0.9$ for sky error. While the final configuration will also be dependent\non both technological and financial considerations, our study suggests that\nincreasing the size of a two arm detector is a viable alternative to the\ninclusion of a third arm in a smaller detector. More importantly, this work\nfurther suggests no clear scientific loss between either choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 14:26:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-09"}

After being essentially flat at the earliest epochs of\ndisk formation, the radial gradients steepen as age decreases, reaching a\nmaxima (steepest) at age 7-8 Gyr, and then they flatten again. Similar temporal\ntrends are also found for the vertical gradients. We infer that the assemblage\nof the Milky Way disk may have experienced at least two distinct phases. The\nearlier phase is probably related to a slow, pressure-supported collapse of\ngas, when the gas settles down to the disk mainly in the vertical direction. In\nthe later phase, there are significant radial flows of gas in the disk, and the\nrate of gas inflow near the solar neighborhood reaches a maximum around a\nlookback time of 7-8 Gyr. The transition of the two phases occurs around a\nlookback time between 8 and 11 Gyr. The two phases may be responsible for the\nformation of the Milky Way thick and thin disks, respectively.

In this\npaper, we study the convergence of GMRES for such systems by deriving inclusion\nand exclusion regions for the pseudospectrum of the coefficient matrix. All\nanalysis is done a priori by relating the properties of the weak problem to the\ncoefficient matrix.

Systems\nconfigured in small-world networks spread information more easily than in\nrandom or regular lattice-type networks. Whilst it is a known fact that\nsmall-world networks have short average path length and high clustering\ncoefficient in self-organising systems, the ego centralities that maintain the\ncohesiveness of small-world network have not been formally defined. Here we\nshow that instantaneous events such as the release of news items via Twitter,\ncoupled with active community arguments related to the news item form a\nparticular type of small-world network. Analysis of the centralities in the\nnetwork reveals that community arguments maintain the small-world network\nwhilst actively maintaining the cohesiveness and boundary of the group. The\nresults demonstrate how an active Twitter community unconsciously forms a\nsmall-world network whilst interacting locally with a bordering community. Over\ntime, such local interactions brought about the global emergence of the\nsmall-world network, connecting media channels with human activities.\nUnderstanding the small-world phenomenon in relation to online social or civic\nmovement is important, as evident in the spate of online activists that tipped\nthe power of governments for the better or worst in recent times. The support,\nor removal of high centrality nodes in such networks has important\nramifications in the self-expression of society and civic discourses. The\npresentation in this article anticipates further exploration of man-made\nself-organising systems where a larger cluster of ad-hoc and active community\nmaintains the overall cohesiveness of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 02:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}
