This\narticle highlights some recent developments concerning this issue for the so\ncalled Reduced Basis Method (RBM) for models based on parameter dependent\nfamilies of PDEs. In this context the key task is to sample the {\\em solution\nmanifold} at judiciously chosen parameter values usually determined in a {\\em\ngreedy fashion}. The corresponding {\\em space growth} concepts are closely\nrelated to so called {\\em weak greedy} algorithms in Hilbert and Banach spaces\nwhich can be shown to give rise to convergence rates comparable to the best\npossible rates, namely the {\\em Kolmogorov $n$-widths} rates. Such algorithms\ncan be interpreted as {\\em adaptive sampling} strategies for approximating\ncompact sets in Hilbert spaces. We briefly discuss the results most relevant\nfor the present RBM context. The applicability of the results for weak greedy\nalgorithms has however been confined so far essentially to well-conditioned\ncoercive problems. A critical issue is therefore an extension of these concepts\nto a wider range of problem classes for which the conventional methods do not\nwork well. A second main topic of this article is therefore to outline recent\ndevelopments of RBMs that do realize $n$-width rates for a much wider class of\nvariational problems covering indefinite or singularly perturbed unsymmetric\nproblems. A key element in this context is the design of {\\em well-conditioned\nvariational formulations} and their numerical treatment via saddle point\nformulations.

The method takes advantage of the different distributions\nalong the line of sight (LOS) of total (tB) and polarized (pB) brightnesses to\nestimate the average location of the emitting plasma. To this end, we assumed\ntwo simple electron density distributions along the LOS (a constant density and\nGaussian density profiles) for a plasma blob and synthesized the expected tB\nand pB for different distances $z$ of the blob from the plane of the sky (POS)\nand different projected altitudes $\\rho$. Reconstructed locations of the blob\nalong the LOS were thus compared with the real ones, allowing a precise\ndetermination of uncertainties in the method. Independently of the analytical\ndensity profile, when the blob is centered at a small distance from the POS\n(i.e. for limb CMEs) the distance from the POS starts to be significantly\noverestimated. Polarization ratio technique provides the LOS position of the\ncenter of mass of what we call folded density distribution, given by reflecting\nand summing in front of the POS the fraction of density profile located behind\nthat plane. On the other hand, when the blob is far from the POS, but with very\nsmall projected altitudes (i.e. for halo CMEs, $\\rho < 1.4$ R$_\\odot$), the\ninferred distance from that plane is significantly underestimated. Better\ndetermination of the real blob position along the LOS is given for intermediate\nlocations, and in particular when the blob is centered at an angle of\n$20^\\circ$ from the POS. These result have important consequences not only for\nfuture 3D reconstruction of CMEs with polarization ratio technique, but also\nfor the design of future coronagraphs aimed at providing a continuous\nmonitoring of halo-CMEs for space weather prediction purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 17:29:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

We performed x-ray powder diffraction measurements up to 31.5 GPa\nand ab initio calculations. Experiments were carried out on different\npolymorphs; trigonal (phase I) and monoclinic (phases II and III). Phases I and\nIII, at low pressure (0.2-0.8 GPa), transform into phase II, which has a\nmonazite-type structure. At room temperature, this polymorph is stable up to\n31.5 GPa. Calculations support these findings and predict the occurrence of an\nadditional transition from the monoclinic monazite-type to a tetragonal\nscheelite-type structure (phase IV). This transition was experimentally found\nafter the simultaneous application of pressure (28 GPa) and temperature (1500\nK), suggesting that at room temperature the transition might by hindered by\nkinetic barriers. Calculations also predict an additional phase transition at\n52 GPa, which exceeds the maximum pressure achieved in the experiments. This\ntransition is from phase IV to an orthorhombic barite-type structure (phase V).\nWe also studied the axial and bulk compressibility of BiPO4. Room-temperature\npressure-volume equations of state are reported. BiPO4 was found to be more\ncompressible than isomorphic rare-earth phosphates. The discovered phase IV was\ndetermined to be the less compressible polymorph of BiPO4. On the other hand,\nthe theoretically predicted phase V has a bulk modulus comparable with that of\nmonazite-type BiPO4. Finally, the isothermal compressibility tensor for the\nmonazite-type structure is reported at 2.4 GPa showing that the direction of\nmaximum compressibility is in the (010) plane at approximately 15 (21) degrees\nto the a axis for the case of our experimental (theoretical) study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 17:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-12"}

This\nis achieved by a theorem connecting computations on a kind of randomized\ndecision trees and sampling based algorithms. This approach is surprisingly\npowerful, and applicable to several models of computation previously studied.\n  As a first illustration we show how all the results of Evans and Pippenger\n(SIAM J.

This result considerably simplifies and strengthens\nan earlier result of Dutta, Kanoria Manjunath and Radhakrishnan (SODA 08) that\nsuch networks cannot compute the parity function reliably with significantly\nfewer than $N\\log \\log N$ transmissions. The lower bound for parity shown\nearlier made use of special properties of the parity function and is\ninapplicable, e.g., to the majority function. In this paper, we use our\napproach to develop an interesting connection between computation of boolean\nfunctions on noisy networks that make few transmissionss, and algorithms that\nwork by sampling only a part of the input.

A single point\nevaluation of the kernel density estimator, for example, requires a computation\ntime linear in the training sample size. To address this challenge, we present\na method to efficiently construct a sparse approximation of a kernel mean. We\ndo so by first establishing an incoherence-based bound on the approximation\nerror, and then noticing that, for the case of radial kernels, the bound can be\nminimized by solving the $k$-center problem. The outcome is a linear time\nconstruction of a sparse kernel mean, which also lends itself naturally to an\nautomatic sparsity selection scheme.

We assume\nthat the buyer valuations for the items they desire have a nice (although\nreasonable) structure, i.e., that the aggregate buyer demand has a monotone\nhazard rate and that the values of every buyer type come from the same support.\n  For such large markets, our main contribution is a 1.88 approximation\nalgorithm for maximizing revenue, showing that good pricing schemes can be\ncomputed when the number of buyers is large. We also give a (e,2)-bicriteria\nalgorithm that simultaneously approximates both maximum revenue and welfare,\nthus showing that it is possible to obtain both good revenue and welfare at the\nsame time. We further generalize our results by relaxing some of our\nassumptions, and quantify the necessary tradeoffs between revenue and welfare\nin our setting.

These have been observed by satellites such as\nCOBE, WMAP, and PLANCK, and by bolometric instruments placed near the South\nPole by the BICEP collaborations. The expected temperature anisotropies are\nwell-confirmed. The B-mode polarization patterns in the CMB are currently under\nmeasurement jointly by the PLANCK and BICEP groups to determine the extent to\nwhich the B-modes can be attributed to gravitational waves from the creation of\ngravitons in the earliest universe. It was during 1962 that I proved that\nquanta of the minimally-coupled scalar field were created by the general\nexpanding FLRW universe. This was relevant also to the creation of quantized\nperturbations of the gravitational field, since these perturbations satisfied\nlinear field equations that could be quantized in the same way as the\nminimally-coupled scalar field equation. In fact, in 1946, E.M. Lifshitz had\nconsidered the classical Einstein gravitational field in FLRW expanding\nuniverses and had shown that the classical linearized Einstein field equations\nreduced, in what is now known as the Lifshitz gauge, to two separate classical\nminimally-coupled massless scalar field equations. These field equations of\nLifshitz, when quantized, correspond to the field equations for massless\ngravitons, one equation for each of the two independent polarization components\nof the spin-2 massless graviton.

In\nthis article we use Monadic Second Order logic (MSOL) to give alternative,\ncompact proofs of fixed parameter tractability for several well-known\nincongruency measures. In doing so we wish to demonstrate the considerable\npotential of MSOL - machinery still largely unknown outside the algorithmic\ngraph theory community - within phylogenetics.

It is\nthis bound on treewidth that makes the machinery of MSOL available for proving\nfixed parameter tractability. We give a variety of different MSOL formulations.\nSome are based on explicitly encoding agreement forests, while some only use\nthem implicitly to generate the treewidth bound.

Although atomic and molecular level consideration is a key\ningredient in experimental design and fabrication of nanfluidic systems, atomic\nand molecular modeling of nanofluidics is rare and most simulations at\nnanoscale are restricted to one- or two-dimensions in the literature, to our\nbest knowledge. The present work introduces atomic scale design and\nthree-dimensional (3D) simulation of ionic diffusive nanofluidic systems.

ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic\nd-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition temperature (Tc)\ncuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave\nsuperconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous\ngap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy.

In cold cores and in\nthe outer regions of protoplanetary disks, gas-phase water comes from\nphotodesorption of water ice. We present fitting formulae for implementation in\nastrochemical models using photodesorption efficiencies for all water ice\nisotopologues obtained using classical molecular dynamics simulations. We\ninvestigate if the gas-phase HDO/H2O ratio reflects that present in the ice or\nwhether fractionation can occur during photodesorption. Probabilities for the\ntop four monolayers are presented for photodesorption of X (X=H,D) atoms, OX\nradicals, and X2O and HDO molecules following photodissociation of H2O, D2O,\nand HDO in H2O amorphous ice at temperatures from 10-100 K. Isotope effects are\nfound for all products: (1) H atom photodesorption probabilities from H2O ice\nare larger than those for D atom photodesorption from D2O ice by a factor of\n1.1; the ratio of H and D photodesorbed upon HDO photodissociation is a factor\nof 2. This process will enrich the ice in deuterium atoms over time; (2) the\nOD/OH photodesorption ratio upon D2O and H2O photodissociation is on average a\nfactor of 2, but the ratio upon HDO photodissociation is almost constant at\nunity for all temperatures; (3) D atoms are more effective in kicking out\nneighbouring water molecules than H atoms. However, the ratio of the\nphotodesorbed HDO and H2O molecules is equal to the HDO/H2O ratio in the ice,\ntherefore, there is no isotope fractionation upon HDO and H2O photodesorption.\nNevertheless, the enrichment of the ice in D atoms due to photodesorption can\nover time lead to an enhanced HDO/H2O ratio in the ice, and, when\nphotodesorbed, also in the gas. The extent to which the ortho/para ratio of H2O\ncan be modified by the photodesorption process is also discussed.

Here we focus on investigating main properties of its\nstar-formation history (SFH) by constructing a simple evolution model, which\nassumes that the disc builds up gradually by cold gas infall and the gas infall\nrate can be parameterizedly described by a Gaussian form. By comparing model\npredictions with the observed data, we discuss the probable range for free\nparameter in the model and then know more about the main properties of the\nevolution and SFH of M51a. We find that the model predictions are very\nsensitive to the free parameter and the model adopting a constant infall-peak\ntime $t_{\\rm p}\\,=\\,7.0{\\rm Gyr}$ can reproduce most of the observed\nconstraints of M51a. Although our model does not assume the gas infall\ntime-scale of the inner disc is shorter than that of the outer disc, our model\npredictions still show that the disc of M51a forms inside-out.

Our interest arises from\nthe observation that if inter-patient variations in OAR and tumor sensitivities\nto radiation or sparing factor of the OAR are not accounted for during\nradiation scheduling, the performance of the therapy may be strongly degraded\nor the OAR may receive a substantially larger dose than the maximum threshold.\nThis paper proposes two radiation scheduling concepts to incorporate\ninter-patient variability into the scheduling optimization problem. The first\napproach is a robust formulation that formulates the problem as a conservative\nmodel that optimizes the worst case dose scheduling that may occur. The second\nmethod is a probabilistic approach, where the model parameters are given by a\nset of random variables. This formulation insures that our constraints are\nsatisfied with a given probability, and that our objective function achieves a\ndesired level with a stated probability. We used a transformation to reduce the\nresulting optimization problem to two dimensions. We showed that the optimal\nsolution lies on the boundary of the feasible region and we used a branch and\nbound algorithm to find the global optimal solution. We observed that if the\nnumber of fractions in the optimal conventional schedule is the same as the\nrobust and stochastic solutions, it is preferable to administer equal or\nsmaller total dose. In addition if there exist more (fewer) treatment sessions\nin the probabilistic or robust solution compared to the conventional schedule,\na reduction in total dose squared (total dose) will be expected. Finally, we\nperformed numerical experiments in the setting of head-and-neck tumors to\nreveal the effect of parameter uncertainty on optimal schedules and to evaluate\nthe sensitivity of the model to the choice of key model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 03:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 21:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

We introduce two new mechanisms for\ncontrolling the McMillan degree of the final approximant, one based on\nalternating least-squares minimization and one based on ancillary\nsystem-theoretic reduction methods.

This learning problem arises in\nmany areas ranging from the natural sciences to the social sciences, and has\nalso found many machine learning applications. Unfortunately, learning mixture\nof Gaussians is an information theoretically hard problem: in order to learn\nthe parameters up to a reasonable accuracy, the number of samples required is\nexponential in the number of Gaussian components in the worst case.

We study such alignment processes by explicitly taking into account the\nfinite sizes of accretion disks and the episodic lifetimes of AGNs that\ndelineate the duration of gas fueling onto accretion disks.

In this scheme,\nthe received intermediate frequency (IF) signals are expressed as a linear\ncombination of time-delayed and scaled replicas of the transmitted waveforms.\nFor sparse IF signals on discrete grids of time-delay space, the QuadCS can\nefficiently reconstruct the I/Q components from sub-Nyquist samples. In\npractice, the signals are characterized by a set of unknown time-delay\nparameters in a continuous space. Then conventional sparse signal\nreconstruction will deteriorate the QuadCS reconstruction performance. This\npaper focuses on the reconstruction of the I/Q components with continuous delay\nparameters. A parametric spectrum-matched dictionary is defined, which sparsely\ndescribes the IF signals in the frequency domain by delay parameters and gain\ncoefficients, and the QuadCS system is reexamined under the new dictionary.\nWith the inherent structure of the QuadCS system, it is found that the\nestimation of delay parameters can be decoupled from that of sparse gain\ncoefficients, yielding a beamspace direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation\nformulation with a time-varying beamforming matrix. Then an interpolated\nbeamspace DOA method is developed to perform the DOA estimation. An optimal\ninterpolated array is established and sufficient conditions to guarantee the\nsuccessful estimation of the delay parameters are derived. With the estimated\ndelays, the gain coefficients can be conveniently determined by solving a\nlinear least-squares problem.

Here we analyze the multi-wavelength data of the particularly\nwell-observed SN 2006aj, associated with llgrb 060218, finding that its\nprogenitor star is sheathed in an extended ($>100R_\\odot$), low-mass ($\\sim\n0.01M_\\odot$) envelope.

The same engine, which launches a relativistic jet, can drive the two\nexplosions, but, while in LGRBs the ultra-relativistic jet emerges from the\nbare progenitor star and produces the observed gamma-rays, in llgrbs the\nextended envelope smothers the jet and prevents the generation of a large\ngamma-ray luminosity. Instead, the jet deposits all its energy in the envelope,\ndriving a mildly relativistic shock that upon breakout produces a llgrb. In\naddition for giving a unified view of the two phenomena, this model provides a\nnatural explanation to many observed properties of llgrbs.

Additionally, the approximation makes it possible\nto analyze surprise more closely and compare it to other methods, especially\nmodularity. We show that surprise is (nearly) unaffected by the well known\nresolution limit, a particular problem for modularity. However, surprise may\ntend to overestimate the number of communities, whereas they may be\nunderestimated by modularity. In short, surprise works well in the limit of\nmany small communities, whereas modularity works better in the limit of few\nlarge communities. In this sense, surprise is more discriminative than\nmodularity, and may find communities where modularity fails to discern any\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 09:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 09:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-10"}

We consider decentralized routing\nscheme where only the weak ties from the activated nodes are revealed. We study\nthe routing time of complex contagion and compare the result with simple\nrouting and complex diffusion (the diffusion of complex contagion, where all\nnodes that could be activated are activated immediately in the same step with\nthe goal of activating all nodes in the end).\n  We show that for decentralized complex routing, the routing time is lower\nbounded by a polynomial in $n$ (the number of nodes in the network) for all\nrange of $\\alpha$ both in expectation and with high probability (in particular,\n$\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+2}})$ for $\\alpha \\le 2$ and\n$\\Omega(n^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2(\\alpha+2)}})$ for $\\alpha > 2$ in expectation),\nwhile the routing time of simple contagion has polylogarithmic upper bound when\n$\\alpha = 2$.

However, Ethernet is usually used together with TCP/IP protocol\nstack, which makes it difficult to be implemented because designers have to use\noperating system to process this protocol. Furthermore, TCP/IP protocol\ndegrades the transmission efficiency and real-time performance. To maximize the\nperformance of Ethernet in physics experiment applications, a data readout\nmethod based on physical layer (PHY) is proposed in this paper. In this method,\nTCP/IP protocol is forsaken and replaced with a customized and simple protocol,\nwhich make it easier to be implemented. On each readout module, data from\nfront-end electronics is first fed into an FPGA for protocol processing and\nthen sent out to a PHY chip controlled by this FPGA for transmission. This kind\nof data path is fully implemented by hardware. While from the side of data\nacquisition system (DAQ), absence of standard protocol makes the network\nrelated applications panic. To solve this problem, in the operating system\nkernel space, data received by network interface card is drawn away from the\ntraditional flow and redirected to a specified memory space by a customized\nprogram. This memory space can be easily accessed by applications in user\nspace. For the purpose of verification, a prototype system is designed and\nimplemented.

In effect this means that a growth of one\npopulation, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of\nothers. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change\nincrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we\npropose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe\ncollapses of the entire population of a single species freeing up resources for\nthe remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of\nbacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading\nbacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an\nimportant role.\n  The emergent dynamics of our system is cyclic \"diversity waves\" triggered by\ncollapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at\nthe beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species\nabundances are characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the\nlower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced\nspecies, while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the\ncurrent wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several\nsmaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term\nmemory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of\nthe time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7.\nWe show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in\nthe rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments,\nspecies-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 14:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 18:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Remarkably, the largest improvement in\nperformance with respect to the other methods employed is found in the case of\nbenchmarks with meshes, where the validity hypothesis behind message-passing is\nexpected to worsen. In these cases, even though the exact message-passing\nequations do not converge, by introducing a reinforcement parameter to force\nconvergence towards a sub optimal solution, we were able to always outperform\nthe other algorithms with a peak of 27% performance improvement in terms of\naccommodated paths. On random graphs, we numerically observe two separated\nregimes: one in which all paths can be accommodated and one in which this is\nnot possible. We also investigate the behaviour of both the number of paths to\nbe accommodated and their minimum total length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 14:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

Furthermore, anisotropic colloids with attractive patches\ncan self-assemble into open lattices and colloidal equivalents of molecules and\nmicelles. However, model systems that combine mutual attraction, anisotropy,\nand deformability have---to the best of our knowledge---not been realized.\nHere, we synthesize colloidal particles that combine these three\ncharacteristics and obtain self-assembled microcapsules.

In particular, we\nclarify that for certain problems \\textsc{Arepo} only reaches first-order\nconvergence for its original formulation. This can be rectified by simple\nmodifications we propose to the time integration scheme and the spatial\ngradient estimates of the code, both improving the accuracy of the code. We\ndemonstrate that the new implementation is indeed second-order accurate under\nthe $L^1$ norm, and in particular substantially improves conservation of\nangular momentum. Interestingly, whereas these improvements can significantly\nchange the results of smooth test problems, we also find that cosmological\nsimulations of galaxy formation are unaffected, demonstrating that the\nnumerical errors eliminated by the new formulation do not impact these\nsimulations. In contrast, simulations of binary stars followed over a large\nnumber of orbital times are strongly affected, as here it is particularly\ncrucial to avoid a long-term build up of errors in angular momentum\nconservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 15:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 12:07:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

A\nparticular question is whether gravity causes decoherence - an unavoidable\nsource of noise. Several models for gravitational decoherence have been\nproposed, not all of which can be described quantum mechanically. In parallel,\nseveral experiments have been proposed to test some of these models, where the\ndata obtained by such experiments is analyzed assuming quantum mechanics. Since\nwe may need to modify quantum mechanics to account for gravity, however, one\nmay question the validity of using quantum mechanics as a calculational tool to\ndraw conclusions from experiments concerning gravity.\n  Here we propose an experiment to estimate gravitational decoherence whose\nconclusions hold even if quantum mechanics would need to be modified. We first\nestablish a general information-theoretic notion of decoherence which reduces\nto the standard measure within quantum mechanics. Second, drawing on ideas from\nquantum information, we propose a very general experiment that allows us to\nobtain a quantitative estimate of decoherence of any physical process for any\nphysical theory satisfying only very mild conditions.Finally, we propose a\nconcrete experiment using optomechanics to estimate gravitational decoherence\nin any such theory, including quantum mechanics as a special case.\n  Our work raises the interesting question whether other properties of nature\ncould similarly be established from experimental observations alone - that is,\nwithout already having a rather well formed theory of nature like quantum\nmechanics to make sense of experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 15:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

However, its standard\nformulation is referred to the statistical ensemble of its possible\ntrajectories. The statistical ensemble is introduced in order to establish the\nexact correspondence (the Born's rule) between the probability density on the\nspatial configurations and the quantum distribution, that is the squared\nmodulus of the wave-function. In this work we explore the possibility of using\nthe pilot wave theory at the level of a single Bohm's trajectory. The pilot\nwave theory allows a formally self-consistent representation of quantum systems\nas a single Bohm's trajectory, but in this case there is no room for the Born's\nrule at least in its standard form. We will show that a correspondence exists\nbetween the statistical distribution of configurations along the single Bohm's\ntrajectory and the quantum distribution for a subsystem interacting with the\nenvironment in a multicomponent system. To this aim, we present the numerical\nresults of the single Bohm's trajectory description of the model system of six\nconfined rotors with random interactions. We find a rather close correspondence\nbetween the coordinate distribution of one rotor along its trajectory and the\ntime averaged marginal quantum distribution for the same rotor. This might be\nconsidered as the counterpart of the standard Born's rule. Furthermore a\nstrongly fluctuating behavior with a fast loss of correlation is found for the\nevolution of each rotor coordinate. This suggests that a Markov process might\nwell approximate the evolution of the Bohm's coordinate of a single rotor and\nit is shown that the correspondence between coordinate distribution and quantum\ndistribution of the rotor is exactly verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 15:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

Using a unique combination of advanced thermometry during\ncavity RF measurements, and TEM structural and compositional characterization\nof the samples extracted from cavity walls, we discover the existence of\nnanoscale hydrides in electropolished cavities limited by the high field Q\nslope, and show the decreased hydride formation in the electropolished cavity\nafter 120C baking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding 800C hydrogen\ndegassing followed by light buffered chemical polishing restores the hydride\nformation to the pre-120C bake level. We also show absence of niobium oxides\nalong the grain boundaries and the modifications of the surface oxide upon 120C\nbake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 15:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 17:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-16"}

However, the systematic\ngeneralization of the GNM has been elusive. We show that the GNM Kirchhoff\nmatrix can be built from the ideal low-pass filter, which is a special case of\na wide class of correlation functions underpinning the linear scaling\nflexibility-rigidity index (FRI) method. Based on the mathematical structure of\ncorrelation functions, we propose a unified framework to construct generalized\nKirchhoff matrices whose matrix inverse leads to correlation function based\nGNMs, whereas, the direct inverse of the diagonal elements gives rise to FRI\nmethod. We illustrate that correlation function based GNMs outperform the\noriginal GNM in the B-factor prediction of a set of 364 proteins. We\ndemonstrate that for any given correlation function, FRI and GNM methods\nprovide essentially identical B-factor predictions when the scale value in the\ncorrelation function is sufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 00:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}

The Eisenhart lift is a\nprocedure to describe trajectories of a classical natural Hamiltonian system as\ngeodesics in an enlarged space. We point out that it can be easily obtained\nfrom basic principles of Hamiltonian dynamics, and as such it represents a\nuseful didactical way to introduce graduate students to several modern concepts\nof geometry applied to physics: curved spaces, both Riemannian and Lorentzian,\nconformal transformations, geometrisation of interactions and extra dimensions,\ngeometrisation of dynamical symmetries. For all these concepts the Eisenhart\nlift can be used as a theoretical tool that provides easily achievable\nexamples, with the added benefit of also being a topic of current research with\nseveral applications, among which the study of dynamical systems and\nnon-relativistic holography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 14:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}
