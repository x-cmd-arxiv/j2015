The measurement of jet spectra in\np-Pb collisions provides an important way of quantifying the effects of cold\nnuclear matter in the initial state on jet production, fragmentation, and\nhadronization. Unlike in Pb-Pb collisions, strong hot nuclear matter effects -\ne.g. from quark-gluon plasma formation - are not expected to occur in p-Pb\ncollisions.

The Jamesian two-stage model, which\ndeconstructs free will into the causally open \"free\" stage with its closure in\nthe \"will\" stage, is implicitly a move in this direction. However, to avoid the\ndilemma of determinism, free will additionally requires an infinite regress of\ncausal meta-stages, making free choice a hypertask. We use this model to define\nfree will of the rationalist-compatibilist type. This is shown to provide a\nnatural three-way distinction between quantum indeterminism, freedom and free\nwill, applicable respectively to artificial intelligence (AI), animal agents\nand human agents.

Our method\nof proof relies on a complete survey of the $1$-types of $T_{\\log}$, which, in\nthe presence of QE, is equivalent to a characterization of all simple\nextensions $\\Gamma\\langle\\alpha\\rangle$ of $\\Gamma$. We also show that\n$T_{\\log}$ does not have the Steinitz exchange property and we weigh in on the\nrelationship between models of $T_{\\log}$ and the so-called\n\\emph{precontraction groups} of~\\cite{kuhlmann1}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:13:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 21:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

However,\nreleasing this data to researchers and the public comes at the cost of\npotentially exposing private and sensitive user information. It has been shown\nthat a naive anonymization of a network by removing the identity of the nodes\nis not sufficient to preserve users' privacy. In order to deal with malicious\nattacks, k-anonymity solutions have been proposed to partially obfuscate\ntopological information that can be used to infer nodes' identity.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring k-anonymity in time-varying\ngraphs, i.e., graphs with a structure that changes over time, and multi-layer\ngraphs, i.e., graphs with multiple types of links. More specifically, we\nexamine the case in which the attacker has access to the degree of the nodes.\nThe goal is to generate a new graph where, given the degree of a node in each\n(temporal) layer of the graph, such a node remains indistinguishable from other\nk-1 nodes in the graph. In order to achieve this, we find the optimal\npartitioning of the graph nodes such that the cost of anonymizing the degree\ninformation within each group is minimum. We show that this reduces to a\nspecial case of a Generalized Assignment Problem, and we propose a simple yet\neffective algorithm to solve it. Finally, we introduce an iterated linear\nprogramming approach to enforce the realizability of the anonymized degree\nsequences. The efficacy of the method is assessed through an extensive set of\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

Most importantly, in\naddition to the geographical coordinates of the user's location, LBSNs allow\neasy access to an additional set of characteristics of that location, such as\nthe venue type or popularity.\n  In this paper, we investigate the role of location semantics in the\nidentification of LBSN users. We simulate a scenario in which the attacker's\ngoal is to reveal the identity of a set of LBSN users by observing their\ncheck-in activity. We then propose to answer the following question: what are\nthe types of venues that a malicious user has to monitor to maximize the\nprobability of success? Conversely, when should a user decide whether to make\nhis/her check-in to a location public or not? We perform our study on more than\n1 million check-ins distributed over 17 urban regions of the United States. Our\nanalysis shows that different types of venues display different discriminative\npower in terms of user identity, with most of the venues in the \"Residence\"\ncategory providing the highest re-identification success across the urban\nregions. Interestingly, we also find that users with a high entropy of their\ncheck-ins distribution are not necessarily the hardest to identify, suggesting\nthat it is the collective behaviour of the users' population that determines\nthe complexity of the identification task, rather than the individual\nbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 23:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

This opposing force may be due to cargo carried by\nmotors or resistance coming from the cell membrane pressing against the\ncytoskeletal filaments. Some recent studies have shown that the collective\nmaximum force (stall force) generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or\nmolecular motors may not always be just a simple sum of the stall forces of the\nindividual filaments or motors. To understand this excess or deficit in the\ncollective force, we study a broad class of models of both cytoskeletal\nfilaments and molecular motors. We argue that the stall force generated by a\ngroup of filaments or motors is additive, that is, the stall force of $N$\nnumber of filaments (motors) is $N$ times the stall force of one filament\n(motor), when the system is in equilibrium at stall. Conversely, we show that\nthis additive property typically does not hold true when the system is not at\nequilibrium at stall. We thus present a novel and unified understanding of the\nexisting models exhibiting such non-addivity, and generalise our arguments by\ndeveloping new models that demonstrate this phenomena.

Ordering of the\nparticles in the chain is governed by single correlation parameter -- the\nprobability for two neighboring particles to have the same mass. As this\nparameter grows from zero to unity, the structure of the chain varies from\nregular staggering chain to completely random configuration, and then -- to\nvery long clusters of particles with equal masses. Therefore, this correlation\nparameter allows a control of typical cluster size in the chain. In order to\nexplore different regimes of the heat transport, two interatomic potentials are\nconsidered. The first one is an infinite potential wall, corresponding to\ninstantaneous elastic collisions between the neighboring particles. In\nhomogeneous chains such interaction leads to an anomalous heat transport. The\nother one is classical Lennard-Jones interatomic potential, which leads to a\nnormal heat transport. The simulations demonstrate that the correlated disorder\nof the particle arrangement does not change the convergence properties of the\nheat conduction coefficient, but essentially modifies its value. For the\ncollision potential, one observes essential growth of the coefficient for fixed\nchain length as the limit of large homogeneous clusters is approached. The\nthermal transport in these models remains superdiffusive. In the Lennard-Jones\nchain the effect of correlation appears to be not monotonous in the limit of\nlow temperatures. This behavior stems from the competition between formation of\nlong clusters mentioned above, and Anderson localization close to the\nstaggering ordered state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 08:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 11:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-13"}

In this paper, we study the\nbehaviour of regular graph covering with respect to 1-cuts and 2-cuts in $G$.\n  We describe reductions which produce a series of graphs $G = G_0,\\dots,G_r$\nsuch that $G_{i+1}$ is created from $G_i$ by replacing certain inclusion\nminimal subgraphs with colored edges. The process ends with a primitive graph\n$G_r$ which is either 3-connected, or a cycle, or $K_2$.

We propose two regression models\nthat take into account various properties of sorting algorithms and some of the\nknown theoretical results in smoothed analysis to improve prediction quality.\nWe show experimental results for predicting the smoothed complexity of\nQuicksort, Mergesort, and optimized Bubblesort for large input sizes, therefore\nfilling the gap between known theoretical and empirical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 09:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-29"}

The application of MHD shock models in the interpretation of the\nresulting line emission can yield information on the energetic and chemical\nimpact of supernova remnants. We have mapped two regions in the supernova\nremnant W44 with the APEX telescope in ${}^{12}$CO (3-2), (4-3), (6-5), (7-6)\nand ${}^{13}$CO (3-2). The extraction of integrated intensities on five\ndifferent positions, corresponding to local maxima of CO emission, allows to\ncompare these intensities to the outputs of a grid of models, which combine an\nMHD shock code with a radiative transfer module based on the 'large velocity\ngradient' approximation.

Studying the evolution of deuterated molecules allows to\ndifferentiate between subsequent stages of high-mass star formation regions due\nto the strong temperature dependence of deuterium isotopic fractionation. We\nobserved a sample of 59 sources including 19 infrared dark clouds, 20 high-mass\nprotostellar objects, 11 hot molecular cores and 9 ultra-compact HII regions in\nthe (3-2) transitions of the four deuterated molecules, DCN, DNC, DCO+ and N2D+\nas well as their non-deuterated counterpart. The overall detection fraction of\nDCN, DNC and DCO+ is high and exceeds 50% for most of the stages. N2D+ was only\ndetected in a few infrared dark clouds and high-mass protostellar objects. It\ncan be related to problems in the bandpass at the frequency of the transition\nand to low abundances in the more evolved, warmer stages. We find median D/H\nratios of ~0.02 for DCN, ~0.005 for DNC, ~0.0025 for DCO+ and ~0.02 for N2D+.\nWhile the D/H ratios of DNC, DCO+ and N2D+ decrease with time, DCN/HCN peaks at\nthe hot molecular core stage. We only found weak correlations of the D/H ratios\nfor N2D+ with the luminosity of the central source and the FWHM of the line,\nand no correlation with the H2 column density.

Since density-functional theory (DFT) with local\nand semi-local exchange-correlation functionals (LDA and GGA) systematically\nfails to predict these quantities this can have serious implications on the\nmodeling of defect reactions.

The newly defined AF serves as a\ngeneralized AF form for which the phased-array (PA) and traditional MIMO radar\nAFs are important special cases. We establish relationships among the defined\nTB-based MIMO radar AF and the existing AF results including the Woodward's AF,\nthe AFs defined for the traditional colocated MIMO radar, and also the PA radar\nAF, respectively.

The\nactual 'clear region' of the TB-based MIMO radar AF depends on the array\nconfiguration and is in between of the worst- and best-case bounds.

In addition to reducing\ncircuit area, power consumption, and delay, redundancy removal also improves\ntestability. All commercially available synthesis tools include a redundancy\nremoval engine which is often run multiple times on the same netlist during\noptimization. This paper presents a fast heuristic algorithm for redundancy\nremoval in combinational circuits. Our idea is to provide a quick partial\nsolution which can be used for the intermediate redundancy removal runs instead\nof exact ATPG or SAT-based approaches. The presented approach has a higher\nimplication power than the traditional heuristic algorithms, such as FIRE, e.g.\non average it removes 37% more redundancies than FIRE with no penalty in\nruntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 13:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

We can reasonably reproduce the abundances of LAEs and\nLBGs from redshift 3 to 7, as well as most UV LFs of LAEs. The stronger dust\nattenuation for (resonant) Lya photons compared to UV continuum photons in\nbright LBGs provides a natural interpretation to the increase of the LAE\nfraction in LBG samples, X_LAE, towards fainter magnitudes. The redshift\nevolution of X_LAE seems however very sensitive to UV magnitudes limits and EW\ncuts. In spite of the apparent good match between the statistical properties\npredicted by the model and the observations, we find that the tail of the Lya\nequivalent width distribution (EW > 100 A) cannot be explained by our model,\nand we need to invoke additional mechanisms. We find that LAEs and LBGs span a\nvery similar dynamical range, but bright LAEs are about 4 times rarer than LBGs\nin massive halos. Moreover, massive halos mainly contain weak LAEs in our\nmodel, which might introduce a bias towards low-mass halos in surveys which\nselect sources with high EW cuts. Overall, our results are consistent with the\nidea that LAEs and LBGs make a very similar galaxy population. Their apparent\ndifferences seem mainly due to EW selections, UV detection limits, and a\ndecreasing Lya-to-UV escape fraction ratio in high SFR galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 13:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This time-series was used to\nsearch for the small line-profile variations due to a surface magnetic field\nwith the help of a PCA. Evidence for a spatial and temporal inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field distribution is presented. The mean, surface averaged, magnetic\nfield strength was found to be $\\langle B \\rangle = 186 \\pm 47\\,\\mathrm{G}$ in\ngood agreement with previous Zeeman-broadening measurements. Clear short-term\nvariations of the surface averaged magnetic field of up to few tens Gauss were\ndetected together with evidence for a three-year cycle in the surface-averaged\nmagnetic field of $\\epsilon$ Eridani.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 14:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

On the individual\nlevel, it is the processes by which organisms exclude others of the same\nspecies from certain parts of space. On the population level, it is the\nsegregation of space into separate areas, each used by subsections of the\npopulation. Proving mathematically that such individual-level processes can\ncause observed population-level patterns to form is necessary for linking these\ntwo levels of description in a non-speculative way. Previous mathematical\nanalysis has relied upon assuming animals are attracted to a central area. This\ncan either be a fixed geographical point, such as a den- or nest-site, or a\nregion where they have previously visited. However, recent simulation-based\nstudies suggest that this attractive potential is not necessary for territorial\npattern formation. Here, we construct a partial differential equation (PDE)\nmodel of territorial interactions based on the individual-based model (IBM)\nfrom those simulation studies. The resulting PDE does not rely on attraction to\nspatial locations, but purely on conspecific avoidance, mediated via\nscent-marking. We show analytically that steady-state patterns can form, as\nlong as (i) the scent does not decay faster than it takes the animal to\ntraverse the terrain, and (ii) the spatial scale over which animals detect\nscent is incorporated into the PDE. As part of the analysis, we develop a\ngeneral method for taking the PDE limit of an IBM that avoids destroying any\nintrinsic spatial scale in the underlying behavioral decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 14:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-17"}

Using in situ measurements of the solar wind, we\nproduce models for the slow and fast components of the solar wind. We consider\ntwo radically different methods for scaling the base temperature of the wind to\nother stars: in Model A, we assume that wind temperatures are fundamentally\nlinked to coronal temperatures, and in Model B, we assume that the sound speed\nat the base of the wind is a fixed fraction of the escape velocity. In Paper II\nof this series, we use observationally constrained rotational evolution models\nto derive wind mass loss rates.\n  Results: Our model for the solar wind provides an excellent description of\nthe real solar wind far from the solar surface, but is unrealistic within the\nsolar corona. We run a grid of 1200 wind models to derive relations for the\nwind properties as a function of stellar mass, radius, and wind temperature.\nUsing these results, we explore how wind properties depend on stellar mass and\nrotation.\n  Conclusions: Based on our two assumptions about the scaling of the wind\ntemperature, we argue that there is still significant uncertainty in how these\nproperties should be determined. Resolution of this uncertainty will probably\nrequire both the application of solar wind physics to other stars and detailed\nobservational constraints on the properties of stellar winds.

In this work, we go beyond traditional density functional theory\ncalculations to determine defect-derived emission and absorption energies in\nPE. In particular, we characterize PE defect levels in terms of thermodynamic\nand adiabatic charge transition levels that involve total energy calculations\nof neutral and charged defects. Calculations are performed at several levels of\ntheory including those involving (semi)local and hybrid electron\nexchange-correlation functionals, and many-body perturbation theory. With these\ncritical elements, the calculated defect transition levels are in excellent\ncorrespondence to observed luminescence spectra of PE, thus clarifying and\nconfirming the origins of the observed peaks. Based on this work, a\nprescription with a reasonable computational expense is proposed to accurately\npredict and assign spectroscopic signatures of defects in other organic\npolymers as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 15:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Different mechanisms have been proposed to\nimplement inter-agent influence in social models from the voter model, to\nmajority rules, to the Granoveter model. Here we advance in this direction by\nconfronting the recently introduced Social Influence and Recurrent Mobility\n(SIRM) model, that reproduces generic features of vote-shares at different\ngeographical levels, with data in the US presidential elections. Our approach\nincorporates spatial and population diversity as inputs for the opinion\ndynamics while individuals' mobility provides a proxy for social context, and\npeer imitation accounts for social influence. The model captures the observed\nstationary background fluctuations in the vote-shares across counties. We study\nthe so-called political strongholds, i.e., locations where the votes-shares for\na party are systematically higher than average. A quantitative definition of a\nstronghold by means of persistence in time of fluctuations in the voting\nspatial distribution is introduced, and results from the US Presidential\nElections during the period 1980-2012 are analyzed within this framework. We\ncompare electoral results with simulations obtained with the SIRM model finding\na good agreement both in terms of the number and the location of strongholds.\nThe strongholds duration is also systematically characterized in the SIRM\nmodel. The results compare well with the electoral results data revealing an\nexponential decay in the persistence of the strongholds with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 15:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-29"}
