Within the class of Filippov solutions, if\n$\\Sigma$ is attractive, one should expect solution trajectories to slide on\n$\\Sigma$. It is well known, however, that the classical Filippov\nconvexification methodology is ambiguous on $\\Sigma$. The situation is further\ncomplicated by the possibility that, regardless of how sliding on $\\Sigma$ is\ntaking place, during sliding motion a trajectory encounters so-called generic\nfirst order exit points, where $\\Sigma$ ceases to be attractive.\n  In this work, we attempt to understand what behavior one should expect of a\nsolution trajectory near $\\Sigma$ when $\\Sigma$ is attractive, what to expect\nwhen $\\Sigma$ ceases to be attractive (at least, at generic exit points), and\nfinally we also contrast and compare the behavior of some regularizations\nproposed in the literature.\n  Through analysis and experiments we will confirm some known facts, and\nprovide some important insight: (i) when $\\Sigma$ is attractive, a solution\ntrajectory indeed does remain near $\\Sigma$, viz. sliding on $\\Sigma$ is an\nappropriate idealization (of course, in general, one cannot predict which\nsliding vector field should be selected); (ii) when $\\Sigma$ loses attractivity\n(at first order exit conditions), a typical solution trajectory leaves a\nneighborhood of $\\Sigma$; (iii) there is no obvious way to regularize the\nsystem so that the regularized trajectory will remain near $\\Sigma$ as long as\n$\\Sigma$ is attractive, and so that it will be leaving (a neighborhood of)\n$\\Sigma$ when $\\Sigma$ looses attractivity.\n  We reach the above conclusions by considering exclusively the given piecewise\nsmooth system, without superimposing any assumption on what kind of dynamics\nnear $\\Sigma$ (or sliding motion on $\\Sigma$) should have been taking place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 16:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-12"}

A phantom scalar field was used as a model of dark energy\nin the system. Dark matter was modeled by a complex scalar field with a quartic\npotential, charged under a U(1)-gauge field. The dark components were coupled\nto the electrically charged scalar field via the exponential coupling and the\ngauge field-Maxwell field kinetic mixing, respectively.

The wormhole throats were stabilized by the violation of the null\nenergy condition, which occurred due to a significant increase of a value of\nthe phantom scalar field function in its vicinity. The square of mass parameter\nof the dark matter scalar field potential controlled the formation of a Cauchy\nhorizon or wormhole throats in the spacetime.

Using this model, we study the performance of a typical D2D\nreceiver in terms of coverage probability under two realistic content\navailability setups: (i) content of interest for a typical device is available\nat a device chosen uniformly at random from the same cluster, which we term\nuniform content availability, and (ii) content of interest is available at the\n$k^{th}$ closest device from the typical device inside the same cluster, which\nwe term $k$-closest content availability. Using these coverage probability\nresults, we also characterize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the whole\nnetwork for the two setups. A key intermediate step in this analysis is the\nderivation of the distributions of distances from a typical device to both the\nintra- and inter-cluster devices.

This can be interpreted as the classical tradeoff between more\naggressive frequency reuse and higher interference power.

During the kinematic stage, the\nunified large/small-scale dynamo grows fields with a shape-invariant\neigenfunction, with most power peaked at small scales or large $k$, as in\n\\citet{SB14}. Nevertheless, the large-scale field can be clearly detected as an\nexcess power at small $k$ in the negatively polarized component of the energy\nspectrum for a forcing with positively polarized waves. Its strength $bar{B}$,\nrelative to the total rms field $B_{rms}$, decreases with increasing magnetic\nReynolds number, $R_m$. However, as the Lorentz force becomes important, the\nfield generated by the unified dynamo orders itself by saturating on\nsuccessively larger scales. The magnetic integral scale for the positively\npolarized waves, characterizing the small-scale field, increases significantly\nfrom the kinematic stage to saturation. This implies that the small-scale field\nbecomes as coherent as possible for a given forcing scale, which averts the\n$R_m$-dependent quenching of $\\bar{B}/B_rms$.

We devise\na new statistic that is not hampered by these shortcomings, and, using only\ndata on the 9 known MW satellite galaxies with $V_{\\rm max}>15{\\rm kms}^{-1}$,\ndemonstrate that $1.4^{+3.3}_{-1.1}\\%$ of MW-size host haloes have a subhalo\npopulation in statistical agreement with that of the MW. However, when using\ndata on the MW satellite galaxies down to $V_{\\rm max}=8{\\rm kms}^{-1}$, this\nMW consistent fraction plummets to $<5\\times10^{-4}$ (at 68% CL). Hence, if it\nturns out that the inventory of MW satellite galaxies is complete down to\n8km/s, then the maximum circular velocities of MW satellites are utterly\ninconsistent with $\\Lambda$CDM predictions, unless baryonic effects can\ndrastically increase the spread in $V_{\\rm max}$ values of satellite galaxies\ncompared to that of their subhaloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 20:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 20:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The set of all such\nflags (the flag manifold) can be projectively coordinatized using products of\nminors of a matrix. These products are indexed by tableaux on a Young diagram.\nA basis of \"standard monomials\" for the vector space generated by such\nprojective coordinates over the entire flag manifold has long been known. A\nSchubert variety is a subset of flags specified by a permutation. Lakshmibai,\nMusili, and Seshadri gave a standard monomial basis for the smaller vector\nspace generated by the projective coordinates restricted to a Schubert variety.\nReiner and Shimozono made this theory more explicit by giving a straightening\nalgorithm for the products of the minors in terms of the right key of a Young\ntableau. Since then, Willis introduced scanning tableaux as a more direct way\nto obtain right keys.

Important progress has been achieved in computing\nconfidence intervals for single coordinates $\\theta^*_i$. A key role in these\nnew methods is played by a certain debiased estimator $\\hat{\\theta}^{\\rm d}$\nthat is constructed from the Lasso.

Cell polarization is defined\nthrough the spatio-temporal organization of molecules such as PI3K or small\nGTPases, and is determined by intracellular signaling networks. It results in\ndirectional forces through actin polymerization and myosin contractions. Many\nexisting mathematical models of cell polarization are formulated in terms of\nreaction-diffusion systems of interacting molecules, and are often defined in\none or two spatial dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a 3D\nreaction-diffusion model of interacting molecules in a single cell, and find\nthat cell geometry has an important role affecting the capability of a cell to\npolarize, or change polarization when an external signal changes direction. Our\nresults suggest a geometrical argument why more roundish cells can repolarize\nmore effectively than cells which are elongated along the direction of the\noriginal stimulus, and thus enable roundish cells to turn faster, as has been\nobserved in experiments. On the other hand, elongated cells preferentially\npolarize along their main axis even when a gradient stimulus appears from\nanother direction. Furthermore, our 3D model can accurately capture the effect\nof binding and unbinding of important regulators of cell polarization to and\nfrom the cell membrane.

Many\nare in systems with tightly packed inner planets. Inside-Out Planet Formation\n(IOPF) has been proposed to explain these systems. It involves sequential in\nsitu planet formation at the local pressure maximum of a retreating dead zone\ninner boundary (DZIB). Pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap, which builds\nup a ring, and then a planet. The planet is expected to grow until it opens a\ngap, which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and induce DZIB retreat that\nsets the location of formation of the next planet. This simple scenario may be\nmodified if the planet migrates significantly from its formation location. Thus\nplanet-disk interactions play a crucial role in the IOPF scenario. We present\nnumerical simulations that first assess migration of planets of various masses\nthat are forming at the DZIB of an active accretion disk, where the effective\nviscosity rapidly increases in the radially inward direction. We find that the\ndisk's torques on the planet tend to trap the planet at a location very close\nto the initial pressure maximum where it formed. We then study gap opening by\nthese planets to assess at what mass a significant gap is created.

In computer graphics, it is often used as a black box solver\nfor a more general class of non linear problems, including problems having many\nlocal minima. Some works obtain very nice results by solving such difficult\nproblems with L-BFGS. Surprisingly, the method is able to escape local minima:\nour interpretation is that the approximation of the Hessian is smoother than\nthe real Hessian, making it possible to evade the local minima. We analyse the\nbehavior of L-BFGS on the design of 2D frame fields. It involves an energy\nfunction that is infinitly continuous, strongly non linear and having many\nlocal minima. Moreover, the local minima have a clear visual interpretation:\nthey corresponds to differents frame field topologies. We observe that the\nperformances of LBFGS are almost unpredictables: they are very competitive when\nthe field is sampled on the primal graph, but really poor when they are sampled\non the dual graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 07:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-13"}

By embodying recent improvements in nonlinear diffusion\nmodels, we propose a dynamic nonlinear reaction diffusion model with\ntime-dependent parameters (\\ie, linear filters and influence functions). In\ncontrast to previous nonlinear diffusion models, all the parameters, including\nthe filters and the influence functions, are simultaneously learned from\ntraining data through a loss based approach.

The structured outputs include\nvector, tree, sequence, etc. We usually assume that we have a training set of\ninput-output pairs to train the predictor. However, in many real-world appli-\ncations, it is difficult to obtain the output for a input, thus for many\ntraining input data points, the structured outputs are missing. In this paper,\nwe dis- cuss how to learn from a training set composed of some input-output\npairs, and some input data points without outputs. This problem is called semi-\nsupervised structured output prediction. We propose a novel method for this\nproblem by constructing a nearest neighbor graph from the input space to\npresent the manifold structure, and using it to regularize the structured out-\nput space directly. We define a slack structured output for each training data\npoint, and proposed to predict it by learning a structured output predictor.\nThe learning of both slack structured outputs and the predictor are unified\nwithin one single minimization problem. In this problem, we propose to mini-\nmize the structured loss between the slack structured outputs of neighboring\ndata points, and the prediction error measured by the structured loss.

We measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selected\nwith $B-$band luminosity at $0.35 \\leq z < 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion in\nthe number density distribution derived from the 48 ALHAMBRA subfields. We\ncompare the observational $\\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the dark\nmatter expected from the theory, $\\sigma_{v,{\\rm dm}}$. This provides an\nestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. The galaxy bias from the cosmic variance is\nin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlation\nfunction analysis in ALHAMBRA. This holds for different redshift bins, for red\nand blue subsamples, and for several $B-$band luminosity selections.

Within the framework of\n(Floquet-)Born-Markov theory, several analytical and numerical methods are\ndescribed in detail.

One can view a 3-term arithmetic progression\nas a sequence $x, f_n(x), f_n(f_n(x))$, where $f_n(x) = x + n$, $n$ a nonzero\ninteger.

As the\nscattering source function is reduced, we find the solution topology in the\ntransonic region transitions from X-type, with a unique wind solution, to a\nnodal type, characterized by a degenerate family of solutions.\n  Specifically, in the idealized case of an optically thin source function and\na uniformly bright stellar disk, the unique X-type solution proves to be a\nstable attractor to which time-dependent numerical radiation-hydrodynamical\nsimulations relax. But in models where the scattering strength is only modestly\nreduced, the topology instead turns nodal, with the associated solution\ndegeneracy now manifest by intrinsic structure and variability that persist\ndown to the photospheric wind base. This highlights the potentially crucial\nrole of diffuse radiation for the dynamics and variability of line-driven\nwinds, and seriously challenges the use of Sobolev theory in the transonic wind\nregion. Since such Sobolev-based models are commonly used in broad applications\nlike stellar evolution and feedback, this prompts development of new wind\nmodels, not only for further quantifying the intrinsic variability found here,\nbut also for computing new theoretical predictions of global properties like\nvelocity laws and mass-loss rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2015 15:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}
