To\novercome these problems, this paper proposes two-stage normalization by\nperforming verbosity and scope normalization separately, and by employing\ndifferent penalization functions. In verbosity normalization, each document is\npre-normalized by dividing the term frequency by the verbosity of the document.\nIn scope normalization, an existing retrieval model is applied in a\nstraightforward manner to the pre-normalized document, finally leading us to\nformulate our proposed verbosity normalized (VN) retrieval model.

As an experimentally controlled process, it is a key\ntool for the realization of quantum technologies. In particular, in an\natom/photon based quantum network scenario, in which localized atomic particles\nare used as quantum information processing nodes while photons are used as\ncarriers of quantum information between distant nodes, controlling both\nemission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is required for\nquantum coherent state mapping between the two entities. Most experimental\nefforts to date have focused on establishing the control of single photon\nemission by single trapped atoms, and the implementation of quantum networking\nprotocols using this interaction. In this chapter, we describe experimental\nefforts to control the process of single photon absorption by single trapped\nions. We describe a series of experiments in which polarization entangled\nphoton pairs, generated by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, are\ncoupled to a single ion. First the source is operated to generate heralded\nsingle photons, and coincidences between the absorption event of one photon of\nthe pair and the detection of the heralding partner photon are observed. We\nthen show how polarization control in the process is established, leading to\nthe manifestation of the photonic polarization entanglement in the absorption\nprocess. Finally, we introduce protocols in which this interaction scheme is\nharnessed to perform tasks in a quantum network, such as entanglement\ndistribution among distant nodes of the network, and we demonstrate a specific\nprotocol for heralded, high-fidelity photon-to-atom quantum state transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 19:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 16:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-20"}

Using a spherical harmonic mode decomposition, the waveform is\nexpressed as a sum over modes that depend on the intrinsic parameters (e.g.\nmasses) with coefficients that depend on the observer dependent extrinsic\nparameters (e.g. distance, sky position). The data is then prefiltered against\nthose modes, at fixed intrinsic parameters, enabling efficiently evaluation of\nthe likelihood for generic source positions and orientations, independent of\nwaveform length or generation time. We efficiently parallelize our intrinsic\nspace calculation by integrating over all extrinsic parameters using a Monte\nCarlo integration strategy. Since the waveform generation and prefiltering\nhappens only once, the cost of integration dominates the procedure. Also, we\noperate hierarchically, using information from existing gravitational-wave\nsearches to identify the regions of parameter space to emphasize in our\nsampling.

Although commonly used, little is\nknown about the inner mechanisms of chest physiotherapy and controversies about\nits use are coming out regularly. Thus, a scientific validation of chest\nphysiotherapy is needed to evaluate its effects on secretions.\n  We setup a quasi-static numerical model of chest physiotherapy based on\nthorax and lung physiology and on their respective biophysics. We modeled the\nlung with an idealized deformable symmetric bifurcating tree. Bronchi and their\ninner fluids mechanics are assumed axisymmetric. Static data from the\nliterature is used to build a model for the lung's mechanics. Secretions motion\nis the consequence of the shear constraints apply by the air flow. The input of\nthe model is the pressure on the chest wall at each time, and the output is the\nbronchi geometry and air and secretions properties.\n  In the limit of our model, we mimicked manual and mechanical chest\nphysiotherapy techniques. We show that for secretions to move, air flow has to\nbe high enough to overcome secretion resistance to motion. Moreover, the higher\nthe pressure or the quicker it is applied, the higher is the air flow and thus\nthe mobilization of secretions. However, pressures too high are efficient up to\na point where airways compressions prevents air flow to increases any further.\nGenerally, the first effects of manipulations is a decrease of the airway tree\nhydrodynamic resistance, thus improving ventilation even if secretions do not\nget out of the lungs. Also, some secretions might be pushed deeper into the\nlungs; this effect is stronger for high pressures and for mechanical chest\nphysiotherapy. Finally, we propose and tested two adimensional numbers that\ndepend on lung properties and that allow to measure the efficiency and comfort\nof a manipulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 22:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}

Here we introduce a systematic dynamical framework to\ndesign and analyze a wide variety of quality functions for community detection.\nThe quality of a partition is measured by its Markov Stability, a\ntime-parametrized function defined in terms of the statistical properties of a\nMarkov process taking place on the graph. The Markov process provides a\ndynamical sweeping across all scales in the graph, and the time scale is an\nintrinsic parameter that uncovers communities at different resolutions.\n  This dynamic-based community detection leads to a compound optimization,\nwhich favours communities of comparable centrality (as defined by the\nstationary distribution), and provides a unifying framework for spectral\nalgorithms, as well as different heuristics for community detection, including\nversions of modularity and Potts model. Our dynamic framework creates a\nsystematic link between different stochastic dynamics and their corresponding\nnotions of optimal communities under distinct (node and edge) centralities.

A record\nof the early geodynamo is preserved in ancient silicate crystals containing\nminute magnetic inclusions. These data indicate the presence of a geodynamo\nduring the Paleoarchean, between 3.4 and 3.45 billion years ago. While the\nmagnetic field sheltered Earth's atmosphere from erosion at this time, standoff\nof the solar wind was greatly reduced, and similar to that during modern\nextreme solar storms. These conditions suggest that intense radiation from the\nyoung Sun may have modified the atmosphere of the young Earth by promoting loss\nof volatiles, including water. Such effects would have been more pronounced if\nthe field were absent or very weak prior to 3.45 billion years ago, as\nsuggested by some models of lower mantle evolution.

To illustrate what this kind of progress can look like, we\npresent a case study of a middle school science teacher who implemented the\n\"same\" lesson on the motion of freely falling objects in two subsequent years.\nWe argue that his primary shift in responsiveness stemmed from a shift in which\ndisciplinary practices he preferentially noticed and foregrounded.

It is known that an on-axis spherical/parabolic optical component,\nplaced at an angle to the incident beam introduces defocus as well as\nastigmatism in the image plane. Although the former can be compensated by\nchanging the focal plane position, the latter cannot be removed by mere optical\nre-alignment. Since the DM is to be used to compensate a turbulence-induced\ncurvature term in addition to other aberrations, it is necessary to determine\nthe aberrations induced by such (curved DM surface) an optical element when\nplaced at an angle (other than 0 degree) of incidence in the optical path. To\nthis effect, we estimate to a first order, the aberrations introduced by a DM\nas a function of the incidence angle and deformation of the DM surface. We\nrecord images using a simple setup in which the incident beam is reflected by a\n37 channel Micro-machined Membrane Deformable Mirror for various angles of\nincidence.

Their formation history is still puzzling as\nthe sdB progenitors must lose nearly all of their hydrogen envelope during the\nred-giant phase. About half of the known sdBs are in close binaries with\nperiods from 1.2 h to a few days, a fact that implies they experienced a\ncommon-envelope phase. Eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries (also called HW Virginis\nsystems) are rare but important objects for determining fundamental stellar\nparameters. Even more significant and uncommon are those binaries containing a\npulsating sdB, as the mass can be determined independently by asteroseismology.\n  Here we present a first analysis of the eclipsing hot subdwarf binary\nV2008-1753. The light curve shows a total eclipse, a prominent reflection\neffect, and low--amplitude pulsations with periods from 150 to 180 s. An\nanalysis of the light-- and radial velocity (RV) curves indicates a mass ratio\nclose to $ q = 0.146$, an RV semi-amplitude of $K=54.6 \\,\\rm kms^{-1}$, and an\ninclination of $i=86.8^\\circ$. Combining these results with our spectroscopic\ndetermination of the surface gravity, $\\log \\,g = 5.83$, the best--fitting\nmodel yields an sdB mass of 0.47$M_{\\rm \\odot}$ and a companion mass of $69\nM_{\\rm Jup}$. As the latter mass is below the hydrogen-burning limit,\nV2008-1753 represents the first HW Vir system known consisting of a pulsating\nsdB and a brown dwarf companion. Consequently, it holds great potential for\nbetter constraining models of sdB binary evolution and asteroseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

A constrained weighted least\nsquare method is employed to evaluate the physical quantities at the\ninterpolation points. Different boundary conditions, including isothermal\nboundary, adiabatic boundary, and Euler slip boundary, are presented by\ndifferent interpolation strategies. We also propose a simplified gas kinetic\nscheme as the flux solver for both subsonic and supersonic flow computations.\nThe methodology of constructing a simplified kinetic flux function can be\nextended to other flow systems.

The\nmost known image enhancement method is the histogram equalization. This method\nis an automated one, and realizes a simultaneous modification for brightness\nand contrast in the case of monochrome images and for brightness, contrast,\nsaturation and hue in the case of color images. Simple and efficient methods\ncan be obtained if affine transforms within logarithmic models are used. A very\nimportant thing in the affine transform determination for color images is the\ncoordinate system that is used for color space representation. Thus, the using\nof the RGB coordinates leads to a simultaneous modification of luminosity and\nsaturation. In this paper using the lrgb perceptual coordinates one can define\naffine transforms, which allow a separated modification of luminosity l and\nsaturation s (saturation being calculated with the component rgb in the\nchromatic plane). Better results can be obtained if partitions are defined on\nthe image support and then the pixels are separately processed in each window\nbelonging to the defined partition. Classical partitions frequently lead to the\nappearance of some discontinuities at the boundaries between these windows. In\norder to avoid all these drawbacks the classical partitions may be replaced by\nfuzzy partitions. Their elements will be fuzzy windows and in each of them\nthere will be defined an affine transform induced by parameters using the fuzzy\nmean, fuzzy variance and fuzzy saturation computed for the pixels that belong\nto the analyzed window. The final image is obtained by summing up in a weight\nway the images of every fuzzy window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 11:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

We show that complete statistical mixtures\nof the vacuum and single-photon states are the most nonclassical single-qubit\nstates regarding the distance $D$ for a fixed value of both the depth $\\tau$\nand NP in the whole range $[0,1]$ of their values, as well as the NP for a\ngiven value of $\\tau$ such that $\\tau>0.3154$. Conversely, pure states are the\nmost nonclassical single-qubit states with respect to $\\tau$ for a given $D$,\nNP versus $D$, and $\\tau$ versus NP. We also show the \"relativity\" of these\nnonclassicality measures by comparing pairs of single-qubit states: if a state\nis less nonclassical than another state according to some measure then it might\nbe more nonclassical according to another measure. Moreover, we find that the\nconcurrence potential is equal to the nonclassical distance for single-qubit\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 13:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2015 11:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

In this paper, we discuss the linearized\nperturbations of the Boltzmann kinetic equation describing an ensemble of\nelectrons accelerated by the energy release occurring during solar flares.\nEither in the limit of high energy or at vanishing background temperature such\nan equation reduces to a continuity equation equipped with an extra force of\nstochastic nature. This stochastic force is actually described by the well\nknown energy loss rate due to Coulomb collision with ambient particles, but, in\norder to match the collision kernel in the linearized Boltzmann equation it\nneeds to be treated in a very specific manner. In the second part of the paper\nthe derived continuity equation is solved with some hyperbolic techniques, and\nthe obtained solution is written in a form suitable to be compared with data\ngathered by hard X-ray imaging-spectroscopy telescopes. Finally, a first\nvalidation of the model with NASA Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager spectrometer measurements is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 13:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

By using\nthe notion of single, double and mixed occupancy representation with\nintertwiners relating them a natural physical interpretation of embedded qubits\nis found.

Despite its great\npotential in terms of coverage and capacity performance, implementing this new\nconcept poses some challenges, in particular with respect to radio resource\nmanagement. The main challenges arise from a strong need for distributed D2D\nsolutions that operate in the absence of precise channel and network knowledge.\nIn order to address this challenge, this paper studies a resource allocation\nproblem in a single-cell wireless network with multiple D2D users sharing the\navailable radio frequency channels with cellular users. We consider a realistic\nscenario where the base station (BS) is provided with strictly limited channel\nknowledge while D2D and cellular users have no information.

A large enhancement\nof the torque, characterized by an effective spin-Hall angle exceeding most\nheavy transition metals, correlates with the presence of the exchange-bias\nfield at the NiFe/IrMn interface. It highlights that, in addition to strong\nspin-orbit coupling, the antiferromagnetic order in IrMn governs the observed\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 15:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2015 17:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

Here, it is shown that non-equilibrium effects in the\ngas can account for this behaviour, with ambient pressure reductions increasing\nthe gas' mean free path and hence the Knudsen number $Kn$. These effects first\nmanifest themselves through Maxwell slip at the gas' boundaries so that for\nsufficiently small $Kn$ they can be incorporated into a continuum model for\ndynamic wetting flows. The resulting mathematical model contains flow\nstructures on the nano-, micro- and milli-metre scales and is implemented into\na computational platform developed specifically for such multiscale phenomena.\nThe coating flow geometry is used to show that for a fixed gas-liquid-solid\nsystem (a) the increased Maxwell slip at reduced pressures can substantially\ndelay air entrainment, i.e. increase the `maximum speed of wetting', (b)\nunbounded maximum speeds are obtained as the pressure is reduced only when slip\nat the gas-liquid interface is allowed for and (c) the observed behaviour can\nbe rationalised by studying the dynamics of the gas film in front of the moving\ncontact line. A direct comparison to experimental results obtained in the\ndip-coating process shows that the model recovers most trends but does not\naccurately predict some of the high viscosity data at reduced pressures. This\ndiscrepancy occurs because the gas flow enters the `transition regime', so that\nmore complex descriptions of its non-equilibrium nature are required. Finally,\nby collapsing onto a master curve experimental data obtained for drop impact in\na reduced pressure gas, it is shown that the same physical mechanisms are also\nlikely to govern splash suppression phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 15:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 07:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We mainly consider undirected graphs of $n$ vertices, where each\nedge has an associated set of discrete availability instances (labels). A\njourney from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is a path from $u$ to $v$ where\nsuccessive path edges have strictly increasing labels. A graph is temporally\nconnected iff there is a $(u,v)$-journey for any pair of vertices $u,v,~u\\not=\nv$. We first give a simple polynomial-time algorithm to check whether a given\ntemporal graph is temporally connected. We then consider the case in which a\ndesigner of temporal graphs can \\emph{freely choose} availability instances for\nall edges and aims for temporal connectivity with very small \\emph{cost}; the\ncost is the total number of availability instances used. We achieve this via a\nsimple polynomial-time procedure which derives designs of cost linear in $n$.\nWe also show that the above procedure is (almost) optimal when the underlying\ngraph is a tree, by proving a lower bound on the cost for any tree. However,\nthere are pragmatic cases where one is not free to design a temporally\nconnected graph anew, but is instead \\emph{given} a temporal graph design with\nthe claim that it is temporally connected, and wishes to make it more\ncost-efficient by removing labels without destroying temporal connectivity\n(redundant labels).

Contrary to initial beliefs that the model exhibits\na sharp phase transition from freely flowing to fully jammed, it has been\nreported that it shows intermediate stable phases, where jams and freely\nflowing traffic coexist, but there is no clear understanding of their origin.\nHere, we analyze the model as an anisotropic system with a preferred fluid\ndirection (north-east) and find that it exhibits two differentiated phase\ntransitions: either if the system is longer in the flow direction\n(longitudinal) or perpendicular to it (transversal). The critical densities\nwhere these transitions occur enclose the density interval of intermediate\nstates and can be approximated by mean-field analysis, all derived from the\nanisotropic exponent relating the longitudinal and transversal correlation\nlengths. Thus, we arrive to the interesting result that the puzzling\nintermediate states in the original model are just a superposition of these two\ndifferent behaviours of the phase transition, solving by the way most mysteries\nbehind the BML model, which turns to be a paradigmatic example of such\nanisotropic critical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 15:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Network theory has undergone further developments, in particular in\nrelation to detection of communities in graphs, to catch this structure.\nRecently, an approach has been proposed to transform a graph into a collection\nof signals: Using a multidimensional scaling technique on a distance matrix\nrepresenting relations between vertices of the graph, points in a Euclidean\nspace are obtained and interpreted as signals, indexed by the vertices. In this\narticle, we propose several extensions to this approach, developing a framework\nto study graph structures using signal processing tools. We first extend the\ncurrent methodology, enabling us to highlight connections between properties of\nsignals and graph structures, such as communities, regularity or randomness, as\nwell as combinations of those. A robust inverse transformation method is next\ndescribed, taking into account possible changes in the signals compared to\noriginal ones. This technique uses, in addition to the relationships between\nthe points in the Euclidean space, the energy of each signal, coding the\ndifferent scales of the graph structure. These contributions open up new\nperspectives in the study of graphs, by enabling processing of graphs through\nthe processing of the corresponding collection of signals, using reliable tools\nfrom signal processing. A technique of denoising of a graph by filtering of the\ncorresponding signals is then described, suggesting considerable potential of\nthe approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 10:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 17:48:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 20:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}
