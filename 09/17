This is due to the\neffects of quantum electrodynamics in the highly magnetized vacuum around the\nstar (the vacuum polarization) coupled with the rotation of the Stokes\nparameters in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight induced by the\nnon-uniform magnetic field. Here we revisit the problem and present an\nefficient method for computing the observed polarization fraction and\npolarization angle in the case of radiation coming from the entire surface of a\nneutron star, accounting for both vacuum polarization and geometrical effects\ndue to the extended emitting region. Our approach is fairly general and is\nillustrated in the case of blackbody emission from a neutron star with either a\ndipolar or a (globally) twisted magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 19:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

In this paper we use high-resolution\nhydrodynamical cosmological simulations to compare the halo and stellar mass\ngrowth of galaxies in a large-scale overdensity to those in a large-scale\nunderdensity (on scales of about 20 Mpc). The simulation reproduces assembly\nbias, that halos have earlier formation times in overdense environments than in\nunderdense regions. We find that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio is larger\nin overdense regions in central galaxies residing in halos with masses between\n10$^{11}$-10$^{12.9}$ M$_{\\odot}$. When we force the local density (within 2\nMpc) at z=0 to be the same for galaxies in the large-scale over- and\nunderdensities, we find the same results. We posit that this difference can be\nexplained by a combination of earlier formation times, more interactions at\nearly times with neighbors, and more filaments feeding galaxies in overdense\nregions. This result puts the standard practice of assigning stellar mass to\nhalos based only on their mass, rather than considering their larger\nenvironment, into question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 20:08:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

It is generally fit with a composite power\nlaw. Some clues on the progenitors can be found in dense starless cores that\nhave a core mass function (CMF) with a similar shape. In the low-mass end,\nthese mass functions increase with mass, albeit the sample may be somewhat\nincomplete; in the high-mass end, the mass functions decrease with mass. There\nis an offset in the turn-over mass between the two mass distributions. The\nstellar mass for the IMF peak is lower than the corresponding core mass for the\nCMF peak in the Pipe Nebula by about a factor of three. Smaller offsets are\nfound between the IMF and the CMFs in other nebulae. We suggest that the offset\nis likely induced during a starburst episode of global star formation which is\ntriggered by the formation of a few O/B stars in the multi-phase media, which\nnaturally emerged through the onset of thermal instability in the cloud-core\nformation process. We consider the scenario that the ignition of a few massive\nstars photoionizes the warm medium between the cores, increases the external\npressure, reduces their Bonnor?Ebert mass, and triggers the collapse of some\npreviously stable cores.

In practice, to infer the reduced shear, weak\nlensing measures galaxy shapes, which are the consequence of both the intrinsic\nellipticity of the sources and of the integrated gravitational lensing effect\nalong the line of sight. Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in\norder to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak\nlensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant\nadvances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected. This paper\ndescribes a general method for extracting the probability distributions of\nparameters from catalogues of data using Voronoi cells, which has several\napplications, and has synergies with Bayesian hierarchical modelling\napproaches. This allows us to construct a probability distribution for the\nvariance of the intrinsic ellipticity as a function of galaxy property using\nonly photometric data, allowing a reduction of shape noise. As a proof of\nconcept the method is applied to the CFHTLenS survey data.

In a\nsufficiently inclined triple, gravitational interactions between the inner and\nouter binary can cause large-amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the\ninner orbit (\"Lidov-Kozai cycles\"), which can lead to a collision and merger of\nthe two inner components. In this paper we use Monte Carlo models of dense star\nclusters to identify all triple systems formed dynamically and we compute their\nevolution using a highly accurate three-body integrator which incorporates\nrelativistic and tidal effects. We find that a large fraction of these triples\nevolve through a non-secular dynamical phase which can drive the inner binary\nto higher eccentricities than predicted by the standard secular perturbation\ntheory (even including octupole-order terms). We place constraints on the\nimportance of Lidov-Kozai-induced mergers for producing: (i) gravitational wave\nsources detectable by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), for triples with an inner pair of\nstellar black holes; and (ii) blue straggler stars, for triples with\nmain-sequence-star components. We find a realistic aLIGO detection rate of\nblack hole mergers due to the Lidov-Kozai mechanism of 1yr^-1, with about 20%\nof these having a finite eccentricity when they first chirp into the aLIGO\nfrequency band. While rare, these events are likely to dominate among eccentric\ncompact object inspirals that are potentially detectable by aLIGO.

Secondly, even for nonlinear constitutive models like those of Casson\nor Herschel-Bulkley, no nonlinear systems of equations have to be solved in the\nsubproblems of the algorithm. Thirdly, there is no need to augment the\nLagrangian, which eliminates the difficulty of choosing a penalty parameter\nheuristically.\n  In this paper, we transform the usual velocity-based formulation of\nviscoplastic flow problems to a dual formulation in terms of the stress.

High-performance codes usually\narise from designing frames whose elements have mutually low coherence.\nBuilding off the original \"group frame\" design of Slepian which has since been\nelaborated in the works of Vale and Waldron, we present several new frame\nconstructions based on cyclic and generalized dihedral groups. Slepian's\noriginal construction was based on the premise that group structure allows one\nto reduce the number of distinct inner pairwise inner products in a frame with\n$n$ elements from $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ to $n-1$. All of our constructions further\nutilize the group structure to produce tight frames with even fewer distinct\ninner product values between the frame elements. When $n$ is prime, for\nexample, we use cyclic groups to construct $m$-dimensional frame vectors with\nat most $\\frac{n-1}{m}$ distinct inner products. We use this behavior to bound\nthe coherence of our frames via arguments based on the frame potential, and\nderive even tighter bounds from combinatorial and algebraic arguments using the\ngroup structure alone. In certain cases, we recover well-known Welch bound\nachieving frames. In cases where the Welch bound has not been achieved, and is\nnot known to be achievable, we obtain frames with close to Welch bound\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 00:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The efficiency of hot-carrier\nsolar cells can be expected to strongly depend on the details of the energy\nfiltering process, a relationship which to date has not been satisfactorily\nexplored. Here, we establish the conditions under which electron-hole\nseparation in hot-carrier solar cells can occur reversibly, that is, at maximum\nenergy conversion efficiency. We thus focus our analysis on the internal\noperation of the hot-carrier solar cell itself, and in this work do not\nconsider the photon-mediated coupling to the sun. After deriving an expression\nfor the voltage of a hot-carrier solar cell valid under conditions of both\nreversible and irreversible electrical operation, we identify separate\ncontributions to the voltage from the thermoelectric effect and the\nphotovoltaic effect. We find that, under specific conditions, the energy\nconversion efficiency of a hot-carrier solar cell can exceed the Carnot limit\nset by the intra-device temperature gradient alone, due to the additional\ncontribution of the quasi-Fermi level splitting in the absorber. We also\nestablish that the open-circuit voltage of a hot-carrier solar cell is not\nlimited by the band gap of the absorber, due to the additional thermoelectric\ncontribution to the voltage. Additionally, we find that a hot-carrier solar\ncell can be operated in reverse as a thermally driven solid-state light\nemitter. Our results help explore the fundamental limitations of hot-carrier\nsolar cells, and provide a first step towards providing experimentalists with a\nguide to the optimal configuration of devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 02:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

An emerging powerful approach for\nanalyzing large sample data is subsampling, by which one takes a random\nsubsample from the original full sample and uses it as a surrogate for\nsubsequent computation and estimation. In this paper, we study subsampling\nmethods under two scenarios: approximating the full sample ordinary\nleast-square (OLS) estimator and estimating the coefficients in linear\nregression. We present two algorithms, weighted estimation algorithm and\nunweighted estimation algorithm, and analyze asymptotic behaviors of their\nresulting subsample estimators under general conditions. For the weighted\nestimation algorithm, we propose a criterion for selecting the optimal sampling\nprobability by making use of the asymptotic results. On the basis of the\ncriterion, we provide two novel subsampling methods, the optimal subsampling\nand the predictor- length subsampling methods. The predictor-length subsampling\nmethod is based on the L2 norm of predictors rather than leverage scores. Its\ncomputational cost is scalable. For unweighted estimation algorithm, we show\nthat its resulting subsample estimator is not consistent to the full sample OLS\nestimator.

The most significant changes upon ionization are dominated by the\nFe-electrons in non-degenerate signature orbitals. That is, 4a1 which is\ndominated by the Fe 3s orbital, 3a2 by the Fe 3pz orbital and the 8a1 orbital\n(alpha only) by the Fe 3dz2 (one beta-electron is removed from this orbital).\nThe \\Delta DFT and \\Delta SCF calculations yield the IP of 6.90 eV and 6.85 eV,\nrespectively, in excellent agreement to the recent measurements of 6.9 \\pn 0.1\neV, suggesting that significant relaxation energy exists whereas electron\ncorrelation energies are largely cancelled out. A further dual space analysis\n(DSA) identifies that the momentum profiles of such the singly occupied\nfingerprint 8a1 orbital indeed experiences most significant changes in all\norbitals of Fc+, again indicates that the electron removal of ferrocene\nionization is not from the highest occupied molecular orbital.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 04:24:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

In this paper, first, a set of\nvalid linear equalities are applied to strengthen the semidefinite program\n(SDP) relaxation of the MIQCQP problem without significantly increasing the\nproblem dimension so that an enhanced mixed-integer SDP (MISDP) relaxation,\nwhich is a mixed-integer convex problem, is obtained. Then, the enhanced MISDP\nrelaxation is reformulated as a disjunctive programming (DP) problem which is\ntighter than the former one, since the disjunctions are designed to capture the\ndisjunctive nature of the terms in the rank-1 constraint about the integral\nvariables. The DP relaxation is then equivalently convert-ed back into a MISDP\nproblem the feasible set of whose continu-ous relaxation is the convex hull of\nfeasible region of the DP prob-lem. Finally, globally optimal solution of the\nDP problem which is the tightest relaxation for the MIQCQP proposed in the\npaper is obtained by solving the resulting MISDP problem using a\nbranch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. Computational efficiency of the B&B algorithm\nis expected to be high since feasible set of the continuous relaxation of a\nMISDP sub-problem is the convex hull of that of the corresponding DP\nsub-problem. To further reduce the dimension of the resulting MISDP problem, a\ncompact for-mulation of this problem is proposed considering the sparsity. An\noptimal placement problem of smart PV inverter in distribution systems\nintegrated with high penetration of PV, which is an MIQCQP problem, is studied\nas an example. The proposed ap-proach is tested on an IEEE distribution system.\nThe results show that it can effectively improve the tightness and feasibility\nof the SDP relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 06:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

The data reach a\nlimiting surface brightness (1sigma) of ~1 x 10^-19 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 in\nazimuthally averaged radial profiles, an order of magnitude improvement over\nprevious narrowband imaging. Our sample consists of 26 spectroscopically\nconfirmed Ly alpha-emitting, but mostly continuum-faint (m_AB >~ 27) galaxies.\nIn most objects the Ly alpha emission is considerably more extended than the UV\ncontinuum light. While 5 of the faintest galaxies in the sample show no\nsignificantly detected Ly alpha haloes, the derived upper limits suggest that\nthis is just due to insufficient S/N. Ly alpha haloes therefore appear to be\n(nearly) ubiquitous even for low-mass (~10^8-10^9 M_sun) star-forming galaxies\nat z>3. We decompose the Ly alpha emission of each object into a compact\n`continuum-like' and an extended halo component, and infer sizes and\nluminosities of the haloes. The extended Ly alpha emission approximately\nfollows an exponential surface brightness distribution with a scale length of a\nfew kpc. While these haloes are thus quite modest in terms of their absolute\nsizes, they are larger by a factor of 5-15 than the corresponding rest-frame UV\ncontinuum sources as seen by HST. They are also much more extended, by a factor\n~5, than Ly alpha haloes around low-redshift star-forming galaxies.

The mass loss is believed to increase\ngradually with age on the AGB, but it may also occur in the form of bursts,\npossibly related to the thermal pulsing phenomenon. Detached, geometrically\nthin, CO shells around carbon stars are good signposts of brief and intense\nmass ejection. We aim to put further constraints on the physical properties of\ndetached CO shells around AGB stars. The photodissociation of CO and other\ncarbon-bearing species in the shells leads to the possibility of detecting\nlines from neutral carbon. We have therefore searched for the\nCI($^3P_1-\\,^3P_0$) line at 492 GHz towards two carbon stars, S Sct and R Scl,\nwith detached CO shells of different ages, about 8000 and 2300 years,\nrespectively. The CI($^3P_1-\\,^3P_0$) line was detected towards R Scl. The line\nintensity is dominated by emission from the detached shell. The detection is at\na level consistent with the neutral carbon coming from the full\nphotodissociation of all species except CO, and with only limited\nphotoionisation of carbon. The best fit to the observed $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO\nline intensities, assuming a homogeneous shell, is obtained for a shell mass of\nabout 0.002 $M_\\odot$, a temperature of about 100 K, and a CO abundance with\nrespect to H$_2$ of 10$^{-3}$.

We prove as the number of clusters increase from N to N+dN the\nnumber of processing elements in the first layer only increases by d(logN), and\nare proportional to the number of classes, and the method is not NP hard.\n  Many examples are solved to demonstrate that the method of Orientation\nVectors requires much less computational effort than Radial Basis Function\nmethods and other techniques wherein distance computations are required, in\nfact the present method increases logarithmically with problem size compared to\nthe Radial Basis Function method and the other methods which depend on distance\ncomputations e.g statistical methods where probabilistic distances are\ncalculated.

On the other hand, a counter-example shows that the\nglobal realizability in R^2 may hold without the realizability in the torus,\nand it is discussed in connection with the associated semilinear wave equation.\nThe case where the strain field vanishes is illustrated by an example. The\nsingular case of a rank-one laminate field is also investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 11:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

We discuss distributional regression along a study on\ndeterminants of labour incomes for full-time working males in Germany with a\nparticular focus on regional differences after the German reunification.\nControlling for age, education, work experience and local disparities, we\nestimate full conditional income distributions allowing us to study various\ndistributional quantities such as moments, quantiles or inequality measures in\na consistent manner in one joint model. Detailed guidance on practical aspects\nof model choice including the selection of several competing distributions for\nlabour incomes and the consideration of different covariate effects on the\nincome distribution complete the distributional regression analysis. We find\nthat next to a lower expected income, full-time working men in East Germany\nalso face a more unequal income distribution than men in the West, ceteris\nparibus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 12:24:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

When the reactor is operated at\nthe critical point, and fissions are exactly compensated by absorptions, the\nwhole neutron population might in principle go to extinction because of the\nwild fluctuations induced by births and deaths. This phenomenon, which has been\nnamed critical catastrophe, is nonetheless never observed in practice: feedback\nmechanisms acting on the total population, such as human intervention, have a\nstabilizing effect. In this work, we revisit the critical catastrophe by\ninvestigating the spatial behaviour of the fluctuations in a confined geometry.\nWhen the system is free to evolve, the neutrons may display a wild patchiness\n(clustering). On the contrary, imposing a population control on the total\npopulation acts also against the local fluctuations, and may thus inhibit the\nspatial clustering. The effectiveness of population control in quenching\nspatial fluctuations will be shown to depend on the competition between the\nmixing time of the neutrons (i.e., the average time taken for a particle to\nexplore the finite viable space) and the extinction time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 12:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

Depending on the amplitude of an\napplied oscillatory magnetic field the particles orient their time averaged\nanisotropy axis perpendicular to the applied field for low magnetic field\namplitudes and nearly parallel to the direction of the field for high\namplitudes. The transition between these regions takes place in a narrow field\ninterval. In the low field region the magnetic moment is locked to some crystal\naxis and the energy absorption in an oscillatory driving field is dominated by\nviscous losses associated with particle rotation in the liquid. In the opposite\nlimit the magnetic moment rotates within the particle while its easy axis being\nnearly parallel to the external field direction oscillates. The kinetic\nequations are generalized to include thermal fluctuations. This leads to a\nsignificant increase of the power absorption in the low and intermediate field\nregion with a pronounced absorption peak as function of particle size. In the\nhigh field region, on the other hand, the inclusion of thermal fluctuations\nreduces the power absorption.

We use the kinematics of these disks to estimate the circular\nvelocity at large radii for these galaxies. We find that the Tully-Fisher\nrelation for our early-type galaxies is offset by about 0.5-0.7 magnitudes from\nthe relation for spiral galaxies. The residuals with respect to the spiral\nTully-Fisher relation correlate with estimates of the stellar mass-to-light\nratio, suggesting that the offset between the relations is mainly driven by\ndifferences in stellar populations. We also observe a small offset between our\nTully-Fisher relation with the relation derived for the ATLAS3D sample based on\nCO data representing the galaxies' inner regions (< 1 R_eff). This indicates\nthat the circular velocities at large radii are systematically 10% lower than\nthose near 0.5-1 R_eff, in line with recent determinations of the shape of the\nmass profile of early-type galaxies. The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of our\nsample is distinctly tighter than the standard one, in particular when using\nmass-to-light ratios based on dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. We\nfind that the early-type galaxies fall on the spiral baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation if one assumes M/L_K = 0.54 M_sun/L_sun for the stellar populations of\nthe spirals, a value similar to that found by recent studies of the dynamics of\nspiral galaxies. Such a mass-to-light ratio for spiral galaxies would imply\nthat their disks are 60-70% of maximal.

In this work, we present an algorithm that removes blur due to camera\nshake by combining information in the Fourier domain from nearby frames in a\nvideo. The dynamic nature of typical videos with the presence of multiple\nmoving objects and occlusions makes this problem of camera shake removal\nextremely challenging, in particular when low complexity is needed. Given an\ninput video frame, we first create a consistent registered version of\ntemporally adjacent frames. Then, the set of consistently registered frames is\nblock-wise fused in the Fourier domain with weights depending on the Fourier\nspectrum magnitude. The method is motivated from the physiological fact that\ncamera shake blur has a random nature and therefore, nearby video frames are\ngenerally blurred differently. Experiments with numerous videos recorded in the\nwild, along with extensive comparisons, show that the proposed algorithm\nachieves state-of-the-art results while at the same time being much faster than\nits competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 13:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2015 18:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2015 15:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

However,\nnot much was said there about the role of locality, which was not assumed. This\npaper is an attempt to fill that gap. To deal with the challenges gauge\nsymmetries may pose to a good definition of locality, I start by demanding\nsymmetries to have an action on $\\mathcal{M}$ so that the quotient wrt the\nsymmetries respects certain factorizations of $\\mathcal{M}$. These\nfactorizations are algebraic splits of $\\mathcal{M}$ into sub-spaces\n$\\mathcal{M}=\\bigoplus_i \\mathcal{M}_{O_i}$-- each factor corresponding to a\nphysical sub-region $O_i$. This deals with kinematic locality, but locality in\nfull can only emerge dynamically, and is not postulated. I describe conditions\nunder which it can be said to have emerged. The dynamics of $O$ is independent\nof its complement, $M-O$, if the projection of extremal curves on $M$ onto the\nspace of extremal curves intrinsic to $O$ is a surjective map. This roughly\ncorresponds to $e^{i\\hat{H}t}\\circ \\mathsf{pr}_{\\mbox{O}}= \\mathsf{pr}_{\\mbox{\nO}}\\circ e^{i\\hat{H}t}$, where $\\mathsf{pr}_{\\mbox{ O}}:\\mathcal{M}\\rightarrow\n\\mathcal{M}_O^{\\partial O}$ is a linear projection. This criterion for locality\ncan be made approximate -- an impossible feat had it been already postulated --\nand it can be applied for theories which do not have hyperbolic equations of\nmotion, and/or no fixed causal structure. When two regions are \\emph{mutually\nindependent} according to the criterion proposed here, the semi-classical path\nintegral kernel factorizes, showing cluster decomposition which is what one\nwould like to obtain from any definition of locality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 13:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 14:34:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 22:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 17:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

From our study we\nhave quantitatively confirmed previous results that during wave passage the\nplasma visible in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171A channel is\ngetting heated to higher temperatures corresponding to AIA 193A and 211A\nchannels. We have calculated an increase of 6 - 9% in density and 5 - 6% in\ntemperature during the passage of the EUV wave. We have compared the variation\nin temperature with the adiabatic relationship and have quantitatively\ndemonstrated the phenomenon of heating due to adiabatic compression at the wave\nfront. However, the cooling phase does not follow adiabatic relaxation but\nshows slow decay indicating slow energy release being triggered by the wave\npassage. We have also identified that heating is taking place at the front of\nthe wave pulse rather than at the rear. Our results provide support for the\ncase that the event under study here is a compressive fast-mode wave or a\nshock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 14:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Optical observations, of both the linear and circular\npolarisation components, have been impeded due to non-optimised\ninstrumentation. The need for suitable observing conditions and the\navailability of luminous targets are also limiting factors. GASP uses division\nof amplitude polarimeter (DOAP) (Compain and Drevillon) to measure the four\ncomponents of the Stokes vector simultaneously, which eliminates the\nconstraints placed upon the need for moving parts during observation, and\noffers a real-time complete measurement of polarisation. Results from the GASP\ncalibration are presented in this work for both a 1D detector system, and a\npixel-by-pixel analysis on a 2D detector system. Following Compain et al. we\nuse the Eigenvalue Calibration Method (ECM) to measure the polarimetric\nlimitations of the instrument for each of the two systems. Consequently, the\nECM is able to compensate for systematic errors introduced by the calibration\noptics, and it also accounts for all optical elements of the polarimeter in the\noutput. Initial laboratory results of the ECM are presented, using APD\ndetectors, where errors of 0.2% and 0.1{\\deg} were measured for the degree of\nlinear polarisation and polarisation angle respectively. Channel-to-channel\nimage registration is an important aspect of 2-D polarimetry. We present our\ncalibration results of the measured Mueller matrix of each sample, used by the\nECM. A set of Zenith flat-field images were recorded during an observing\ncampaign at the Palomar 200 inch telescope in November 2012. From these we show\nthe polarimetric errors from the spatial polarimetry indicating both the\nstability and absolute accuracy of GASP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 14:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

We study the velocity dispersion\nbehaviour of Galactic disc stars as a function of the [Mg/Fe] ratio, which can\nbe used as a proxy of relative age. This key relation is essential to constrain\nthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the cooling\nprocesses. We used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800\nFGK Milky Way field stars from the second internal data release of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. These stars were observed with the GIRAFFE spectrograph, and cover a\nlarge spatial volume (6<R<10kpc and |Z|<2kpc). Based on the [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H]\nratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. From analysing the\nGalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positive\ncorrelation between Vphi and [Fe/H], due to a slowly rotating Fe-poor tail. For\nthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] is established. We\nhave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [Mg/Fe] for\nthick-disc stars with [Fe/H]<-0.1dex and [Mg/Fe]>+0.2dex. First, the velocity\ndispersion increases with [Mg/Fe] at all [Fe/H] ratios for the thin-disc stars,\nand then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [Mg/Fe] abundances.\nSimilar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocity\ndispersion, while a continuous increase with [Mg/Fe] is observed for the\nvertical velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersion decrease agrees with\nprevious measurements of the RAVE survey, although it is observed here for a\ngreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. We confirm the\nexistence of [Mg/Fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in the\ngenerally turbulent context of the primitive Galactic disc. This is discussed\nin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 14:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-04"}

Calculating heat capacity, we study the\nstability and phase transitions of these black holes. We show that Maxwell,\nlogarithmic and exponential theories yield only type one phase transition which\nis related to the root(s) of heat capacity. Whereas for correction form of\nnonlinear electrodynamics, heat capacity contains two roots and one divergence\npoint. Next, we use geometrical approach for studying classical thermodynamical\nbehavior of the system. We show that Weinhold and Ruppeiner metrics fail to\nprovide fruitful results and the consequences of the Quevedo approach are not\ncompletely matched to the heat capacity results. Then, we employ a new metric\nfor solving this problem. We show that this approach is successful and all\ndivergencies of its Ricci scalar and phase transition points coincide. We also\nshow that there is no phase transition for uncharged BTZ black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 18:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-23"}

Due to internal degrees of freedom of such hadron field, it can\ninteract with gauge fields. This interaction is introduced by a standard\nderivative extension. The gauge field which was obtained in this way revealed\nto be a multi-particle field. We construct the dynamic equations for this\nmulti-particle gauge field. It was shown that the solutions of these equations\ncan describe the interaction of quarks inside hadrons and also the interaction\nof quarks in different hadrons via two-particle gluon field. Quanta of this\ntwo-gluon field can be considered as bound states of two gluons.

Further,\na combinatorial analysis of the binding sequences (contiguous sequence of amino\nacid residues of binding locations) is performed to build graph-theoretic\nmodels, which show that PPCA differs from its homologues.
