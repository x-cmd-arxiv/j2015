The extreme plasma parameters in these\nenvironments, e.g. high Reynolds numbers, supersonic and super-Alfvenic flows,\nhowever, make direct numerical simulations computationally intractable even for\nthe simplest treatment -- magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). To overcome this problem\none can use subgrid-scale (SGS) closures -- models for the influence of\nunresolved, subgrid-scales on the resolved ones. In this work we propose and\nvalidate a set of constant coefficient closures for the resolved, compressible,\nideal MHD equations. The subgrid-scale energies are modeled by Smagorinsky-like\nequilibrium closures. The turbulent stresses and the electromotive force (EMF)\nare described by expressions that are nonlinear in terms of large scale\nvelocity and magnetic field gradients. To verify the closures we conduct a\npriori tests over 137 simulation snapshots from two different codes with\nvarying ratios of thermal to magnetic pressure ($\\beta_\\mathrm{p} = 0.25, 1,\n2.5, 5, 25$) and sonic Mach numbers ($M_s = 2, 2.5, 4$).

Most of the existing reuse approaches\nare based on syntactic or semantic equivalence of constraints; e.g. the Green\nframework is able to reuse constraints which have different representations but\nare semantically equivalent, through canonizing constraints into syntactically\nequivalent normal forms. However, syntactic/semantic equivalence is not a\nnecessary condition for reuse--some constraints are not syntactically or\nsemantically equivalent, but their solutions still have potential for reuse.\nExisting approaches are unable to recognize and reuse such constraints.\n  In this paper, we present GreenTrie, an extension to the Green framework,\nwhich supports constraint reuse based on the logical implication relations\namong constraints. GreenTrie provides a component, called L-Trie, which stores\nconstraints and solutions into tries, indexed by an implication partial order\ngraph of constraints.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\nphoto-sketch generation, aiming to automatically transform face photos into\ndetail-preserving personal sketches. Unlike the traditional models synthesizing\nsketches based on a dictionary of exemplars, we develop a fully convolutional\nnetwork to learn the end-to-end photo-sketch mapping. Our approach takes whole\nface photos as inputs and directly generates the corresponding sketch images\nwith efficient inference and learning, in which the architecture are stacked by\nonly convolutional kernels of very small sizes.

In contrast, motility arrest is associated with\nre-symmetrization of the internal configuration of a cell. Experiments on\nkeratocytes suggest that polarization is triggered by the increased\ncontractility of motor proteins but the conditions of re-symmetrization remain\nunknown. In this paper we show that if adhesion with the extra-cellular\nsubstrate is sufficiently low, the progressive intensification of motor-induced\ncontraction may be responsible for both transitions: from static (symmetric) to\nmotile (polarized) at a lower contractility threshold and from motile\n(polarized) back to static (symmetric) at a higher contractility threshold. Our\nmodel of lamellipodial cell motility is based on a 1D projection of the complex\nintra-cellular dynamics on the direction of locomotion. In the interest of\nanalytical transparency we also neglect active protrusion and view adhesion as\npassive. Despite the unavoidable oversimplifications associated with these\nassumptions, the model reproduces quantitatively the motility initiation\npattern in fish keratocytes and reveals a crucial role played in cell motility\nby the nonlocal feedback between the mechanics and the transport of active\nagents. A prediction of the model that a crawling cell can stop and\nre-symmetrize when contractility increases sufficiently far beyond the motility\ninitiation threshold still awaits experimental verification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 16:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 12:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The main active processes in this layer are\nprotrusion, originating from non-equilibrium polymerization of actin fibers,\ncontraction, induced by myosin molecular motors and attachment due to active\nbonding of trans-membrane proteins to a substrate. All three active mechanisms\nare regulated by complex signaling pathways involving chemical and mechanical\nfeedback loops whose microscopic functioning is still poorly understood. In\nthis situation, it is instructive to take a reverse engineering approach and\nstudy a problem of finding the spatial organization of standard active elements\ninside a crawling layer ensuring an optimal cost-performance trade-off. In this\npaper we assume that (in the range of interest) the energetic cost of\nself-propulsion is velocity independent and adopt, as an optimality criterion,\nthe maximization of the overall velocity.

Recently three water models have\nbeen developed following the adaptive force matching (AFM) method that provides\nexcellent predictions of water properties with only electronic structure\ninformation as a reference. Compared to many other electronic structure based\nforce fields that rely on fairly sophisticated energy expressions, the AFM\nwater models use point-charge based energy expressions that are supported by\nmost popular molecular dynamics packages. An outstanding question regarding\nsimple force fields is whether such force fields provide reasonable\ntransferability outside of their conditions of parameterization. A survey of\nthree AFM water models, B3LYPD-4F, BLYPSP-4F, and WAIL are provided for\nsimulations under conditions ranging from the melting point up to the critical\npoint. By including ice-Ih configurations in the training set, the WAIL\npotential predicts the melting temperate, TM, of ice-Ih correctly. Without\ntraining for ice, BLYPSP-4F underestimates TM by about 15 K. Interestingly, the\nB3LYPD-4F model gives a TM 14 K too high. The overestimation of TM by B3LYPD-4F\nmostly likely reflects a deficiency of the B3LYP reference. The BLYPSP-4F model\ngives the best estimate of the boiling temperature TB and is arguably the best\npotential for simulating water in the temperature range from TM to TB. None of\nthe three AFM potentials provides a good description of the critical point.\nAlthough the B3LYPD-4F model gives the correct critical temperature TC and\ncritical density, there are good reasons to believe the agreement is reached\nfortuitously. Links to Gromacs input files for the three water models are\nprovided at the end of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 17:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Building on recent results by the third author we show that in order to\nprovide such a coalgebraic generalization of the Janin-Walukiewicz Theorem, it\nsuffices to find what we call an adequate uniform construction for the functor.\nAs applications of this result we obtain a partly new proof of the\nJanin-Walukiewicz Theorem, and bisimulation invariance results for the bag\nfunctor (graded modal logic) and all exponential polynomial functors.\n  Finally, we consider in some detail the monotone neighborhood functor, which\nprovides coalgebraic semantics for monotone modal logic.

The biofilm material is represented as a network of\nHookean springs that are placed along the edges of a triangulation of the\nbiofilm region. The interfacial shear stress, lift and drag forces acting on\nthe biofilm colony are computed by using fluid stress jump method developed by\nWilliams, Fauci and Gaver [Disc. Contin. Dyn. Sys. B 11(2):519-540, 2009], with\na modified version of their exclusion filter. Our detachment criterion is based\non the novel concept of an averaged equivalent continuum stress tensor defined\nat each IB point in the biofilm which is then used to determine a corresponding\nvon Mises yield stress; wherever this yield stress exceeds a given critical\nthreshold the connections to that node are severed, thereby signalling the\nonset of a detachment event. In order to capture the deformation and detachment\nbehaviour of a biofilm colony at different stages of growth, we consider a\nfamily of four biofilm shapes with varying aspect ratio. Our numerical\nsimulations focus on the behaviour of weak biofilms (with relatively low yield\nstress threshold) and investigate features of the fluid-structure interaction\nsuch as locations of maximum shear and increased drag. The most important\nconclusion of this work is that the commonly employed detachment strategy in\nbiofilm models based only on interfacial shear stress can lead to incorrect or\ninaccurate results when applied to the study of shear induced detachment of\nweak biofilms. Our detachment strategy based on equivalent continuum stresses\nprovides a unified and consistent IB framework that handles both sloughing and\nerosion modes of biofilm detachment, and is consistent with strategies employed\nin many other continuum based biofilm models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 18:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

Correcting for these lines,\nmostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on\nobservations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the\nscience targets, therefore using precious observing time. Aims: We present\nmolecfit, a tool for correcting for telluric absorption lines based on\nsynthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is\nversatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based\ntelescopes and instruments. Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available\nradiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and\nvarious kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric\nprofiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative\nof a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of\ndynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and\nhumidity.

The system is expected to (locally) relax to a\nthermal ensemble if integrability is broken, or to a so-called generalised\nGibbs ensemble if unbroken. In some circumstances expectation values exhibit\nquasi-stationary behaviour long before their typical relaxation time. For\nintegrability-breaking perturbations, these are also called pre-thermalisation\nplateaux, and emerge e.g. in the strong coupling limit of the Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. As a result of the hidden symmetries, quasi-stationarity appears also in\nintegrable models, for example in the Ising limit of the XXZ model. We\ninvestigate a weak coupling limit, identify a time window in which the effects\nof the perturbations become significant and solve the time evolution through a\nmean-field mapping. As an explicit example we study the XYZ spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\nchain with additional perturbations that break integrability. One of the most\nintriguing results of the analysis is the appearance of persistent oscillatory\nbehaviour. To unravel its origin, we study in detail a toy model: the\ntransverse-field Ising chain with an additional nonlocal interaction\nproportional to the square of the transverse spin per unit length [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 111, 197203 (2013)].

The resulting absorption line strength\nand shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e.\npressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved.\nUsually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS)\nare needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope\ntime. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic\ntransmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of\nthe observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by\nmeans of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this\nway, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed\nwithout any additional calibration observations of TSS. Aims: We evaluate the\nquality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of\narchival ESO-VLT X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra. Methods: Thanks\nto the wavelength coverage from the U to the K band, X-Shooter is well suited\nto investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect\nto the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the\ncode, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles.\nThese investigations are based on two figures of merit, I_off and I_res, that\ndescribe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the\ncorrections.

As a consequence they are comparatively easily driven out of\ntheir ground state and out of equilibrium, which leads to many of their\nfascinating properties. Here, we review illustrative examples. This review is\nstructured by an increasing distance from the equilibrium ground state. On each\nlevel, examples of increasing degree of complexity are considered. In detail,\nwe first consider systems that are quasi-statically tuned or switched to a new\nstate by applying external fields. These are common liquid crystals, liquid\ncrystalline elastomers, or ferrogels and magnetic elastomers. Next, we\nconcentrate on systems steadily driven from outside e.g. by an imposed flow\nfield. In our case, we review the reaction of nematic liquid crystals, of\nbulk-filling periodically modulated structures such as block copolymers, and of\nlocalized vesicular objects to an imposed shear flow. Finally, we focus on\nsystems that are \"active\" and \"self-driven\". Here our range spans from\nidealized self-propelled point particles, via sterically interacting particles\nlike granular hoppers, via microswimmers such as self-phoretically driven\nartificial Janus particles or biological microorganisms, via deformable\nself-propelled particles like droplets, up to the collective behavior of\ninsects, fish, and birds. As we emphasize, similarities emerge in the features\nand behavior of systems that at first glance may not necessarily appear\nrelated. We thus hope that our overview will further stimulate the search for\nbasic unifying principles underlying the physics of these soft materials out of\ntheir equilibrium ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 20:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-29"}

In particular, simple models of\nthis type can explain the gamma ray excess originating in the Galactic Center\nas observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. In many cases the pseudoscalar's\nbranching ratio into WIMPs is suppressed, making these states challenging to\ndetect at colliders through standard dark matter searches. Here, we study the\nprospects for observing these light mediator states at the LHC without\nexploiting missing energy techniques. While existing searches effectively probe\npseudoscalars with masses between 5 - 14 GeV and above 90 GeV, the LHC reach\ncan be extended to cover much of the interesting parameter space in the\nintermediate 20 - 80 GeV mass range in which the mediator can have appreciable\nYukawa-like couplings to Standard Model fermions but would have escaped\ndetection by LEP and other experiments. Models explaining the Galactic Center\nexcess via a light pseudoscalar mediator can give rise to a promising signal in\nthis regime through the associated production of the mediator with bottom\nquarks while satisfying all other existing constraints. We perform an analysis\nof the backgrounds and trigger efficiencies, detailing the cuts that can be\nused to extract the signal. A significant portion of the otherwise\nunconstrained parameter space of these models can be conclusively tested at the\n13 TeV LHC with 100 fb$^{-1}$, and we encourage the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations to extend their existing searches to this mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 21:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In the circular binary case, no Lindblad resonances lie within the disc\nand no Lindblad resonant torques are produced, as was previously known. By\nanalytic means, we show that when the binary orbit is eccentric, there exist\ncomponents of the gravitational potential of the binary which rotate in a\nretrograde sense to the binary orbit and so rotate progradely with respect to\nthis disc, allowing a resonant interaction to occur between the binary and the\ndisc. The resulting resonant torques distinctly alter the disc response from\nthe circular binary case. We describe results of three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations to explore this effect and categorise the response of the disc in\nterms of modes whose strengths vary as a function of binary mass ratio and\neccentricity. These mode strengths are weak compared to the largest mode\nstrengths expected in the prograde case where the binary and disc rotate in the\nsame sense. However, for sufficiently high binary eccentricity, resonant\ntorques open a gap in a retrograde circumbinary disc, while permitting gas\ninflow on to the binary via gas streams. The inflow results in a time varying\naccretion rate on to the binary that is modulated over the binary orbital\nperiod, as was previously found to occur in the prograde case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 21:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In addition, star formation may occur throughout the ring, if\nand when the gas reaches sufficient density to collapse under gravity.

In principle it should\nbe possible to form analogous systems from mu and tau leptons, viz. true\nmuonium and true tauonium.

Likewise, the decay of the atoms is hastened by the high\nprobability of the constituent particles decaying. Nevertheless, if sufficient\nnumbers of mu and tau pairs are produced in high energy astrophysical\nenvironments there may be significant production of true muonium and true\ntauonium, despite the small probabilities.

We include the effect of multiple scatterings\nwithin each shell, properly accounting for the atomic structure of the\nscattering ions. We also account for the effect of a finite circular aperture\non actual observations.

We show that\nscattered resonant emission fills in the resonant absorption profiles, with a\nstrength that is different for each transition.

While we do find several low-significance possible flares with\npotential indications of rapid variability, we find no strong evidence for\nrapid ($<$15 minutes) doubling or halving times in flares in the soft X-ray\nenergy band for the AGNs analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 21:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In algorithm perspective, the architecture\nperforms a high-dimensional analysis, and compares the findings with RMT\npredictions to conduct anomaly detections. Mean Spectral Radius (MSR), as a\nstatistical indicator, is defined to reflect the correlations of system data in\ndifferent dimensions. In management mode perspective, a group-work mode is\ndiscussed for smart grids operation. This mode breaks through regional\nlimitations for energy flows and data flows, and makes advanced big data\nanalyses possible. For a specific large-scale zone-dividing system with\nmultiple connected utilities, each site, operating under the group-work mode,\nis able to work out the regional MSR only with its own measured/simulated data.\nThe large-scale interconnected system, in this way, is naturally decoupled from\nstatistical parameters perspective, rather than from engineering models\nperspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of these distributed MSRs,\neven with imperceptible different raw data, will produce a contour line to\ndetect the event and locate the source. It demonstrates that the architecture\nis compatible with the block calculation only using the regional small\ndatabase; beyond that, this architecture, as a data-driven solution, is\nsensitive to system situation awareness, and practical for real large-scale\ninterconnected systems.

We work in black-hole perturbation theory,\nand focus on non-spinning, uncharged particles sent in on equatorial orbits. We\nfirst identify the complete parameter-space region in which overspinning occurs\nwhen back-reaction effects from the particle's self-gravity are ignored. We\nfind, in particular, that overspinning can be achieved only with particles sent\nin from infinity. Gravitational self-force effects may prevent overspinning by\nradiating away a sufficient amount of the particle's angular momentum\n(\"dissipative effect\"), and/or by increasing the effective centrifugal\nrepulsion, so that particles with suitable parameters never get captured\n(\"conservative effect\"). We analyze the full effect of the self-force, thereby\ncompleting previous studies by Jacobson and Sotiriou (who neglected the\nself-force) and by Barausse, Cardoso and Khanna (who considered the dissipative\neffect on a subset of orbits). Our main result is an inequality, involving\ncertain self-force quantities, which describes a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the overspinning scenario to be overruled. This \"censorship\"\ncondition is formulated on a certain one-parameter family of geodesics in an\nextremal Kerr geometry. We find that the censorship condition is insensitive to\nthe dissipative effect (within the first-order self-force approximation used\nhere), except for a subset of perfectly fine-tuned orbits, for which a separate\ncensorship condition is derived.

The reason is\nthat dislocation dipoles, which play an important role in determining the\nmechanical properties of crystals, often get smeared out when traditional\nhomogenisation methods are applied. To address such difficulties, the\ncollective behaviour of a row of dislocation dipoles is studied by using\nmatched asymptotic techniques. The discrete-to-continuum transition is\nfacilitated by introducing two field variables respectively describing the\ndislocation pair density potential and the dislocation pair width. It is found\nthat the dislocation pair width evolves much faster than the pair density. Such\nhierarchy in evolution time scales enables us to describe the dislocation\ndynamics at the coarse-grained level by an evolution equation for the slowly\nvarying variable (the pair density) coupled with an equilibrium equation for\nthe fast varying variable (the pair width). The time-scale separation method\nadopted here paves a way for properly incorporating dipole-like (zero net\nBurgers vector but non-vanishing) dislocation structures, known as the\nstatistically stored dislocations (SSDs) into macroscopic models of crystal\nplasticity in three dimensions.

The composition maps\nshow how FIP bias evolves within the decaying AR from 2012 January 4-6.\nGlobally, FIP bias decreases throughout the AR. We analyzed areas of\nsignificant plasma composition changes within the decaying AR and found that\nsmall-scale evolution in the photospheric magnetic field is closely linked to\nthe FIP bias evolution observed in the corona. During the AR's decay phase,\nsmall bipoles emerging within supergranular cells reconnect with the\npre-existing AR field, creating a pathway along which photospheric and coronal\nplasmas can mix. The mixing time scales are shorter than those of plasma\nenrichment processes. Eruptive activity also results in shifting the FIP bias\ncloser to photospheric in the affected areas. Finally, the FIP bias still\nremains dominantly coronal only in a part of the AR's high-flux density core.\nWe conclude that in the decay phase of an AR's lifetime, the FIP bias is\nbecoming increasingly modulated by episodes of small-scale flux emergence, i.e.\ndecreasing the AR's overall FIP bias.

The\nclassification has been repeated with the external CFLIB library.\n  The spectral class obtained with the external library agrees within a few\nsub-classes when the target spectrum has a SNR of about 100 at least. While the\nphotometric spectral type can deviate by an entire spectral class, the\nphotometric luminosity classification is as close as a spectroscopic\nclassification with the external library. A low SNR of the target spectrum\nlimits the attainable accuracy of classification more strongly than the use of\nexternal templates or photometry.

We use 15 GHz\nradio data obtained with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40-m telescope, 95\nGHz millimeter data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave\nAstronomy, and GeV gamma-ray data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The\nradio light curves during the flaring periods in 2012 and 2013 have very\ndifferent appearances, both in shape and peak flux density. Assuming that the\nradio and gamma-ray flares are physically connected, we attempt to model the\nmost prominent sub-flares of the 2012 and 2013 activity periods by using the\nsimplest possible theoretical framework. We first fit a one-zone synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) model to the less extreme 2013 flare and estimate parameters\ndescribing the emission region. We then model the major gamma-ray and radio\nflares of 2012 using the same framework. The 2012 gamma-ray flare shows two\ndistinct spikes of similar amplitude, so we examine scenarios associating the\nradio flare with each spike in turn. In the first scenario, we cannot explain\nthe sharp radio flare with a simple SSC model, but we can accommodate this by\nadding plausible time variations to the Doppler beaming factor. In the second\nscenario, a varying Doppler factor is not needed, but the SSC model parameters\nrequire fine tuning. Both alternatives indicate that the sharp radio flare, if\nphysically connected to the preceding gamma-ray flares, can be reproduced only\nfor a very specific choice of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 10:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 10:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In particular\nwe focus on the simplest model of this kind, where the spacetime is described\nby a non-singular Kasner solution that quickly evolves into an isotropic de\nSitter space, the so-called Kasner-de Sitter solution. The initial Big Bang\nsingularity is replaced, in this case, by a horizon. We show that the extension\nof this metric to the region behind the horizon contains a timelike singularity\nwhich will be visible by cosmological observers. This makes it impossible to\nhave a reliable prediction of the quantum state of the cosmological\nperturbations in the region of interest. In this paper we consider the\npossibility that this Kasner-de Sitter universe is obtained as a result of a\nquantum tunneling process effectively substituting the region behind the\nhorizon by an anisotropic parent vacuum state, namely a $1+1$ dimensional\nspacetime compactified over an internal flat torus, $T_2$, which we take it to\nbe of the form ${de Sitter}_2 \\times T_2$ or ${Minkowski}_2 \\times T_2$. As a\nfirst approximation to understand the effects of this anisotropic initial\nstate, we compute the power spectrum of a massless scalar field in these\nbackgrounds. In both cases, the spectrum converges at small scales to the\nisotropic scale invariant form and only present important deviations from it at\nthe largest possible scales. We find that the decompactification scenario from\n$M_2 \\times T_2$ leads to a suppressed and slightly anisotropic power spectrum\nat large scales which could be related to some of the anomalies present in the\ncurrent CMB data. On the other hand, the spectrum of the universe with a $dS_2\n\\times T_2$ parent vacuum presents an enhancement in power at large scales not\nconsistent with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 12:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 17:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Formed by runaway collisions of massive stars in young and\ndense stellar clusters, intermediate-mass black holes could still be present in\nthe centers of globular clusters, today. Our group investigated the presence of\nintermediate-mass black holes for a sample of 10 Galactic globular clusters. We\nmeasured the inner kinematic profiles with integral-field spectroscopy and\ndetermined masses or upper limits of central black holes in each cluster. In\ncombination with literature data we further studied the positions of our\nresults on known black-hole scaling relations (such as M_bh - sigma) and found\na similar but flatter correlation for IMBHs. Applying cluster evolution codes,\nthe change in the slope could be explained with the stellar mass loss occurring\nin clusters in a tidal field over its life time. Furthermore, we present\nresults from several numerical simulations on the topic of IMBHs and integral\nfield units (IFUs). We ran N-body simulations of globular clusters containing\nIMBHs in a tidal field and studied their effects on mass-loss rates and remnant\nfractions and showed that an IMBH in the center prevents core collapse and\nejects massive objects more rapidly. These simulations were further used to\nsimulate IFU data cubes.

This interrelation of a higher-dimensional\nMarkovian and lower-dimensional non-Markovian dynamics is discussed in its\nrelevance to the general problem of the network dynamics of complex elements\npossessing memory. The simplest model of this class is provided by a\nthree-state Markovian neuron with one refractory state, which causes firing\ndelay with an exponentially decaying memory within the two-state reduced model.\nThis basic model is used to study critical avalanche dynamics (the noise\nsustained criticality) in a balanced feedforward network consisting of the\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons. Such avalanches emerge due to the network\nsize dependent noise (mesoscopic noise). Numerical simulations reveal an\nintermediate power law in the distribution of avalanche sizes with the critical\nexponent around -1.16.

As a high resolution radar imaging modality, SAR detects and\nidentifies stationary targets very well, giving it an advantage over classical\nGMTI radars. Moving target detection is more challenging due to the \"burying\"\nof moving targets in the clutter and is often achieved using space-time\nadaptive processing (STAP) (based on learning filters from the spatio-temporal\nclutter covariance) to remove the stationary clutter and enhance the moving\ntargets. In this work, it is noted that in addition to the oft noted low rank\nstructure, the clutter covariance is also naturally in the form of a space vs\ntime Kronecker product with low rank factors. A low-rank KronPCA covariance\nestimation algorithm is proposed to exploit this structure, and a separable\nclutter cancelation filter based on the Kronecker covariance estimate is\nproposed. Together, these provide orders of magnitude reduction in the number\nof training samples required, as well as improved robustness to corruption of\nthe training data, e.g. due to outliers and moving targets. Theoretical\nproperties of the proposed estimation algorithm are derived and the significant\nreductions in training complexity are established under the spherically\ninvariant random vector model (SIRV). Finally, an extension of this approach\nincorporating multipass data (change detection) is presented. Simulation\nresults and experiments using the real Gotcha SAR GMTI challenge dataset are\npresented that confirm the advantages of our approach relative to existing\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 15:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 18:25:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 18:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

In\nthe plutonium case, this element was considered initially in the alpha-phase or\nstabilized in the delta-phase. In the last case, an abrupt and instantaneous\ntransition to the alpha-phase was considered when the delta-phase plutonium is\nsubmitted to strong compressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 15:49:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 19:27:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 23:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 16:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-23"}

By employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of\nthe current generator is increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of\nthe output transistor. To make the stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation\ncurrent is set by scaling a reference current using a two stage binary-weighted\ntransistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a 4 bit\nlow-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the\narea of the circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented\nin AMS 0.18um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of\nabout 0.042mm^2. Measurement results show that proper charge balance of the\nanodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor\ncan be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the proposed\nsystem suitable for a large number of channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 09:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}
