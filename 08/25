We show that this problem has to be treated as a\nmulti-dimensional Kramers' problem, which presents rich and unexpected\nbehavior. We first perform direct and forward-flux sampling (FFS) simulations,\nand measure the mean first-passage time $\\tau(z)$ for the free end to reach a\ncertain distance $z$ away from the origin. The results show that the mean FP\ntime is getting faster if the Rouse chain is represented by more beads. Two\nscaling regimes of $\\tau(z)$ are observed, with transition between them varying\nas a function of chain length. We use these simulations results to test two\ntheoretical approaches. One is a well known asymptotic theory valid in the\nlimit of zero temperature. We show that this limit corresponds to fully\nextended chain when each chain segment is stretched, which is not particularly\nrealistic. A new theory based on the well known Freidlin-Wentzell theory is\nproposed, where dynamics is projected onto the minimal action path. The new\ntheory predicts both scaling regimes correctly, but fails to get the correct\nnumerical prefactor in the first regime. Combining our theory with the FFS\nsimulations lead us to a simple analytical expression valid for all extensions\nand chain lengths. One of the applications of polymer FP problem occurs in the\ncontext of branched polymer rheology. In this paper, we consider the\narm-retraction mechanism in the tube model, which maps exactly on the model we\nhave solved.

When posed as a nonlinear least squares problem\nfitting a model to data, the cost of each iteration grows linearly with the\namount of data and it can easily become prohibitively expensive to perform many\niterations. Here we develop an approach that projects the data onto a\nlow-dimensional subspace of the high-dimensional data that preserves the\ninformation in the original data. We provide results from both optimization and\nstatistical perspectives showing that the information is preserved when the\nsubspace angles between this projection and the Jacobian of the model at the\ncurrent iterate remain small. However, for this approach to reduce\ncomputational complexity, both the projected model and Jacobian must be\ncomputed inexpensively. This is a constraint on the pairs of models and\nsubspaces for which this approach provides a computational speedup. Here we\nconsider the exponential fitting problem projected onto the range of\nVandermonde matrix, for which the projected model and Jacobian can be computed\nin closed form using a generalized geometric sum formula. We further provide an\ninexpensive heuristic that picks this Vandermonde matrix so that the subspace\nangles with the Jacobian remain small and use this heuristic to update the\nsubspace during optimization. Although the asymptotic cost still depends on the\ndata dimension, the overall cost of this sequence of projected nonlinear least\nsquares problems is less expensive than the original nonlinear least squares\nproblem. Applied to the exponential fitting problem, this provides an algorithm\nthat is not only faster in the limit of large data than the conventional\nnonlinear least squares approach, but is also faster than subspace based\napproaches such as HSVD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 17:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 18:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 16:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-01"}

Two instances are considered. The\nfirst instance pertains to the general case in which each subcarrier can be\ntimeshared by multiple links, whereas the second instance pertains to a special\ncase in which time-sharing is not allowed and a subcarrier, once assigned to a\nset of links, is used by those links throughout the signalling interval.

Measuring the evolution of $w$\nalong the redshift is one of the most demanding challenges for observational\ncosmology. Aims: We discuss the existence of a close relation for GRBs, named\nCombo-relation, based on characteristic parameters of GRB phenomenology such as\nthe prompt intrinsic peak energy $E_{p,i}$, the X-ray afterglow, the initial\nluminosity of the shallow phase $L_0$, the rest-frame duration $\\tau$ of the\nshallow phase, and the index of the late power-law decay $\\alpha_X$. We use it\nto measure $\\Omega_m$ and the evolution of the dark energy equation of state.\nWe also propose a new calibration method for the same relation, which reduces\nthe dependence on SNe Ia systematics. Methods: We have selected a sample of\nGRBs with 1) a measured redshift $z$; 2) a determined intrinsic prompt peak\nenergy $E_{p,i}$, and 3) a good coverage (0.3-10) keV afterglow light curves.\nThe fitting technique of the rest.frame (0.3-10) keV luminosity light curves\nrepresents the core of the Combo-relation. We separate the early steep decay,\nconsidered a part of the prompt emission, from the X-ray afterglow additional\ncomponent. Data with the largest positive residual, identified as flares, are\nautomatically eliminated until the p-value of the fit becomes greater than 0.3.\nResults: We strongly minimize the dependency of the Combo-GRB calibration on\nSNe Ia. We also measure a small extra-Poissonian scatter of the Combo-relation,\nwhich allows us to infer from GRBs alone $\\Omega_M =0.29^{+0.23}_{-0.15}$\n(1$\\sigma$) for the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, and $\\Omega_M\n=0.40^{+0.22}_{-0.16}$, $w_0 = -1.43^{+0.78}_{-0.66}$ for the flat-Universe\nvariable equation of state case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 18:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 12:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

A judicious combination of low-symmetry\nbuilding unit and high-symmetry topological template leads to aperiodic\n\"procrystalline\" solids that harbour this type of topological disorder. We\nidentify key classes of procrystalline states together with their\ncharacteristic diffraction behaviour, and establish a variety of mappings onto\nknown and target materials.

DWD was originally proposed as a superior\nalternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be\npopular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone\nprogramming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is\nmuch more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD\nmainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting\nand data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the\nBayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency\nof DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work,\nwe advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and\ntheoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving\nDWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing\nstate-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can\nhandle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a\nspecial DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural\nkernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes\nrisk consistency of the kernel DWD.

The analysis is performed with the aid of\nthe real-time diagrammatic technique in the sequential tunneling regime. We\nstudy the dependence of the Andreev current, the differential conductance, and\nthe tunnel magnetoresistance on various parameters of the model in both the\nlinear and nonlinear response regimes. In particular, we analyze the\nspin-resolved transport in the crossed Andreev reflection regime, where a\nblockade of the current occurs due to enhanced occupation of the triplet state.\nWe show that in the triplet blockade, finite intradot correlations can lead to\nconsiderable leakage current due to direct Andreev reflection processes.\nFurthermore, we find additional regimes of current suppression resulting from\nenhanced occupation of singlet states, which decreases the rate of crossed\nAndreev reflection.We also study how the splitting of Andreev bound states,\ntriggered by either dot level detuning, finite hopping between the dots, or\nfinite magnetic field, affects the Andreev current. While in the first two\ncases the number of Andreev bound states is doubled, whereas transport\nproperties are qualitatively similar, in the case of finite magnetic field\nfurther level splitting occurs, leading to a nontrivial behavior of\nspin-resolved transport characteristics, and especially that of tunneling\nmagnetoresistance.

In his seminal work, John\nBell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can\nreproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local\nrealist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an\ninequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to\nquantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the\nfundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades,\nnumerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because\nof experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional\nassumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in\nloopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such\nadditional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's\ninequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of\nhigh-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin\nreadout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use\nof fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation\nof 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials\ntesting the CHSH-Bell inequality $S \\leq 2$ and find $S = 2.42 \\pm 0.20$. A\nnull hypothesis test yields a probability of $p = 0.039$ that a local-realist\nmodel for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as\nlarge as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result\nrules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for\nimplementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness\ncertification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 20:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-12"}

We explicitly calculate\nvacuum entanglement entropies in 1+1 dimension and we find a transition between\nlogarithmic and linear scaling of the entropy, which is the expected 1+1\ndimensional analog of the transition from an area to a volume law. We also use\nentanglement entropy and mutual information as measures to probe in detail the\nlocalizability of the field degrees of freedom. We find that, even though\nneither translation nor rotation invariance are broken, each field degree of\nfreedom occupies an incompressible volume of space, indicating a finite\ninformation density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 20:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

By definition,\nirregular orbits can not be represented by action-angle tori everywhere in\nphase space. This thwarts perturbation theory and complicates our understanding\nof their role in galaxy structure and evolution. This paper provides a\nqualitative introduction to a new method based on KAM theory for investigating\nthe morphology of regular and irregular orbits based on direct computation of\ntori described in Paper 1 and applies it to a galaxy disc bar. Using this\nmethod, we find that much of the phase space inside of the bar radius becomes\nchaotic for strong bars, excepting a small region in phase space between the\nILR and corotation resonances for orbits of moderate ellipticity. This helps\nexplain the preponderance of moderately eccentric bar-supporting orbits as the\nbar strength increases. This also suggests that bar strength may be limited by\nchaos! The chaos results from stochastic layers that form around primary\nresonances owing to separatrix splitting. Most investigations of orbit\nregularity are performed using numerical computation of Lyapunov exponents or\nrelated indices. We show that Lyapunov exponents poorly diagnose the degree of\nstochasticity in this problem; the island structure in the stochastic sheaths\nallow orbit to change morphology while presenting anomalously small Lyapunov\nexponent values (i.e. weak chaos). For example, a weakly chaotic orbit may\nappear to change its morphology spontaneously, while appearing regular except\nduring the change itself. The numerical KAM approach sensitively detects these\ndynamics and provides a model Hamiltonian for further investigation. It may\nunderpredict the number of broken tori for strong perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 20:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Our general aim is to\ndescribe and quantify the apparent \"latticelike\" microarchitecture of the\ntrabecular bone network.\n  Methods: Similar in some ways to the topological node-strut analysis\nintroduced by Garrahan et al. [J. Microsc. 142, 341-349 (1986)], our method is\ndistinguished by an emphasis on long-range trabecular connectivity. Thus, while\nthe topological classification of a pixel (after skeletonization) as a node,\nstrut, or terminus, can be determined from the 3x3 neighborhood of that pixel,\nour method, which does not involve skeletonization, takes into account a much\nlarger neighborhood. In addition, rather than giving a discrete classification\nof each pixel as a node, strut, or terminus, our method produces a continuous\nvariable, node strength.

Isotropy\nimplies that spatial dependence does not depend on the direction of the spatial\nseparation between sampling locations. Misspecification of isotropy properties\n(directional dependence) can lead to misleading inferences, e.g., inaccurate\npredictions and parameter estimates.

We perform\nmulti-million-atom atomistic tight-binding calculations to study the influence\nof electric fields on the electron and hole wave function confinements and\nsymmetries, the ground-state transition energies, the band-gap wavelengths, and\nthe optical transition modes. The electrical fields both parallel ($\\vec{E_p}$)\nand anti-parallel ($\\vec{E_a}$) to the growth direction are investigated to\nprovide a comprehensive guide on the understanding of the electric field\neffects. The strain-induced asymmetry of the hybridized electron states is\nfound to be weak and can be balanced by applying a small $\\vec{E_a}$ electric\nfield, of the order of 1 KV/cm. The strong interdot couplings completely break\ndown at large electric fields, leading to single QD states confined at the\nopposite edges of the QDM. This mimics a transformation from a type-I band\nstructure to a type-II band structure for the QDMs, which is a critical\nrequirement for the design of intermediate-band solar cells (IBSC). The\nanalysis of the field-dependent ground-state transition energies reveal that\nthe QDM can be operated both as a high dipole moment device by applying large\nelectric fields and as a high polarizibility device under the application of\nsmall electric field magnitudes.

In 2002 it was shown that in bacterium Escherichia coli and\nthe archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus, protein sequences with no homologs are, on\naverage, shorter than those with homologs. Most experts now agree that the\nlength distributions are distinctly different between protein sequences with\nand without homologs in bacterial and archaeal genomes. In this study, we\nexamine this postulate by a comprehensive analysis of all annotated prokaryotic\ngenomes and focusing on certain exceptions.\n  Results: We compared lengths distributions of having homologs proteins (HHPs)\nand non-having homologs proteins (orphans or ORFans) in all currently annotated\ncompletely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. As expected, the HHPs and ORFans have\nstrikingly different length distributions in almost all genomes. As previously\nestablished, the HHPs, indeed, are, on average, longer than the ORFans, and the\nlength distributions for the ORFans have a relatively narrow peak, in contrast\nto the HHPs, whose lengths spread over a wider range of values. However, about\nthirty genomes do not obey these rules. Practically all genomes of Mycoplasma\nand Ureaplasma have atypical ORFans distributions, with the mean lengths of\nORFan larger than the mean lengths of HHPs. These genera constitute over 80% of\natypical genomes.\n  Conclusions: We confirmed on a ubiquitous set of genomes the previous\nobservation that HHPs and ORFans have different gene length distributions. We\nalso showed that Mycoplasmataceae genomes have distinctive distributions of\nORFans lengths. We offer several possible biological explanations of this\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 22:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Classical techniques for\nidentifying the development of faults rely on acoustic testing. These\ntechniques, being invasive, may result in causing permanent damage to the\nmaterial, especially if the material is inspected periodically. Non destructive\ntesting has been carried out for different materials since long. In this\nregard, non-invasive systems were developed based on infrared thermometry\nprinciple to identify the faults in artworks. The test artwork is heated and\nthe thermal response of the different layers is captured with the help of a\nthermal infrared camera. However, prolonged heating risks overheating and thus\ncausing damage to artworks and an alternate approach is to use pseudo-random\nbinary sequence excitations. The faults in the artwork, though, cannot be\ndetected on the captured images, especially if their strength is weak. The\nweaker faults are either masked by the stronger ones, by the pictorial layer of\nthe artwork or by the non-uniform heating. This work addresses the detection\nand localization of the faults through a wavelet based subspace decomposition\nscheme. The proposed scheme, on one hand, allows to remove the background\nwhile, on the other hand, removes the undesired high frequency noise. It is\nshown that the detection parameter is proportional to the diameter and the\ndepth of the fault. A criterion is proposed to select the optimal wavelet basis\nalong with suitable level selection for wavelet decomposition and\nreconstruction. The proposed approach is tested on a laboratory developed test\nsample with known fault locations and dimensions as well as real artworks. A\ncomparison with a previously reported method demonstrates the efficacy of the\nproposed approach for fault detection in artworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 02:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

To investigate the role\nof bulges in shaping the MS, we compare the NUV$-r$ color between the central\n($r<R_{50}$) and outer regions for a sample of 6401 local star-forming\ngalaxies. The NUV$-r$ color is a good specific star formation rate indicator.\nWe find that at $M_{\\ast}<10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}$, the central NUV$-r$ is on average\nonly $\\sim$ 0.25 mag redder than the outer NUV$-r$. Above\n$M_{\\ast}=10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}$, the central NUV$-r$ becomes systematically much\nredder than the outer NUV$-r$ for more massive galaxies, indicating that the\ncentral bulge is more evolved at the massive end. When dividing the galaxies\naccording to their S\\'ersic index $n$, we find that galaxies with $n$>2.0 tend\nto be redder in the central NUV$-r$ color than those with $n$<2.0, even at\nfixed B/T and $M_{\\ast}$. This suggests that star formation in bulges is more\nstrongly dependent on $n$ (or central mass density) than on B/T. Finally, we\nfind that the fraction of galaxies with $n$>2.0 rapidly increases with\n$M_{\\ast}$ at $M_{\\ast}>10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}$, which is consistent with the\nturning over of the MS at the same transition mass. We conclude that the\nincreasing fraction of low-sSFR dense bulges in $M_{\\ast}>10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}$\ngalaxies, rather than increasing B/T, is responsible for the flattened slope of\nthe $M_{\\ast}$$-$SFR relation at high masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 03:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 01:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-31"}

After analyzing spin\nevolution in halo merging trees, it was found that a spin change can be\ncharacterized by a stochastic random walk of angular momentum. Also, spin\ndistributions generated by random walks are fairly consistent with those\ndirectly obtained from N-body simulations. We derived a stochastic differential\nequation from a widely used spin definition and measured the probability\ndistributions of the derived angular momentum change from a massive set of halo\nmerging trees. The roles of major merging and accretion are also statistically\nanalyzed in evolving spin distributions. Several factors (local environment,\nhalo mass, merging mass ratio, and redshift) are found to influence the angular\nmomentum change. The spin distributions generated in the mean-field or void\nregions tend to shift slightly to a higher spin value compared with simulated\nspin distributions, which seems to be caused by the correlated random walks. We\nverified the assumption of randomness in the angular momentum change observed\nin the N-body simulation and detected several degrees of correlation between\nwalks, which may provide a clue for the discrepancies between the simulated and\ngenerated spin distributions in the voids. However, the generated spin\ndistributions in the group and cluster regions successfully match the simulated\nspin distribution.

Since inside each molecule, individual\natoms conserve their identity, the intermolecular potential energy can be\nexpanded as the sum of pairwise atomic potential energies. In the case of\nEr$_2$ Feshbach molecules, we show that the interaction between atomic magnetic\ndipoles gives rise to the usual $R^{-3}$ term of the multipolar expansion, with\n$R$ the intermolecular distance, but also to additional terms scaling as\n$R^{-5}$, $R^{-7}$, and so on. Those terms are due to the interaction between\neffective molecular multipole moments, and are strongly anisotropic with\nrespect to the orientation of the molecules. Similarly the atomic pairwise van\nder Waals interaction results in $R^{-6}$, $R^{-8}$, ... terms in the\nintermolecular potential energy. By calculating the reduced electric-quadrupole\nmoment of erbium ground level $\\langle J=6||\\hat{Q}_2||J=6\\rangle = -1.305$\na.u., we also demonstrate that the electric-quadrupole interaction energy is\nnegligible with respect to the magnetic-dipole and van der Waals interaction\nenergies.

A high\nlevel of integration will be achieved by massively deploying state-of-the-art\nmulti-gigabit transmission channels, beginning from the ADC flash converters,\nthrough the internal data and trigger signals transmission over backplanes and\ncables, to the camera's server link. Such an approach makes it possible to\ndesign the camera to fit the size and weight requirements of the SST-1M\nexactly, and provide low power consumption, high reliability and long lifetime.\nThe structure of the digital electronics will be presented, along with main\nphysical building blocks and the internal architecture of FPGA functional\nsubsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 09:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

In\nthis report we discuss updated constraints on the stability of the\nfine-structure constant $\\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio\n$\\mu=m_p/m_e$ within the Galaxy. We revisit and improve upon the analysis by\nTruppe {\\it et al.} by allowing for the possibility of simultaneous variations\nof both couplings and also by combining them with the recent measurements by\nLevshakov {\\it et al.} By considering representative unification scenarios we\nfind no evidence for variations of $\\alpha$ at the 0.4 ppm level, and of $\\mu$\nat the 0.6 ppm level; if one uses the Levshakov bound on $\\mu$ as a prior,\nthe$\\alpha$ bound is improved to 0.1 ppm. We also highlight how these\nmeasurements can constrain (and discriminate among) several fundamental physics\nparadigms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 09:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

I explore the consequences of chiral symmetry for the values of\n$m_\\pi$ close to $m_\\pi^\\star$. It turns out that chiral symmetry is crucial\nfor an $S$-wave resonance to be able to stand very near threshold and in the\nmeantime to remain narrow, provided that the mass splitting is reasonably\nsmall. The effective range of pion-baryon scattering is unexpectedly large,\nproportional to $ 4\\pi f_\\pi^2/m_\\pi^3$ when $m_\\pi$ is around $m_\\pi^\\star$.\nAs a result, this unexpected large length scale causes universality relations\nto break down much sooner than naively expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 09:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

This manuscript presents several\nfractional-order Taylor expansions of H\\\"olderian functions around points of\nnon- differentiability. These expansions are derived using the concept of a\nfractional velocity, which can be used to describe the singular behavior of\nderivatives and non-differentiable functions. Fractional velocity is defined as\nthe limit of the difference quotient of the increment of a function and the\ndifference of its argument raised to a fractional power. Fractional velocity\ncan be used to regularize ordinary derivatives. To this end, it is possible to\ndefine regularized Taylor series and compound differential rules. In particular\na compound differential rule for Holder 1/2 functions is demonstrated.

In practical recommendation, only items at the top of\nthe ranked list are presented to the users. With this in mind, we propose a\nclass of objective functions over matrix factorisations which primarily\nrepresent a smooth surrogate for the real AUC, and in a special case we show\nhow to prioritise the top of the list. The objectives are differentiable and\noptimised through a carefully designed stochastic gradient-descent-based\nalgorithm which scales linearly with the size of the data. In the special case\nof square loss we show how to improve computational complexity by leveraging\npreviously computed measures. To understand theoretically the underlying matrix\nfactorisation approaches we study both the consistency of the loss functions\nwith respect to AUC, and generalisation using Rademacher theory. The resulting\ngeneralisation analysis gives strong motivation for the optimisation under\nstudy. Finally, we provide computation results as to the efficacy of the\nproposed method using synthetic and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 09:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

In this\npaper, we consider two different MNOs coexisting in the same area, and exploit\ntheir collaboration in both energy purchase and wireless load sharing for\nenergy cost saving. Specifically, we propose a new approach named energy group\nbuying with load sharing, in which the two MNOs are aggregated as a single\ngroup to make the day-ahead and real-time energy purchase, and their base\nstations (BSs) share the wireless traffic to maximally turn lightly-loaded BSs\ninto sleep mode.

We consider the case of\nrotating stars computed with a strong coupling mediated by an interior magnetic\nfield. In models without any tidal interaction (single stars and wide\nbinaries), homogeneous evolution in solid body rotating models is obtained when\ntwo conditions are realized: the initial rotation must be high enough, the loss\nof angular momentum by stellar winds should be modest. This last point favors\nmetal-poor fast rotating stars.

In close binaries, mixing is\nstronger at higher than at lower metallicities. Homogeneous evolution is thus\nfavored at higher metallicities.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic inference approach\nthat permits the prediction, well in advance, of the intended destination of a\ntracked object and its future trajectory. Within the framework introduced here,\nthe observed partial track of the object is modeled as being part of a Markov\nbridge terminating at its destination, since the target path, albeit random,\nmust end at the intended endpoint. This captures the underlying long term\ndependencies in the trajectory, as dictated by the object intent. By\ndetermining the likelihood of the partial track being drawn from a particular\nconstructed bridge, the probability of each of a number of possible\ndestinations is evaluated. These bridges can also be employed to produce\nrefined estimates of the latent system state (e.g. object position, velocity,\netc.), predict its future values (up until reaching the designated endpoint)\nand estimate the time of arrival. This is shown to lead to a low complexity\nKalman-filter-based implementation of the inference routine, where any linear\nGaussian motion model, including the destination reverting ones, can be\napplied.

For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 13:39:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2015 10:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

We investigate the stability of non-isothermal Bonnor-Ebert spheres\nwith a model that includes a self-consistent calculation of the gas\ntemperature. This way we can discard the assumption of equality between the\ndust and gas temperatures, and study the stability as the gas temperature\nchanges with chemical evolution of the gas.\n  Methods. We use a gas-grain chemical model including a time-dependent\ntreatment of depletion onto grain surfaces, which strongly influences the gas\ntemperature as the main coolant, CO, depletes from the gas. Dust and gas\ntemperatures are solved with radiative transfer. For comparison with previous\nwork, we assume that the cores are deeply embedded in a larger external\nstructure, corresponding to visual extinction $A_{\\rm V}^{\\rm ext}=10$ mag.\n  Results. We find that the critical non-dimensional radius $\\xi_1$ derived\nhere is similar to our previous work where we assumed $T_{\\rm dust}=T_{\\rm\ngas}$; the $\\xi_1$ values lie below the isothermal critical value\n$\\xi_0\\sim6.45$, but the difference is less than 10%. Chemical evolution does\nnot affect notably the stability condition of low-mass cores (<0.75 $M_\\odot$).\nFor higher masses the decrease of cooling owing to CO depletion causes\nsubstantial temporal changes in the temperature and density profiles of the\ncores. In the mass range 1-2 $M_\\odot$ , $\\xi_1$ decreases with chemical\nevolution, whereas above 3 $M_\\odot$ , $\\xi_1$ instead increases. We also find\nthat decreasing $A_{\\rm V}^{\\rm ext}$ increases the gas temperature especially\nwhen the gas is chemically old, causing $\\xi_1$ to increase with respect to\nmodels with higher $A_{\\rm V}^{\\rm ext}$. The derived $\\xi_1$ values are close\nto $\\xi_0$. The density contrast between the core center and edge varies\nbetween 8 to 16 depending on core mass and the chemical age of the gas,\ncompared to the constant value $\\sim$ 14.1 for the isothermal BES.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 13:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}

The T2K experiment observed electron-neutrino\nappearance in 2012. This observation enables T2K to explore CP violation in the\nlepton sector by comparing electron-neutrino appearance and\nelectron-antineutrino appearance. Indeed, the number of observed electron\nneutrino events up to 2012 is, though within statistical fluctuation, larger\nthan the expectation, which suggests maximal CP violation. Since 2013, T2K has\nbeen accumulating data with a muon antineutrino beam. If the suggested maximal\nCP violation is true, electron-antineutrino appearance would be suppressed. The\nsignal is further suppressed by the smaller cross section for antineutrinos\ncompared to neutrinos. Hence the observation of electron-antineutrino\nappearance is an important next step. Furthermore, the CPT theorem imposes that\nthe muon disappearance rate must be the same for muon neutrinos and muon\nantineutrinos; therefore the comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos is\na good test of the CPT theorem, or else a probe for new non-standard\ninteractions of neutrinos with matter.

Considering non-line-of-sight (NLoS) RF transmissions\nand a generalized atmospheric turbulence (AT) channel, the associated\nstatistical features constituted of both the exact and the asymptotic moment\ngenerating functions (MGF) are derived in closed form.

A range\nof additional asymptotic expressions are also derived for all the modulation\nschemes under high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).

When matched to WISE mid-IR photometry, these passive and\nretired galaxies exhibit a range of mid-IR colour, with a number of void\ngalaxies exhibiting [4.6]-[12] colours inconsistent with completely quenched\nstellar populations, with a similar spread in colour seen for a randomly drawn\nnon-void comparison sample. We hypothesise that a number of these galaxies host\nobscured star formation, else they are star forming outside of their central\nregions targeted for single fibre spectroscopy. When matched to a randomly\ndrawn sample of non-void galaxies, the void and non-void galaxies exhibit\nsimilar properties in terms of optical and mid-IR colour, morphology, and star\nformation activity, suggesting comparable mass assembly and quenching\nhistories. A trend in mid-IR [4.6]-[12] colour is seen, such that both void and\nnon-void galaxies with quenched/passive colours <1.5 typically have masses\nhigher than $10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, where internally driven processes play an\nincreasingly important role in galaxy evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 15:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

The present study characterizes the\namplitude variation in a sample of main--sequence stars with light curves\ncollected using CoRoT exo--field CCDs. We analyze potential stellar activity\ncycles by studying the variability amplitude over small boxes. The cycle\nperiods and amplitudes were computed based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram,\nharmonic fits, and visual inspection. As a first application of our approach we\nhave considered the photometric data for 16 CoRoT FGK main sequence stars,\nrevisited during the IRa01, LRa01 and LRa06 CoRoT runs.

Here, it is shown that these\ndeviations are related to the power spectrum of the bath. Specifically, it is\nshown that the system thermal-equilibrium-state cannot be characterized by the\ncanonical Boltzmann's distribution in quantum mechanics. This is because the\nuncertainty principle imposed a lower bound of the dispersion of the total\nenergy of the system that is dominated by the spectral density of the bath.\nHowever, in the classical case, for a wide class of systems that interact via\ncentral forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, the system thermal\nequilibrium state is exactly characterized by the canonical Boltzmann\ndistribution. As a consequence of this analysis and taking into account all\nenergy scales in the system and reservoir interaction, an effective coupling to\nthe environment is introduced. Sample computations in different regimes\npredicted by this effective coupling are shown. Specifically, in the strong\ncoupling effective regime, the system exhibits deviations from standard\nthermodynamics and in the weak coupling effective regime, quantum features such\nas stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. Moreover, it is\nknown that the spectrum of thermal baths depends on the non-Markovian\ncharacter. Hence, non-Markovian interactions have a important role in the\nthermal equilibrium state of physical systems. For example, in quantum\noptomechanics is looked up to cool the mechanical system through an auxiliary\nsystem which generally is a cavity. This cooling process takes into account the\nnon-Markovian interaction and as it is shown here, it is more effective than if\nwe use only the Markovian approximation in the equation of motion for the\ndifferent modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 15:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

This would explain observed exoplanets with significant inclination\nrespect to the equatorial plane of their host star. We have used two different\nSPH codes, vine and phantom, to model the evolution of a system\nstar+disk+planet and companion star with time. After an initial coupled\nevolution, the inclination of the disk and that of the planet begin to differ\nsignificantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, respect to\nthe initial plane, is shorter than that of the planet which evolves\nindependently after about 10^4 yr following a perturbed N-body behavior.\nHowever, the planet keeps migrating towards the star because during its orbital\nmotion it crosses the disk plane and the friction with the gas causes angular\nmomentum loss. Disk and planet in a significantly inclined binary system are\nnot dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost\nindependently. The planet abandons the disk and, due to the onset of a\nsignificant mutual inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit\nintersects the disk plane. The drift of the planet towards the star is not due\nto type I/II with the planet embedded in the disk but to the friction with the\ngas during the disk crossing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 15:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

In recent years, a number of novel topological metrics for\nmicrostructures have been proposed, which measure essential connectivity\ninformation and are based on techniques from algebraic topology. Such metrics\nare inherently computable using computational homology, provided the\nmicrostructures are discretized using a thresholding process. However, while in\nmany cases the thresholding is straightforward, noise and measurement errors\ncan lead to misleading metric values. In such situations, persistence\nlandscapes have been proposed as a natural topology metric. Common to all of\nthese approaches is the enormous data reduction, which passes from complicated\npatterns to discrete information. It is therefore natural to wonder what type\nof information is actually retained by the topology. In the present paper, we\ndemonstrate that averaged persistence landscapes can be used to recover central\nsystem information in the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase separation. More\nprecisely, we show that topological information of evolving microstructures\nalone suffices to accurately detect both concentration information and the\nactual decomposition stage of a data snapshot. Considering that persistent\nhomology only measures discrete connectivity information, regardless of the\nsize of the topological features, these results indicate that the system\nparameters in a phase separation process affect the topology considerably more\nthan anticipated. We believe that the methods discussed in this paper could\nprovide a valuable tool for relating experimental data to model simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 16:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Since the Industrial\nRevolution, human activities have drastically changed coastal marine\necosystems. The development of rules and regulations to protect these\necosystems against human activities requires availability of environmental\nassessment standard. This necessitates the identification of the key parameters\nthat reflect condition of the coastal water ecosystem. Macrobenthic assemblages\nare recognized to rapidly respond to changes in the quality of water or\nhabitat. Therefore, it would be useful to study the population of macrobenthos\nand assess the influential factors on the growth of this species. This study is\ncategorized as multidisciplinary approach which contains two perspectives,\necological and mathematical. In the ecological section, the effect of the water\nquality parameters (e.g. pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity) and\nthe sediment characteristics on the macrobenthic abundance is studied. A total\nof 432 samples were collected and analyzed from four touristic costal locations\n(at various distances form the coast) of Penang National Park to investigate\nthe spatial change of macrobenthic assemblage. In a mathematical perspective,\nthis paper pursues a new algorithm based on the performance evaluation methods.\nFor this purpose, first, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is employed to\nevaluate a group of Decision Making Units (DMUs). Consequently, inputs of the\nmentioned DMUs are considered as alternatives (or candidates), and using a\nmodified DEA model that is categorized as aggregating preference ranking\nmethod, the influence of inputs in efficiency of DMUs is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 01:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-19"}
