The most prevalent type of parameters used in kernelization is the\nsolution size for optimization problems; however, also structural parameters\nhave been successfully used to obtain polynomial kernels for a wide range of\nproblems. Many of these parameters can be defined as the size of a smallest\nmodulator of the given graph into a fixed graph class (i.e., a set of vertices\nwhose deletion puts the graph into the graph class). Such parameters admit the\nconstruction of polynomial kernels even when the solution size is large or not\napplicable. This work follows up on the research on meta-kernelization\nframeworks in terms of structural parameters.\n  We develop a class of parameters which are based on a more general view on\nmodulators: instead of size, the parameters employ a combination of rank-width\nand split decompositions to measure structure inside the modulator. This allows\nus to lift kernelization results from modulator-size to more general\nparameters, hence providing smaller kernels. We show (i) how such large but\nwell-structured modulators can be efficiently approximated, (ii) how they can\nbe used to obtain polynomial kernels for any graph problem expressible in\nMonadic Second Order logic, and (iii) how they allow the extension of previous\nresults in the area of structural meta-kernelization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 16:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

To compute the fully discrete solution, such\napproaches employ a Galerkin projection in both the deterministic and\nstochastic domains, produced here by a combination of finite elements and a\nglobal orthogonal basis, defined on an isotopic total degree index set,\nrespectively. To account for the sparsity of the resulting system, we present a\nrigorous cost analysis that considers the total number of coupled finite\nelement systems that must be simultaneously solved in the SGFEM. However, to\nmaintain sparsity as the coefficient becomes increasingly nonlinear in the\nparameterization, it is necessary to also approximate the coefficient by an\nadditional orthogonal expansion. In this case we prove a rigorous complexity\nestimate for the number of floating point operations (FLOPs) required per\nmatrix-vector multiplication of the coupled system. Based on such complexity\nestimates we also develop explicit cost bounds in terms of FLOPs to solve the\nstochastic Galerkin (SG) systems to a prescribed tolerance, which are used to\ncompare with the minimal complexity estimates of a stochastic collocation\nfinite element method (SCFEM), shown in our previous work [16]. Finally,\ncomputational evidence complements the theoretical estimates and supports our\nconclusion that, in the case that the coefficient is affine, the coupled SG\nsystem can be solved more efficiently than the decoupled SC systems. However,\nas the coefficient becomes more nonlinear, it becomes prohibitively expensive\nto obtain an approximation with the SGFEM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 16:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 21:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

This class\nof polynomials contains the Permanent but also includes, for example, the\nHamiltonian Cycle polynomial, and many other familiar #P-hard polynomials.\n  Although our construction, unlike that proposed by Aaronson and Arkhipov,\nlikely requires a universal quantum computer, we are able to use this\nadditional power to weaken the conjectures needed to prove approximate sampling\nhardness results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 18:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

It is also capable of\nobserving neutrinos from terrestrial and extra-terrestrial sources, including\nsupernova burst neutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrino background, geoneutrinos,\natmospheric neutrinos, solar neutrinos, as well as exotic searches such as\nnucleon decays, dark matter, sterile neutrinos, etc. We present the physics\nmotivations and the anticipated performance of the JUNO detector for various\nproposed measurements. By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants\nat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4\nsigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino\nspectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six\noscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\\%. Neutrino burst from a\ntypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000\ninverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic\nscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information\non the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino\nenergy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400\nevents per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino\nsamples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton\ndecay via the $p\\to K^++\\bar\\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide\na unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and\nastrophysics.

Here, we propose a quantitative approach to this\nproblem, we use it to design an empirically testable CBA model, and we apply it\nto the the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the highest-energy accelerator in the\nworld, currently operating at CERN. We show that the evaluation of benefits can\nbe made quantitative by determining their value to users (scientists,\nearly-stage researchers, firms, visitors) and non-users (the general public).\nFour classes of contributions to users are identified: knowledge output, human\ncapital development, technological spillovers, and cultural effects. Benefits\nfor non-users can be estimated, in analogy to public goods with no practical\nuse (such as environment preservation), using willingness to pay. We determine\nthe probability distribution of cost and benefits for the LHC since 1993 until\nplanned decommissioning in 2025, and we find there is a 92% probability that\nbenefits exceed its costs, with an expected net present value of about 3\nbillion euro, not including the unpredictable economic value of discovery of\nany new physics. We argue that the evaluation approach proposed here can be\nreplicated for any large-scale research infrastructure, thus helping the\ndecision-making on competing projects, with a socio-economic appraisal\ncomplementary to other evaluation criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 20:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

We illustrate the\ncomplementarity of these two approaches by comparing the SV data with the\nBCC-UFig, a synthetic sky catalogue generated by forward-modelling of the DES\nSV images. We analyse the BCC-UFig simulation to construct galaxy samples\nmimicking those used in SV galaxy clustering studies.

Tabulated properties of subclusters in these regions\ninclude physical sizes and shapes, intrinsic numbers of stars, absorptions by\nthe molecular clouds, and median subcluster ages. Physical signs of dynamical\nevolution are present in the relations of these properties, including\nstatistically significant correlations between subcluster size, central\ndensity, and age, which are likely the result of cluster expansion after gas\nremoval. We argue that many of the subclusters identified in Paper I are\ngravitationally bound because their radii are significantly less than what\nwould be expected from freely expanding clumps of stars with a typical initial\nstellar velocity dispersion of ~3 km/s for star-forming regions. We explore a\nmodel for cluster formation in which structurally simpler clusters are built up\nhierarchically through the mergers of subclusters--subcluster mergers are\nindicated by an inverse relation between the numbers of stars in a subcluster\nand their central densities (also seen as a density vs. radius relation that is\nless steep than would be expected from pure expansion). We discuss implications\nof these effects for the dynamical relaxation of young stellar clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 20:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Due to its high temperature,\nthe protolunar disk may act as a thermochemical reactor in which the material\nis processed before being incorporated into the Moon. Outstanding issues like\ndevolatilisation and istotopic evolution are tied to the disk evolution,\nhowever its lifetime, dynamics and thermodynamics are unknown. Here, we\nnumerically explore the long term viscous evolution of the protolunar disk\nusing a one dimensional model where the different phases (vapor and condensed)\nare vertically stratified. Viscous heating, radiative cooling, phase\ntransitions and gravitational instability are accounted for whereas Moon s\naccretion is not considered for the moment. The viscosity of the gas, liquid\nand solid phases dictates the disk evolution. We find that (1) the vapor\ncondenses into liquid in about 10 years, (2) a large fraction of the disk mass\nflows inward forming a hot and compact liquid disk between 1 and 1.7 Earth s\nradii, a region where the liquid is gravitationally stable and can accumulate,\n(3) the disk finally solidifies in 1000 to 100,000 years. Viscous heating is\nnever balanced by radiative cooling. If the vapor phase is abnormally viscous,\ndue to magneto-rotational instability for instance, most of the disk volatile\ncomponents are transported to Earth leaving a disk enriched in refractory\nelements. This opens a way to form a volatile-depleted Moon and would suggest\nthat the missing Moon s volatiles are buried today into the Earth. The disk\ncooling timescale may be long enough to allow for planet-disk isotopic\nequilibration.

Although these\nelements introduce a statistical component that does not exist in classical\nthermodynamics, the logical structure of the theory is different from that of\nstatistical mechanics and represents an expanded version of thermodynamics.\nBased on this theory, we present a regular procedure for calculations of\nequilibrium fluctuations of extensive parameters, intensive parameters and\ndensities in systems with any number of fluctuating parameters.

As a corollary of our main results, we\nobtain the non-faithfullness of the family of cylinders generated by the\nclassical L\\\"uroth expansion.\n  Possible infinite entropy of the stochastic vector $Q_\\infty$ which\ndetermines the metric relations for partitions of the generalized L\\\"uroth\nexpansions, possible non-faithfulness of the family $\\Phi(Q_\\infty)$ and the\nabsence of general formulae for the calculation of the Hausdorff dimension even\nfor probability measures with independent identically distributed symbols of\ngeneralized L\\\"uroth expansions are all facts that do not allow to apply usual\nprobabilistic methods, as well as methods of dynamical systems to study fractal\nproperties of corresponding subsets of non-normal numbers.\n  Despite of the above mentioned difficulties, we develop new approach to the\nstudy of subsets of $Q_\\infty$-essentially non-normal numbers and prove\n(without any additional restrictions on the stochastic vector $Q_{\\infty}$)\nthat this set is superfractal. This result answers the open problem mentioned\nin \\cite{AKNT2} and completes the metric, dimensional and topological\nclassification of real numbers via the asymptotic behaviour of frequencies\ntheir digits in the generalized L\\\"uroth expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 22:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

Moreover, the proposed method, which relaxes both the primal and the\ndual variables in a natural way with one relaxation factor in the interval\n$(0,2)$, has the potential of enhancing the performance of the classic ADMM.\nExtensive numerical experiments on various doubly non-negative semidefinite\nprogramming problems, with or without inequality constraints, are conducted.\nThe corresponding results showed that all these multi-block problems can be\nsuccessively solved, and the advantage of using the relaxation step is\napparent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 02:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 00:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 12:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 00:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

This work explores bidirectional architectures that also\nreason with top-down feedback: neural units are influenced by both lower and\nhigher-level units.\n  We do so by treating units as rectified latent variables in a quadratic\nenergy function, which can be seen as a hierarchical Rectified Gaussian model\n(RGs). We show that RGs can be optimized with a quadratic program (QP), that\ncan in turn be optimized with a recurrent neural network (with rectified linear\nunits). This allows RGs to be trained with GPU-optimized gradient descent. From\na theoretical perspective, RGs help establish a connection between CNNs and\nhierarchical probabilistic models. From a practical perspective, RGs are well\nsuited for detailed spatial tasks that can benefit from top-down reasoning.

A notion of\nminimal networks and a notion of network equivalence under group action are\ndefined. An efficient algorithm capable of directly listing single minimal\ncanonical representatives from each network equivalence class is presented and\nutilized to list all minimal canonical networks with up to 5 sources and\nhyperedges. Computational tools are then applied to obtain the rate regions of\nall of these canonical networks, providing exact expressions for 744,119 newly\nsolved network coding rate regions corresponding to more than 2 trillion\nisomorphic network coding problems. In order to better understand and analyze\nthe huge repository of rate regions through hierarchy, several embedding and\ncombination operations are defined so that the rate region of the network after\noperation can be derived from the rate regions of networks involved in the\noperation. The embedding operations enable the definition and determination of\na list of forbidden network minors for the sufficiency of classes of linear\ncodes. The combination operations enable the rate regions of some larger\nnetworks to be obtained as the combination of the rate regions of smaller\nnetworks. The integration of both the combinations and embedding operators is\nthen shown to enable the calculation of rate regions for many networks not\nreachable via combination operations alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 07:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

Criminal networks are covert and most of the information is not\npublicly available. This leads to small datasets available for analysis. The\navailable criminal network datasets consists of entities, i.e. individual or\norganizations, which are linked to each other. The links between entities\nindicates that there is a connection between these entities such as involvement\nin the same criminal event, having commercial ties, and/or memberships in the\nsame criminal organization. Because of incognito criminal activities, there\ncould be many hidden links from entities to entities, which makes the publicly\navailable criminal networks incomplete. Revealing hidden links introduces new\ninformation, e.g. affiliation of a suspected individual with a criminal\norganization, which may not be known with public information. What will we be\nable to find if we can run analysis on a larger dataset and use link prediction\nto reveal the implicit connections? We plan to answer this question by using a\ndataset that is an order of magnitude more than what is used in most criminal\nnetworks analysis. And by using machine learning techniques, we will convert a\nlink prediction problem to a binary classification problem. We plan to reveal\nhidden links and potentially hidden key attributes of the criminal network.\nWith a more complete picture of the network, we can potentially use this data\nto thwart criminal organizations and/or take a Pareto approach in targeting key\nnodes. We conclude our analysis with an effective destruction strategy to\nweaken criminal networks and prove the effectiveness of revealing hidden links\nwhen attacking to criminal networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 08:10:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 07:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 15:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

This\ndefinition leads to statistical distributions of work that satisfy\nnonequilibrium work and fluctuation relations. While this two-point measurement\ndefinition of quantum work can be justified heuristically by appeal to the\nfirst law of thermodynamics, its relationship to the classical definition of\nwork has not been carefully examined. In this paper we employ semiclassical\nmethods, combined with numerical simulations of a driven quartic oscillator, to\nstudy the correspondence between classical and quantal definitions of work in\nsystems with one degree of freedom. We find that a semiclassical work\ndistribution, built from classical trajectories that connect the initial and\nfinal energies, provides an excellent approximation to the quantum work\ndistribution when the trajectories are assigned suitable phases and are allowed\nto interfere. Neglecting the interferences between trajectories reduces the\ndistribution to that of the corresponding classical process. Hence, in the\nsemiclassical limit, the quantum work distribution converges to the classical\ndistribution, decorated by a quantum interference pattern. We also derive the\nform of the quantum work distribution at the boundary between classically\nallowed and forbidden regions, where this distribution tunnels into the\nforbidden region. Our results clarify how the correspondence principle applies\nin the context of quantum and classical work distributions, and contribute to\nthe understanding of work and nonequilibrium work relations in the quantum\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 09:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

For\nchromospheric and coronal radiation, the situation is less clear-cut. The Sun's\n10.7\\,cm flux shows a decrease of $\\sim4\\%$ during the solar minimum in 2008\ncompared to the previous minimum, but \\ion{Ca}{II} K does not. Here we consider\nadditional wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), specifically\ntransitions of \\ion{He}{I} at 584.3\\,\\AA\\ and \\ion{O}{V} at 629.7\\,\\AA , of\nwhich the CDS spectrometer aboard SOHO has been taking regular scans along the\nsolar central meridian since 1996. We analysed this unique dataset to verify if\nand how the radiance distribution undergoes measurable variations between cycle\nminima. To achieve this aim we determined the radiance distribution of quiet\nareas around the Sun centre. Concentrating on the last two solar minima, we\nfound out that there is very little variation in the radiance distribution of\nthe chromospheric spectral line \\ion{He}{I} between these minima. The same\nanalysis shows a modest, although significant, 4\\% variation in the radiance\ndistribution of the transition region spectral line \\ion{O}{V}. These results\nare comparable to those obtained by earlier studies employing other spectral\nfeatures, and they confirm that chromospheric indices display a small\nvariation, whereas in the TR a more significant reduction of the brighter\nfeatures is visible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 11:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

Priced timed games\nare known to be undecidable for timed automata with $3$ or more clocks, while\nthey are known to be decidable for automata with $1$ clock.\n  In an attempt to recover decidability for priced timed games Bouyer, Markey,\nand Sankur studied robust priced timed games where the environment has the\npower to slightly perturb delays proposed by the controller.

Determining the day-ahead unit commitment and production\nschedules for these systems is an optimization problem subject to uncertainty\nstemming from the unpredictability of demand and prices for heat and\nelectricity. Furthermore, owing to the dynamic features of production and heat\nstorage units as well as to the length and granularity of the optimization\nhorizon (e.g., one whole day with hourly resolution), this problem is in\nessence a multi-stage one. We propose a formulation based on robust\noptimization where recourse decisions are approximated as linear or\npiecewise-linear functions of the uncertain parameters. This approach allows\nfor a rigorous modeling of the uncertainty in multi-stage decision-making\nwithout compromising computational tractability. We perform an extensive\nnumerical study based on data from the Copenhagen area in Denmark, which\nhighlights important features of the proposed model.

Investigating the quantum dynamics of a $N$-component\n$\\varphi^{4}$-model coupled to an external bath, we determine this universal\naging and demonstrate that the system undergoes a coarsening, governed by a\ncritical exponent that is unrelated to the equilibrium exponents of the system.\nWe analyze this behavior in the large-$N$ limit, which is complementary to our\nearlier renormalization group analysis, allowing in particular the direct\ninvestigation of the order-parameter dynamics in the symmetry broken phase and\nat the upper critical dimension. By connecting the long time limit of\nfluctuations and response, we introduce a distribution function that shows that\nthe system remains non-thermal and exhibits quantum coherence even on long\ntimescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 13:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Assuming that the flame starts in a point-like region slightly above\nthe center of the white dwarf (WD) and adding a moderate amount of angular\nvelocity to the star we follow the evolution of the deflagration using a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code.

The impact of rotation is larger for angles close to\n90{\\deg} because the Coriolis force on a floating element of fluid is maximum,\nand its principal effect is to break the symmetry of the deflagration. Such\nsymmetry breaking weakens the convergence of the nuclear flame at the antipodes\nof the initial ignition volume, changing the environmental conditions around\nthe convergence region with respect to non-rotating models.

We use 17 frequency\nseparation ratios\n$r_{02}(n)=(\\nu_{n,l=0}-\\nu_{n-1,l=2})/(\\nu_{n,l=1}-\\nu_{n-1,l=1})$ from 8640\ndays of low-$\\ell$ BiSON frequencies and consider three likelihood functions\nthat depend on the handling of the errors of these $r_{02}(n)$ ratios.\nMoreover, we employ the 2010 CODATA recommended values for Newton's constant,\nsolar mass, and radius to calibrate a large grid of solar models spanning a\nconceivable range of solar ages. It is shown that the most constrained\nposterior distribution of the solar age for models employing Irwin EOS with\nNACRE reaction rates leads to $t_\\odot = 4.587 \\pm 0.007$ Gyr, while models\nemploying the Irwin EOS and Adelberger, et al., Reviews of Modern Physics, 83,\n195 (2011) reaction rate have $t_\\odot = 4.569 \\pm 0.006 $ Gyr.

Indeed we find that there exists an energy threshold in $\\mathcal E$\nsuch that below it the harmonic energy $\\mathcal E$ appears to be an\napproximate integral of motion for the whole observation time. Consequently,\nthe system remains trapped near the minimum, in what may be called a vitreous\nor glassy state. Instead, for larger values of $\\mathcal E$ the system rather\nquickly relaxes to a final equilibrium state. Moreover we find that the\nvitreous states present peculiar statistical behaviors, still involving the\nharmonic energy $\\mathcal E$. Indeed, the vitreous states are described by a\nGibbs distribution with an effective Hamiltonian close to $\\mathcal E$ and with\na suitable effective inverse temperature. The final equilibrium state presents\ninstead statistical properties which are in very good agreement with the Gibbs\ndistribution relative to the full Hamiltonian of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 14:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

As a test, we also study the bending of light near such black-holes\nanalyzing the movement of a test particle and the modification caused by\nextrinsic curvature on its movement. Accordingly, using the asymptotically\nconformal flat condition for the extrinsic curvature, an analytical expansion\nof a set of \\emph{n}-scalar fields can be defined and we show that the\ncorresponding black holes must be large and constrained in the range of allowed\nvalues $-1/2 \\leq n \\leq 1.8$. As a result, they are locally thermodynamically\nstable, but not globally preferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 23:27:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2015 19:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 15:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 14:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

Several experimental tests using high intensity lasers have been\nproposed to observe electromagnetic nonlinearities in vacuum, such as the\ndiffraction or the reflection of intense laser pulses. We propose a new\napproach which consists in observing the refraction, i.e. the rotation of the\nwaveplanes of a probe laser pulse crossing a transverse vacuum index gradient.\nThe latter is produced by the interaction of two very intense and ultra short\nlaser pulses, used as pump pulses. At the maximum of the index gradient, the\nrefraction angle of the probe pulse is estimated to be $0.2 \\times\n(\\frac{w_0}{10 \\mathrm{\\mu m}})^{-3} \\times \\frac{I}{1\n\\mathrm{J}}$~picoradians, where $I$ is the total energy of the two pump pulses\nand $w_0$ is the minimum waist (fwhm) at the interaction area. Assuming the\nmost intense laser pulses attainable by the LASERIX facility ($I = 25$~J, 30~fs\nfwhm duration, 800~nm central wavelength) and assuming a minimum waist of $w=10\n\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ (fwhm) (corresponding to an intensity of the order of\n$10^{21}$~W/cm$^2$), the expected maximum refraction angle is about\n5~picoradians. An experimental setup, using a Sagnac interferometer, is\nproposed to perform this measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 08:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 12:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2015 15:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

However a calculation of the vacuum polarization tensor will include\nnon-gauge invariant terms. These terms must be removed from the calculation in\norder to get a physically correct result. One common way to do this today is\nthe technique of \"dimensional regularization\". It has recently been noted [2]\nthat at one time a supersymmetric-like solution to the problem was explored -\nthat is, the right combination of fields would cause the offending terms to\ncancel out. I will examine some of this early work and pose the question - why\ndo the non-gauge invariant terms appear in the first place? I will show that\nthis is due to an improper mathematical step in the formulation of the\npertubative expansion. I will then show that when this step is corrected the\nresult is gauge invariant.
