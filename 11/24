Moreover, for\na class of partial regularizers, any global minimizer of these models is a\nsparsest solution to the linear system.

The annual\naverage umbral magnetic field is then examined for the 17 year observation\nperiod and shows a small decrease of 375 Gauss in sunspot magnetic fields over\nthe period 1996 to 2013, but the mean intensity of sunspot umbrae does not vary\nsignificantly over this time.

The effective potential as a function of the varying coupling\n(aimed to implement a natural phase transition) is seen to develop a negative\ndivergence, i.e. becomes a \"bottomless well\" in certain limit region. Although\nwe explain how an lower unbounded potential is not necessarily unacceptable in\na cosmological context, the divergence can be removed if we consider a mass\nterm for the coupling-like field. We found that for a proper set of parameters,\nthe total potential obtained has two minima, one located at the origin (the\ntrivial solution, in which the fluid associated with the fields behave like\nmatter); and the other related to the non-trivial solution. This last solution\nhas three possibilities: 1) if the minimum is positive V_{min}>0, the system\nbehave as a cosmological constant, thus leading eventually to an accelerated\nuniverse; 2) if the minimized potential vanishes V_{min}=0, then we have matter\nwith no acceleration ; 3) finally a negative minimum V_{min}<0 leads an\neventually collapsing universe, even though we have a flat geometry.Therefore,\na possible interpretation as Dark Matter or Dark Energy is allowed among the\nbehaviors implicated in the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 19:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

The computation entails a subtle interplay between\nthe near (or potential) and far (or radiation) zones. In particular, we find\nthat the tail contribution to the effective action is non-local in time, and\nfeatures both a dissipative and a `conservative' term. The latter includes a\nlogarithmic ultraviolet (UV) divergence, which we show cancels against an\ninfrared (IR) singularity found in the (conservative) near zone. The origin of\nthis behavior in the long-distance EFT is due to the point-particle limit\n-shrinking the binary to a point- which transforms a would-be infrared\nsingularity into an ultraviolet divergence. This is a common occurrence in an\nEFT approach, which furthermore allows us to use renormalization group (RG)\ntechniques to resum the resulting logarithmic contributions. We then derive the\nRG evolution for the binding potential and total mass/energy, and find\nagreement with the results obtained imposing the conservation of the (pseudo)\nstress-energy tensor in the radiation theory. While the calculation of the\nleading tail contribution to the effective action involves only one diagram,\nfive are needed for the one-point function. This suggests logarithmic\ncorrections may be easier to incorporate in this fashion.

We find similar jet properties for all five bursts: the\nbulk Lorentz factor decreases monotonously over the pulses and lies between\n1000 and 100.

Its most popular formulation, introduced by Fisher, uses\n$n$ samples to predict the number $U$ of hitherto unseen species that would be\nobserved if $t\\cdot n$ new samples were collected. Of considerable interest is\nthe largest ratio $t$ between the number of new and existing samples for which\n$U$ can be accurately predicted.\n  In seminal works, Good and Toulmin constructed an intriguing estimator that\npredicts $U$ for all $t\\le 1$, thereby showing that the number of species can\nbe estimated for a population twice as large as that observed. Subsequently\nEfron and Thisted obtained a modified estimator that empirically predicts $U$\neven for some $t>1$, but without provable guarantees.\n  We derive a class of estimators that $\\textit{provably}$ predict $U$ not just\nfor constant $t>1$, but all the way up to $t$ proportional to $\\log n$. This\nshows that the number of species can be estimated for a population $\\log n$\ntimes larger than that observed, a factor that grows arbitrarily large as $n$\nincreases. We also show that this range is the best possible and that the\nestimators' mean-square error is optimal up to constants for any $t$. Our\napproach yields the first provable guarantee for the Efron-Thisted estimator\nand, in addition, a variant which achieves stronger theoretical and\nexperimental performance than existing methodologies on a variety of synthetic\nand real datasets.\n  The estimators we derive are simple linear estimators that are computable in\ntime proportional to $n$. The performance guarantees hold uniformly for all\ndistributions, and apply to all four standard sampling models commonly used\nacross various scientific disciplines: multinomial, Poisson, hypergeometric,\nand Bernoulli product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 20:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 20:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 02:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

The SOT strength can\nbe modulated by a factor of 4 within the accessible gate voltage range, and it\nshows strong correlation with the spin-polarized surface current in the film.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the magnetization switching by scanning gate\nvoltage with constant current and in-plane magnetic field applied in the film.\nThe effective electric-field control of SOT and the giant spin-torque\nefficiency in Cr-doped TI may lead to the development of energy-efficient\ngate-controlled spin-torque devices compatible with modern field-effect\nsemiconductor technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

Our GR gravity is implemented in our\nNewtonian hydrodynamics simulations via an effective relativistic potential\n(GREP) that closely reproduces the GR structure of neutron stars and has been\nshown to match GR simulations of core collapse quite well. In axisymmetry, we\nsimulate core-collapse supernovae with four different progenitor models in both\nNewtonian and GR gravity. We find that the more compact protoneutron star\nstructure realized in simulations with GR gravity gives higher neutrino\nluminosities and higher neutrino energies. These differences in turn give\nhigher neutrino heating rates (upwards of $\\sim$20-30% over the corresponding\nNewtonian gravity simulations) that increase the efficacy of the neutrino\nmechanism. Three of the four models successfully explode in the simulations\nassuming GREP gravity. In our Newtonian gravity simulations, two of the four\nmodels explode, but at times much later than observed in our GR gravity\nsimulations. Our results, both in Newtonian and GR gravity, compare well with\nseveral other studies in the literature.

Superhydrophobicity stems from an aversion for water to wet the surface\ntexture, so that a water droplet in the superhydrophobic \"Cassie state\",\ncontacts only the tips of the rough hydrophobic surface. However,\nsuperhydrophobicity is remarkably fragile, and can break down due to the\nwetting of the surface texture to yield the \"Wenzel state\" under various\nconditions, such as elevated pressures or droplet impact. Moreover, due to\nlarge energetic barriers that impede the reverse (dewetting) transition, this\nbreakdown in superhydrophobicity is widely believed to be irreversible. Using\nmolecular simulations in conjunction with enhanced sampling techniques, here we\nshow that on surfaces with nanoscale texture, water density fluctuations can\nlead to a reduction in the free energetic barriers to dewetting by\ncircumventing the classical dewetting pathways. In particular, the\nfluctuation-mediated dewetting pathway involves a number of transitions between\ndistinct dewetted morphologies, with each transition lowering the resistance to\ndewetting. Importantly, an understanding of the mechanistic pathways to\ndewetting and their dependence on pressure, allows us to augment the surface\ntexture design, so that the barriers to dewetting are eliminated altogether and\nthe Wenzel state becomes unstable at ambient conditions. Such robust surfaces,\nwhich defy classical expectations and can spontaneously recover their\nsuperhydrophobicity, could have widespread importance, from underwater\noperation to phase change heat transfer applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 21:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

In this paper we present a methodology that has enabled us to\ncollect, identify and annotate a dataset of 330 rumour threads (4,842 tweets)\nassociated with 9 newsworthy events. We analyse this dataset to understand how\nusers spread, support, or deny rumours that are later proven true or false, by\ndistinguishing two levels of status in a rumour life cycle i.e., before and\nafter its veracity status is resolved. The identification of rumours associated\nwith each event, as well as the tweet that resolved each rumour as true or\nfalse, was performed by a team of journalists who tracked the events in real\ntime. Our study shows that rumours that are ultimately proven true tend to be\nresolved faster than those that turn out to be false. Whilst one can readily\nsee users denying rumours once they have been debunked, users appear to be less\ncapable of distinguishing true from false rumours when their veracity remains\nin question. In fact, we show that the prevalent tendency for users is to\nsupport every unverified rumour. We also analyse the role of different types of\nusers, finding that highly reputable users such as news organisations endeavour\nto post well-grounded statements, which appear to be certain and accompanied by\nevidence.

The\nefficiency of meta-modeling techniques relies on their ability to provide\nstatistically-equivalent analytical representations based on relatively few\nevaluations of the original model. Polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) have\nproven a powerful tool for developing meta-models in a wide range of\napplications; the key idea thereof is to expand the model response onto a basis\nmade of multivariate polynomials obtained as tensor products of appropriate\nunivariate polynomials. The classical PCE approach nevertheless faces the\n\"curse of dimensionality\", namely the exponential increase of the basis size\nwith increasing input dimension. To address this limitation, the sparse PCE\ntechnique has been proposed, in which the expansion is carried out on only a\nfew relevant basis terms that are automatically selected by a suitable\nalgorithm. An alternative for developing meta-models with polynomial functions\nin high-dimensional problems is offered by the newly emerged low-rank\napproximations (LRA) approach. By exploiting the tensor-product structure of\nthe multivariate basis, LRA can provide polynomial representations in highly\ncompressed formats. Through extensive numerical investigations, we herein first\nshed light on issues relating to the construction of canonical LRA with a\nparticular greedy algorithm involving a sequential updating of the polynomial\ncoefficients along separate dimensions. Canonical LRA exhibit smaller errors\nthan sparse PCE in cases when the number of available model evaluations is\nsmall with respect to the input dimension. By introducing the conditional\ngeneralization error, we further demonstrate that canonical LRA tend to\noutperform sparse PCE in the prediction of extreme model responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 22:21:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 11:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The surface\nconfinement, the oxygen-vacancy ordering, and the octahedra distortions give\nrise to spin-polarized $t_{2g}$ dispersive sub-bands; their energy split near\nthe Brillouin zone center acts as an effective Zeeman term, which, when we turn\non a Rashba interaction, produces bands with momentum-spin correlations similar\nto those recently discovered on oxygen deficient STO surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 22:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The precise determination of octant and\n$\\delta_{CP}$ is interlinked through the octant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. In\nthis paper we study the proficiency of the DUNE experiment to determine these\nparameters, in particular, the role played by the antineutrinos, the broadband\nnature of the beam and the matter effect. For $P_{\\mu e}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\mu}\n\\bar{e}}$ the octant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy occurs at different values of\n$\\delta_{CP}$, combination of neutrino and antineutrino runs help to resolve\nthis. However, in regions where neutrinos do not have octant degeneracy adding\nantineutrino data is expected to decrease the sensitivity because of the\ndegeneracy and reduced statistics. However we find that in case of DUNE\nbaseline, the antineutrino runs help even in parameter space where the\nantineutrino probabilities suffer from degeneracies. We explore this point in\ndetail and point out that this happens because of the (i) broad-band nature of\nthe beam so that even if there is degeneracy at a particular energy bin, over\nthe whole spectrum the degeneracy may not be there; (ii) the enhanced matter\neffect due to the comparatively longer baseline which creates an increased\ntension between the neutrino and the antineutrino probabilities which raises\nthe overall $\\chi^2$ in case of combined runs. This feature is more prominent\nfor IH since the antineutrino probabilities in this case are much higher than\nthe neutrino probabilities due to matter effects. The main role of\nantineutrinos in enhancing CP sensitivity is their ability to remove the\noctant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. However even if one assumes octant to be known\nthe addition of antineutrinos can give enhanced CP sensitivity in some\nparameter regions due to the tension between the neutrino and antineutrino\n$\\chi^2$s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 22:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 12:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 08:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

In a discrete setting, such as classification, CNNs\nare not only able to predict a label but often predict a confidence in the form\nof a probability distribution over the output space. In continuous regression\ntasks, such a probability estimate is often lacking. We present a regression\nframework which models the output distribution of neural networks. This output\ndistribution allows us to infer the most likely labeling following a set of\nphysical or modeling constraints. These constraints capture the intricate\ninterplay between different input and output variables, and complement the\noutput of a CNN. However, they may not hold everywhere. Our setup further\nallows to learn a confidence with which a constraint holds, in the form of a\ndistribution of the constrain satisfaction. We evaluate our approach on the\nproblem of intrinsic image decomposition, and show that constrained structured\nregression significantly increases the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 22:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

A MWM consists of a system of multiple hoppers that\nare filled with product which when discharged through a funnel fills a package\nto a desired weight. Operating this machine requires first to specify the\nproduct weight targets or setpoints that each hopper should contain on average\nin each cycle, which do not need to be identical. The selection of these\nsetpoints has a major impact on the performance of a MWM. Each cycle, the\nmachine fills a package running a built-in knapsack algorithm that opens --or\nleaves shut-- different combinations of hoppers releasing their content such\nthat the total weight of each package is near to its target, minimizing the\namount of product ``given away\". In this paper, we address the practical open\nproblem for industry of how to determine the setpoint weights for each of the\nhoppers given a desired total package weight for a widely used type of MWM. An\norder statistic formulation based on a characterization of near-optimal\nsolutions is presented. This is shown to be computationally intractable, and a\nfaster heuristic that utilizes a lower bound approximation of the expected\nsmallest order statistic is proposed instead. The setup solutions obtained with\nthe proposed methods can result in substantial savings for MWM users.\nAlternatively, the analysis presented could be used by management to justify\nthe acquisition of new MWM machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 23:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

Many of these\nhave properties pointing to origins as the stripped nuclei of larger galaxies,\nand a smoking-gun example is presented of an omega Cen-like star cluster\nembedded in a tidal stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 00:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

In spontaneous fission, half-lives are the main observables\nand quantum tunnelling the essential concept, while in induced fission the\nfocus is on fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are\nneeded. The cornerstone of the current microscopic theory of fission is the\nenergy density functional formalism. Its basic tenets, including tools such as\nthe HFB theory, effective two-body effective nuclear potentials,\nfinite-temperature extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented\nsuccinctly. The EDF approach is often combined with the hypothesis that the\ntime-scale of the large amplitude collective motion driving the system to\nfission is slow compared to typical time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus.\nIn practice, this hypothesis of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a\nfew) collective variables and mapping out the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation\ninto a collective Schr\\\"odinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet.\nScission configurations indicate where the split occurs. This collective\nSchr\\\"odinger equation depends on an inertia tensor that includes the response\nof the system to small changes in the collective variables and also plays a\nspecial role in the determination of spontaneous fission half-lives. A\ntrademark of the microscopic theory of fission is the tremendous amount of\ncomputing needed for practical applications. In particular, the successful\nimplementation of the theories presented in this article requires a very\nprecise numerical resolution of the HFB equations for large values of the\ncollective variables. Finally, a selection of the most recent and\nrepresentative results obtained for both spontaneous and induced fission is\npresented with the goal of emphasizing the coherence of the microscopic\napproaches employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 00:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 18:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

A particularly studied setting is the shared link caching\nnetwork, in which a single source with access to a file library communicates\nwith multiple users, each having the capability to store segments (packets) of\nthe library files, over a shared multicast link. Each user requests one file\nfrom the library according to a common demand distribution and the server sends\na coded multicast message to satisfy all users at once. The problem consists of\nfinding the smallest possible average codeword length to satisfy such requests.\nIn this paper, we consider the generalization to the case where each user\nplaces L >= 1 independent requests according to the same common demand\ndistribution.

Such\nresearch is difficult because it requires making sense of non-linear\ncomputations performed by millions of parameters, but valuable because it\nincreases our ability to understand current models and create improved versions\nof them. In this paper we investigate the extent to which neural networks\nexhibit what we call convergent learning, which is when the representations\nlearned by multiple nets converge to a set of features which are either\nindividually similar between networks or where subsets of features span similar\nlow-dimensional spaces. We propose a specific method of probing\nrepresentations: training multiple networks and then comparing and contrasting\ntheir individual, learned representations at the level of neurons or groups of\nneurons.

Since the\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) have excellent capability of feature\nextraction, certain deep learning methods have been recently applied in person\nre-identification. However, in person re-identification, the deep networks\noften suffer from the over-fitting problem. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCNN-based method to learn a discriminative metric with good robustness to the\nover-fitting problem in person re-identification. Firstly, a novel deep\narchitecture is built where the Mahalanobis metric is learned with a weight\nconstraint. This weight constraint is used to regularize the learning, so that\nthe learned metric has a better generalization ability. Secondly, we find that\nthe selection of intra-class sample pairs is crucial for learning but has\nreceived little attention. To cope with the large intra-class variations in\npedestrian images, we propose a novel training strategy named moderate positive\nmining to prevent the training process from over-fitting to the extreme samples\nin intra-class pairs.

Both source and relay transmissions use rateless code, which\nallows the destination to employ any of the two information receiving\nstrategies, i.e., the mutual information accumulation (IA) and the energy\naccumulation (EA). The SWIPT-enabled relay employs three different SWIPT\nreceiver architectures, the ideal receiver and two practical receivers (i.e.,\nthe power splitting (PS) and the time switch (TS) receivers). Accordingly,\nthree relaying protocols, namely, ideal protocol, PS protocol and TS protocol,\nare presented. In order to explore the system performance limits with these\nthree protocols, optimization problems are formulated to maximize their\nachievable information rates. For the ideal protocol, explicit expressions of\nthe optimal solutions are derived. For the PS protocol, a linear-search\nalgorithm is designed to solve the non-convex problems.

Numerical experiments are carried out to\nvalidate our analysis and algorithms, which also show that, with the same SWIPT\nreceiver, the IA-based system outperforms the EA-based system, while with the\nsame information receiving strategy, PS protocol outperforms TS protocol.\nMoreover, compared with conventional non-SWIPT and non-rateless-coded systems,\nthe proposed protocols exhibit considerable performance gains, especially in\nrelatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Besides, the effects of the\nsource-destination direct link and the relay position on system performance are\nalso discussed, which provides insights on SWIPT-enabled relay systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 03:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

They form a natural, well-studied class of codes; they\ninclude popular codes such as Reed-Muller and Reed-Solomon. A particularly\nappealing feature of affine-invariant codes is that they seem well-suited to\nadmit local correctors and testers.\n  In this work, we give lower bounds on the length of locally correctable and\nlocally testable affine-invariant codes with constant query complexity. We show\nthat if a code $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\Sigma^{\\mathbb{K}^n}$ is an $r$-query\nlocally correctable code (LCC), where $\\mathbb{K}$ is a finite field and\n$\\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet, then the number of codewords in $\\mathcal{C}$ is\nat most $\\exp(O_{\\mathbb{K}, r, |\\Sigma|}(n^{r-1}))$.

This paper\npresents an efficient scheme to minimize compression costs under dynamic\nconditions where deliveries to customers are described by time-dependent mass\nflow. The optimization scheme relies on a compact representation of gas flow\nphysics, a trapezoidal discretization in time and space, and a two-stage\napproach to minimize energy costs and maximize smoothness.

The crucial assumption underlying this\nmathematical and computational \"technology transfer\" is that the evolving\nstates of the nodes in a network quickly become correlated with the\ncorresponding node \"identities\": features of the nodes imparted by the network\nstructure (e.g. the node degree, the node clustering coefficient). The node\ndynamics thus depend on heterogeneous (rather than uncertain) parameters, whose\ndistribution over the network results from the network structure. Knowing these\ndistributions allows us to obtain an efficient coarse-grained representation of\nthe network state in terms of the expansion coefficients in suitable orthogonal\npolynomials. This representation is closely related to\nmathematical/computational tools for uncertainty quantification (the Polynomial\nChaos approach and its associated numerical techniques). The Polynomial Chaos\ncoefficients provide a set of good collective variables for the observation of\ndynamics on a network, and subsequently, for the implementation of reduced\ndynamic models of it. We demonstrate this idea by performing coarse-grained\ncomputations of the nonlinear dynamics of information propagation on our\nillustrative network model using the Equation-Free approach\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 08:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

Transfer of energy into\ntranslation is calculated from the mean energy transfer for this population at\nthe specified collision energy. The simulations are compared with a continuum\nmodel for the on-axis density, temperature and velocity; rotational temperature\nas a function of distance from the nozzle is in accord with expectations from\nexperimental measurements. The method could be applied to other types of gas\nmixture dynamics under non-uniform conditions, such as buffer gas cooling of\nNH$_3$ by He.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 09:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

Similar spectral features are often\nobserved in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and other black-hole binaries (BHBs),\nand several models have been proposed for explaining it. In order to\ndistinguish spectral models, time variation provides an important key. In AGNs,\nvariation amplitude has been found to drop significantly at the iron K-energy\nband at timescales of ~10 ks. If spectral variations of black-holes are\nnormalized by their masses, the spectral variations of BHBs at timescales of\nsub-seconds should exhibit similar characteristics to those of AGNs. In this\npaper, we investigated spectral variations of GRS 1915+105 at timescales down\nto ~10 ms. This was made possible for the first time with the Suzaku XIS\nParallel-sum clocking (P-sum) mode, which has the CCD energy-resolution as well\nas a time-resolution of 7.8 ms. Consequently, we found that the variation\namplitude of GRS 1915+105 does not drop at the iron K-energy band at any\ntimescales from 0.06 s to 63000 s, and that the entire X-ray flux and the iron\nfeature are independently variable at timescales of hours. These are naturally\nunderstood in the framework of the ``partial covering'' model, in which\nvariation timescales of the continuum flux and partial absorbers are\nindependent. The difference of energy dependence of the variation amplitude\nbetween AGN and BHB is presumably due to different mechanisms of the outflow\nwinds, i.e., the partial absorbers are due to UV-line driven winds (AGN) or\nthermally-driven winds (BHB).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 10:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new type of solitons\nlocated at the Dirac point beyond photonic bandgaps.

We then revisit the question of the accretion rate, which allows us to\nunderstand the distribution of the observed pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) stars in\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram.

The objective of such research is often to identify the smallest\npossible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance. The\nproblem of assigning tumours to a known class is a particularly important\nexample that has received considerable attention in the last ten years.

The direct optimization of such a function can be\nvery difficult because the problem is potentially discontinuous and nonconvex.\nWe therefore propose a general procedure for variable selection that resembles\nimportance sampling to explore the feature space.

In this work, we\npresent a detailed analysis on both X-ray and near-ultraviolet (NUV) light\ncurves. The fluxes at all wavelengths display a near-exponential decays in the\nearly phase and transits to a faster-decay at late times. The e-folding decay\ntime-scales monotonically decrease with photon energies, and the derived\nviscous time-scale is $\\tau_{\\rm \\dot{M}} \\sim 60$ days. The time-scale in the\nlate faster-decay stage is about a few days. The high ratio of NUV luminosity\nto X-ray luminosity indicates that the irradiation is unimportant in this\noutburst, while the near-exponential decay profile and the long decay\ntime-scales conflict with the disc thermal-viscous instability model. We thus\nsuggest that the disc is thermally stable during the observations. Adopting the\ntruncated disc model, we obtain a lower limit of peak accretion rate of $0.03\n\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$ and the X-ray radiative efficiency $\\eta < 5\\times10^{-4}$,\nwhich decreases as the luminosity declines. The low X-ray radiative efficiency\nis caused by the combined action of advection and outflows, and naturally\nexplains that the X-ray reprocessing is overwhelmed by the viscous radiation of\nthe outer standard disc in the NUV regime. We also propose a possibility that\nthe outer standard disc recedes from the central black hole, resulting in the\nfaster-decay at late times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 12:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

Numerical test-particle simulations are a reliable and frequently used\ntool to test analytical transport theories and to predict mean-free paths. The\ncomparison between solutions of the diffusion equation and the particle flux is\nused to critically judge the applicability of diffusion to the stochastic\ntransport of energetic particles in magnetized turbulence. Methods. A\nMonte-Carlo simulation code is extended to allow for the generation of\nintensity profiles as well as anisotropy-time profiles. Due to the relatively\nlow number density of computational particles, a kernel function has to be used\nto describe the spatial extent of each particle. Results. The obtained\nintensity profiles are interpreted as solutions of the diffusion equation by\ninserting the diffusion coefficients that have been directly determined from\nthe mean-square displacements. The comparison shows that the time dependence of\nthe diffusion coefficients needs to be considered, in particular the initial\nballistic phase and the often sub-diffusive perpendicular coefficient.\nConclusions. It is argued that the perpendicular component of the distribution\nfunction is essential if agreement between the diffusion solution and the\nsimulated flux is to be obtained. In addition, time-dependent diffusion can\nprovide a better description than the classic diffusion equation only after the\ninitial ballistic phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 12:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In addition, the space density of CVs is\nfound to be significantly lower than theoretical models. We investigate the\ninfluence of nova outbursts on the formation and (initial) evolution of CVs. In\nparticular, we calculate the stability of the mass transfer in case all the\nmaterial accreted on the WD is lost in classical novae, and part of the energy\nto eject the material comes from a common-envelope like interaction with the\ncompanion. In addition, we study the effect of an asymmetry in the mass\nejection, that may lead to small eccentricities in the orbit. We find that a\ncommon-envelope like ejection significantly decreases the stability of the mass\ntransfer, in particular for low-mass WD. Similarly, the influence of asymmetric\nmass loss can be important for short-period systems and even more so for\nlow-mass WD, but likely disappears long before the next nova outburst due to\norbital circularization. In both cases the mass-transfer rates increase, which\nmay lead to observable (and perhaps already observed) consequences for systems\nthat do survive to become CVs. However, a more detailed investigation of the\ninteraction between nova ejecta and the companion and the evolution of slightly\neccentric CVs is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 13:47:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Diversity in 2G devices can be present\nboth in form of multiple receive branches and blind repetitions. In presence of\ndiversity, intersymbol interference (ISI) equalization and co-channel\ninterference (CCI) suppression are usually very complex. In this paper, we\nconsider the improvements for 2G devices with receive diversity. We derive a\nlow-complexity receiver based on a channel shortening filter, which allows to\nsum up all diversity branches to a single stream after filtering while keeping\nthe full diversity gain. The summed up stream is subsequently processed by a\nsingle stream Max-log-MAP (MLM) equalizer. The channel shortening filter is\ndesigned to maximize the mutual information lower bound (MILB) with the\nUngerboeck detection model. Its filter coefficients can be obtained mainly by\nmeans of discrete-Fourier transforms (DFTs). Compared with the state-of-art\nhomomorphic (HOM) filtering based channel shortener which cooperates with a\ndelayed-decision feedback MLM (DDF-MLM) equalizer, the proposed MILB channel\nshortener has superior performance. Moreover, the equalization complexity, in\nterms of real-valued multiplications, is decreased by a factor that equals the\nnumber of diversity branches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 13:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

We revisit the formation of this\ncharacteristic spectrum, considering a particular situation where the electrons\nare accelerated through gyroresonant interaction with magnetohydrodynamic wave\nturbulence driven by the turbulent cascade. By solving kinetic equations of the\nturbulent fields, electrons, and photons emitted via the synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) process, we demonstrate that in the non-test-particle\ntreatment, the formation of a Maxwellian-like distribution is prevented by the\ndamping effect on the turbulent fields due to the electron acceleration, at\nleast unless an extreme parameter value is chosen. Instead, a softer electron\nspectrum with the index of $m \\approx -1$ is produced if the Kolmogorov-type\ncascade is assumed. The SSC spectrum that originates from the resultant softer\nelectron spectrum is still hard, but somewhat softer and broader than the case\nof $m=2$. This change of achievable hardness should be noted when this basic\nparticle acceleration scenario is tested with observations of hard photon\nspectra accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 14:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2015 19:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

In particular, their dynamics\nunder external fields is an issue of vital importance both for fundamental\nscience and for technical application. Whereas observations of magnetic\nskyrmions had been limited to metallic magnets so far, their realization was\ndiscovered also in a chiral-lattice insulating magnet Cu2OSeO3 in 2012.\nSkyrmions in the insulator turned out to exhibit multiferroic nature with\nspin-induced ferroelectricity. Strong magnetoelectric coupling between\nnoncollinear skyrmion spins and electric polarizations mediated by relativistic\nspin-orbit interaction enables us to drive motion and oscillation of magnetic\nskyrmions by application of electric fields instead of injection of electric\ncurrents. Insulating materials also provide an environment suitable for\ndetection of pure spin dynamics through spectroscopic measurements owing to\nabsence of appreciable charge excitations. In this article, we review recent\ntheoretical and experimental studies on multiferroic properties and dynamical\nmagnetoelectric phenomena of magnetic skyrmions in insulators. We argue that\nmultiferroic skyrmions show unique coupled oscillation modes of magnetizations\nand polarizations, so-called electromagnon excitations, which are both\nmagnetically and electrically active, and interference between the electric and\nmagnetic activation processes leads to peculiar magnetoelectric effects in a\nmicrowave frequency regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 15:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The Sun shows an activity cycle that is caused by its varying global\nmagnetic field. During a solar cycle, sunspots, i.e. extended regions of strong\nmagnetic fields, occur in activity belts that are slowly migrating from middle\nto lower latitudes, finally arriving close to the equator during the cycle\nmaximum phase. While this have been well known for centuries, much less is\nknown about the solar cycle evolution of small-scale magnetic fields. Aims. To\naddress this question, we study magnetic bright points (MBPs) as proxies for\nsuch small-scale, kG solar magnetic fields. This study is based on a\nhomogeneous data set that covers a period of eight years. Methods. An automated\nMBP identification algorithm was applied to the synoptic Hinode/SOT G-band data\nover the period November 2006 to August 2014, i.e. covering the decreasing\nphase of Cycle 23 and the rise, maximum, and early decrease of Cycle 24. This\ndata set includes, at the moment of investigation, a total of 4 162 images,\nwith about 2.9 million single MBP detections. Results. After a careful\npreselection and monthly median filtering of the data, the investigation\nrevealed that the number of MBPs close to the equator is coupled to the global\nsolar cycle but shifted in time by about 2.5 years. Furthermore, the\ninstantaneous number of detected MBPs depends on the hemisphere, with one\nhemisphere being more prominent, i.e. showing a higher number of MBPs. After\nthe end of Cycle 23 and at the starting point of Cycle 24, the more active\nhemisphere changed from south to north. Conclusions. These findings suggest\nthat there is indeed a coupling between the activity of MBPs close to the\nequator with the global magnetic field. The results also indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of the magnetic flux that is visible as MBPs close to the\nequator originates from the sunspot activity belts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 15:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

Under the assumption that HM is metastable with their free\nenergies being larger than those of 3QM but smaller than those of 2-flavor\nquark matter (2QM), we consider in this paper the conversion induced by\ndiffusions of seed 3QM. This is a sequel to our previous paper, in which the\nshock-induced conversion was studied in the same frame work. We not only pay\nattention to the jump condition on both sides of the conversion front but the\nstructures inside the front are also considered by taking into account what\nhappens during the conversion processes on the time scale of weak interactions.\nWe employ for HM the Shen's EOS, which is based on the relativistic mean field\ntheory, and the bag model-based EOS for QM just as in the previous paper. We\ndemonstrated in that paper that in this combination of EOS's the combustion\nwill occur for a wide range of the bag constant and strong coupling constant in\nthe so-called endothermic regime, in which the Hugoniot curve for combustion\nruns below the initial state. We find that weak deflagration nearly always\noccurs and that weak detonation is possible only when the diffusion constant is\n(unrealistically) large and the critical strange fraction is small. The\nvelocities of the conversion front are ~ $10^3-10^7$ cm/s depending on the\ninitial temperature and density as well as the parameters in the QM EOS and\nbecome particularly small when the final state is in the mixed phase.

This model integrates a number of system\ndecisions in both the planning and operational stages, including facility\nlocation, multi-level service assignments, multi-modal transportation\nconfiguration, and inventory management. In particular, we consider\nprobabilistic supplier disruptions that may halt product supply from certain\nsuppliers from time to time. To mitigate the impact from supplier disruptions,\na terminal facility may be assigned to multiple supplies that back up each\nother with different service priorities. With such multi-level service\nassignments, even when some suppliers are disrupted, a facility may still be\nsupplied by the remaining functioning suppliers. Expensive expedited shipments\nyet with assured fast delivery may be used in complement to less expensive\nregular shipments yet with uncertain long lead times. Combining these two\nshipment modes can better leverage the inventory management against uncertain\ndemands. We formulate this problem into a mix-integer nonlinear program that\nsimultaneously determines all these interdependent system decisions to minimize\nthe expected system cost under uncertainties from both suppliers and demands. A\ncustomized solution algorithm based on the Lagrangian relaxation is developed\nto efficiently solve this model. Several numerical examples are conduced to\ntest the proposed model and draw managerial insights into how the key\nparameters affect the optimal system design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 06:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}
