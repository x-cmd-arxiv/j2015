However, enabling multi-view 3D video\nservices may overwhelm WiFi networks when every view of a video are\nmulticasted. In this paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate\ndepth-image-based rendering (DIBR), which allows each mobile client to\nsynthesize the desired view from nearby left and right views, in order to\neffectively reduce the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, when each client\nsuffers from packet losses, retransmissions incur additional bandwidth\nconsumption and excess delay, which in turn undermines the quality of\nexperience in video applications. To address the above issue, we first discover\nthe merit of view protection via DIBR for multi-view video multicast using a\nmathematical analysis and then design a new protocol, named Multi-View Group\nManagement Protocol (MVGMP), to support the dynamic join and leave of users and\nthe change of desired views.

ABC methods use a comparison between simulated data, using different\nparameters drew from a prior distribution, and observed data. This comparison\nprocess is based on computing a distance between the summary statistics from\nthe simulated data and the observed data. For complex models, it is usually\ndifficult to define a methodology for choosing or constructing the summary\nstatistics. Recently, a nonparametric ABC has been proposed, that uses a\ndissimilarity measure between discrete distributions based on empirical kernel\nembeddings as an alternative for summary statistics. The nonparametric ABC\noutperforms other methods including ABC, kernel ABC or synthetic likelihood\nABC. However, it assumes that the probability distributions are discrete, and\nit is not robust when dealing with few observations.

An\nevent in decision theory corresponds to the measurement of an observable. This\nanalogy looks clear for operationally testable simple events. However, the\nsituation is essentially more complicated in the case of composite events. The\nmost difficult point is the relation between decisions under uncertainty and\nmeasurements under uncertainty. We suggest a unified language for describing\nthe processes of quantum decision making and quantum measurements. The notion\nof quantum measurements under uncertainty is introduced. We show that the\ncorrect mathematical foundation for the theory of measurements under\nuncertainty, as well as for quantum decision theory dealing with uncertain\nevents, requires the use of positive operator-valued measure that is a\ngeneralization of projection-valued measure. The latter is appropriate for\noperationally testable events, while the former is necessary for characterizing\noperationally uncertain events. In both decision making and quantum\nmeasurements, one has to distinguish composite non-entangled events from\ncomposite entangled events. Quantum probability can be essentially different\nfrom classical probability only for entangled events. The necessary condition\nfor the appearance of an interference term in the quantum probability is the\noccurrence of entangled prospects and the existence of an entangled strategic\nstate of a decision maker or of an entangled statistical state of a measuring\ndevice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 16:14:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Since magnetic fields are\ndivergence free, this scalar potential obeys Laplace's equation, given an\nappropriate boundary condition (BC). With measurements of the full magnetic\nvector at the photosphere, it is possible to employ either Neumann or Dirichlet\nBCs there. Historically, the Neumann BC was used with available line-of-sight\nmagnetic field measurements, which approximate the radial field needed for the\nNeumann BC. Since each BC fully determines the 3D vector magnetic field, either\nchoice will, in general, be inconsistent with some aspect of the observed field\non the boundary, due to the presence of both currents and noise in the observed\nfield.

The model is based on breakable\nelements which break when the force experienced by the elements exceed their\nown load capacity. In this model when an element breaks, the capacity of the\nneighboring elements are decreased by a certain amount assuming weakening\neffect around the defected zone. We numerically investigate the stress-strain\nbehavior, the strength of the system, how it scales with the system size and\nalso it's fluctuation for both uniformly and weibull distributed breaking\nthreshold of the elements in the system.

We\nreconsider the role of decoherence in adiabatic quantum computation and quantum\nannealing using the adiabatic quantum master equation formalism. We restrict\nourselves to the weak-coupling and singular-coupling limits, which correspond\nto decoherence in the energy eigenbasis and in the computational basis,\nrespectively.

To address the high computational\ncost of master equation simulations, we also demonstrate that a quantum Monte\nCarlo algorithm that explicitly accounts for a thermal bosonic bath can be used\nto interpolate between classical and quantum annealing.

These \"cold\" Planck sources,\nselected using the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) directly from the maps and\nfrom the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS), all satisfy the criterion\nof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range\n353 and 857 GHz. This colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift range\nz=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (CIB).\nWe perform a dedicated Herschel-SPIRE follow-up of 234 such Planck targets,\nfinding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison to\nreference SPIRE fields. About 94% of the SPIRE sources in the Planck fields are\nconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. About 3% are\ncandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopic\nconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z>2.2. The galaxy overdensities are\ndetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statistical\nsignificance above 10sigma. The SPIRE photometric redshifts of galaxies in\noverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. Under the Td=35K assumption, we derive an\ninfrared (IR) luminosity for each SPIRE source of about 4x10^12 Lsun, yielding\nstar formation rates of typically 700 Msun.yr^-1. If the observed overdensities\nare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formation\nrates reaches 7x10^3 Msun.yr^-1. Taken together, these sources show the\nsignatures of high-z (z>$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.\nAll these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate the\nability of the all-sky Planck-HFI cold sources to select populations of\ncosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 18:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 13:17:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-07"}

This paper\ncritically re-examines this formation scenario by comparing the number ratio of\nRR Lyrae to M giant stars associated with the TriAnd clouds with other\nstructures in the Galaxy. The current data suggest a stellar population for\nthese over-densities ($f_{\\rm RR:MG} < 0.38$ at 95% confidence) quite unlike\nany of the known satellites of the Milky Way ($f_{\\rm RR:MG} \\approx 0.5$ for\nthe very largest and $f_{\\rm RR:MG} >>1$ for the smaller satellites) and more\nlike the population of stars born in the much deeper potential well inhabited\nby the Galactic disk ($f_{\\rm RR:MG} < 0.01$).

In ordinary waveguides, imperfections and disorder\ncause unwanted back-reflections, which hinder large-scale optical integration.\nTopological photonic structures, a new class of optical systems inspired by\nquantum Hall effect and topological insulators, can realize robust transport\nvia topologically-protected unidirectional edge modes. Such waveguides are\nrealized by the introduction of synthetic gauge fields for photons in a\ntwo-dimensional structure, which break time reversal symmetry and enable\none-way guiding at the edge of the medium. Here we suggest a different route\ntoward robust transport of light in lower-dimensional (1D) photonic lattices,\nin which time reversal symmetry is broken because of the {\\it non-Hermitian}\nnature of transport. While a forward propagating mode in the lattice is\namplified, the corresponding backward propagating mode is damped, thus\nresulting in an asymmetric transport that is rather insensitive to disorder or\nimperfections in the structure. Non-Hermitian transport in two lattice models\nis considered: a tight-binding lattice with an imaginary gauge field\n(Hatano-Nelson model), and a non-Hermitian driven binary lattice. In the former\ncase transport in spite of disorder is ensured by a mobility edge that arises\nbecause of a non-Hermitian delocalization transition. The possibility to\nobserve non-Hermitian delocalization induced by a synthetic 'imaginary' gauge\nfield is suggested using an engineered coupled-resonator optical waveguide\n(CROW) structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 18:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 12:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

In recent developments it was found that in\nthree spatial dimensions a qubit color code can support a transversal\nnon-Clifford gate, and that in higher spatial dimensions additional\nnon-Clifford gates can be found, saturating Bravyi and K\\\"onig's bound [Phys.\nRev.

In Zombies and Survivors, a\nset of zombies attempts to eat a lone survivor loose on a given graph.

At each round, they move to the\nneighbouring vertex that minimizes the distance to the survivor; if there is\nmore than one such vertex, then they choose one uniformly at random. The\nsurvivor attempts to escape from the zombies by moving to a neighbouring vertex\nor staying on his current vertex. The zombies win if eventually one of them\neats the survivor by landing on their vertex; otherwise, the survivor wins. The\nzombie number of a graph is the minimum number of zombies needed to play such\nthat the probability that they win is strictly greater than 1/2.

In this paper we argue that the Glashow\nresonance within the Standard Model also occurs in neutrino--nucleus\ncollisions. The main conclusions are as follows. 1)~The Glashow resonance can\nbe excited by both~neutrinos and~antineutrinos of all the three flavors\nscattering in the Coulomb field of a nucleus. 2)~The Glashow resonance in a\nneutrino--nucleus reaction does not manifest itself as a Breit--Wigner-like\npeak in the cross section but the latter exhibits instead a slow\nlogarithmic-law growth with the neutrino energy. The resonance turns thus out\nto be hidden. 3)~More than~$98\\%$ of~$W$ bosons produced in the sub-PeV region\nin neutrino-initiated reactions in water/ice will be from the Glashow\nresonance. 4)~The vast majority of the Glashow resonance events in a neutrino\ndetector is expected at energies from a few TeV to a few tens of TeV, being\nmostly initiated by the conventional atmospheric neutrinos dominant in this\nenergy range. Calculations of the cross sections for Glashow resonance\nexcitation on the oxygen nucleus as well as on the proton are carried out in\ndetail. The results of this paper can be useful for studies of neutrino\ninteractions at large volume water/ice neutrino detectors. For example, in the\nIceCube detector one can expect~0.3 Glashow resonance events with shower-like\ntopologies and the deposited energies above~$300~\\text{TeV}$ per year. It is\ntherefore likely already to have at least one Glashow resonance event in the\nIceCube data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 19:52:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 21:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

The Effective Field\nTheory of LSS (EFTofLSS) is a novel theoretical framework that aims to develop\nan analytic understanding of LSS at long distances, where inhomogeneities are\nsmall. We further develop the description of biased tracers in the EFTofLSS to\naccount for the effect of baryonic physics and primordial non-Gaussianities,\nfinding that new bias coefficients are required. Then, restricting to dark\nmatter with Gaussian initial conditions, we describe the prediction of the\nEFTofLSS for the one-loop halo-halo and halo-matter two-point functions, and\nfor the tree-level halo-halo-halo, matter-halo-halo and matter-matter-halo\nthree-point functions. Several new bias coefficients are needed in the\nEFTofLSS, even though their contribution at a given order can be degenerate and\nthe same parameters contribute to multiple observables. We develop a method to\nreduce the number of biases to an irreducible basis, and find that, at the\norder at which we work, seven bias parameters are enough to describe this\nextremely rich set of statistics.

The flash of radiation from the nova\nevent had no effect on the ejecta until at least 55 days after the eruption\nbegan.

Using the derived\nsystemic velocity of -150 km/s and the best available limits on the source\ndistance, we infer that the black hole is moving towards the Plane in its\ncurrent Galactic orbit unless the proper motion is substantial. Finally, the\ndepth of the central absorption in the double peaked profiles adds support for\nSwift J1357.2-0933 as a high-inclination system. On the other hand, we argue\nthat the low hydrogen column density inferred from X-ray fitting suggests that\nthe system is not seen edge-on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 23:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

We used 8059 SDSS AGNs/QSOs for which virial\nmasses of individual SMBHs were measured, and divided them into four mass\ngroups. Cross-correlation analysis was performed and bias for each mass group\nwas derived. The averaged color and luminosity distributions of galaxies around\nthe AGNs/QSOs were also derived for each mass group. The galaxy color was\nestimated for SED constructed from a merged SDSS and UKIDSS catalog. The\ndistributions of color and luminosity were derived by the subtraction method,\nwhich does not require redshift information of galaxies. The main results of\nthis work are: (1) a bias increases by a factor two from the lower mass group\nto the highest mass group; (2) the environment around AGNs with the most\nmassive SMBH (Mbh > 10^9 Msun) is dominated by red sequence galaxies; (3)\nmarginal indication of decline in luminosity function at dimmer side of M >\n-19.5 mag is found for galaxies around AGNs with Mbh = 10^8.2 - 10^9 Msun and\nnearest redshift group (z=0.1-0.3). These results indicate that AGNs with the\nmost massive SMBHs reside in haloes where large fraction of galaxies have been\ntransited to the red sequence. The accretion of hot halo gas as well as\nrecycled gas from evolving stars can be the most plausible mechanism to fuel\nthe SMBHs above ~10^9 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 02:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 07:43:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 01:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

This problem becomes more elucidated, when the\ndeep-subwavelength-scaled two-dimensional (2D) material (e.g., graphene and\nmolybdenum disulfide) is implemented into optoelectronic device as an active\nchannel layer. The purpose of this work was to conceive the idea for using a\ncharge storage layer (spherical Au nanoparticles (AuNPs), embedded into\ndielectric matrix) of the floating-gate graphene photodetector as a magnetic\nmirror, which allows the device to harness the increase in broadband light\nabsorption. In particular, we systematically examined whether the versatile\nassembly of spherical AuNP monolayer within a dielectric matrix (i.e., optical\nmetamaterial mirror), which should be designed to be placed right below the\ngraphene channel layer for floating-gate device, can be indeed treated as the\neffective magnetic mirror. In addition to being capable of the enhancement of\nbroadband light absorption, versatile access to various structural motifs of\nAuNPs benefitting from recent advances in chemical synthesis promises\ncompelling opportunities for sophisticated engineering of optical metamaterial\nmirror. High amenability of the AuNP assembly with the semiconductor-related\nprocedures may make this strategy widely applicable to various thin film\noptoelectronic devices. Our study thereby illustrates advantages in advancing\nthe design of mirror for rational engineering of light-matter interaction\nwithin deep-subwavelength-scaled optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 03:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Large stop masses, required for a 125 GeV Higgs, feed into the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking conditions through renormalisation group\nequations forcing one to fine tune these parameters to obtain the correct\nelectroweak vacuum expectation value. Nonetheless this fine tuning depends\ncrucially on our assumptions about the supersymmetry breaking scale. At the\nsame time $U(1)$ extensions provide the most compelling solution to the\n$\\mu$-problem, which is also a naturalness issue, and allow the tree level\nHiggs mass to be raised substantially above $M_Z$. These very well motivated\nsupersymmetric models predict a new $Z'$ boson which could be discovered at the\nLHC and the naturalness of the model requires that the $Z'$ boson mass should\nnot be too far above the TeV scale. Moreover this fine tuning appears at the\ntree level, making it less dependent on assumptions about the supersymmetry\nbreaking mechanism. Here we study this fine tuning for several $U(1)$\nsupersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model and compare it to the situation\nin the MSSM where the most direct tree level fine tuning can be probed through\nchargino mass limits. We show that future LHC $Z'$ searches are extremely\nimportant for challenging the most natural scenarios in these models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 06:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 07:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 13:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

Wu, Phys. Rev. D 83, 121502(R) (2011)], a new kind\nof metric ansatz was found to fairly describe all already known black hole\nsolutions in the ungauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) supergravity theories. That metric\nansatz somewhat resembles to the famous Kerr-Schild (KS) form, but it is\ndifferent from the KS one in two distinct aspects. That is, apart from a global\nconformal factor, the metric ansatz can be written as a vacuum background\nspacetime plus a \"perturbation\" modification term, the latter of which is\nassociated with a timelike geodesic vector field rather than a null geodesic\ncongruence in the usual KS ansatz. In this paper, we shall study this novel\nmetric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the\nconstruction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other\ngauged supergravity theories. In order to investigate the metric properties of\nthe general KK-AdS solutions, in this paper we devise a new effective method,\ndubbed the background metric expansion method, which can be thought of as a\ngeneralization of the perturbation expansion method, to deal with the\nLagrangian and all equations of motion. In addition to two previously known\nconditions, namely the timelike and geodesic properties of the vector, we get\nthe three additional constraints via contracting the Maxwell and Einstein\nequations once or twice with this timelike geodesic vector. In particular, we\nfind that these are a simple set of sufficient conditions to determine the\nvector and the dilaton scalar around the background metric, which is helpful in\nobtaining new exact solutions. With these five simplified equations in hand, we\nrederive the general rotating charged KK-(A)dS black hole solutions with\nspherical horizon topology and obtain new solutions with planar topology in all\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 06:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 08:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 06:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

In the proposed scenario, a server wishes to transmit\na finite sequence of packets to multiple receivers via a broadcast channel with\npacket erasures until all of the receivers successfully receive all of the\npackets. In the retransmission phase, the server produces a coded packet as a\nretransmitted packet based on the side-information sent from the receivers via\nfeedback channels. A notable feature of the proposed protocol is that the\ndecoding process at the receiver side has low decoding complexity because only\na small number of addition operations are needed in order to recover an\nintended packet. This feature may be preferable for reducing the power\nconsumption of receivers. The throughput performance of the proposed protocol\nis close to that of the ideal FEC throughput performance when the erasure\nprobability is less than $0.1$. This implies that the proposed protocol\nprovides almost optimal throughput performance in such a regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 07:08:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

In\nour contribution we investigate a model of four qubits with one qubit coupled\nto a phonon and (optionally) to environmental particles of high density of\nstates, called gravonons. The calculations indicate that when no gravonons are\npresent, the current in the qubit is flipped at some time and adiabatic\nevolution is discontinued. The time dependent wave functional becomes a\nnon-correctable superposition of many excited states. The results demonstrate\nthe possibility of effectively suppressing the current flip and allowing for\ncontinued adiabatic evolution when the entanglement to gravonons is included.\nThis adiabatic evolution is, however, a coherent evolution in high dimensional\nspacetime and cannot be understood as a solution of Schr\\\"odinger's time\ndependent equation in four dimensional spacetime.

Although the time reversal invariance and the\ntopological order are broken in the magnetic field, the investigation of\ncyclotron resonance allows determining whether this insulator was trivial or\nnontrivial at zero magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 08:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Such time-delay anisotropy, for which we measure values as\nlarge as 60 attoseconds, is caused by the interplay between final quantum\nstates with different symmetry and arises naturally whenever the\nphotoionization process involves the exchange of more than one photon in the\nfield of the parent-ion.

In clear contrast, near\na surface atomic step, QW states exhibit negligible changes at least up to 1 nm\naway from the step, leaving unmixed the two sets of neighboring QW states\nbelonging to different thicknesses. The results are discussed in terms of a\nsimple electron wave diffraction model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 10:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

These advantages, however, can be realized only when channel state\ninformation (CSI) is available at the transmitter. Since there are many\nantennas, CSI is too large to feed back without compression. To compress CSI,\nprior work has applied compressive sensing (CS) techniques and the fact that\nCSI can be sparsified. The adopted sparsifying bases fail, however, to reflect\nthe spatial correlation and channel conditions or to be feasible in practice.\nIn this paper, we propose a new sparsifying basis that reflects the long-term\ncharacteristics of the channel, and needs no change as long as the spatial\ncorrelation model does not change.

We review the methodology to interpret travel-time\nmeasurements in terms of small, localized perturbations to a horizontally\nhomogeneous reference solar model. Using the first Born approximation, we\nderive and compute 3D travel-time sensitivity (Fr\\'echet) kernels for\nperturbations in sound-speed, density, pressure, and vector flows. While\nkernels for sound speed and flows had been computed previously, here we extend\nthe calculation to kernels for density and pressure, hence providing a complete\ndescription of the effects of solar dynamics and structure on travel times.

The typical kernel calculations used in this paper are\ncomputer intensive and require on the order of 600 CPU hours per kernel.\nKernels are validated by computing the travel-time perturbation that results\nfrom horizontally-invariant perturbations using two independent approaches. At\nfixed sound-speed, the density and pressure kernels are approximately related\nthrough a negative multiplicative factor, therefore implying that perturbations\nin density and pressure are difficult to disentangle. Mean travel-times are not\nonly sensitive to sound-speed, density and pressure perturbations, but also to\nflows, especially vertical flows.

Indeed, even though the\ndiffusion coefficients may be considered known, questions on appropriate choice\nof the drift functions constitute a non-trivial model selection problem. In\nthis article, we develop the asymptotic theory for comparisons between\ncollections of SDEs with respect to the choice of drift functions using Bayes\nfactors when the number of equations (individuals) in the collection of SDEs\ntend to infinity while the time domains remain bounded for each equation. Our\nasymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated with\nthe SDEs are independently and identically distributed (iid), as well as when\nthey are independently but not identically distributed (non-iid). In\nparticular, we allow incorporation of available time-dependent covariate\ninformation into each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift\nfunction; we also permit different initial values and domains of observations\nfor the SDEs. Our model selection problem thus encompasses selection of a set\nof appropriate time-dependent covariates from a set of available time-dependent\ncovariates, besides selection of the part of the drift function free of\ncovariates.

Here, we demonstrate an\nalternative source for the Seebeck effect based on charge-carrier relaxation: A\ncharge mobility that changes rapidly with temperature can result in a sizeable\naddition to the Seebeck coefficient. This new Seebeck source is demonstrated\nexplicitly for Ni-doped CoSb3, where a dramatic mobility change occurs due to\nthe crossover between two different charge-relaxation regimes. Our findings\nunveil the origin of pronounced features in the Seebeck coefficient of many\nother elusive materials characterized by a significant mobility mismatch. As\nthe physical origin for the latter can vary greatly, our proposal provides a\nunifying framework for the understanding of a large panoply of thermoelectric\nphenomena. When utilized appropriately, this effect can also provide a novel\nroute to the design of improved thermoelectric materials for applications in\nsolid-state cooling or power generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 12:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

These\nsuper-functions are parametrized by superpartitions with fixed bosonic and\nfermionic degrees. Now, a truly amazing feature pops out when the fermionic\ndegree is sufficiently large: the Jack superpolynomials stabilize and\nfactorize. Their stability is with respect to their expansion in terms of an\nelementary basis where, in the stable sector, the expansion coefficients become\nindependent of the fermionic degree. Their factorization is seen when the\nfermionic variables are stripped off in a suitable way which results in a\nproduct of two ordinary Jack polynomials (somewhat modified by plethystic\ntransformations), dubbed the double Jack polynomials.

By plotting Poincar\\'e\nsurfaces of section and using two recurrence methods for similar situations as\nin the relativistic case, we find similar tendencies in the evolution of the\nphase portrait with parameters (mainly with mass of the disc/ring and with\nenergy of the orbiters), namely those characteristic to weakly non-integrable\nsystems. More specifically, this is true for the Paczy\\'nski--Wiita and a newly\nsuggested logarithmic potential, whereas the Nowak--Wagoner potential leads to\na different picture. The potentials and the exact relativistic system clearly\ndiffer in delimitation of the phase-space domain accessible to a given set of\nparticles, though this mainly affects the chaotic sea whereas not so much the\noccurrence and succession of discrete dynamical features (resonances). In the\npseudo-Newtonian systems, the particular dynamical features generally occur for\nslightly smaller values of the perturbation parameters than in the relativistic\nsystem, so one may say that the pseudo-Newtonian systems are slightly more\nprone to instability. We also add remarks on numerics (a different code is used\nthan in previous papers), on the resemblance of dependence of the dynamics on\nperturbing mass and on orbital energy, on the difference between the Newtonian\nand relativistic Bach--Weyl rings, and on the relation between Poincar\\'e\nsections and orbital shapes within the meridional plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 15:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-29"}

Here we show how such core glitches can\naffect the oscillations we observe in red giants. We derive an analytical\nexpression describing the expected frequency pattern in the presence of a\nglitch. This formulation also accounts for the coupling between acoustic and\ngravity waves. From an extensive set of canonical stellar models we find\nglitch-induced variation in the period spacing and inertia of non-radial modes\nduring several phases of red-giant evolution. Significant changes are seen in\nthe appearance of mode amplitude and frequency patterns in asteroseismic\ndiagrams such as the power spectrum and the \\'echelle diagram. Interestingly,\nalong the red-giant branch glitch-induced variation occurs only at the\nluminosity bump, potentially providing a direct seismic indicator of stars in\nthat particular evolution stage. Similarly, we find the variation at only\ncertain post-helium-ignition evolution stages, namely, in the early phases of\nhelium-core burning and at the beginning of helium-shell burning signifying the\nasymptotic-giant-branch bump. Based on our results, we note that assuming stars\nto be glitch-free, while they are not, can result in an incorrect estimate of\nthe period spacing. We further note that including diffusion and mixing beyond\nclassical Schwarzschild, could affect the characteristics of the glitches,\npotentially providing a way to study these physical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 15:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this article, we first develop an\nasymptotic theory of Bayes factors when two SDEs are compared, assuming the\ntime domain expands. Using this we then develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes\nfactors when systems of SDEs are compared, assuming that the number of\nequations in each system, as well as the time domain, increase indefinitely.\nOur asymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated\nwith the SDEs are independently and identically distributed (iid), as well as\nwhen they are independently but not identically distributed (non-iid). Quite\nimportantly, we allow inclusion of available time-dependent covariate\ninformation into each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift function\nin a random effects set-up; different initial values for the SDEs are also\npermitted. Thus, our general model-selection framework includes simultaneously\nthe variable selection problem associated with time-varying covariates, as well\nas choice of the part of the drift function free of covariates. As we show, the\nBayes factor is inconsistent for comparing individual SDEs, in the sense that\nthe log-Bayes factor converges only in expectation, while the relevant variance\ndoes not converge to zero.

Here we study the kinetics of\ntranslation at molecular level through a stochastic simulation model. The model\nexplicitly include RNA sequences, ribosome dynamics, tRNA pool and biochemical\nreactions in the translation elongation. The results show that the translation\nefficiency is mainly limited by the available ribosome number, translation\ninitiation and the translation elongation time. The elongation time is\nlog-normal distribution with mean and variance determined by both the codon\nsaturation and the process of aa-tRNA selection at each codon binding.\nMoreover, our simulations show that the translation accuracy exponentially\ndecreases with the sequence length. These results suggest that aa-tRNA\ncompetition is crucial for both translation elongation, translation efficiency\nand the accuracy, which in turn determined the effective protein production\nrate of correct proteins. Our results improve the dynamical equation of protein\nproduction with a delay differential equation which is dependent on sequence\ninformations through both the effective production rate and the distribution of\nelongation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 01:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

As proposed by Tegeler et al., this equation is also based on a\nfunctional form of the residual part of the reduced Helmholtz free energy.\nHowever in this work, the fundamental equation for the Helmholtz free energy\nhas been derived from the measured quantities CV(rho,T) and P(rho,T). The\nempirical description of the isochoric heat capacity CV is based on an original\nempirical description containing explicitly the metastable states. The new\nformulation is valid for the whole fluid region from the melting line to 2300 K\nand for pressures up to 50 000 MPa.
