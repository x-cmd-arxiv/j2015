We show that the model exhibits a Neel-type\nantiferromagnetic order, which simultaneously accompanies a ferroic toroidal\norder. We find that the occurrence of toroidal order modulates the magnon\ndispersion in an asymmetric way with respect to the wave number: a toroidal\ndipole order on the zigzag chain leads to a band-bottom shift, while a toroidal\noctupole order on the honeycomb lattice gives rise to a valley splitting. These\nasymmetric magnon excitations could be a source of unusual magnetic responses,\nsuch as nonreciprocal magnon transport. A variety of modulations are discussed\nwhile changing the lattice and magnetic symmetries. Implications of candidate\nmaterials for asymmetric magnon excitations are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2015 16:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 23:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-14"}

Following Fu et al. (2014), a Bayesian statistical\nframework is considered to make use of possible prior knowledge on the\nparameters of the distribution of the Xi, which is assumed Gaussian. Moreover,\na Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is carried out to estimate their\nposterior distribution by replacing H by a kriging metamodel build from a\nlimited number of simulated experiments. Two heuristics, involving two\ndifferent criteria to be optimized, are proposed to sequentially design these\ncomputer experiments in the limits of a given computational budget. The first\ncriterion is a Weighted Integrated Mean Square Error (WIMSE). The second one,\ncalled Expected Conditional Divergence (ECD), developed in the spirit of the\nStepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) criterion, is based on the discrepancy\nbetween two consecutive approximations of the target posterior distribution.\nSeveral numerical comparisons conducted over a toy example then a motivating\nreal case-study show that such adaptive designs can significantly outperform\nthe classical choice of a maximin Latin Hypercube Design (LHD) of experiments.\nDealing with a major concern in hydraulic engineering, a particular emphasis is\nplaced upon the prior elicitation of the case-study, highlighting the overall\nfeasibility of the methodology.

Despite the\nimportance of these chains to characterizing the stress state and dynamics of\nthe system, there is no common framework for quantifying their their\nproperties. Recently, attention has turned to the tools of network science as a\npromising route to such a description. In this paper, we apply community\ndetection techniques to numerically-generated packings of spheres over a range\nof interparticle friction coefficients and confining pressures. In order to\nextract chain-like features, we use a modularity maximization with a\nrecently-developed geographical null model \\cite{Bassett2015}, and optimize the\ntechnique to detect branched structures by minimizing the normalized convex\nhull of the detected communities. We characterize the force chain communities\nby their size (number of particles), network strength (internal forces), and\nnormalized convex hull ratio (sparseness). We find the that the first two\nexhibit an approximately linear correlation and are therefore largely\nredundant. For both pressure $P$ and interparticle friction $\\mu$, we observe\ncrossovers in behavior. For $\\mu \\lesssim 0.1$, the packings exhibit more\nsensitivity to pressure. In addition, we identify a crossover pressure where\nthe frictional dependence switches from having more large/strong communities at\nlow $\\mu$ vs. high $\\mu$. We explain these phenomena by comparison to the\nspatial distribution of communities along the vertical axis of the system.\nThese results provide new tools for considering the mesoscale structure of a\ngranular system and pave the way for reduced descriptions based on the force\nchain structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2015 18:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-25"}

To examine the\nchange in frequency with rotation and mass, we have studied oscillation\nfrequencies of two-dimensional uniformly rotating zero-age main sequence\nstellar models in the delta Scuti mass range. We identified 370 p and g\naxisymetric modes for non-rotating models and then traced the changes in their\nfrequencies as the rotational velocity was increased. For each mass we\nconsidered a rotation sequence of ten models, with the largest rotation rate\nbeing about 200 km s$^{-1}$. We constrained the models to have the same surface\nshape, which can be characterized for uniform rotation by the ratio between the\npolar and the equatorial radii. We find that scaling relationships exist among\nthe oscillation frequencies of the same mode for different masses when the\nmodels have the same shape. For p modes, this scaling closely follows the\nperiod root-mean-density relation found in spherical stars. The g modes also\nscale between models of the same shape, with the scaling reflecting the change\nin properties outside the convective core as the stellar mass increases. These\nscaling relationships can be particularly useful in finding specific stellar\nmodels to match the oscillation frequencies of individual stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 00:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 19:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Nontrivial SPT phases cannot be\nadiabatically connected to the trivial disordered state(or atomic insulator) as\nlong as certain global symmetry $G$ is unbroken. At low energies, most of\ntwo-dimensional SPTs with Abelian symmetry can be described by topological\nquantum field theory (TQFT) of multi-component Chern-Simons type. However, in\ncontrast to the fractional quantum Hall effect where TQFT can give rise to\ninteresting bulk anyons, TQFT for SPTs only supports trivial bulk excitations.\nThe essential question in TQFT descriptions for SPTs is to understand how the\nglobal symmetry is implemented in the partition function. In this paper, we\nsystematically study TQFT of three-dimensional SPTs with unitary Abelian\nsymmetry (e.g., $\\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\\times\\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\\times\\cdots$). In\naddition to the usual multi-component $BF$ topological term at level-$1$, we\nfind that there are new topological terms with quantized coefficients (e.g.,\n$a^1\\wedge a^2\\wedge d a^2$ and $a^1\\wedge a^2\\wedge a^3\\wedge a^4$) in TQFT\nactions, where $a^{1},a^2,\\cdots$ are 1-form U(1) gauge fields. These\nadditional topological terms cannot be adiabatically turned off as long as $G$\nis unbroken. By investigating symmetry transformations for the TQFT partition\nfunction, we end up with the classification of SPTs that is consistent with the\nwell-known group cohomology approach.

For general GIC's, many inner bounds\nhave been provided over the years, among of them, the Han-Kobayashi (HK)\nregion, is the most celebrated one. Unfortunately, the calculation of the HK\nregion is prohibitively complex, due to the appearance of some auxiliary random\nvariables, whose optimal choice is an open problem. As in other multi-user\ncommunication systems, these achievable regions are based on ensembles of\ni.i.d.

In this paper, we show that for the GIC, it\nis worthwhile to employ random coding ensembles of codewords with memory.\nSpecifically, we take known achievable regions for the GIC, and\ngeneralize/improve them by allowing dependency between the code symbols. For\nexample, we improve the state-of-the-art HK region by drawing the codewords (of\neach codeword and for each user) from a first-order autoregressive moving\naverage (ARMA) Gaussian process.

It involves all parts of\nthe molecule and is particularly important in glassy systems because of its\nvery close relationship with the $\\alpha$-relaxation process. However, the\nabsence of a J-G $\\beta$-relaxation mode in colloidal glasses raises questions\nregarding its universality. In the present work, we study the microscopic\nrelaxation processes in Laponite suspensions, a model soft glassy material, by\ndynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$-relaxation\ntimescales are estimated from the autocorrelation functions obtained by DLS\nmeasurements for Laponite suspensions with different concentrations, salt\nconcentrations and temperatures. Our experimental results suggest that the\n$\\beta$-relaxation process in Laponite suspensions involves all parts of the\nconstituent Laponite particle. The ergodicity breaking time is also seen to be\ncorrelated with the characteristic time of the $\\beta$-relaxation process for\nall Laponite concentrations, salt concentrations and temperatures. The width of\nthe primary relaxation process is observed to be correlated with the secondary\nrelaxation time. The secondary relaxation time is also very sensitive to the\nconcentration of Laponite. We measure primitive relaxation timescales from the\n$\\alpha$-relaxation time and the stretching exponent ($\\beta$) by applying the\ncoupling model for highly correlated systems. The order of magnitude of the\nprimitive relaxation time is very close to the secondary relaxation time. These\nobservations indicate the presence of a J-G $\\beta$-relaxation mode for soft\ncolloidal suspensions of Laponite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 11:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

That is, we assume that workers are rational in a game-theoretic\nsense, and that they randomize their strategic choice. Workers are assigned\nmultiple tasks in subsequent rounds. We model the system as an infinitely\nrepeated game of the mixed extension of the strategic game. In each round, the\nmaster decides stochastically whether to accept the answer of the majority or\nverify the answers received, at some cost. Incentives and/or penalties are\napplied to workers accordingly. Under the above framework, we study the\nconditions in which the master can reliably obtain tasks results, exploiting\nthat the repeated games model captures the effect of long-term interaction.\nThat is, workers take into account that their behavior in one computation will\nhave an effect on the behavior of other workers in the future. Indeed, should a\nworker be found to deviate from some agreed strategic choice, the remaining\nworkers would change their own strategy to penalize the deviator. Hence, being\nrational, workers do not deviate.

Then, we consider other models where Extended Chaplygin gas and\nquintessence field play role of dark matter and dark energy respectively with\ntwo different forms of interaction between the extended Chaplygin gas and\nquintessence scalar field for both constant and varying $\\Lambda$. Concerning\nto the mathematical hardness of the problems we discuss results numerically and\ngraphically. Obtained results give us hope that proposed models can work as\ngood models for the early universe with later stage of evolution containing\naccelerated expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 12:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

The fractal dimensions of the geometrical\nshapes in gorga are calculated and they are conjectured into 1.5-1.6, between\nthe dimensional of a line and a plane.
