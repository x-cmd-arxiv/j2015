Understanding\nthe dynamics of a system from its observed time series is key to the prediction\nand control of the system's behavior. While most existing techniques tacitly\nassume some form of stationarity or continuity, abrupt changes, which are often\ndue to external disturbances or sudden changes in the intrinsic dynamics, are\ncommon in time series. Structural breaks, which are time points at which the\nstatistical patterns of a time series change, pose considerable challenges to\ndata analysis. Without identification of such break points, the same dynamic\nrule would be applied to the whole period of observation, whereas false\nidentification of structural breaks may lead to overfitting. In this paper, we\ncast the problem of decomposing a time series into its trend and seasonal\ncomponents as an optimization problem. This problem is ill-posed due to the\narbitrariness in the number of parameters.

Our approach simultaneously identifies\nseasonality and trend without the need of iterations, and allows the reliable\ndetection of structural breaks. The method is applied to recorded data on fish\npopulations and sea surface temperature, where it detects structural breaks\nthat would have been neglected otherwise.

With the upcoming LHC measurements at\nnotably higher collision energies, there is a question of what differences,\nwith respect to the current (2.76 TeV) measurements, can be expected. In this\npaper we concentrate on heavy flavor suppression at the upcoming 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions energy at the LHC. Naively, one would expect a notably ($\\sim 30\\%$)\nlarger suppression at 5.1 TeV collision energy, due to estimated (significant)\nenergy loss increase when transitioning from 2.76 to 5.1 TeV. Surprisingly,\nmore detailed calculations predict nearly the same suppression results at these\ntwo energies. We show that this unexpected result is due to an interplay of the\nfollowing two effects, which essentially cancel each other: i) flattening of\nthe initial distributions with increasing collision energies, and ii)\nsignificantly slower than naively expected increase in the energy loss.\nTherefore, the obtained nearly the same suppression provides a clear\n(qualitative and quantitative) test of our energy loss formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2015 19:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

The short-lived population is known to be a transient group\nsustained in steady state by the Yarkovsky semimajor axis drift.

They reside near two isolated islands of the phase space\ndenoted $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$, with an uneven population ratio\n$\\mathrm{B}/\\mathrm{A} \\simeq 10$.

Using an $N$-body model with\nseven planets and the Yarkovsky effect included, we demonstrate that the\ndynamical depletion of island $\\mathrm{A}$ is faster, in comparison with island\n$\\mathrm{B}$.

We also model the collisional evolution of the\nresonant population over past $4\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$. Our conclusion is that the\nlong-lived group was created by resonant capture from a narrow part of\nhypothetical outer main-belt family during planetary migration.

Our analysis shows that, under the assumption that the input data\nmatrix has incoherent rows but possibly coherent columns, all algorithms\nprovably converge to the best low-rank approximation of the original data as\nnumber of selected columns increases. Furthermore, two of the proposed\nalgorithms enjoy a relative error bound, which is preferred for column subset\nselection and matrix approximation purposes. We also demonstrate through both\ntheoretical and empirical analysis the power of feedback driven sampling\ncompared to uniform random sampling on input matrices with highly correlated\ncolumns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 01:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 21:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 00:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}

These measurements must then be communicated to a common location to be\ncompared, which is unavoidably noisy. While much is known about the limits of\nmeasurement precision by cells, the limits placed by the communication are not\nunderstood. Motivated by recent experiments, we derive the fundamental limits\nto the precision of gradient sensing in a multicellular system, accounting for\ncommunication and temporal integration. The gradient is estimated by comparing\na \"local\" and a \"global\" molecular reporter of the external concentration,\nwhere the global reporter is exchanged between neighboring cells. Using the\nfluctuation-dissipation framework, we find, in contrast to the case when\ncommunication is ignored, that precision saturates with the number of cells\nindependently of the measurement time duration, since communication establishes\na maximum lengthscale over which sensory information can be reliably conveyed.\nSurprisingly, we also find that precision is improved if the local reporter is\nexchanged between cells as well, albeit more slowly than the global reporter.\nThe reason is that while exchange of the local reporter weakens the comparison,\nit decreases the measurement noise. We term such a model \"regional\nexcitation--global inhibition\" (REGI). Our results demonstrate that fundamental\nsensing limits are necessarily sharpened when the need to communicate\ninformation is taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 02:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Consider a random\nCSP$(P)$ instance $I$ over $n$ variables with $m$ constraints. When $m \\gg n$\nthe instance $I$ will be unsatisfiable with high probability, and we want to\nfind a refutation - i.e., a certificate of unsatisfiability. When $P$ is the\n$3$-ary OR predicate, this is the well studied problem of refuting random\n$3$-SAT formulas, and an efficient algorithm is known only when $m \\gg\nn^{3/2}$. Understanding the density required for refutation of other predicates\nis important in cryptography, proof complexity, and learning theory.\nPreviously, it was known that for a $k$-ary predicate, having $m \\gg n^{\\lceil\nk/2 \\rceil}$ constraints suffices for refutation. We give a criterion for\npredicates that often yields efficient refutation algorithms at much lower\ndensities. Specifically, if $P$ fails to support a $t$-wise uniform\ndistribution, then there is an efficient algorithm that refutes random CSP$(P)$\ninstances $I$ whp when $m \\gg n^{t/2}$. Indeed, our algorithm will \"somewhat\nstrongly\" refute $I$, certifying $\\mathrm{Opt}(I) \\leq 1-\\Omega_k(1)$, if $t =\nk$ then we get the strongest possible refutation, certifying $\\mathrm{Opt}(I)\n\\leq \\mathrm{E}[P] + o(1)$. This last result is new even in the context of\nrandom $k$-SAT. Regarding the optimality of our $m \\gg n^{t/2}$ requirement,\nprior work on SDP hierarchies has given some evidence that efficient refutation\nof random CSP$(P)$ may be impossible when $m \\ll n^{t/2}$. Thus there is an\nindication our algorithm's dependence on $m$ is optimal for every $P$, at least\nin the context of SDP hierarchies. Along these lines, we show that our\nrefutation algorithm can be carried out by the $O(1)$-round SOS SDP hierarchy.\nFinally, as an application of our result, we falsify assumptions used to show\nhardness-of-learning results in recent work of Daniely, Linial, and\nShalev-Shwartz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 11:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 21:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 06:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

The elastic routing is shown to achieve a\nmuch better throughput scaling law than that of the conventional\nnearest-neighbor multihop for all operating regimes. The gain comes from the\nfact that more source--destination pairs can be simultaneously activated as the\nbeam width becomes narrower, which eventually leads to a linear throughput\nscaling law. In addition, our framework is applied to a hybrid network\nconsisting of both wireless ad hoc nodes and infrastructure nodes.

We model clouds with a total mass of 1.3x10^5\nM_{sun} and explore the effects of varying the mean cloud density and the\nvirial parameter, alpha = E_{kin}/|E_{pot}|. We vary the latter from alpha =\n0.5 to alpha = 8.0, and so many of the clouds that we simulate are\ngravitationally unbound. We expose our model clouds to an interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF) and cosmic ray flux (CRF) that are both a factor of 1000\nhigher than the values found in the solar neighbourhood. As a reference, we\nalso run simulations with local solar neighbourhood values of the ISRF and the\nCRF in order to better constrain the effects of the extreme conditions in the\nGC on the SFE.

Increasing the virial parameter from\nalpha = 0.5 to alpha = 8.0 decreases the SFE by a factor ~4-10, while\nincreasing the ISRF/CRF by a factor of 1000 decreases the SFE again by a factor\n~2-6.

In this paper, we\nintroduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they\ncan both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hinge-loss\nMarkov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model\nthat generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three\napproaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and\nfuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference\nobjective. We then define HL-MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The\nsecond new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic\nprogramming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on\nfirst-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable\nvariable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than\ngeneral-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to\ntake advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the\nparameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous\ndiscrete models, but much more scalable.

We consider this work in two stages: In\nthe first stage, we obtain the perturbation mass matrix with real components\nwhich breaks softly the $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry and this leads to a nonzero value\nfor $\\theta_{13}$. In the second stage, we extend the perturbation mass matrix\nto a complex symmetric matrix which leads to CP violation. Therefore obtain a\nrealistic neutrino mixing matrix with $\\theta_{23}=45^\\circ$. We obtain the\nsolar mass splitting, the ordering of the neutrino masses is inverted. Using\nonly two sets of the experimental data, we can fix all of the parameters of\nmass matrix and predict the masses of neutrinos and phases. These predictions\ninclude the following: $m_{1}\\approx(4.82-4.93)10^{-2}eV $,\n$|m_2|\\approx(4.90-5.01)10^{-2} eV$, $m_3\\approx0$ and,\n$\\phi\\approx(0.687^\\circ-10.31^\\circ)$ as the origin of the Majorana phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 04:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2022 11:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-12"}
