The well-known Fictitious Play (FP) algorithm has been\nshown to achieve Nash equilibrium learning in certain classes of multi-agent\ngames. However, FP can be computationally difficult to implement when the\nnumber of players is large. Sampled FP is a variant of FP that mitigates the\ncomputational difficulties arising in FP by using a Monte-Carlo (i.e.,\nsampling-based) approach. The Sampled FP algorithm has been studied both as a\ntool for distributed learning and as an optimization heuristic for large-scale\nproblems. Despite its computational advantages, a shortcoming of Sampled FP is\nthat the number of samples that must be drawn in each round of the algorithm\ngrows without bound (on the order of $\\sqrt{t}$, where $t$ is the round of the\nrepeated play). In this paper we propose Computationally Efficient Sampled FP\n(CESFP)---a variant of Sampled FP in which only one sample need be drawn each\nround of the algorithm (a substantial reduction from $O(\\sqrt{t})$ samples per\nround, as required in Sampled FP). CESFP operates using a\nstochastic-approximation type rule to estimate the expected utility from round\nto round.

While graphlets have witnessed a\ntremendous success and impact in a variety of domains, there has yet to be a\nfast and efficient approach for computing the frequencies of these subgraph\npatterns. However, existing methods are not scalable to large networks with\nmillions of nodes and edges, which impedes the application of graphlets to new\nproblems that require large-scale network analysis. To address these problems,\nwe propose a fast, efficient, and parallel algorithm for counting graphlets of\nsize k={3,4}-nodes that take only a fraction of the time to compute when\ncompared with the current methods used. The proposed graphlet counting\nalgorithms leverages a number of proven combinatorial arguments for different\ngraphlets. For each edge, we count a few graphlets, and with these counts along\nwith the combinatorial arguments, we obtain the exact counts of others in\nconstant time. On a large collection of 300+ networks from a variety of\ndomains, our graphlet counting strategies are on average 460x faster than\ncurrent methods.

The direct sum structure of the vacuum is revealed\nby a suitable splitting of the scalar fields in the model in a manner that\ngeneralizes our approach in \\cite{Seckinson}. Fluctuations around this vacuum\nhave the structure of gauge fields over $S_F^{2\\, Int}\\times S_F^{2\\, Int}$,\nand this enables us to conjecture the spontaneous broken model as an effective\n$U(n)$ $(n < {\\cal N})$ gauge theory on the product manifold $M^4 \\times\nS_F^{2\\, Int} \\times S_F^{2\\, Int}$.

The dynamics of such\nexcitations must be studied as an evolution in superspace, the space of all\nfuzzball solution $|F_i\\rangle$. The states in this superspace are arranged in\na hierarchy of `complexity'. We argue that evolution towards higher complexity\nmaps, through a duality analogous to AdS/CFT, to infall inside the horizon of\nthe traditional hole. We explain how the large degeneracy of fuzzball states\nleads to a breakdown of the principle of equivalence at the threshold of\nhorizon formation. We recall that the firewall argument did not invoke the\nlimit $E\\gg T$ when considering a complementary picture; on the contrary it\nfocused on the dynamics of the $E\\sim T$ modes which contribute to Hawking\nradiation.

Using two complimentary\nvariational approaches, valid for weak interactions, we find rich physics\ndriven by the long range forces. Generically, long range interactions tend to\ndestroy the Meissner phase in favor of modulated density wave phases. Nearest\nneighbor interactions produce a novel interleg charge density wave phase, where\nthe total density remains uniform, but the density on each leg of the ladder is\nmodulating in space, out-of-phase with one another. At weak magnetic fields,\nnext nearest neighbor interactions lead to a fully modulated biased ladder\nphase, where all the particles are on one leg of the ladder, and the density is\nmodulating in space. This state simultaneously breaks $Z_{2}$ reflection\nsymmetry and $U(1)$ symmetry associated with translation in real space. For\nvalues of the flux near $\\phi = \\pi$, we find that a switching effect occurs\nfor arbitrarily weak interactions, where the density modulates in space, but\nthe chiral current changes sign on every plaquette. Arbitrarily weak attractive\ninteractions along the rungs destroy the Meissner phase completely, in favor of\na modulated density wave phase. Varying magnetic field produces a cascade of\nfirst order transitions between modulated density wave states with different\nwave-vectors, which manifests itself as discrete jumps in the chiral current.\nPolarizing the dipoles along the ladder direction yields a region of phase\nspace where a stable biased ladder phase occurs even at arbitrarily weak\nmagnetic fields.

It is argued that building a\ngeneral data compression algorithm solving all problems up to a complexity\nthreshold should be the main thrust of research. A measure for partial progress\nin AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some\ngeneral properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its\ninductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly\nsearching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining\nthe data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby\ncompressing the data increasingly at every iteration.\n  Abstract Based on that fundamental ability, a grounded reasoning system is\nproposed. It is argued how grounding and flexible feature bases made of\nhypotheses allow for resourceful thinking. While the simulation of\nrepresentation contents on the mental stage accounts for much of the power of\npropositional logic, compression leads to simple sets of hypotheses that allow\nthe detection and verification of universally quantified statements.\n  Abstract Together, it is highlighted how general compression and grounded\nreasoning could account for the birth and growth of first concepts about the\nworld and the commonsense reasoning about them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2015 09:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

Jointly optimizing these resources results in an\noverall scaling of $N^{1/4}$, which is a significant, but not unreasonable,\nimprovement over the $N^{1/2}$ scaling of Grover's algo.

The current rises and\nsets with the Sun and thus causes a readily observable diurnal variation of the\ngeomagnetic field, allowing us the deduce the conductivity and thus the EUV\nflux as far back as reliable magnetic data reach.

This means we usually need to compare distributions that are\nconsistent with a broad range of possible observations, with actual\nexperimental data. One controversial means of making this comparison is by\ninvoking the 'principle of mediocrity': that is, the principle that we are\ntypical of the reference class implicit in the conjunction of the theory and\nthe conditionalization scheme. In this paper, I quantitatively assess the\nprinciple of mediocrity in a range of cosmological settings, employing\n'xerographic distributions' to impose a variety of assumptions regarding\ntypicality. I find that for a fixed theory, the assumption that we are typical\ngives rise to higher likelihoods for our observations. If, however, one allows\nboth the underlying theory and the assumption of typicality to vary, then the\nassumption of typicality does not always provide the highest likelihoods.\nInterpreted from a Bayesian perspective, these results support the claim that\nwhen one has the freedom to consider different combinations of theories and\nxerographic distributions (or different 'frameworks'), one should favor the\nframework that has the highest posterior probability; and then from this\nframework one can infer, in particular, how typical we are. In this way, the\ninvocation of the principle of mediocrity is more questionable than has been\nrecently claimed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 23:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

When the support is a smooth enough manifold, an\nalmost complete picture is available. One of the early results in this\ndirection is the following: Let $f\\in C_c^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $d\\sigma$\nbe the surface measure on the sphere $S^{n-1}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then\n  $$|\\widehat{fd\\sigma}(\\xi)|\\leq\\ C\\ (1+|\\xi|)^{-\\frac{n-1}{2}}.$$\n  It follows that $\\widehat{fd\\sigma}\\in L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all\n$p>\\frac{2n}{n-1}$. This result can be extended to compactly supported measure\non $(n-1)$-dimensional manifolds with appropriate assumptions on the curvature.\nSimilar results are known for measures supported in lower dimensional manifolds\nin $\\mathbb{R}^n$ under appropriate curvature conditions. However, the picture\nfor fractal measures is far from complete. This thesis is a contribution to the\nstudy of asymptotic properties of the Fourier transform of measures supported\nin sets of fractal dimension $0<\\alpha<n$ for $p\\leq 2n/\\alpha$.\n  In 2004, Agranovsky and Narayanan proved that if $\\mu$ is a measure supported\nin a $C^1$-manifold of dimension $d<n$, then $\\widehat{fd\\mu}\\notin\nL^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $1\\leq p\\leq \\frac{2n}{d}$.

We also\nstudy $L^p$-asymptotics of the Fourier transform of fractal measures $\\mu_E$\nunder appropriate conditions on $E$ and give quantitative versions of the above\nstatement by obtaining lower and upper bounds for the following:\n  $$\\underset{L\\rightarrow\\infty}{\\limsup} \\frac{1}{L^k} \\int_{|\\xi|\\leq\nL}|\\widehat{fd\\mu_E}(\\xi)|^pd\\xi.$$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2015 15:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-21"}

The utility of this approach has been vigorously debated\nof late, particularly in light of theories that claim we live in a multiverse,\nwhere parameters may take differing values in regions lying outside our\nobservable horizon. Within this cosmological framework, we investigate the\nefficacy of top-down anthropic reasoning based on the weak anthropic principle.\nWe argue contrary to recent claims that it is not clear one can either dispense\nwith notions of typicality altogether or presume typicality, in comparing\nresulting probability distributions with observations. We show in a concrete,\ntop-down setting related to dark matter, that assumptions about typicality can\ndramatically affect predictions, thereby providing a guide to how errors in\nreasoning regarding typicality translate to errors in the assessment of\npredictive power. We conjecture that this dependence on typicality is an\nintegral feature of anthropic reasoning in broader cosmological contexts, and\nargue in favour of the explicit inclusion of measures of typicality in schemes\ninvoking anthropic reasoning, with a view to extracting predictions from\nmultiverse scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2015 22:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

We consider the\nadiabatic condition along with the Gong-Wang mass, and evaluate the $g_{rr}$\nelement which points to a null hypersurface. In addition, we generalize the\nthermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus the\ncorresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the\n$g_{tt}$ element. Moreover, we investigate the mathematical and physical\nproperties of the discovered metric in the Einstein relativity framework which\nshows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. The\nobtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of a\npolytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de Sitter background. We also show\nthat if one considers the Misner-Sharp mass in the calculations, the\nSchwarzschild metric will be got. The relationship between the two mass\ndefinitions in each metric is studied. The results of considering the\ngeometrical surface gravity are also addressed. Our investigation shows that\nthe geometrical surface gravity's definition is not always compatible with the\nvalidity of the first law of thermodynamics on the horizons of spherically\nsymmetric static metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2015 04:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 09:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 07:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}
